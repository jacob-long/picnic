          "title": "Rationality or Relationality in Life and Death: Regulating Organ Donation in Singapore and Taiwan",
          "authors": "Wan-Zi Lu",
          "abstract": "Lawmakers often attempt to settle conflicting values. However, we know little about how regulatory reasoning influences organizational practices and shapes the conditions under which people respond. This article examines unexpected outcomes of deceased organ donation in Singapore and Taiwan, whose governments have had to address cultural and emotional resistance to the practice. Adopting an opt-out law, Singapore created a larger pool of legal organ donors yet generated worse donation outcomes than Taiwan, whose opt-in regulation has resulted in a smaller pool of potential organ donors. Drawing from interviews and archival research to solve this puzzle, I argue that moral infrastructure—the regulation-endorsed organizational arrangements to tackle cultural and emotional tensions—determines whether and when people change their minds regarding shared cultural norms. Singapore’s regulation prioritizes instrumental rationality and generates efficiency-driven organizational practices. These practices lead to affective circumvention , sidestepping emotions to expedite organ procurement and, in turn, prompting patients’ families to withdraw from hospital care. By contrast, in Taiwan, relational reasoning creates arrangements that promote affective coordination , a process that empowers intermediaries to work with grieving families and morally reframe donation. An institutionalized emphasis on relationality fosters cooperation and provides opportunities to re moralize a contested practice.",

          "title": "Unpacking the nexus of Islamic religiosity and attitudes towards individual liberties and gender equality: a person-centered analysis among Dutch Muslims",
          "authors": "Marija Dangubić, Fenella Fleischmann",
          "abstract": "Public discourses frequently portray religiosity as a problem for the emancipation of women and sexual minorities, and in Europe, Muslims are particularly singled out as threatening liberal values. Empirical studies indeed often document negative associations between Muslims’ religiosity and attitudes such as support for gender equality and acceptance of homosexuality. However, research so far mainly applied variable-centered analyses which neglect that there might be different ways in which Muslim minority members combine their religiosity and attitudes towards individual (sexual) liberties and gender equality. To provide a more differentiated understanding of these complex associations, we conduct a person-centered analysis and identify different subgroups in the Turkish- and Moroccan-origin oversample of the Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study (NELLS 2011, N = 1829). Two subgroups confirm findings from variable-centered approaches: we find a profile that combines high levels of religiosity with low acceptance of sexual liberalism, and one with the opposite pattern of low religiosity but high levels of acceptance of sexual liberalism and gender equality. A sizable additional subgroup combines high levels of religiosity with acceptance of homosexuality, and to a lesser extent divorce and chosen childlessness. Our findings suggest that the acceptance of homosexuality is particularly relevant in differentiating between subgroups of Muslims, whereas attitudes towards gender equality do not differ remarkably between profiles. In conclusion, liberal attitudes are complexly related to religiosity, warning against over-simplified interpretations of religion as generally threatening progressive values or the emancipation of minoritized groups on the basis of gender or sexuality.",

          "title": "Secularism, sorting, and Americans’ political knowledge",
          "authors": "Samuel L Perry",
          "abstract": "Political knowledge, including knowledge of basic civics and current political conditions, is associated with a host of pro-democratic outcomes including institutional trust and civic and political participation. Religion is also historically associated with these outcomes, yet a link between religion and indicators of political knowledge remains underexamined. Integrating research on religion/secularism and political engagement with work on partisan sorting, I theorize self-consciously secular Americans, particularly if they are sorted politically, will exhibit the strongest grasp on basic civics and current political conditions. Analyses of data from a recent, nationally representative survey affirm my expectations. Self-identified atheists/agnostics consistently score significantly higher than religious or non-affiliated Americans on questions about basic civics and current political conditions. Interactions reveal that education helps most other religious groups catch up to atheists/agnostics on civics knowledge, but not knowledge about current politics. And on knowledge of both basic civics and current politics, atheists/agnostics’ advantage is strongest among liberals and Democrats and disappears among conservatives and Republicans. A similar pattern appears for evangelical Protestants in the opposite direction with their scores on both civics and current politics increasing significantly as they identify more with ideological conservatism, but this does not apply to partisan identity. Findings extend literatures on political knowledge, religious/secular political engagement, and partisan sorting by showing that (1) self-identified secular Americans, particularly if they are sorted, tend to be the most knowledgeable about basic civics and current political conditions, and (2) this pattern is to a weaker extent mirrored by evangelicals, another politicized religious group.",

          "authors": "Felix J. Clouth, Maarten J. Bijlsma, Steffen Pauws, Jeroen K. Vermunt",
          "abstract": "The parametric g-formula can be used to estimate causal effects of time-varying exposures on observable outcomes. It resolves intermediate confounding in such settings by specifying several parametric models, one each for every time-varying variable, and by performing micro-simulations. However, its restriction to applications with observable outcomes limits its usability for social sciences where variables of interest are often unobservable constructs. In such cases, measurement models are needed. We propose a new approach utilizing bias-adjusted three-step latent Markov models (LMMs) within the parametric g-formula. LMMs estimate the probability of membership in an unobservable state conditional on observed indicator variables. By replacing the parametric models in the g-formula with LMMs, micro-simulations are performed as usual to estimate a causal effect of the time-varying exposure. We illustrate this new approach by estimating the average treatment effect of unemployment on several unobservable mental health states utilizing longitudinal data from the Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences panel.",

          "authors": "Cody Spence, James D. Bachmeier, Claire E. Altman, Jennifer Van Hook, Kendal Lowrey",
          "abstract": "Research on the stratifying effects of migration status has increased sharply in the last two decades, although efforts have been hampered by the near absence of representative data that include detailed migration status measures. Researchers have developed various statistical and logical imputation methods that have produced widely varying estimates. In this article, we introduce a new indicator of migration status constructed from two federal surveys matched to the Social Security Administration's Numident file, a database that includes all citizens and legal residents of the United States. In models predicting poverty, our measure produces estimates comparable to those based on respondents’ own self-reports, in one federal survey, of their migration status. Both the administrative and survey-based measures produce poverty gradients that diverge from those produced by logic-based measures. Our findings contribute to mounting evidence of bias in the use of certain kinds of logic-based algorithms to impute migration status and demonstrate the promise of administrative record linkages in migration status research.",

          "title": "Educational Attainment and Cardiovascular Disease Symptoms among Americans Entering Mid-Adulthood",
          "authors": "Anna Zajacova, Samuel Fishman, Elizabeth M. Lawrence",
          "abstract": "Although the education-health gradient is well documented, relatively little is known about its application to cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Furthermore, critical nuances across educational levels and demographic subgroups remain underexplored. The authors examine the association between education and CVD among U.S. adults entering mid-adulthood, leveraging a novel symptom-based CVD index capturing clinical indicators such as angina or dyspnea and a detailed 13-category measure of educational attainment. Waves I and V of the nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health sample ( n = 11,806) are analyzed for the full cohort and by sex/gender and race/ethnicity; models also account for adolescent confounders and adulthood social and economic mediators. The findings reveal profound disparities: adults with professional or doctoral degrees report 0.6 CVD symptoms on average, versus 1.8 among those without high school credentials, a threefold difference. However, there are also important deviations from the expected gradient. Adults with sub-baccalaureate education report no fewer symptoms than high school graduates, whereas General Educational Development diploma recipients resemble dropouts more than diploma holders. Racial/ethnic patterns differ markedly: most strikingly, Black adults derive no significant CVD returns from college completion compared with high school graduation. These patterns challenge assumptions about education’s universal benefits and underscore the importance of structural and intersectional approaches to addressing health disparities and designing equitable health policies.",

          "authors": "Jisu Park, Sarah Damaske, Jiwon Choi, Susan McHale, Joshua Rosenberger, Junjun Yin",
          "abstract": "The authors examine the gendered perceptions of workplace challenges in the male-dominated fields of computer science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM). Using novel qualitative and quantitative data from an online survey of 3,556 cisgender CSEM professionals, the authors explore how women and men differently perceive workplace challenges in domains that are central to gendered organizational theory. In stark contrast to prior research that suggests science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals embrace purportedly meritocratic and “gender-neutral” cultural schemas, the present findings reveal that women in CSEM are significantly more likely than men to perceive workplace challenges across multiple areas and the biggest gender disparities are reported in the recognition of structural barriers. The authors further investigate how job tenure moderates these gendered perceptions. Longer tenure is linked to lower perceptions of workplace challenges among men, whereas women’s perceptions of structural barriers remain consistent over time, and reports of interpersonal difficulties become more frequent as tenure increases. These findings suggest that tenure, rather than buffering women from inequality, may amplify gendered burdens, reinforcing disparities in how organizational experiences are seen and navigated. By highlighting both the persistence of gendered perceptions and the role of job tenure, this study advances understanding of how inequality is perceived and reproduced within contemporary STEM workplaces.",
