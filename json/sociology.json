          "title": "Toward a Unified Conceptualization of Social Capital",
          "authors": "Paulina Erices-Ocampo, Miranda J. Lubbers, jimi adams",
          "abstract": "Social capital is among the most broadly used concepts in social science. Despite its shared understanding as beneficial resources available from the connections between people, authors vary widely in their conceptualizations of social capital. To extract clarity from these disparate perspectives, we offer a systematic framework for conceptualizing social capital, which identifies three primary theoretical dimensions of scholars’ conceptualizations of social capital: ( a ) where beneficial resources reside, ranging from within individuals to the relationships between individuals; ( b ) beneficial network structure, differentiating closure from brokerage arrangements; and ( c ) the level to which rewards accrue, distinguishing individual from collective benefits. We illustrate how combining these dimensions produces a unifying perspective that fosters reintegrating social capital's disconnected conceptualizations. Finally, we draw on this framework to both reconcile seeming contradictions and gaps in social capital scholarship, and provide a principled means for prioritizing questions for future developments of social capital.",

          "title": "Black and White Wealth Differentials in the United States: Explaining and Recreating Persistent Inequality",
          "authors": "Fenaba R. Addo, Daniel Auguste",
          "abstract": "This review explores research on the sources of Black and White wealth and debt differentials and how these differentials recreate inequalities in both wealth and nonwealth outcomes. We discuss how the relationship between wealth and life outcomes is bidirectional, yet studies of racial wealth inequality overwhelmingly focus on wealth as an outcome. We suggest that studies that examine the relationship from wealth to life outcomes are necessary to enable full understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the production and reproduction of racial wealth inequality and to identify policies in the United States to reduce racial inequality. We highlight research on entrepreneurship, race, and wealth to illustrate these dynamics. We conclude with a call for scholars to focus on community-level wealth, given scholarly and policy interests in closing the racial wealth gap.",

          "title": "Colonial legacy and contemporary civil violence: a global study from 1960 to 2018",
          "authors": "Christopher Kollmeyer",
          "abstract": "This study assesses whether the legacy of colonialism continues to influence patterns of civil violence in the contemporary era. A large and established quantitative literature attributes civil violence to low levels of economic development and limited political rights, but few quantitative studies consider whether colonial legacy plays an enduring role in such conflicts. This is surprising given the substantial evidence showing that colonialism impeded long-run development in many parts of the world. Drawing on ideas from macro-comparative sociology, institutional economics, and political science, the study develops several theoretical expectations regarding colonialism’s effect on contemporary civil violence. These ideas are tested with a global sample of 152 countries observed annually from 1960 to 2018. Results from logistic regression models support the contention that (1) post-colonial societies are more prone to civil violence than non-colonized societies, that (2) ex-British colonies are especially prone to ethnic-based civil violence while ex-Spanish colonies are especially prone to socio-economic-based civil violence, and that (3) these historical effects change and evolve but never fully abate. This latter finding implies that elevated levels of civil violence are a path-dependent legacy of colonialism. The study ends by running robustness checks and discussing the theoretical implications of the study’s findings, in particular reflecting on our understanding of the long-run consequences of colonialism.",

          "title": "Gentrification in small cities: growth coalitions, civic engagement, and political participation",
          "authors": "Richard E Ocejo",
          "abstract": "Most gentrification research uses large cities as cases to make sense of how the process unfolds, while studies of gentrification in nonmetropolises tend to focus on the process’s similarities across differently-sized municipalities. Unexplained is how the distinct characteristics of differently-sized places inform how the process unfolds. Based on interviews with eighty-five stakeholders and four years of ethnographic fieldwork in a small city experiencing gentrification, this article advances a new understanding of the process by analyzing and theorizing the role of scale in shaping the social and political dynamics behind it. It argues that gentrification in small cities is different from what the process looks like in other places for two reasons. First, they offer conditions that facilitate small-scale actors who wish to form gentrification stakeholder-led growth coalitions. Second, they offer opportunities for these actors to get civically and politically involved in municipal government in direct, influential ways. While in decision-making roles, they effectively help to advance gentrification in their neighborhoods to better suit their economic interests and cultural preferences. By focusing on how place characteristics structure urban processes, specifically conditions in gentrifying small cities, and this article reveals the distinct features of gentrification in nonmetropolises.",

          "title": "Deep Learning With DAGs",
          "authors": "Sourabh Balgi, Adel Daoud, Jose M. Peña, Geoffrey T. Wodtke, Jesse Zhou",
          "abstract": "Social science theories often postulate systems of causal relationships among variables, which are commonly represented using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). As non-parametric causal models, DAGs require no assumptions about the functional form of the hypothesized relationships. Nevertheless, to simplify empirical evaluation, researchers typically invoke such assumptions anyway, even though they are often arbitrary and do not reflect any theoretical content or prior knowledge. Moreover, functional form assumptions can engender bias, whenever they fail to accurately capture the true complexity of the system. In this article, we introduce causal-graphical normalizing flows (cGNFs), a novel approach to causal inference that leverages deep neural networks to empirically evaluate theories represented as DAGs. Unlike conventional methods, cGNFs model the full joint distribution of the data using a DAG specified by the analyst, without relying on stringent assumptions about functional form. This enables flexible, non-parametric estimation of any causal estimand identified from the DAG, including total effects, direct and indirect effects, and path-specific effects. We illustrate the method with a reanalysis of Blau and Duncan’s ( 1967 ) model of status attainment and Zhou’s ( 2019 ) model of controlled mobility. The article concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for future development.",

          "authors": "Wonjeong Jeong",
          "abstract": "Examining couples as joint decision makers offers valuable insights into gender disparities, yet the literature has largely overlooked the transition to a key alternative work arrangement: self-employment. Using couple-matched data from the 2015–2024 Current Population Survey, the author investigates how the collective decisions of couples are linked to the shift toward self-employment and how these patterns are moderated by parenthood and occupational characteristics. The author finds that wives are more likely to move from wage employment to self-employment if their husbands work long hours. Although this tendency is not moderated by parenthood, the association between husbands’ long hours on encouraging wives’ self-employment is stronger when wives are in occupations with strong overwork norms. This work underscores the option of self-employment for women when the demand for flexibility is heightened because of partners’ long work hours while the potential supply for flexibility is limited because of occupational norms.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this study is to understand mental well-being differences among cisgender, transgender, and nonbinary people in Colombia. On the one hand, the authors quantify the importance of economic and social resources in explaining such differences. On the other hand, they document the role played by experiences of discrimination. The authors use two different datasets to achieve these goals. First, they use nonprobabilistic data from the Williams Institute, which surveyed a large number of transgender and nonbinary people. The authors compare these individuals’ well-being with that of cisgender nonheterosexual people. Second, the authors use probabilistic data from the Colombian Drug Use Survey to replicate the main results and to compare with cisgender heterosexual individuals. The authors find that social and economic resources have limited power explaining well-being differences among cisgender, transgender, and nonbinary people in both samples. Instead, experiences of discrimination and violence mediate a large part of the association between gender identity and well-being among the LGBTQ sample.",
