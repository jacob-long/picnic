          "title": "Managing motherhood: how “queen bee” managers in the US service sector reduce motherhood advantages in work scheduling",
          "authors": "Joshua Choper",
          "abstract": "This study advances sociological theories of motherhood-based workplace inequalities by examining how frontline managers shape mothers’ access to stable work schedules in the US service sector. Prior research has shown that mothers in the US service sector experience intense conflict between the time demands of motherhood and employers’ expectations that employees will be available to work unstable work schedules, yet little work has investigated sources of variation in mothers’ exposure to schedule instability. Building on and synthesizing theories of homophily, expectation states theory, and “queen bee” theories of women in management, I propose a model in which managers’ own gender and parenthood status structure their responses to their employees’ scheduling needs. Female managers who are mothers are theorized to exhibit homophily and produce motherhood scheduling advantages, while female managers without children are expected to penalize mothers. Analyses of survey and experimental data collected from a large national sample of US retail and food service workers support this theoretical synthesis, showing that motherhood advantages in scheduling appear under male managers and female managers who are mothers, but erode under female managers without children. By positioning motherhood—not gender alone—as the status dimension that most directly collides with ideal worker norms, this work highlights an important determinant of when women in management act as agents of change and when they reinforce inequality. More broadly, this study frames managerial discretion as a key mechanism linking status expectations, manager-employee relations, and organizational outcomes, advancing theory on the micro-foundations of workplace inequality.",

          "title": "Institutional contestations and educational equity: incorporation of the marginalized in National Education Policies Worldwide, 1960–2019",
          "authors": "Jieun Song",
          "abstract": "The notion that everyone deserves education and that governments need to strive for this ideal has been legitimized and expanded worldwide over the past few decades, as a central part of the successful establishment of a liberal world order. However, the recent resurgence of global illiberalism poses a threat to liberal ideas of equity and diversity, potentially impeding progress toward a more inclusive education system. Against this backdrop, I investigate the extent to which countries around the world introduced policies to incorporate historically disadvantaged populations into education between 1960 and 2019 and what sociocultural factors are associated with the adoption of education policies for the marginalized. Using event count analyses and a novel longitudinal dataset on global education reforms, I show that countries are more likely to adopt education policies for the marginalized when liberalism is globally prevalent, while they are less likely to do so when illiberalism is globally prominent. I also find that countries’ linkages to international liberal or illiberal institutions, including through organized transnational networks, as well as domestic sociopolitical environments, relate to the adoption of education policies for the marginalized. These results help illuminate how countries exist in a world filled with opposing cultural models and through which mechanisms their approaches to educational equity are shaped by such global forces. While focused on education for the marginalized, these findings offer insights into understanding inequality in a changing world context of growing illiberalism.",

          "title": "Do university-educated families lose their edge as education expands? The withering performance and advantage of their children",
          "authors": "Manuel T Valdés, Fabrizio Bernardi, Ilaria Lievore",
          "abstract": "Extensive research has examined the effect of educational expansion in one cohort on educational inequality and occupational returns in that same cohort. This study makes a novel contribution by exploring whether the expansion of university education among parents affects their children’s academic achievement. We argue that this expansion reduces the selectivity of university attainment, making graduates progressively less selected on traits relevant to their children’s achievement. Additionally, expansion likely diminishes occupational returns on a university degree, increasing the proportion of overqualified university-graduated parents. Consequently, the average achievement of children from university-educated families should diminish with this expansion among parents. Using data from 30 countries across seven waves of the Program for International Student Assessment, we show that students from university-educated families experience a notable decline in achievement as the proportion of university-educated parents increases. Importantly, the growing over-qualification of university-educated parents and the diminishing objectified cultural capital of university-educated families mediate this negative effect. Furthermore, we also observe a negative association between educational expansion among parents and children’s achievement in non-university-educated families, but less pronounced, resulting in a negative (albeit modest) association between expansion among parents and inequality among children.",

          "title": "Crossing Which Boundary? New Evidence on Racial and Educational Assortative Mating among Recent Different-Sex and Same-Sex Marriages",
          "authors": "Haoming Song",
          "abstract": "This study revisits the question of “who marries whom” by examining detailed patterns of racial and educational assortative mating across newlywed different-sex and same-sex couples in the United States. Against the backdrop of growing racial diversity, driven largely by recent immigration from Latin America and Asia, and the expansion of higher education, including graduate degrees, the author asks what boundaries are being crossed and for whom. Using nationally representative couple-level data from the 2013 to 2023 American Community Survey, the author found that same-sex newlyweds, particularly male couples, were more likely to be interracial and educationally heterogamous than different-sex couples, with educational crossing more prevalent. Detailed pairing further reveals that White-Hispanic and, to a lesser extent, White-Asian unions primarily accounted for higher interraciality among same-sex male couples. Among same-sex couples, educational heterogamy often involved pairings among those with at least some college experience, such as bachelor’s and graduate degree pairs. These findings underscore how structural demographic shifts are reshaping new marital sorting and call for moving beyond binary measures of homogamy to capture how much, which, and for whom boundaries are crossed in the ongoing study of “who marries whom.”",

          "title": "Diffusing Strategies North-South and South-North: Circular Diffusion and the Case of Abortion Rights Movements in the United States and Latin America",
          "authors": "Cora Fernández Anderson, Anna Calasanti, Tamara Kay",
          "abstract": "Because research focuses on unidirectional diffusion, primarily from the Global North to the Global South, diffusion in more than one direction has not been examined. Here the authors ask: How does the diffusion of social movement symbols and strategies occur from North to South and from South to North? To answer this question, the authors examine a case of diffusion between abortion rights movements. Using data from in-depth interviews with activists in the United States, Argentina, and Mexico, the authors argue that symbols and strategies originating in the United States prior to Roe v. Wade spread to Argentina and Mexico during the last decades of intense struggle for abortion rights, while strategies and symbols from Argentina and Mexico created during this time diffused to the United States in the months leading up to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision. This study introduces and develops the novel concept of circular diffusion : the process by which innovations move from originator to adopter—where they are adopted whole cloth, transformed, or used as inspiration for new innovations depending on local contexts—and then back to the originator. During this process, originators and adopters exchange roles as they learn from each other over time. In the case of movements for abortion rights, the authors argue that both ongoing contestation and ongoing interactions are necessary to activate and sustain the process of circular diffusion.",
