          "title": "Finding a Home during the Affordable Housing Crisis: How Social Ties Shape Renters’ Housing-Search Outcomes",
          "authors": "Steven Schmidt",
          "abstract": "Housing searches play a central role in the reproduction of racial inequality in U.S. cities. Past research finds that movers’ social ties influence residential segregation, as renters receive information about homes located near friends and family. Fewer studies examine how renters’ social ties also provide instrumental assistance during moves, or how this aid unequally shapes moving outcomes. In the present study, I show how 69 low-income, Latina/o and non-Hispanic white renters rely on their friends, family, and acquaintances to navigate moves in Los Angeles, a highly unaffordable rental market. Both groups mobilize their ties for instrumental assistance, but the resources available through renters’ ties contribute to diverging search outcomes. Low-income Latina/o renters’ ties, who also struggled to make ends meet, provided what I call constrained support—referrals to open units, loans to cover moving costs, and informal rental opportunities. This assistance channeled movers to specific apartments and left them negotiating informal, doubled-up homes and new debt. In contrast, low-income white renters leveraged comparatively affluent ties to cosign leases, provide financial gifts, and strengthen applications across buildings—what I refer to as flexible assistance. This aid helped low-income white movers secure housing advantages, while avoiding short-term reciprocal obligations to friends and family. These findings advance research on residential mobility and social support, and they show how network resource inequalities contribute to racial stratification in rental markets.",

          "title": "Abortion and Women’s Future Socioeconomic Attainment",
          "authors": "Bethany G. Everett, Catherine J. Taylor",
          "abstract": "Abortion is a safe and common medical procedure. Roughly one in four women in the United States will have an abortion before the end of her reproductive years. Because of how common this experience is and how rapidly abortion policy is shifting, understanding the relationship between abortion and women’s socioeconomic futures is well worth exploring. Extant research has demonstrated that the transition to parenthood is a critical inflection point in women’s socioeconomic trajectories, often leading to poorer outcomes. In this article, we connect previous sociological work elucidating mechanisms of socioeconomic stratification and gender by considering the relationship between abortion use and access and future socioeconomic outcomes such as education, income, and financial stability—as measured by several measures, including evictions, debt, ability to pay bills, and a separate index of economic instability. We use national longitudinal survey data to assess socioeconomic outcomes associated with abortion using two statistical approaches. We find that women who lived in a location with fewer abortion restrictions in adolescence, and women who had an abortion, compared to a live birth, in adolescence, are more likely to have graduated from college, have higher incomes, and have greater financial stability at two time-points over an almost 25-year period. Our results provide evidence that policy environments allowing access to abortion, and teenagers having the option to use abortion to avoid early parenthood, are important axes along which women’s economic lives are shaped. Our research implies that the widespread abortion bans and restrictions in the United States are likely to lead to lower educational attainment and adult economic stability among women living under such restrictions, as compared to women in locations with better access to abortion.",

          "title": "How Social Determinants of Health Shape Parental Concern and Teacher Recognition of Student Speech-Language Needs",
          "authors": "Janet Vuolo, Mike Vuolo",
          "abstract": "Despite the importance of receiving speech-language therapy for educational outcomes, the role of language in all subject learning, and parental language complexity as a hypothesized mechanism for reproducing educational inequalities, there is a surprising lack of attention to speech-language issues within sociology. The authors link theories from sociology of education and medical sociology and use the prospective longitudinal nationally representative UK Millennium Cohort Study to examine the roles that social determinants of health, teacher bias, and parental concern play in teacher recognition of speech-language needs in early childhood, net of a measure of speech-language ability. Although social determinants affect ability, there is little evidence of bias in teacher recognition once controlling for said ability, with the exception of lower recognition of female speech-language needs. However, social determinants also drive whether parents are concerned about their children’s speech-language ability, which has a striking association with teacher recognition for both under- and overperforming children.",

          "authors": "Dashram Pai, Yan Zhen Zhu, Christina Pao",
          "abstract": "With the rising disclosure of LGBTQ+ identities, there have been increasing efforts to capture inclusive sexual identity data. Commonly used survey measures are closed ended and single choice (i.e., “select one”) and may be restrictive for sexuality- and gender-diverse respondents. However, more expansive measures may be unwieldy to survey takers and analysts. In this data visualization, the authors compare single-choice and mark-all-that-apply measures for sexual identity. Using survey data ( n = 2,511) fielded in the United States and United Kingdom in 2022, the authors analyze within-respondent alignment of a single-choice measure and an expansive mark-all-that-apply measure for sexual identity. Responses were considered “aligned” when respondents provided identical information across both measures. Overall, alignment was 89 percent in the full sample, with the highest rate of alignment occurring among straight respondents. With the mark-all-that-apply measure, 3 percent of the sample selected multiple identities, and about 2 percent selected identities not found in the commonly used single-choice measure.",
