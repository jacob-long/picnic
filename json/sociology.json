          "authors": "Alexander Helbing, Ivar Krumpal",
          "abstract": "Social desirability bias is a problem in surveys collecting data on norm violations and compliance. If confronted with sensitive questions, respondents systematically underreport norm violations and overreport norm compliance. This leads to biased survey estimates and poor data quality. To improve the measurement of norm violations and compliance, the item count technique (ICT) has been developed. The ICT anonymizes the question-and-answer process. In their experimental survey ( n = 2,510), the authors use the ICT to study norm violations and compliance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe. More specifically, they estimate the prevalence of vaccination certificate falsification and self-isolation with COVID-19 symptoms. Estimates obtained using standard direct questioning (DQ; n = 1,006) are compared with ICT estimates ( n = 1,504). As a result, the authors find no significant difference between estimates of vaccination certificate falsification (4.8 percent with DQ vs. 4.5 percent with the ICT). At the same time, they find a significant difference between estimates of self-isolation with COVID-19 symptoms (87.7 percent with DQ vs. 76.0 percent with the ICT). Conventional survey measures based on DQ thus likely overestimate the extent of norm compliance in a pandemic such as COVID-19.",

          "authors": "Peter Valet, Patricia Böger, Jonas Lübker",
          "abstract": "This data visualization illustrates trends in income inequality within and across different contexts in Germany from 2010 to 2022. The authors examine four key contexts in which income inequalities predominantly arise: (1) the national level, (2) the industry level, (3) the occupational level, and (4) the firm level. Using large-scale official data on employee incomes in Germany, the authors compute contextual income inequalities and assess the impact of part-time work by calculating inequalities on the basis of both gross monthly and gross hourly incomes. The findings reveal considerable variation in income inequality across these contexts, with inequality consistently highest at the national level and progressively lower at the industry, occupation, and firm levels. Despite these differences, overall inequality trends remained relatively stable across contexts and income measures. These results have implications for the broader sociological framework on inequality, as they suggest that in Germany, within-firm inequality is not the primary driver of macro-level income inequality. Consequently, efforts to reduce overall income inequality should extend beyond the firm level and also address income disparities at the occupational and industry levels.",

          "authors": "Ken Cai Kowalski",
          "abstract": "This study examines two questions: whether members of the public perceive discrepancies between economic data and their own assessments of economic conditions and how they explain discrepancies they recognize. Drawing on 78 interviews and 12 focus groups conducted with residents of three U.S. cities, the author finds an overwhelmingly common pattern of interpretation following a logic of double disconnect. People saw economic data as disconnected from reality and irrelevant to their lives. They also understood the ubiquity of these data in media discourse as evidence of elites’ and experts’ own disconnect from the concerns of ordinary citizens. This reasoning was not confined to conservatives or populists prone to institutional distrust but rather commonplace across respondents with varied political beliefs and partisan affiliations. These findings show that the ambiguous meaning of economic data, a factor unrelated to ideology or polarization, is a salient factor consolidating broad-based distrust in media discourse about the economy.",

          "abstract": "Immigrants constitute nearly one third of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degree holders in the United States, yet their contributions to diversifying the U.S. STEM workforce are often overlooked. The author examines disparities in the likelihood of holding a STEM degree among college graduates, considering the intersections of race/ethnicity, gender, and immigration status. The analyses reveal that immigrant men and women from all non-White racial/ethnic groups are equally or more likely than their U.S.-born White counterparts to hold a STEM degree. However, compared with the U.S.-born, race/ethnicity and gender disparities are more pronounced among immigrants, particularly the 1.25th generation: those who earned a college degree in the United States after completing K–12 education in their countries of birth. The findings of this study underscore the limitations of social interventions that have narrowly focused on U.S.-born individuals in efforts to foster a more diverse and inclusive STEM workforce.",

          "abstract": "The authors investigate the moderating role of three dimensions of economic hardship on the relationship between maternal nonstandard work schedules (working evening, nights, or weekends) and children’s behavioral and cognitive outcomes at age five in the United Kingdom. The literature on the relationship between nonstandard work and child development in early childhood has not taken into consideration the potentially important role of families’ economic circumstances. Economic circumstances may reduce or amplify the potential consequences of maternal nonstandard work schedules for young children. Using the Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative birth cohort from the United Kingdom, and residualized change models, the authors test associations between children’s cognitive and behavioral outcomes at age five from contemporaneous maternal nonstandard work schedules. Mothers who worked nonstandard schedules had more economic hardship relative to mothers working standard schedules. Nonstandard work schedules were related to higher internalizing behavior scores at age five. The authors examined if observed associations were moderated by income poverty, financial stress, and material hardship, separately, and found that the interaction of nonstandard work with higher levels of financial stress at age five was related to higher internalizing behavior scores. The results highlight a potentially challenging work-family interface in the context of working nonstandard schedules and experiencing economic hardship.",

          "authors": "Noga Keidar, Daniel Silver",
          "abstract": "In the global arena of municipal policymaking, cities do not merely address local concerns but actively engage with other cities in a global relational space, referencing and being referenced by others. Within these networks, certain “model cities” emerge, linking urban transformation strategies to specific city experiences. Although much research focuses on the production of model cities—how they gain prominence and status—less attention has been given to the peer cities that reference them. The authors examine how model cities rise by analyzing “referential styles”: the ways cities express interest in one another. Drawing on urban sociology, cultural theory, and network analysis, the authors propose two propositions to explain the forces that influence referencing styles: the cultural domination proposition, which suggests that the characteristics of referenced cities shape how they are discussed, and the networks from culture proposition, which suggests that referencing cities’ attributes drive their interpretations. Using public art policy documents (1959–2020) from 26 major anglophone cities and computational techniques, the authors investigate the referential styles cities use to discuss one another. The authors find support for both propositions: although dominant cities determine where to look, it is often the attributes of referencing cities that determine how to look that shape the referencing style. These results suggest orienting policy-mobility research more toward the peer-network ecologies that actively construct urban meaning.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated associations between social network characteristics and health care utilization. However, understanding the role of network- and individual-level factors together remains limited. We use the Person to Person Health Interview Study (2018–2020) to show network-level and individual-level predictors of two health care utilization measures: having a regular doctor (preventive care) and seeking medical services after an acute health care problem (reactive care). We explore preventive care among the full sample (N = 2,524) and reactive care among the subsample that reported a physical or mental health problem in the past year (n = 885). We measure medical trust as an individual-level characteristic (personal trust in physicians) and a network-level characteristic (average trust in physicians among social ties). Results show that higher medical trust in doctors within one’s network positively predicts both having a regular doctor and utilizing medical services after a health care problem, even after adjusting for known predictors of utilization. Our findings provide support that a network’s pro-medical culture matters beyond individual medical trust for health care utilization.",
