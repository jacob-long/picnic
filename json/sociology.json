          "title": "(Not) Getting What You Deserve: How Misrecognized Evaluators Reproduce Misrecognition in Peer Evaluations",
          "authors": "Mabel Abraham, Tristan L. Botelho, James T. Carter",
          "abstract": "In most evaluation systems—such as those governing the allocation of prestigious awards—the evaluator’s primary task is to reward the highest quality candidates. However, these systems are imperfect; top performers may not be acknowledged and thus be underrecognized, and low performers may receive unwarranted recognition and thus be overrecognized. An important feature of many evaluation systems is that people alternate between being candidates and being evaluators. How does experiencing misrecognition as a candidate affect how people subsequently evaluate others? We develop novel theory that underrecognition and overrecognition lead people to reproduce those experiences when they are evaluators. Across three studies—a quasi-natural experiment and two preregistered, multistage experiments, we find that underrecognized evaluators are less likely to grant recognition to others—even to the highest-performing candidates. Conversely, overrecognized evaluators are more likely to grant rewards to others—even to the lowest-performing candidates. Whereas underrecognized evaluator behavior is driven by individuals’ perceptions that their experience was unfair, overrecognized evaluator behavior is driven by the informational cues people glean on how to evaluate others. Thus, in evaluation processes where people oscillate between being the evaluated and being the evaluator, we show how and why seemingly innocuous initial inefficiencies are reproduced in subsequent evaluations.",

          "title": "Essentializing Merit: Disability and Exclusion in Elite Private School Admissions",
          "authors": "Estela B. Diaz, Lauren A. Rivera",
          "abstract": "Historically, elite schools have selected students in ways that reproduce advantages for dominant groups and exclude groups deemed undesirable. The specific outgroup in question has changed over time, but the underlying logic used to exclude these groups is often related to disability. Yet, disability as a social category has received minimal attention in discussions of elite reproduction. In this article, we draw on qualitative data collected from elite independent pre-K–12 schools to show that disability is indeed a salient basis of selection into elite educational environments, one that begins at the earliest moments of educational sorting: admission to elite early childhood programs. Through interviews with admissions personnel, we show that elite independent schools explicitly structure their admissions processes to identify—and exclude—children who are perceived as having or being at risk of developing any type of disability, regardless of impairment type or support needs. We argue that admissions practices at elite independent schools (1) serve as a form of social closure intended to restrict enrollment to young children perceived as able-bodied and neurotypical, and (2) represent a case of essentializing merit , in which elite gatekeepers construct merit as an intrinsic, rather than achieved, property of individuals.",

          "authors": "Aldon D. Morris",
          "abstract": "This article discusses how my lived experiences led me to become a sociologist studying the civil rights movement and the sociology of W. E. B. Du Bois. It explains my rejection of dominant movement theories and the formulation of my own social movement framework to explain the civil rights movement. It proceeds with my transition to studying the sociology of Du Bois. I cover the origins and substance of Du Boisian sociology. Finally, I conclude by addressing an attempted coup on Du Boisian sociology and defend the viability of this new sociological approach.",

          "title": "Gendered Pathways to the Job Offer: Stereotypes and Diversity Value during Job Offer Decisions in Software Engineering Hiring",
          "authors": "Koji Chavez",
          "abstract": "Many corporations in the United States are under pressure to increase gender diversity in professions such as software engineering that have long been dominated by men. Current sociological theory suggests that in response to such pressure, hiring decision makers value women job candidates as potential contributions to gender diversity and incorporate this value into their initial hiring screening decisions. However, it remains unclear whether and how decision makers take diversity into consideration in later hiring stages, namely, during offer decisions, and particularly when there is a strong culture of meritocracy. In this article, the author examines a critical case study of software engineering hiring at a midsized high-technology firm. Drawing on qualitative data, the author finds that diversity considerations do play a role in job offers, but as an implicit motivational force during job offer deliberations rather than an explicitly stated factor. A quantitative analysis complements the qualitative analysis: the author finds no female penalty on receiving an offer where one might be expected, which the author argues is due to implicit diversity considerations during hiring deliberations. The findings of this study have implications for theories of hiring discrimination, cultural fit as a legitimating tool, and motivating reasoning under strong pressures to diversify.",

          "authors": "Marta Ascherio, Carolina Aragão",
          "abstract": "In this study, the authors examine whether and how city-level socioeconomic and political context shape racial classification practices in U.S. Black-White families. The authors link IPUMS 2012–2022, American Community Survey population estimates, and presidential election voting estimates to create a dataset that has 19,907 children across 1,135 Public Use Microdata Areas. Results from multilevel multinomial logistic regression models show that although overall parents are most likely to classify their multiracial children as Black and White, parents are more likely to classify their children as a single race in certain sociopolitical contexts: compared with parents in wealthier areas, parents in disadvantaged areas are more likely to classify their children as only White. Compared with parents in predominantly Democratic areas, parents in predominantly Republican areas are more likely to classify their children as only Black. The authors argue that parents of Black-White children promote racial passing in a low-wage labor market, and armoring in anti-Black political contexts. These findings emphasize the salient role of socioeconomic and political context in the construction of race and contribute to ongoing debates on the future of race and ethnicity in the United States.",

          "authors": "Andrew Miles, Salwa Khan, Yagana Samim",
          "abstract": "The “automaticity dominance” perspective on cognition and behavior holds that automatic processes guide most behavior because deliberate processing is slow, inefficient, and therefore rare, typically restricted to “problematic” situations. Other scholars argue on both theoretical and empirical grounds that deliberate processing is more common. In this study, the authors test automaticity dominance by using multinomial processing tree models to examine donation decisions in an online sample of 1,027 respondents. Using a mixture of preregistered and exploratory analyses on both experimental and observational data, the authors find that (1) the processes underlying donation behavior execute efficiently and rapidly, but key processes are also controllable; (2) deliberate cognition increases in problematic situations but also operates when levels of problematicity are low; and (3) respondents deliberately control (at a minimum) a substantial minority of their decisions. These results indicate that deliberate cognition might not be as rare as an automaticity dominance perspective suggests.",

          "authors": "Tyler W. McDaniel",
          "abstract": "In the era of school choice, much research has examined how families access nonneighborhood schools, but little attention has been given to families’ prior connections to nonneighborhood locations. This study examines how activity spaces —the places where people work, play, worship, and otherwise spend time—relate to school enrollments and, by extension, school segregation. Combining longitudinal data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey with school and neighborhood demographics, the study tests hypotheses derived from the social structural sorting perspective, which predict that families’ activity spaces will influence school sorting processes. First, among schools more than two miles from the home, families were twice as likely to enroll when the school was near a previous activity location. Second, net of residence, racially segregating prior activity spaces (consisting of higher own-group proportions than the neighborhood) predicted racially segregating school enrollments (in schools with higher own-group proportions than the neighborhood school). The results demonstrate links between activity space segregation and school segregation, with implications for larger patterns of social and educational stratification in the twenty-first century.",

          "authors": "Jessica L. Schachle-Gordon, Jonathan S. Coley, Daniel Tetteh",
          "abstract": "A growing number of states have passed laws that ban or restrict diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in higher education; however, little is known about how such laws affect the prevalence of DEI centers and student-of-color groups, which are often housed within DEI centers. Through logistic regression analyses of longitudinal data on DEI centers and student-of-color organizations across 1,756 U.S. colleges and universities, the authors find that anti-DEI laws are associated with schools losing DEI offices between 2020 and 2024. Yet schools in states with anti-DEI laws were more likely to gain Black, Latinx, and Native American groups and less likely to lose existing Black and Latinx student groups. Additionally, anti-DEI laws were not associated with gains or losses in Asian or Asian American student groups. Our study thus suggests that students are organizing to create new inclusive spaces in response to anti-DEI legislation.",

          "authors": "Carolina Gallo Garcia",
          "abstract": "The author examines transnational narratives of women’s empowerment in Brazil, highlighting discourses promoting women’s ability to improve society and their incomes by mobilizing emotions and attributes linked to care responsibilities as savvy feminized skills to be used in micro entrepreneurship. On the basis of a case study through ethnographic research conducted between 2019 and 2022 within a national empowerment program for entrepreneurship training, the author argues that such initiatives are grounded in affective economies increasingly reliant on individualized forms of emotional labor as a central strategy to navigate the Brazilian labor market. By analyzing how emotions circulate within the social space of this corporate-sponsored training program, the author explores the role of affects in constituting power dynamics between those “already empowered” women promoting trainings and those yet to be shaped by the required affects to succeed. Drawing on theories of affective economies and governmentality, this study unravels some complexities of promoting empowerment and financial independence among women in the growing context of labor informality in Brazil. The author concludes by demonstrating how these narratives of empowerment create normative affective standards that rely on women’s emotional engagement with entrepreneurial values, often obscuring the precariousness underpinning their labor conditions.",
