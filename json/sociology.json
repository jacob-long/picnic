          "abstract": "This visualization represents the historical patterns and trends in racial/ethnic differences in punitive school discipline over the last five decades in K–12 public schools in the United States. Overall, out-of-school suspension rates show an inverted-U trend with significant increases between 1970 and 2010 followed by decreases in the last decade. On the other hand, corporal punishment rates (and associated racial/ethnic disparities) show a consistent negative trend since the early 1980s following statewide bans in the use of corporal punishment in schools since the 1970s. However, racial/ethnic disproportionality in school discipline remains persistent across the board; indeed, increasing until the very last few years for Black and American Indian/Alaskan Native students compared to White students.",

          "abstract": "Informal status hierarchy is a ubiquitous feature of social life, and it is one that drives dynamics of dominance, influence, exclusion, and stratification. Utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, this article shows that friendship nominations among adolescents are sensitive to status distinctions and that this sensitivity can be exploited to infer status relations and the level of ambiguity those relations entail. A measure is developed to uncover latent status structures based on such relations among students, demonstrating the existence of complex hierarchical structures among communities. Differentiating between students’ rank (verticality) and embeddedness (horizontality), the analysis reveals orthogonal processes of stratification: A student’s rank is associated with their social role at the school, whereas their embeddedness is linked to traditional markers of stratification, such as race and income. The analysis demonstrates the theoretical utility of incorporating ambiguity of status relations and provides a flexible set of statistical tools to study relational status hierarchies.",

          "abstract": "Some conservative governments denied the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, inducing their supporters to go against sanitary measures. However, could individuals aligned with such political beliefs jeopardize their health due to ideological conviction? In a survey conducted with 1,461 Brazilians exclusively designed for this purpose, the data indicate that the higher the right-wing authoritarianism, the worse the attitudes toward government policies combating COVID-19 and the lower the preventive behavior in the early stages of the pandemic. Considering the support provided by evangelical religions to conservative governments, we compared the effect of right-wing authoritarianism among different religious groups, where the results were consistent. Right-wing authoritarianism emerged as the strongest predictor of resistance to pandemic prevention attitudes and behaviors even when controlling its effect with belief in science, demographics, and risk factors. The implications of the relationship between right-wing authoritarianism and the denial of public health measures have not ceased with the pandemic: Identification with authoritarian agendas points toward resistance to vaccination campaigns and the combating of epidemics.",

          "authors": "Amber R. Crowell",
          "abstract": "In this study, I examine the role of household income in determining White-Black, White-Latino, and White-Asian residential segregation in the twenty-first century across 50 metropolitan areas over the decennial time points from 2000 to 2020. I use census and survey microdata and a reformulation of the separation index, a measure of the segregation dimension of evenness, to situate segregation as a group inequality that can be analyzed using group-specific household-level regression models and regression standardization analysis, where household income is the predictor of segregation-relevant neighborhood outcomes. I find that across groups, across communities, and over time, the role of household income in shaping segregation patterns varies widely. White-Black segregation is lowest between high-income households and is declining consistently for all income groups, even at mismatched incomes. White-Latino segregation patterns are more inconsistent, with segregation staying low and stable for high-income Latino households but rising somewhat for low- and middle-income households. Finally, White-Asian segregation is rising and has risen the fastest for high-income Asian households. These findings call for continuing investigation into the shifting and interlocking dynamics of race and income that shape segregation outcomes.",

          "abstract": "How do race and foreign-born status shape labor market outcomes? Existing frameworks about discrimination against immigrants posit that the further people are racially and socioculturally from the “mainstream,” the more discrimination they will experience. To date, we lack a direct empirical test of how race and foreign-born status combine in a causal manner in hiring. To fill this empirical gap, I use insights from status aggregation theory and racial boundary formation to develop and test empirical predictions about how race and nativity status combine in hiring. I test these hypotheses using data from a large-scale field experiment in 18 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas in semi-skilled jobs. Results from the audit study show that employers discriminate based on nativity status and that these effects are similar for Hispanic and Eastern European immigrants. I discuss the implications of these findings for theories of immigrant incorporation and literature on employer hiring decisions.",

Some theoretical and empirical work on stereotypes focuses on personal “first-order” beliefs about social groups. Other work focuses on perceptions of a culture’s stereotypes, or “generalized second-order” beliefs. Scholars differ in which they consider to have greater impact or whether they think they are unique or represent the same underlying belief. In this visualization, I present data from a large online survey experiment ( N = 1,045) in which participants reported either first-order or generalized second-order stereotypes about 19 different social groups. For the majority of stereotypes measured, the results differ across the two methods, with perceptions of culture more pessimistic than people’s actual first-order beliefs would suggest. That is, people tend to assume that others hold more negative stereotypes than they actually do, and this is especially pronounced for negatively viewed social groups.",

However, studies have yet to examine these longitudinal changes across generational birth cohorts defined by ever-shifting social norms, cultural contexts, and social policies. Using Monitoring the Future Study panel data, we conducted cohort-stratified modified Poisson regression models to estimate the probability of bachelor’s degree completion by educational expectations overall and by gender, race and ethnicity, and parental educational attainment. We found that despite high educational expectations, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and first-generation students had a low likelihood of bachelor’s degree completion. These relationships persisted across generational cohorts. These findings suggest that social and economic resources remain salient factors that structure educational opportunities for students from minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds and first-generation students.",

          "abstract": "Studies examining the consequences of intergenerational income mobility for individuals often face challenges due to multicollinearity between origin, destination, and a mobility construct based on the origin-destination difference. This article introduces a novel conceptualization of mobility, termed “reachability mobility,” which is based on the “easiness” of achieving a particular origin-destination combination within a population. This approach contrasts with the traditional lattice-based conceptualization. Furthermore, this study proposes using copulas—a statistical tool that captures the dependence structure between incomes of two generations while remaining insensitive to their marginal distributions—to measure reachability mobility. When combined with a standard measure of mobility direction, this approach allows scholars to simultaneously estimate the effects of origin, destination, and mobility along with numerous other methodological advantages.

          "abstract": "This article is the first to explore variations in alcohol, drug overdose, and suicide deaths in the United States by marital status before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Using the Multiple Cause-of-Death file and the American Community Survey (2000–2021), we found the nonmarried exhibit mortality rates 2 to 3 times higher in alcohol and suicide deaths and 4 to 5 times higher in drug-related deaths compared to the married population, net of education. This magnitude of marriage advantage is comparable to educational differences in these deaths. The marriage advantages are more pronounced for males than females (except in suicide, where gender differences are minor) and for White individuals compared to Black and Hispanic individuals. Furthermore, the marriage advantage widened substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We advocate for viewing these deaths not only through an economic lens but also as manifestations of “social pathology,” urging consideration within broader societal shifts.",

          "authors": "Michael Niño, Alexia Angton, Kathryn Norton-Smith, Kayla Allison",
          "abstract": "School suspension has been linked to numerous adverse social outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. While research continues to highlight the deleterious consequences tied to suspension, less is known about how exposure to suspension influences health over the life course. Drawing from panel data, we address this gap by investigating whether school suspension is associated with self-rated health from adolescence to midlife. Compared to youth with no history of suspension, suspended youth were more likely to report poorer health in adolescence. Findings also demonstrate that school suspension plays a significant role in self-rated health patterns over time. Specifically, we find suspended youth experience a persistent health gap in excellent health from adolescence to midlife and a more rapid acceleration of fair and poor health from their late 20s to midlife. Taken together, this study provides new evidence of the role of exclusionary discipline in shaping health disparities from adolescence to midlife.",

          "abstract": "This exploratory study renders it an open empirical question how ordinary people understand the meaning of culture and what are its sociopolitical implications. Using original survey data from over 11,000 respondents across nine European countries, the study focuses on an open-ended question where the respondents defined the meaning of “culture” in their own words. The open-ended answers are scrutinized by structural topic modeling, which allows for identifying relatively coherent clusters of understandings of culture and their relationships. In addition to examining how these understandings vary across national contexts, the study investigates their variation according to major sociodemographic divisions and sociopolitical and cultural factors in and across the nine European societies through regression methods. The results underscore substantial national variation and social stratification of the understandings of culture and the potential of computational text analysis in open-ended survey research.",

          "abstract": "Women’s status in Taiwan has improved substantially due to rapid social and legal changes, yet how female empowerment affects child custody outcomes has been studied little. This study analyzes the entirety of divorce registration records in 2002–2004 and 2018–2020 to reveal the evolution of custodial arrangements in Taiwan. It pays particular attention to how mother’s changing traits and spousal pairings in age and education affect the probability of different child custody outcomes. The findings show that maternal age and education matter in both absolute and relative terms. Higher maternal age and education are associated with more mother-sole and joint custody decisions. Women in age and educational hypogamy secure mother-sole custody more often than their nonhypogamous peers. Furthermore, with improved women’s status at the society level, all women and particularly those in nontraditional unions now have become less likely to face a complete loss of child custody upon divorce than before.",

          "title": "Necessity or Luxury? Air Conditioning and Support for Utility Assistance in the Context of Climate Change",
          "authors": "Evan Stewart",
          "abstract": "Studies of climate attitudes are increasingly concerned with support for mitigation policies such as adequate indoor cooling to address heat exposure. Air conditioning has historically been marketed as a luxury good, but polling shows Americans are evenly split in whether they consider it a necessity or a luxury. Do they support utility aid programs that would increase access to air conditioning? Results from an original survey vignette experiment (N = 1,200) show respondents are less likely to support government aid to help low-income people pay utility bills when policy frames invoke air conditioning rather than heat. A replication (N = 703) finds this effect is most pronounced among White respondents. These findings have important implications for research and policy advocacy because they demonstrate a potential obstacle for public support in addressing the negative impacts of extreme heat in climate change.",
