          "title": "Time’s Up? How Temporal Maps of Climate Change Shape Climate Action",
          "authors": "Ioana Sendroiu, Amalia Álvarez-Benjumea, Fabian Winter",
          "abstract": "We track how temporal mappings of climate change relate to individuals’ actions to address the climate crisis. We consider multiple aspects of temporal maps and so make two innovations over the literature to date. First, we examine how individuals coordinate their actions across both their own expectations of the future (first-order futures) and their sense of others’ expectations (second-order futures). Second, we examine past effects of climate change, as well as the turning points past which respondents believe climate change can no longer be addressed. We show how both everyday actions, such as recycling, and political behaviors, such as protesting, are coordinated across these temporal maps, conceptualized as beliefs about past, present, and future, and the turning points across them. A core finding is that individuals’ own concern about the climate future is associated with increased climate action, whereas believing others to be concerned depreciates individuals’ own climate action. This study is therefore a conceptual contribution to understanding action and temporality, while also providing empirical insight into how individuals navigate the climate crisis.",

          "title": "Religion, Perceptions of Scientists’ Moral Culture, and Support for Science in the United States",
          "authors": "Timothy L. O’Brien, Shiri Noy",
          "abstract": "How do perceptions of scientists’ moral values relate to support for science in society? Recent advances in the sociology of science and religion suggest that people associate scientists with moral values in addition to factual knowledge, and that concerns about scientists’ morality are why members of some religious groups are more critical of science than non-religious people. We test this theory using data from a probability sample of U.S. adults that includes new measures of beliefs about scientists’ moral values, such as their compassion, fairness, and generosity ( n = 1,513). Results from structural equation models indicate that active members of all religious groups are, to varying degrees, more skeptical than atheists and agnostics of scientists’ moral character. A decomposition of direct and indirect effects indicates that beliefs about scientists’ moral values play an intermediary role in the relationship between religion and support for science, and that support for science among the religious is partially suppressed by their concerns about scientists’ morality. This article offers the first direct evidence of the moral culture the U.S. public associates with scientists. We suggest that religious differences in support for organized science reflect religious differences in beliefs about scientists’ moral values.",

          "authors": "Fenaba R. Addo, Daniel Auguste",
          "abstract": "This review explores research on the sources of Black and White wealth and debt differentials and how these differentials recreate inequalities in both wealth and nonwealth outcomes. We discuss how the relationship between wealth and life outcomes is bidirectional, yet studies of racial wealth inequality overwhelmingly focus on wealth as an outcome. We suggest that studies that examine the relationship from wealth to life outcomes are necessary to enable full understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the production and reproduction of racial wealth inequality and to identify policies in the United States to reduce racial inequality. We highlight research on entrepreneurship, race, and wealth to illustrate these dynamics. We conclude with a call for scholars to focus on community-level wealth, given scholarly and policy interests in closing the racial wealth gap.",

          "title": "The limits of feminization: gender composition and mental wellbeing in the medical profession",
          "authors": "Tania M Jenkins, Alyssa R Browne",
          "abstract": "As more women enter traditionally male-dominated professions, it is important to understand how feminization has—or has not—impacted work cultures, with implications for women’s mental wellbeing. Research on proportional representation and mental health suggests that as professions feminize, women’s mental wellbeing should benefit from shifting peer cultures. However, gender stratification scholars argue that interactional cultures are also shaped by macrolevel factors like institutional rules and hegemonic beliefs that may temper cultural change. We examine the case of medicine, a profession that has feminized rapidly but unevenly over recent decades, to investigate the extent to which increasing representation of women shapes not only local peer cultures, but also the professional logics and rules that frame those local cultures, in ways that may affect women’s mental wellbeing. Drawing on interviews with physicians and trainees in more- and less-feminizing specialties, we find that masculinized norms persist across fields, regardless of feminization, because these ideals are codified through enduring professional rules and logics. These ideals can negatively shape women’s mental wellbeing, as they either disengage from their work or grow frustrated with sexist expectations—especially those in more feminized specialties who expected a more “women-friendly” experience. Our findings suggest that increasing proportional representation may be necessary but insufficient for prompting profession-wide cultural change and improving women’s mental wellbeing, given the complexity of the gender structure.",

          "authors": "Brenda Bustos, Jason Bonham, Tim A. Bruckner",
          "abstract": "Although prior studies indicate that approximately 6 percent of the population will engage in racial identification switching (RIS), no prior research has explored the potential relation between RIS and health outcomes. Using the California birth cohort file from 2005 to 2015, the authors examine RIS among mothers identifying as non-Hispanic (NH) white or NH Black and with at least two live births over the test period ( n = 449,008). Using a sibling-control design, the authors compared perinatal health and sociodemographic characteristics of mothers with RIS over time against those without RIS. The authors also conducted logistic regression analyses predicting maternal race at the second birth after controlling for characteristics of the second birth. In sibling-control univariate results, mothers who switched from NH white to NH Black over time were more likely to deliver a low-weight infant, use public programs (e.g., Medicaid), and have less than a high school education relative to NH white mothers who did not change racial identity over time. Logistic regression results further indicate several socioeconomic (e.g., Medicaid) and health (e.g., low birth weight) factors related to RIS. The pattern of results indicate that health disparity research should carefully consider racial identity as a fluid construct which often varies with socioeconomic and health status.",

          "authors": "Wendy D. Manning, Karen Benjamin Guzzo, Claire Kamp Dush, Gabrielle Juteau",
          "abstract": "Despite initial declines in fertility since the onset of the pandemic, less is known about how fertility intentions are related to pandemic-based stressors in the United States. The authors examine the following two questions. First, how are pandemic stressors associated with short-term fertility intentions? Second, among those delaying fertility, what are the rationales for doing so, and how are pandemic stressors related to these rationales? The authors draw on the National Couples’ Health and Time Study, a nationally representative sample of 20- to 50-year-olds in the United States who were married or cohabiting and interviewed between September 2020 and April 2021. Among those desiring or remaining open to having (more) children, experiencing pandemic-related stressors was associated with delays in fertility plans; those whose lives were most disrupted and those who experienced relationship stress were less likely to intend to have children in the next year. The most common rationale for not intending to have children in the next year was economic worries, followed by health worries and concerns about an uncertain future. Economic and health stress were linked to these rationales, net of objective indicators. A comprehensive assessment of fertility intentions and underlying rationale for intentions on the basis of subjective factors is critical for understanding fertility patterns.",
