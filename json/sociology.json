          "title": "Navigating the Labor Market among People Who Use Drugs: Qualitative Evidence from a Justice-Involved Sample",
          "authors": "Mike Vuolo, Anneliese Ward, Lesley E. Schneider",
          "abstract": "Given substantially higher substance use rates among justice-involved people and that employers are largely protected from disqualifying people who use drugs, the U.S. Department of Labor called for incorporation of substance use recovery into the “second chance” hiring framework for individuals with criminal records. Despite this call and a sizable literature on applicants navigating the market with a criminal record, the labor market experiences among the subset who use substances has not been directly studied. The authors address this research gap using 43 in-depth interviews with people with criminal records in central Ohio who use substances. With substance use taking primacy over possessing a record, two thematic approaches emerged. First, participants remained in the formal labor market by restricting applications to employers not conducting drug screens, along with avoiding triggering jobs and using evasion techniques. Second, participants described disconnecting from the labor market while using, either generating illegal income or describing addiction as too all encompassing to work. These results demonstrate that the restrictive labor market for people with criminal records is further limited among those who use substances and how substance use can prohibit labor market attachment. The authors describe implications for employment policy and the punitive nature of substance use control.",

          "title": "How Do Children Self-Locate Themselves in the Social Hierarchy? Educationally Homogamous Parents, Working Mothers, and Children’s Subjective Social Status",
          "authors": "Heeyoun Shin, ChangHwan Kim",
          "abstract": "Children have been assumed to share their father’s subjective social status (SSS) because fathers tend to occupy the highest socioeconomic status in a family. The progress of women in education and their increased contribution to the family economy cast doubt on this assumption, but limited data availability has hindered research on children’s SSS. Utilizing the 2005–2021 Korea Labor and Income Panel Study, this study examines whether children’s SSS is influenced by family settings that deviate from traditional gender norms. The results show that children tend to share the same SSS with their parents, but their SSS varies depending on the family settings. Children of educationally homogamous parents express higher SSS than children of educationally hypergamous or hypogamous parents net of family socioeconomic backgrounds. Also, children of the sole male breadwinner tend to have higher SSS than children of co-breadwinners. These results imply that on top of gender discrimination in labor markets, women whose social status is higher than that of their partners face an additional challenge in the family: Their children’s SSS is lower than that of the traditional male breadwinner families.",
