          "title": "Role-Accumulation and Mental Health across the Life Course",
          "authors": "Trenton D. Mize, Reilly Kincaid",
          "abstract": "Decades of research shows that holding and maintaining multiple social roles leads to better mental health and well-being overall, but role-accumulation theory has not proposed or considered whether effects vary at different stages in the life course. Rather, the current theory assumes that social roles’ positive influence on mental health should be similar at all ages. In addition, extant work suggests that accumulating roles that are more voluntary than obligatory is the best strategy for mental health, regardless of age. In contrast, socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that in later life, adults tend to reduce their number of social roles, especially voluntary ones, as a strategy to maximize mental health. Using 21 waves/years of longitudinal data on Australian adults, we examine the effect of role-accumulation across the entire adult life course. Fixed-effects models show that the types of roles matter, with obligatory role-accumulation associated with better mental health at most ages, but not in late adulthood. In contrast, voluntary role-accumulation is beneficial at all ages, and especially for the mental health of older adults. The findings mostly support role-accumulation theory’s predictions and highlight the importance of voluntary roles for lifelong well-being. Our results suggest that creating more voluntary role opportunities that are accessible to all ages can benefit older individuals, communities, and population health more broadly.",

          "title": "Generational variations in wellbeing: suicide rates, cohort characteristics, and national socio-political context over seven decades",
          "authors": "Jean Stockard",
          "abstract": "Over recent decades, the relative wellbeing of younger birth cohorts declined in many western countries, indicating growing generational inequality. Building on Durkheimian theory, this paper examines explanations for these changes, hypothesizing that differences in cohort wellbeing are related to variations in social integration associated with birth cohorts and national socio-political contexts. Age–period-specific suicide rates of men and women from 1950 to 2020 in 19 highly developed western nations, including 26 birth cohorts, born from 1875 to 2004, are examined using estimable function analysis and age–period–cohort characteristic (APCC) models. Cohort variations in wellbeing are significantly greater in English-speaking nations, which have traditionally provided less institutionalized support and social integration than continental European nations. Age-specific suicide rates are larger for cohorts with childhood demographic characteristics associated with less social integration (relative cohort size and family structure). Major historical events associated with social integration in formative years of late adolescence and young adulthood also influence cohort wellbeing, with higher age-specific rates for cohorts experiencing the Great Depression of the 1930s and health pandemics of the early 20th and 21st centuries and lower rates for those experiencing periods of war and national conflict. However, the magnitude of these associations is strongly influenced by socio-political context. Negative effects of cohort characteristics are muted and positive effects are enhanced in the continental nations. In addition, patterns of associations vary by age and gender. Results remain with strong controls for the pace of change, additional measures of national context, and sensitivity analyses.",

          "title": "Family background and life cycle earnings volatility: evidence from brother correlations in Denmark, Germany, and the United States",
          "authors": "Filippo Gioachin, Kristian Bernt Karlson",
          "abstract": "While stratification scholars have extensively examined intergenerational associations in lifetime income, they have mostly disregarded how family background affects exposure to income volatility over the life course. As exposure to volatility represents a non-desirable outcome associated with negative shocks to individuals’ welfare, studying the link between family background and volatility is key to further advancing the understanding of how family-based inequalities impact lifelong economic prospects. This article fills this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of the role of family background in shaping exposure to earnings volatility across the life course in Denmark, Germany, and the United States. We find that brother correlations in volatility exposure—a broad measure of family background’s impact—are much lower in Denmark than in Germany and the United States. Further analyses indicate that in Germany and the United States, family background exerts a considerable influence particularly around the period of occupational maturity, while in Denmark, its impact remains consistent over time. We also find that family background impacts volatility exposure net of individuals’ position in the overall earnings distribution, indicating that family background has a direct impact on volatility experiences and thus constitutes a nonnegligible component in intergenerational inequality.",

          "title": "Invisible secularity: American theism beyond belief",
          "authors": "David Voas",
          "abstract": "It is often asserted that religion is changing rather than declining and that the usual indicators give a misleading impression of growing secularity. The evidence presented here suggests that on the contrary, social measures like affiliation and attendance may understate the weakening of personal religiosity. The apparent persistence of belief in God conceals erosion in its substance, strength, salience, and stability. The levels of religiosity and spirituality among the religiously unaffiliated are declining, notwithstanding the rapid expansion in their numbers. Moreover, belief has not just diminished among Americans who no longer belong to religious organizations: it is fading from one generation to the next among people who continue to belong. Americans are becoming less confident in the existence of God, less persuaded that God is active and judgmental, less inclined to see God as important, and less likely to express consistent conviction. Contrary to claims that apparent secularization masks enduring (if unorthodox) invisible religion, implicit religion, diffused religion, lived religion, and so on, the evidence shows that continuing religious involvement disguises waning religiosity. The research is based on six waves of the Baylor Religion Survey (2005–2021) in conjunction with the General Social Survey (1972–2022).",

          "title": "Conditional inequality and cooptive inclusion: property managers’ labor and the reproduction of inequalities in the market for rental housing",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Korver-Glenn",
          "abstract": "Occupational inequality, including occupational segregation and associated inequities in working conditions, is a key linchpin of structural racial, gender, and class inequalities among American workers. Building on this scholarship, I center workers who are intermediaries and develop the concept of conditional inequality, which signifies the mediating process by which intermediaries’ experiences of and reactions to structural inequities in work conditions affect the experiences and outcomes of other individuals within their purview. Specifically, I examine how marginalized intermediaries within a segregated profession—residential property management—experience their work conditions, how they react to these conditions, and how their strategies to minimize the burdens of these conditions affect others with whom they interact. Using 80 in-depth interviews and extensive ethnographic data gathered among multifamily managers and leasing consultants (almost all women of color) and renters (predominantly people of color), I demonstrate how managers experience little autonomy and acute, renter-oriented burdens in their work conditions. Managers adopted three strategies to minimize the harms of these conditions and, in so doing, generated financial and health consequences among renters. Finally, I explain cooptive inclusion—the process of White, male-dominated industries relying on marginalized people to enact policies that harm other marginalized people—and its implications for the perpetuation of intersectional capitalism.",

          "title": "When to Use Counterfactuals in Causal Historiography: Methods for Semantics and Inference",
          "authors": "Tay Jeong",
          "abstract": "According to the interventionist framework of actual causality, causal claims in history are ultimately claims about special types of functional dependencies between variables, which consist not only of actual events but also of corresponding counterfactual states of affairs. Instead of advocating the methodological use of counterfactuals tout court, we propose specific circumstances in historical writing where counterfactual reasoning comes in most handy. At the level of semantics, that is, the specification of the variables and their possible values, an explicit specification of the latent contrast classes becomes particularly useful in situations where one may be prompted to take an event that is pre-empted by the antecedent of interest as its proper causal contrast. At the level of inference, we argue that cases in which two or more antecedents appear to be playing a similar role tend to fumble our pretheoretical intuition about cause and propose a sequence of counterfactual tests based on actual examples from causal historiography.",

          "authors": "Kimmo Eriksson, Brent Simpson",
          "abstract": "Conservative thinkers have long warned that the welfare state may weaken society’s moral fiber. But this claim has not been empirically examined. The authors link publicly available data on the sizes of welfare states with behavioral data from a recent study in which thousands of lost wallets were distributed in 40 countries to measure how often they were returned to their owners. A preregistered study ( n = 194) confirmed that U.S. Republicans perceive returning lost wallets as a good indicator of moral character and believe that people’s moral character is worse in countries where the welfare state is larger. Contrary to this belief, the linked data indicate a strong positive relationship between the size of welfare states and moral character: rates of returned wallets were higher in countries with historically large welfare states, net of economic prosperity and economic inequality. The authors conclude with tentative implications and suggestions for further work.",

          "title": "Weaponizing the Workplace: How Algorithmic Management Shaped Amazon’s Antiunion Campaign in Bessemer, Alabama",
          "authors": "Teke Wiggin",
          "abstract": "Scholarship on “algorithmic management” focuses on how employers use algorithms and digital devices to routinely control workers. It also looks at how workers resist this control. But how does algorithmic management affect the ability of employers to respond to collective action? The answer is important because algorithmic management is the “new contested terrain” of labor struggles. Drawing on 42 interviews with workers and court documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, the author examines Amazon’s antiunion campaign in Bessemer, Alabama. The findings reveal that employers can weaponize elements or effects of algorithmic management against unions via repurposing devices that algorithmically control workers, engaging in “algorithmic slack-cutting,” and exploiting patterns of social media activity encouraged by algorithmic management. These findings demonstrate that the labor process can shape counter-organizing opportunities for employers, not just organizing opportunities for workers. They also reveal that algorithmic management has upgraded the antiunion arsenal, while shedding light on other aspects of algorithmic management that have escaped notice. The discussion section presents a framework for researching how other workplace variables shape counter-organizing. The conclusion discusses implications for our understanding of workplace regimes and the future of labor control.",

          "authors": "Melissa A. Milkie, Liana C. Sayer, Kei Nomaguchi, Hope Xu Yan",
          "abstract": "Gender scholars have debated whether the recent movement toward a more equal division of domestic labor is stalling. Using a differential convergence perspective, the authors argue that examining which domestic tasks undergo gender convergence, whose changes narrow the gap, and why changes happen is critical for understanding gender inequalities in unpaid labor time. Using data from the 2003–2023 American Time Use Survey, the authors examine trends in total housework (including core and occasional housework), shopping, and childcare time. Results for married individuals indicate that the historically large gender gap in total housework time narrowed further this century, from a women-to-men ratio of 1.8:1 in 2003–2005 to 1.6:1 in 2022–2023. This shrinking of the gender gap was concentrated in traditionally feminine core housework (decreasing by 40 percent, from 4.2:1 to 2.5:1), particularly housecleaning and laundry. The gender difference in shopping time also narrowed, nearing parity. For childcare time, the gender gap shrunk from 2:1 to 1.8:1, though this change was not statistically significant. Decomposition analyses indicate that women’s reduced housework time was explained mainly by population compositional shifts, whereas men’s increased core housework time likely reflected behavioral or normative changes. With men taking on more female-typed domestic activities, the gendered norms associated with different forms of unpaid labor may be becoming redefined.",
