          "authors": "Dana Shay, Esther Adi-Japha, Yossi Shavit",
          "abstract": "Understanding the long-term effect of early childhood poverty on a child’s life prospects presents a methodological challenge due to the potential endogeneity of family income, making it difficult to establish a clear causal relationship. This study addresses this challenge by exploiting a natural experiment: a major reduction in child allowances and income support benefits for families with young children, which disproportionately affected large and low-income families. We examine the subsequent impact of this policy change on children’s educational achievements. Using administrative population data, we compare the standardized test scores of Israeli fifth-grade students born in 2002—just before the reform, when social security allowances were more generous—to those born in 2004, immediately after the reform was implemented. OLS and Difference-in-Differences analyses reveal a significant negative effect on the test scores of pupils from low-income, large families born after the reform. In particular, fifth-and-last birth-order children in low-income families exhibited significantly lower scores compared to their counterparts born before the reform. No similar effect was observed among children of lower birth order or those from higher-income families born after the reform. These findings underscore the lasting effect of early childhood socioeconomic disparities on educational outcomes and highlight the critical role of social security policy changes in shaping long-term inequality among vulnerable social groups.",

          "authors": "Yiang Li, Linda J Waite",
          "abstract": "Physical attractiveness has been linked to better economic, dyadic, and health outcomes but is understudied. We focus here on the gendered implications of attractiveness for one component of social well-being, access to intimate partnership and sexuality, among older adults. In addition, we examine the role of body size, as measured and rated by an observer, in evaluating attractiveness and the diverging consequences for women and men. We use data from Rounds 1 (2005–2006) and 2 (2010–2011) of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (N = 2,144) to explore the association of two measures of body size, weight relative to height (body mass index [BMI]) and interviewer assessments of body size, with sexual behavior that requires a partner and sexual behavior that does not. We find that at larger body sizes as reflected in both the BMI and rated body shape, women—but not men—face a lower probability of having a partner and engaging in partnered sex, and a lower frequency of vaginal intercourse and receiving sexual touch. These associations are mediated by physical functioning for the BMI and by attractiveness as rated by the interviewer for rated body shape. We also find that women—but not men—are more likely to report finding sex not pleasurable at a higher BMI, which partly operates through the mechanism of functional limitations. We suggest that these findings reflect different attractiveness standards for men and women, which reduce women’s access to partners and partnered sex but not solitary sex, such as masturbation.",

          "abstract": "Reporting on an ethnography of a profeminist batterer intervention program (BIP), this article details how the theory of hybrid hegemonic masculinities can help understand processes and outcomes in men’s interventions. The BIP exalts a liberal masculinity that explains men’s abuse as caused by patriarchal ideologies. The author refers to this locally dominant masculinity as progressive hybrid masculinity, as it discursively distances men who adopt it from global hegemonic masculinity by subordinating “toxic masculinity,” reframes emotional expressiveness and empathy as masculine through a discourse of power, and covertly shores up men’s structural power through reification of conventional masculine roles and values. Observational data, triangulated with interviews, reveal that men’s engagement with and enacting of this hybrid masculinity moderated program outcomes, resulting in attitudes ranging from egalitarian to oppressive. The author situates progressive hybrid masculinity as a hybrid masculinity functioning as a local hegemonic masculinity, adding to the debate regarding the synthesis of these prominent frameworks.",

          "abstract": "Will artificial intelligence (AI) change how scholars write? To find out, I examine normative barriers to the institutionalization of AI tools for text generation in history, political science, and economics. Concretely, I ask 139 editors and editorial board members at 40 top journals—gatekeepers—if they approve of AI-aided writing, defined as (1) a human provides ideas in brief notes; (2) instructs AI to write them up as paragraphs in a preferred style; and (3) edits, verifies, and signs the final text. Most (51 percent) respondents agree that such AI-aided writing is acceptable, but many disagree (33 percent) or remain uncertain (16 percent). Respondents base their approval or disapproval mainly on moral claims about what constitutes worthy authorship. Substantial differences among the three disciplines suggest that rather than converging, the emergence of AI-aided writing provokes reflections on the purpose of human writing and boundary work within the academy.",

          "authors": "Adam R. Roth, Ashley F. Railey, Siyun Peng",
          "abstract": "Geographic disparities in Alzheimer’s disease are often attributed to sociodemographic differences across communities or unequal access to opportunity structures whose use serves as protective mechanisms. Yet limited research considers the social dynamics between residents that are enabled by these opportunity structures. The authors adopt a population-level approach to evaluate how ethnoracial diversity and opportunity structures function jointly to facilitate the development of bridging social capital (i.e., mixing of dissimilar people) which is hypothesized to predict Alzhiemer’s disease mortality rates. Upon analyzing Alzheimer’s disease mortality records from 2,469 U.S. counties, the authors find that counties whose sociodemographic composition and opportunity structures combine to encourage bridging capital potential exhibit lower mortality rates than counties with fewer such opportunities. These findings consistently appear in environments whose composition and structure are conducive to social mixing (i.e., workhoods and civic organizations) but inconsistently in environments that are less conducive to social mixing (i.e., residential neighborhoods). The findings highlight the importance of structural factors that create opportunities for social capital.",

          "authors": "Katy Morris",
          "abstract": "Amid growing evidence that national occupational change trends mask substantial subnational heterogeneity, the author uses census data to visualize how the occupational structure changed within the 33 London borough between 1991 and 2021. The visualization documents a tale of two cities. The story in Inner London is one of clear upgrading: the proportion of residents employed in high-paying occupations increased by approximately 20 percentage points, while the proportion of residents employed in low- and midpaying occupations decreased markedly. In Outer London, the story is rather one of occupational polarization. Although the proportion of residents employed in high-paying jobs increased by 10 percentage points, the rate of growth was much slower, and growth at the top was generally accompanied by an increase in employment in low-paying jobs. These findings have important implications for the socioeconomic composition of schools, income inequality dynamics in London boroughs and potentially also for inequality beliefs and political behavior.",
