          "title": "Is Meritocracy Not So Bad After All? Educational Expansion and Intergenerational Mobility in 40 Countries",
          "authors": "Herman G. van de Werfhorst",
          "abstract": "In the face of continued socioeconomic inheritance, the belief that the simple expansion of educational opportunities will create meritocratic societies has been met with skepticism. It is well documented that within expanding educational systems, class-advantaged families attempt to secure further advantages for their offspring. Conversely, for many, the modernist belief that educational expansion is a means to achieving a fairer society remains compelling. Studying trends in intergenerational occupational mobility in 40 countries from four continents, I examine whether educational expansion enhances occupational mobility, and whether such trends are counteracted by heightened persistence between social origin and destination within education groups. The results indicate that educational expansion over time, and the policies supporting it, are linked to improved intergenerational occupational mobility. Furthermore, this increased mobility through expanded educational opportunities is not negated by a strengthening of within-education elite persistence in occupational status, suggesting that occupational mobility patterns can genuinely change through educational expansion. The modernist ideology around educational expansion as a driver of social mobility may warrant renewed attention.",

          "title": "Misery Needs Company: Contextualizing the Geographic and Temporal Link between Unemployment and Suicide",
          "authors": "Byungkyu Lee, Bernice A. Pescosolido",
          "abstract": "Despite long-standing evidence linking higher unemployment rates to increased suicide rates, a puzzling trend emerged in the United States after the Great Recession: suicide rates continued to rise even as unemployment rates declined. Drawing on theories of social networks and reference groups, we advance the concept of “sameness”—in this case, the extent to which an individual’s employment status aligns with the fate of others in one’s community—to clarify how unemployment rates influence suicide. Constructing a multilevel dataset of U.S. suicide deaths from 2005 to 2017, we find that while unemployed individuals face a higher risk of suicide compared to the employed, this gap diminishes in communities with high local unemployment rates. Moreover, the “sameness” effect extends beyond geographic contexts to temporal ones, as national unemployment spikes reduce suicide risk among the unemployed and diminish the importance of local sameness. Together, these findings suggest a mechanism of “situational awareness,” whereby local and national economic contexts shape the meaning of unemployment, shifting its interpretation from personal failure to system failure and reducing its stigma. Our article offers a novel framework for examining the effects of cross-level interactions in suicide research, highlighting the crucial role of culture as deeply intertwined with social network mechanisms in shaping contextual influence.",

          "title": "Defenders of the status quo: energy protests and policy (in)action in Sweden",
          "authors": "Katrin Uba, Cassandra Engeman",
          "abstract": "Are the positions that protesters take—in favor or against change—consequential for their ability to affect policy? While previous research suggests that protests can inform legislative priorities and facilitate policy introduction, this paper emphasizes policy inaction and stasis as goals of some protest actions. Analysis uses novel and detailed data on energy-related protest and policy actions in Sweden covering a forty-year period and considers protest frequency and size in relation to proposal introduction. The research design uniquely distinguishes between protests in favor or against a specific energy source and proposal activity in line with those demands and also controls for public opinion on each energy source. Findings suggest that pro-renewable energy protests do not yield pro-renewable policies but prevent undesired policies that support non-renewable energy sources. In contrast to pro-renewable protests, protests against renewable energy sources are somewhat more influential. They likewise prevent the introduction of their undesired proposals and also influence the introduction of proposals supporting non-renewable energy sources. Overall, the paper examines policy inaction as a desired protest outcome and argues protest—as a tactic—may be more effective when pushing against rather than for policy change.",

          "title": "Entering the mainstream economy? Workplace segregation and immigrant assimilation",
          "authors": "Mats Lillehagen, Are Skeie Hermansen",
          "abstract": "Why do foreign-born immigrant workers often concentrate in low-wage, minority-dense workplaces? Do immigrants’ native-born children—who typically acquire better language skills, education, and country-specific knowledge—experience improved access to workplaces in the mainstream economy? Using economy-wide linked employer–employee administrative data from Norway, we analyze both ethnic and economic workplace segregation across immigrant generations. We find that, on average, 32% of immigrants’ coworkers and 16% of second-generation immigrants’ coworkers have immigrant backgrounds, compared to 7% for natives. In terms of economic segregation, the average percentile rank of coworkers’ salaries is 36, 49, and 52 for immigrants, children of immigrants, and natives, respectively. A formal decomposition analysis shows that differences in employee, workplace, and residential location characteristics collectively explain 54–74% of ethnic and 79–84% of economic workplace segregation for immigrants and their children. Key factors driving this segregation in both immigrant generations include education, occupational attainment, industry of employment, having an immigrant manager, and the concentration of immigrant neighbors. This suggests that both skill-based sorting and network-related processes contribute to immigrant–native workplace segregation. However, children of immigrants’ improved access to less immigrant-dense and higher-paying workplaces, compared to immigrants, is primarily driven by differential skill-based sorting (i.e., higher education and shifts in occupation and industry placement). Our findings reveal a sharp decline in workplace segregation relative to natives as children of immigrants advance into the mainstream economy, highlighting the central role of assimilation in skill profiles for workplace integration across immigrant generations.",

          "authors": "Anna Reosti, Chris Hess, Courtney Allen, Kyle Crowder",
          "abstract": "Against the backdrop of an acute rental affordability crisis and a resurgent tenant’s rights movement, rental industry groups have frequently argued that tenant protection laws disproportionately harm “mom-and-pop” landlords and, by extension, the disadvantaged tenants they serve. The authors leverage a changing regulatory environment in Seattle to provide a rare empirical interrogation of these claims. This analysis of a novel set of consumer data linked with parcel records provides no evidence that tenant protection laws drove “mom-and-pop” landlords out of the rental market. Moreover, an analysis of a survey of almost 4,000 Seattle landlords suggests that “mom-and-pop” landlords use management practices that are largely similar to those used by landlords with larger rental portfolios. These findings run counter to pervasive political narratives regarding the detrimental effects of tenant protection regulations on the small-scale rental sector and bring needed attention to the repercussions of claims-making for stratification in the housing context.",

          "authors": "Krista M. Brumley, Shirin Montazer, Laura Pineault, Katheryn Maguire, Boris Baltes",
          "abstract": "The study investigates the association of the extent of remote work with men’s and women’s behavioral work-family conflict and their partners’ behavioral work-family conflict. The authors examine if these effects vary by parental status. Analyses of survey data from 343 U.S. dual-earning couples collected during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic show that among couples with children, their extent of remote work is positively associated with both their own and their partners’ behavioral family-to-work conflict but is not associated with their own or their partners’ behavioral work-to-family conflict. For child-free couples, findings show that their extent of remote work does not affect their own work-family conflict (bidirectional). For child-free women only, behavioral work-to-family and family-to-work conflict increase as a function of their partners’ extent of remote work. The authors offer insights into potential policy for work organizations, including benefits that provide time or financial assistance to help employees manage family obligations that might interfere with work.",

          "abstract": "This visualization illustrates patterns of income pooling among German couples using longitudinal data from the German Family Panel (pairfam), examining variations across cohorts born in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and among different partnership types. The findings reveal that marriage is much more strongly associated with income pooling than cohabitation or living-apart-together arrangements. A generational shift is evident: Younger cohorts are less likely to pool finances, even within marriage. The visualization suggests increasing financial independence in intimate relationships over cohorts, reflecting broader societal shifts toward individualism.",

          "authors": "Ellen Berrey, Alex Hanna, Nathan Kim, Kristen Bass",
          "abstract": "The authors describe protest patterns at U.S. and Canadian universities in the 2010s. The research draws on a new dataset, the Higher Ed Protest Event Dataset, which combines machine learning and sociological hand coding of 16,069 campus newspaper articles. The sample consists of 5,553 higher ed protests involving 584 universities and colleges between 2012 and 2018. The dataset also includes university and police responses to a subset of protests. The authors find that protest frequency is patterned by the academic calendar. The top issue in both U.S. and Canadian higher education protests was university administration and governance. The comparative analysis reveals distinctive patterns in other issues raised and protest intensity. In the United States, the periods of greatest protest activity were waves of mass mobilization across the country on often racialized issues with a national dimension: racist police violence, racially hostile campus climates, and Donald Trump’s presidency. In Canada, protest activity was most intense during provincial or local campaigns led by formal student organizations and unions on issues of economic security: public tuition, austerity, and labor conditions. Across both countries, university administrations and police usually avoided extensive intervention during protests. The findings contribute to social movements research through methodological innovations and new empirical insights on movements in higher education.",

          "abstract": "A majority of German households are occupied by renters. There are indications of growing inequality through disproportional income increases among high-income households and disproportional rent increases among low-income households. On the basis of the German Socio-Economic Panel, the author examines rent-income ratios (RIRs) and differentiates between migrants and natives. How did RIRs develop between 1990 and 2020, and are there any differences across the distribution? There are three key findings. First, dynamics of RIRs suggest rising economic inequality among both migrants and natives. Second, although both groups grew more unequal over time, the inequality increase was stronger among migrants. Third, migrants generally faced steeper rent hikes than natives, which partly accounts for a higher rent burden among income-poor migrants. These descriptive findings point out avenues for systematic research of the increases in inequality related to rent and income dynamics and their ethnoracial stratification.",
