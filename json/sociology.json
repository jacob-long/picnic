          "title": "Time’s Up? How Temporal Maps of Climate Change Shape Climate Action",
          "authors": "Ioana Sendroiu, Amalia Álvarez-Benjumea, Fabian Winter",
          "abstract": "We track how temporal mappings of climate change relate to individuals’ actions to address the climate crisis. We consider multiple aspects of temporal maps and so make two innovations over the literature to date. First, we examine how individuals coordinate their actions across both their own expectations of the future (first-order futures) and their sense of others’ expectations (second-order futures). Second, we examine past effects of climate change, as well as the turning points past which respondents believe climate change can no longer be addressed. We show how both everyday actions, such as recycling, and political behaviors, such as protesting, are coordinated across these temporal maps, conceptualized as beliefs about past, present, and future, and the turning points across them. A core finding is that individuals’ own concern about the climate future is associated with increased climate action, whereas believing others to be concerned depreciates individuals’ own climate action. This study is therefore a conceptual contribution to understanding action and temporality, while also providing empirical insight into how individuals navigate the climate crisis.",

          "title": "Religion, Perceptions of Scientists’ Moral Culture, and Support for Science in the United States",
          "authors": "Timothy L. O’Brien, Shiri Noy",
          "abstract": "How do perceptions of scientists’ moral values relate to support for science in society? Recent advances in the sociology of science and religion suggest that people associate scientists with moral values in addition to factual knowledge, and that concerns about scientists’ morality are why members of some religious groups are more critical of science than non-religious people. We test this theory using data from a probability sample of U.S. adults that includes new measures of beliefs about scientists’ moral values, such as their compassion, fairness, and generosity ( n = 1,513). Results from structural equation models indicate that active members of all religious groups are, to varying degrees, more skeptical than atheists and agnostics of scientists’ moral character. A decomposition of direct and indirect effects indicates that beliefs about scientists’ moral values play an intermediary role in the relationship between religion and support for science, and that support for science among the religious is partially suppressed by their concerns about scientists’ morality. This article offers the first direct evidence of the moral culture the U.S. public associates with scientists. We suggest that religious differences in support for organized science reflect religious differences in beliefs about scientists’ moral values.",

          "authors": "Paulina Erices-Ocampo, Miranda J. Lubbers, jimi adams",
          "abstract": "Social capital is among the most broadly used concepts in social science. Despite its shared understanding as beneficial resources available from the connections between people, authors vary widely in their conceptualizations of social capital. To extract clarity from these disparate perspectives, we offer a systematic framework for conceptualizing social capital, which identifies three primary theoretical dimensions of scholars’ conceptualizations of social capital: ( a ) where beneficial resources reside, ranging from within individuals to the relationships between individuals; ( b ) beneficial network structure, differentiating closure from brokerage arrangements; and ( c ) the level to which rewards accrue, distinguishing individual from collective benefits. We illustrate how combining these dimensions produces a unifying perspective that fosters reintegrating social capital's disconnected conceptualizations. Finally, we draw on this framework to both reconcile seeming contradictions and gaps in social capital scholarship, and provide a principled means for prioritizing questions for future developments of social capital.",

          "title": "Black and White Wealth Differentials in the United States: Explaining and Recreating Persistent Inequality",
          "authors": "Fenaba R. Addo, Daniel Auguste",
          "abstract": "This review explores research on the sources of Black and White wealth and debt differentials and how these differentials recreate inequalities in both wealth and nonwealth outcomes. We discuss how the relationship between wealth and life outcomes is bidirectional, yet studies of racial wealth inequality overwhelmingly focus on wealth as an outcome. We suggest that studies that examine the relationship from wealth to life outcomes are necessary to enable full understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the production and reproduction of racial wealth inequality and to identify policies in the United States to reduce racial inequality. We highlight research on entrepreneurship, race, and wealth to illustrate these dynamics. We conclude with a call for scholars to focus on community-level wealth, given scholarly and policy interests in closing the racial wealth gap.",

          "title": "Deep Learning With DAGs",
          "authors": "Sourabh Balgi, Adel Daoud, Jose M. Peña, Geoffrey T. Wodtke, Jesse Zhou",
          "abstract": "Social science theories often postulate systems of causal relationships among variables, which are commonly represented using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). As non-parametric causal models, DAGs require no assumptions about the functional form of the hypothesized relationships. Nevertheless, to simplify empirical evaluation, researchers typically invoke such assumptions anyway, even though they are often arbitrary and do not reflect any theoretical content or prior knowledge. Moreover, functional form assumptions can engender bias, whenever they fail to accurately capture the true complexity of the system. In this article, we introduce causal-graphical normalizing flows (cGNFs), a novel approach to causal inference that leverages deep neural networks to empirically evaluate theories represented as DAGs. Unlike conventional methods, cGNFs model the full joint distribution of the data using a DAG specified by the analyst, without relying on stringent assumptions about functional form. This enables flexible, non-parametric estimation of any causal estimand identified from the DAG, including total effects, direct and indirect effects, and path-specific effects. We illustrate the method with a reanalysis of Blau and Duncan’s ( 1967 ) model of status attainment and Zhou’s ( 2019 ) model of controlled mobility. The article concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for future development.",

          "authors": "Wonjeong Jeong",
          "abstract": "Examining couples as joint decision makers offers valuable insights into gender disparities, yet the literature has largely overlooked the transition to a key alternative work arrangement: self-employment. Using couple-matched data from the 2015–2024 Current Population Survey, the author investigates how the collective decisions of couples are linked to the shift toward self-employment and how these patterns are moderated by parenthood and occupational characteristics. The author finds that wives are more likely to move from wage employment to self-employment if their husbands work long hours. Although this tendency is not moderated by parenthood, the association between husbands’ long hours on encouraging wives’ self-employment is stronger when wives are in occupations with strong overwork norms. This work underscores the option of self-employment for women when the demand for flexibility is heightened because of partners’ long work hours while the potential supply for flexibility is limited because of occupational norms.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this study is to understand mental well-being differences among cisgender, transgender, and nonbinary people in Colombia. On the one hand, the authors quantify the importance of economic and social resources in explaining such differences. On the other hand, they document the role played by experiences of discrimination. The authors use two different datasets to achieve these goals. First, they use nonprobabilistic data from the Williams Institute, which surveyed a large number of transgender and nonbinary people. The authors compare these individuals’ well-being with that of cisgender nonheterosexual people. Second, the authors use probabilistic data from the Colombian Drug Use Survey to replicate the main results and to compare with cisgender heterosexual individuals. The authors find that social and economic resources have limited power explaining well-being differences among cisgender, transgender, and nonbinary people in both samples. Instead, experiences of discrimination and violence mediate a large part of the association between gender identity and well-being among the LGBTQ sample.",

          "abstract": "Despite initial declines in fertility since the onset of the pandemic, less is known about how fertility intentions are related to pandemic-based stressors in the United States. The authors examine the following two questions. First, how are pandemic stressors associated with short-term fertility intentions? Second, among those delaying fertility, what are the rationales for doing so, and how are pandemic stressors related to these rationales? The authors draw on the National Couples’ Health and Time Study, a nationally representative sample of 20- to 50-year-olds in the United States who were married or cohabiting and interviewed between September 2020 and April 2021. Among those desiring or remaining open to having (more) children, experiencing pandemic-related stressors was associated with delays in fertility plans; those whose lives were most disrupted and those who experienced relationship stress were less likely to intend to have children in the next year. The most common rationale for not intending to have children in the next year was economic worries, followed by health worries and concerns about an uncertain future. Economic and health stress were linked to these rationales, net of objective indicators. A comprehensive assessment of fertility intentions and underlying rationale for intentions on the basis of subjective factors is critical for understanding fertility patterns.",
