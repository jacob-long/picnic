          "title": "Keeping the Family Fortune: How Bureaucratic Practices Preserve Elite Multigenerational Wealth",
          "authors": "Doron Shiffer-Sebba",
          "abstract": "How do wealthy families preserve their fortunes across generations? A historic peak in wealth inequality in the United States has inspired research on how economic elites benefit from markets, tax rates, and legal entities. However, the ongoing practices through which families maintain their fortunes across generations are less understood. Using six months of ethnographic observations at a wealth manager for the top 0.1 percent, as well as interviews with the manager’s clients and a wider sample of managers, I argue that wealthy families adopt what I call “bureaucratic practices”—activities like meetings, presentations, and signing documents—to preserve wealth intergenerationally. After erecting legal entities such as corporations, trusts, and foundations, wealth managers help wealthy families implement bureaucratic practices. These practices, which privilege bureaucratic form over substance, constitute a crucial behavioral layer atop the legal infrastructure, facilitating a greater degree of wealth preservation compared with using entities alone. Thus, preserving wealth at the top should be understood not merely as a set of discrete transfers from parents to children, but as an enduring multigenerational process of professional socialization that introduces new behaviors into family life.",

          "authors": "Neda Maghbouleh",
          "abstract": "Research on Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) populations in the United States has been shaped by a fundamental paradox: MENAs are statistically invisible in the administrative data infrastructure yet socially hypervisible in other domains. This review outlines key demographic characteristics of the MENA American population and argues that by addressing the invisibility/hypervisibility paradox through innovative research questions and methods, previous scholarship has advanced sociology in three areas: identity, racialization, and integration. As upcoming changes to federal race and ethnicity standards take effect, the invisibility/hypervisibility paradox may shift as sociologists more easily collect and analyze data about MENA Americans. However, this information may be misused, misinterpreted, or handled unethically without sufficient background context and responsibility to community members. Future research will require data disaggregation to explore intersectional and intragroup minority issues, examination of the evolving content and meaning of MENA panethnicity, and ongoing assessment of the MENA group's relative racial position.",

          "authors": "Tobias Rüttenauer, Felix Bader, Ingmar Ehler, Henning Best",
          "abstract": "Despite ongoing debates on environmental justice, the link between selective residential migration and the unequal exposure to environmental hazards remains underexplored. Previous research has often relied on spatially aggregated data and focused on single-country analyses, limiting our understanding of broader patterns. We address this gap using longitudinal household-level data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the German Socio-Economic Panel linked to air pollution estimates (NO2, PM2.5, and SO2). We find that immigrant minorities are exposed to higher levels of air pollution at their place of residence. The overall disadvantage faced by immigrant minorities in England is three times as large as in Germany. Given that immigrant households start under initially higher levels of air pollution, one would expect convergence with non-immigrant populations over time due to residential moves. However, immigrants face a substantial penalty when moving. If native households started in similar neighborhoods as immigrants—the relevant counterfactual—they would experience higher gains from relocation. Socio-economic factors cannot explain these differences. The pattern holds in both England and Germany, although inequalities in residential mobility are more pronounced in England. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities, such as Bangladeshi, Caribbean, and African migrants in England and Turkish migrants in Germany, experience the largest environmental disadvantages.",

          "title": "The religion of White identity politics: Christian nationalism and White racial solidarity",
          "authors": "Samuel L Perry, Joshua B Grubbs",
          "abstract": "Though recent research on White racial solidarity has advanced our understanding of White identity politics in the United States, the religious underpinnings of White identity politics remain understudied. Building on the documented conflation of religious, racial, and national identities among White Americans, we propose American Christian nationalism is best thought of as the religion of White identity politics. Drawing on nationally representative data with a strong, novel measure of Christian nationalism and tested measures of racial solidarity, we find Christian nationalism is among the leading predictors of racial solidarity but solely among White Americans. Specifically, Christian nationalism among (only) White Americans predicts greater racial identity salience, believing their racial group has a lot to be proud of, that their racial group members share much in common, and that it is important for their racial group members to work together to change laws unfair to their racial group. The result is that while Black and Hispanic Americans on average score higher on indicators of racial consciousness and solidarity than White Americans, at higher levels of Christian nationalism, White Americans become indistinguishable from their Black and Hispanic counterparts. Moreover, among Black Americans, Christian nationalism is negatively associated with the belief that Black people should work together to change laws unfair to Black people, suggesting that while Christian nationalism increases or reflects White racial solidarity motivating White identity politics, it may weaken Black Americans’ motivation to advocate for Black Americans in politics.",

          "title": "Overstatement of GDP growth in autocracies and the recent decline in global inequality",
          "authors": "Roshan K Pandian",
          "abstract": "After rising for almost two centuries, global income inequality declined substantially after 2000. While past scholarship on global inequality has explored several causes for this recent decline in inequality, these studies take for granted the official GDP figures released by national governments. A parallel social science literature has documented the manipulation of official data to exaggerate economic performance in autocratic countries, but this work has stopped short of examining the broader implications of this phenomenon. In this study, I explore the overstatement of GDP growth figures in autocracies as another contributor to the recent decline in estimates of global inequality based on officially reported GDP figures. Drawing on satellite-based night-time lights data and an empirical strategy from recent research, I compute model-based estimates of GDP overstatement in autocracies. I then combine this information with data on within-country income inequality to arrive at adjusted estimates of global income inequality in a sample of 109 countries constituting 92 percent of the world’s population. I find that between 1995 and 2014, ~20 percent of the decline in global inequality can be explained by the overstatement of GDP growth in less democratic countries. I conclude by discussing the broader implications of these findings for our understanding of global inequality and its political economy.",

          "authors": "Samuel Stroope, Rachel J Bacon, Michael S Barton, Elizabeth E Brault, Rhiannon A Kroeger, Joseph O Baker",
          "abstract": "Institutional anomie theory (IAT) posits that religion is a social institution that influences crime, yet religion has been relatively neglected in empirical research on IAT. We elaborate the role of religion within IAT, methodologically differentiate religious traditions, and empirically test hypotheses regarding local religious ecologies and community homicide over time in the United States. In analyses of county-level panel data, we find that increases in the evangelical Protestant adherent rate are directly associated with increases in homicide rates, while increases in the Catholic adherent rate are directly associated with decreases in homicide rates. Using spatial analysis to examine spillover effects from adjacent locations, increases in the Catholic adherent rate and the evangelical Protestant adherent rate are indirectly associated with increases in homicide, while increases in the mainline Protestant adherent rate are indirectly associated with decreases in homicide. The total effect (both direct and indirect) for changes in the evangelical Protestant adherent rate is the largest in the model. In sum, elaborating and extending IAT, this study theorizes and then demonstrates the importance of differentiating between specific religious traditions for understanding spatial and temporal patterns in crime.",

          "title": "Remote/hybrid work in flux: work-place/preference mismatch and adaptations",
          "authors": "Wen Fan, Phyllis Moen",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented employer-driven shift to remote/hybrid work for those whose jobs allow it, but then came retrenchments, forging disjunctures between where one works (remote/hybrid or in-person) and individual preferences, which we term work-place mismatch. We draw on a combined worker power, employer biases, and adaptive strategy theoretical framing to investigate work-place mismatch in light of remarkable pandemic-precipitated shifts in place of work, opening up possibilities (and preferences) for remote/hybrid arrangements. In addition to examining inequities in work-place mismatch, we theorize employees’ possible adaptive strategies when confronting such mismatch—shifting where they work, changing their locational preferences, or intending to leave or actually leaving their employer. Using a nationally representative four-wave panel (October 2020–April 2022) of US employees who worked fully or partially remotely during the pandemic, we find that work-place mismatch is widespread, especially among those returning to on-site work. Hispanics, Black men, and those lacking a college degree are most likely to experience unfulfilled interest (mismatch) in remote work. Structurally disadvantaged mismatched workers also experience constrained strategies—less apt to change their work location or quit relative to white or college-educated workers.",

          "authors": "Jesse Callahan Bryant, J. Tom Mueller, Paul Berne Burow",
          "abstract": "This study shows that populist attitudes are associated with reduced tolerance for political violence in rural areas of the United States. Using a representative sample from rural counties in the American West, the authors advance conceptual frameworks in populism studies and address the challenges of measuring social phenomena in rural areas. Using structural equation modeling and a “bare bones” measure of populism, the authors test hypotheses on links between economic and sociocultural grievances, ideological conservatism, populist attitudes, and tolerance for political violence. The findings confirm associations among economic grievances, conservatism, and populist attitudes, while showing that populism attenuates the link between economic grievance and tolerance for political violence. Thus, this study reveals an unexpected ideological role of populist attitudes in diminishing support for political violence. This advances sociological understanding of how populism interacts with broader ideological systems in the United States and draws greater attention to how political concepts are operationalized empirically.",

          "abstract": "This visualization explores age-specific digital platform use among the German population, aged 18 to 74 years, using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Innovation Sample. Focusing on time spent on social media, we show that nearly everyone uses digital platforms on a regular basis, with younger users spending significantly more time online. Moreover, YouTube is quite popular across all age groups, while younger users spend more time on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. Focusing on subjective reasons for digital platform use, we show that younger individuals place more emphasis on information than on entertainment and state more often that they are actively posting, commenting, or sharing content, while older age groups are predominantly passive consumers on digital platforms.",

Specifically, the authors highlight the demographic mismatch between the school-age population and the teaching workforce that persists for all non-White groups. The rapidly diversifying, multiethnic school-age population highlighted by the 2020 census combined with the persistent, predominantly White teacher population continues to remain a concerning issue given the multifaceted benefits of student-teacher demographic match for students from minoritized backgrounds. Recruitment and retention of a diverse teaching workforce that mirrors the school-age population must remain a core education policy priority in the coming decades.",
