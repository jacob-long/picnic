          "abstract": "To survive in dynamic environments with uncertain resources, animals must adapt their behaviour flexibly, choosing strategies such as persevering with a current choice, exploring alternatives or disengaging altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal strategies during such decisions 1–5 . However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioural strategies such as persevering, exploring or disengaging remain poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub that is critical for flexible switching between behavioural strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations, fibre photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behaviours, we found that the main cell types of the MRN—GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic (VGluT2 + ) and serotonergic neurons—have complementary functions and regulate perseverance, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons—for instance, through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus, which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN—leads to perseverative behaviour. By contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2 + neurons drives exploration. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula that conveys negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioural switchboard that is uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioural strategies. These circuits thus may also have an important role in the aetiology of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders.",

          "abstract": "For decades, antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex class I for T cell-mediated immunity has been considered the primary function of proteasome-derived peptides1,2. However, whether the products of proteasomal degradation play additional parts in mounting immune responses remains unknown. Antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of defence against invading pathogens before the adaptive immune system responds. Although the protective function of antimicrobial peptides across numerous tissues is well established, the cellular mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. Here we uncover a role for proteasomes in the constitutive and bacterial-induced generation of defence peptides that impede bacterial growth both in vitro and in vivo by disrupting bacterial membranes. In silico prediction of proteome-wide proteasomal cleavage identified hundreds of thousands of potential proteasome-derived defence peptides with cationic properties that may be generated en route to degradation to act as a first line of defence. Furthermore, bacterial infection induces changes in proteasome composition and function, including PSME3 recruitment and increased tryptic-like cleavage, enhancing antimicrobial activity. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into the role of proteasomes in cell-autonomous innate immunity, our study suggests that proteasome-cleaved peptides may have previously overlooked functions downstream of degradation. From a translational standpoint, identifying proteasome-derived defence peptides could provide an untapped source of natural antibiotics for biotechnological applications and therapeutic interventions in infectious diseases and immunocompromised conditions.",

          "abstract": "More than ten ergot alkaloids comprising both natural and semi-synthetic products are used to treat various diseases1,2. The central C ring forms the core pharmacophore for ergot alkaloids, giving them structural similarity to neurotransmitters, thus enabling their modulation of neurotransmitter receptors3. The haem catalase chanoclavine synthase (EasC) catalyses the construction of this ring through complex radical oxidative cyclization4. Unlike canonical catalases, which catalyse H2O2 disproportionation5,6, EasC and its homologues represent a broader class of catalases that catalyse O2-dependent radical reactions4,7. We have elucidated the structure of EasC by cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH)-binding pocket and a haem pocket common to all haem catalases, with a unique homodimeric architecture that is, to our knowledge, previously unobserved. The substrate prechanoclavine unprecedentedly binds in the NADPH-binding pocket, instead of the previously suspected haem-binding pocket, and two pockets were connected by a slender tunnel. Contrary to the established mechanisms, EasC uses superoxide rather than the more generally used transient haem iron–oxygen complexes (such as compounds I, II and III)8,9, to mediate substrate transformation through superoxide-mediated cooperative catalysis of the two distant pockets. We propose that this reactive oxygen species mechanism could be widespread in metalloenzyme-catalysed reactions.",

          "abstract": "Recent evidence shows elevated circulating long-chain ceramide levels predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) independently of cholesterol1,2. Although targeting ceramide signaling may provide therapeutic benefits beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, the underlying mechanism by which circulating ceramides aggravate ASCVD remains elusive. We examined whether circulating long-chain ceramides activate membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to exacerbate atherosclerosis. We performed a systematic screen combining G protein signaling quantification, bioinformatic analysis of GPCRs expression, and functional examination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the results suggested CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 are potential endogenous receptors of C16:0 ceramide-evoked inflammasome activation in both endothelial cells and macrophages. We found that inhibiting CYSLTR2/P2RY6 genetically or pharmacologically alleviated ceramide-induced atherosclerosis aggravation. Additionally, increased ceramide levels correlated with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Notably, CYSLTR2/P2RY6 deficiency mitigated chronic kidney disease (CKD)-aggravated atherosclerosis in mice, without affecting cholesterol or ceramide levels. Structural analysis of the ceramide-CYSLTR2-Gq complexes revealed that both C16:0 and C20:0 ceramides bind within an inclined channel-like ligand binding pocket on CYSLTR2. We further revealed an unconventional mechanism underlying ceramides-induced CYSLTR2 activation and CYSLTR2-Gq interface. Overall, our study provided structural and molecular mechanisms that long-chain ceramides initiate transmembrane Gq and inflammasome signaling through directly binding to CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 receptors, and blocking these signaling may provide new therapeutic potential to treat atherosclerosis-related diseases.",

          "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that the emergence of stone tool technology occurred before the appearance of the genus Homo1 and may potentially be traced back deep into the primate evolutionary line2. Conversely, osseous technologies are apparently exclusive of later hominins from approximately 2 million years ago (Ma)3,4, whereas the earliest systematic production of bone tools is currently restricted to European Acheulean sites 400–250 thousand years ago5,6. Here we document an assemblage of bone tools shaped by knapping found within a single stratigraphic horizon at Olduvai Gorge dated to 1.5 Ma. Large mammal limb bone fragments, mostly from hippopotamus and elephant, were shaped to produce various tools, including massive elongated implements. Before our discovery, bone artefact production in pre-Middle Stone Age African contexts was widely considered as episodic, expedient and unrepresentative of early Homo toolkits. However, our results demonstrate that at the transition between the Oldowan and the early Acheulean, East African hominins developed an original cultural innovation that entailed a transfer and adaptation of knapping skills from stone to bone. By producing technologically and morphologically standardized bone tools, early Acheulean toolmakers unravelled technological repertoires that were previously thought to have appeared routinely more than 1 million years later.",

          "abstract": "Pan-genomics and genome-editing technologies are revolutionizing breeding of global crops 1,2 . A transformative opportunity lies in exchanging genotype-to-phenotype knowledge between major crops (that is, those cultivated globally) and indigenous crops (that is, those locally cultivated within a circumscribed area) 3–5 to enhance our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desirable natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between related crops 6,7 . Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum 8 and integrating functional genomics and pan-genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, thousands of gene duplications, particularly within key domestication gene families, exhibited dynamic trajectories in sequence, expression and function. By augmenting our pan-genome with African eggplant cultivars 9 and applying quantitative genetics and genome editing, we dissected an intricate history of paralogue evolution affecting fruit size. The loss of a redundant paralogue of the classical fruit size regulator CLAVATA3 ( CLV3 ) 10,11 was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy, followed by a large cultivar-specific deletion, created a single fused CLV3 allele that modulates fruit organ number alongside an enzymatic gene controlling the same trait. Our findings demonstrate that paralogue diversifications over short timescales are underexplored contingencies in trait evolvability. Exposing and navigating these contingencies is crucial for translating genotype-to-phenotype relationships across species.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian behaviour and physiology undergo major changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their needs and start showing nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions at weaning and puberty, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviours develop during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioural control have been identified 1–6 . These data show a marked diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioural or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including early diversification, perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and refinement of signalling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide new insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviours and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.",

          "abstract": "Tropical forest canopies are the biosphere’s most concentrated atmospheric interface for carbon, water and energy 1,2 . However, in most Earth System Models, the diverse and heterogeneous tropical forest biome is represented as a largely uniform ecosystem with either a singular or a small number of fixed canopy ecophysiological properties 3 . This situation arises, in part, from a lack of understanding about how and why the functional properties of tropical forest canopies vary geographically 4 . Here, by combining field-collected data from more than 1,800 vegetation plots and tree traits with satellite remote-sensing, terrain, climate and soil data, we predict variation across 13 morphological, structural and chemical functional traits of trees, and use this to compute and map the functional diversity of tropical forests. Our findings reveal that the tropical Americas, Africa and Asia tend to occupy different portions of the total functional trait space available across tropical forests. Tropical American forests are predicted to have 40% greater functional richness than tropical African and Asian forests. Meanwhile, African forests have the highest functional divergence—32% and 7% higher than that of tropical American and Asian forests, respectively. An uncertainty analysis highlights priority regions for further data collection, which would refine and improve these maps. Our predictions represent a ground-based and remotely enabled global analysis of how and why the functional traits of tropical forest canopies vary across space.",

          "abstract": "Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics1,2,3,4,5,6. Experimental efforts so far have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials—typically amorphous metals—and semiconducting quantum Hall7,8,9,10,11 or quantum anomalous Hall12,13 systems. However, the strong interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes14,15,16,17. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials in which the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling ν = −1 as well as a superconducting state at ν ≈ −3.5 at zero magnetic field. Gate voltage can also be used to actuate non-volatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state18, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further show a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at ν = 2/3 (ref. 19)—also stable at zero magnetic field—enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers20,21,22, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket20,21,22,23,24, while leaving the topology of the ν = −1 quantum anomalous Hall state intact.

Floating point (FP) computation provides precision exceeding that of integer (INT) formats at the cost of higher power and storage overhead. Multi-level-cell (MLC) memristor compute-in-memory (CIM)13,14,15 provides compact non-volatile storage and energy-efficient computation but is prone to accuracy loss owing to process variation. Digital static random-access memory (SRAM)-CIM16,17,18,19,20,21,22 enables lossless computation; however, storage is low as a result of large bit-cell area and model loading is required during inference. Thus, conventional approaches using homogeneous CIM architectures and computation formats impose a trade-off between efficiency, storage, wakeup latency and inference accuracy. Here we present a mixed-precision heterogeneous CIM AI edge processor, which supports the layer-granular/kernel-granular partitioning of network layers among on-chip CIM architectures (that is, memristor-CIM, SRAM-CIM and tiny-digital units) and computation number formats (INT and FP) based on sensitivity to error.

This is primarily because knowledge of thermal tolerance is taxonomically and geographically biased 3 , compromising global climate vulnerability assessments. Here we used a phylogenetically informed data-imputation approach to predict the heat tolerance of 60% of amphibian species and assessed their vulnerability to daily temperature variations in thermal refugia. We found that 104 out of 5,203 species (2%) are currently exposed to overheating events in shaded terrestrial conditions. Despite accounting for heat-tolerance plasticity, a 4 °C global temperature increase would create a step change in impact severity, pushing 7.5% of species beyond their physiological limits. In the Southern Hemisphere, tropical species encounter disproportionally more overheating events, while non-tropical species are more susceptible in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings challenge evidence for a general latitudinal gradient in overheating risk 4–6 and underscore the importance of considering climatic variability in vulnerability assessments. We provide conservative estimates assuming access to cool shaded microenvironments. Thus, the impacts of global warming will probably exceed our projections. Our microclimate-explicit analyses demonstrate that vegetation and water bodies are critical in buffering amphibians during heat waves. Immediate action is needed to preserve and manage these microhabitat features.",

          "abstract": "Tropical deforestation was found to cause large reductions in precipitation using a range of observation-based datasets1. However, the limitations of satellite-based space-for-time statistical analysis have hindered understanding of the roles of reshaped mesoscale atmospheric circulation and regional precipitation recycling at different scales. These effects are considered nonlocal effects, which are distinct from the local effects governed by deforestation-induced reductions in evapotranspiration (ET). Here we show reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation across wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, deforested grids experienced a noteworthy increase in precipitation (0.96 mm month−1 per percentage point forest loss), primarily attributed to enhanced mesoscale atmospheric circulation (that is, nonlocal effect). These nonlocal increases weaken with distance from deforested grids, leading to significant precipitation reductions in buffers beyond 60 km. Conversely, during the dry season, precipitation decreases in deforested grids and throughout all analysis buffers, with local effects from reduced ET dominating. Our findings highlight the intricate balance between local effects and nonlocal effects in driving deforestation–precipitation responses across different seasons and scales and emphasize the urgent need to address the rapid and extensive loss of forest in the Amazon region.",

          "abstract": "A supersolid is a counter-intuitive phase of matter in which its constituent particles are arranged into a crystalline structure, yet they are free to flow without friction. This requires the particles to share a global macroscopic phase while being able to reduce their total energy by spontaneous, spatial self-organization. The existence of the supersolid phase of matter was speculated more than 50 years ago1,2,3,4. However, only recently has there been convincing experimental evidence, mainly using ultracold atomic Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) coupled to electromagnetic fields. There, various guises of the supersolid were created using atoms coupled to high-finesse cavities5,6, with large magnetic dipole moments7,8,9,10,11,12,13, and spin–orbit-coupled, two-component systems showing stripe phases14,15,16. Here we provide experimental evidence of a new implementation of the supersolid phase in a driven-dissipative, non-equilibrium context based on exciton–polaritons condensed in a topologically non-trivial, bound state in the continuum (BiC) with exceptionally low losses, realized in a photonic-crystal waveguide. We measure the density modulation of the polaritonic state indicating the breaking of translational symmetry with a precision of several parts in a thousand. Direct access to the phase of the wavefunction allows us to also measure the local coherence of the supersolid. We demonstrate the potential of our synthetic photonic material to host phonon dynamics and a multimode excitation spectrum.",

Metastasizing cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, as they are initially deprived of the immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours 3 . There is interest in therapeutically exploiting this immune vulnerability to prevent recurrence in patients with early cancer at risk of metastasis. Here we show that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), including aspirin, enhance immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 acts on T cells to trigger an immunosuppressive pathway that is dependent on the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases. Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA 2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner that is dependent on T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA 2 in vivo. These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway that limits T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.",

          "abstract": "Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is widespread across eukaryotes and can promote adaptive evolution1,2,3,4. However, given the instability of newly formed polyploid genomes5,6,7, understanding how WGDs arise in a population, persist, and underpin adaptations remains a challenge. Here, using our ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE)8, we show that diploid snowflake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under selection for larger multicellular size rapidly evolve to be tetraploid. From their origin within the first 50 days of the experiment, tetraploids persisted for the next 950 days (nearly 5,000 generations, the current leading edge of our experiment) in 10 replicate populations, despite being genomically unstable. Using synthetic reconstruction, biophysical modelling and counter-selection, we found that tetraploidy evolved because it confers immediate fitness benefits under this selection, by producing larger, longer cells that yield larger clusters. The same selective benefit also maintained tetraploidy over long evolutionary timescales, inhibiting the reversion to diploidy that is typically seen in laboratory evolution experiments. Once established, tetraploidy facilitated novel genetic routes for adaptation, having a key role in the evolution of macroscopic multicellular size via the origin of evolutionarily conserved aneuploidy. These results provide unique empirical insights into the evolutionary dynamics and impacts of WGD, showing how it can initially arise due to its immediate adaptive benefits, be maintained by selection and fuel long-term innovations by creating additional dimensions of heritable genetic variation.",

          "abstract": "Seawater electrolysis powered by renewable electricity provides an attractive strategy for producing green hydrogen1,2,3,4,5. However, direct seawater electrolysis faces many challenges, primarily arising from corrosion and competing reactions at the anode caused by the abundance of halide ions (Cl−, Br−) in seawater6. Previous studies3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 on seawater electrolysis have mainly focused on the anode development, because the cathode operates at reducing potentials, which is not subject to electrode dissolution or chloride corrosion reactions during seawater electrolysis11,15. However, renewable energy sources are intermittent, variable and random, which cause frequent start–shutdown operations if renewable electricity is used to drive seawater electrolysis. Here we first unveil dynamic evolution and degradation of seawater splitting cathode in intermittent electrolysis and, accordingly, propose construction of a catalyst’s passivation layer to maintain the hydrogen evolution performance during operation. An in situ-formed phosphate passivation layer on the surface of NiCoP–Cr2O3 cathode can effectively protect metal active sites against oxidation during frequent discharge processes and repel halide ion adsorption on the cathode during shutdown conditions. We demonstrate that electrodes optimized using this design strategy can withstand fluctuating operation at 0.5 A cm−2 for 10,000 h in alkaline seawater, with a voltage increase rate of only 0.5% khr−1. The newly discovered challenge and our proposed strategy herein offer new insights to facilitate the development of practical seawater splitting technologies powered by renewable electricity.",

Although extensively characterized using the laboratory mouse, little is known about clonal selection and population dynamics of the haematopoietic stem cell pool during murine ageing. We isolated stem cells and progenitors from young and old mice, identifying 221,890 somatic mutations genome-wide in 1,845 single-cell-derived colonies. Mouse stem cells and progenitors accrue approximately 45 somatic mutations per year, a rate only approximately threefold greater than human progenitors despite the vastly different organismal sizes and lifespans. Phylogenetic patterns show that stem and multipotent progenitor cell pools are established during embryogenesis, after which they independently self-renew in parallel over life, evenly contributing to differentiated progenitors and peripheral blood. The stem cell pool grows steadily over the mouse lifespan to about 70,000 cells, self-renewing about every 6 weeks. Aged mice did not display the profound loss of clonal diversity characteristic of human haematopoietic ageing. However, targeted sequencing showed small, expanded clones in the context of murine ageing, which were larger and more numerous following haematological perturbations, exhibiting a selection landscape similar to humans. Our data illustrate both conserved features of population dynamics of blood and distinct patterns of age-associated somatic evolution in the short-lived mouse.",

          "abstract": "The current opioid overdose epidemic highlights the urgent need to develop safer and more effective treatments for chronic pain1. Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is a promising non-opioid target for pain relief, but its clinical use has been limited by centrally mediated psychoactivity and tolerance. We overcame both issues by designing peripherally restricted CB1 agonists that minimize arrestin recruitment. We achieved these goals by computationally designing positively charged derivatives of the potent CB1 agonist MDMB-Fubinaca2. We designed these ligands to occupy a cryptic pocket identified through molecular dynamics simulations—an extended binding pocket that opens rarely and leads to the conserved signalling residue D2.50 (ref. 3). We used structure determination, pharmacological assays and molecular dynamics simulations to verify the binding modes of these ligands and to determine the molecular mechanism by which they achieve this dampening of arrestin recruitment. Our lead ligand, VIP36, is highly peripherally restricted and demonstrates notable efficacy in three mouse pain models, with 100-fold dose separation between analgesic efficacy and centrally mediated side effects. VIP36 exerts analgesic efficacy through peripheral CB1 receptors and shows limited analgesic tolerance. These results show how targeting a cryptic pocket in a G-protein-coupled receptor can lead to enhanced peripheral selectivity, biased signalling, desired in vivo pharmacology and reduced adverse effects. This has substantial implications for chronic pain treatment but could also revolutionize the design of drugs targeting other G-protein-coupled receptors.",

Here we use pairs of identical sequences to characterize fine-scale transmission patterns using 114,298 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected through Washington State (USA) genomic sentinel surveillance with associated age and residence location information between March 2021 and December 2022. This corresponds to 59,660 sequences with another identical sequence in the dataset. We find that the location of pairs of identical sequences is highly consistent with expectations from mobility and social contact data. Outliers in the relationship between genetic and mobility data can be explained by SARS-CoV-2 transmission between postcodes with male prisons, consistent with transmission between prison facilities. We find that transmission patterns between age groups vary across spatial scales. Finally, we use the timing of sequence collection to understand the age groups driving transmission. Overall, this study improves our ability to use large pathogen genome datasets to understand the determinants of infectious disease spread.",

          "abstract": "The phytohormone auxin (Aux) is a principal endogenous developmental signal in plants. It mediates transcriptional reprogramming by a well-established canonical signalling mechanism. TIR1/AFB auxin receptors are F-box subunits of an ubiquitin ligase complex; after auxin perception, they associate with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and ubiquitinate them for degradation, thus enabling the activation of auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors 1–3 . Here we revise this paradigm by showing that without TIR1 adenylate cyclase (AC) activity 4 , auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs is not sufficient to mediate the transcriptional auxin response. Abolishing the TIR1 AC activity does not affect auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs but renders TIR1 non-functional in mediating transcriptional reprogramming and auxin-regulated development, including shoot, root, root hair growth and lateral root formation. Transgenic plants show that local cAMP production in the vicinity of the Aux/IAA–ARF complex by unrelated AC enzymes bypasses the need for auxin perception and is sufficient to induce ARF-mediated transcription. These discoveries revise the canonical model of auxin signalling and establish TIR1/AFB-produced cAMP as a second messenger essential for transcriptional reprograming.",

The function of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell plasticity in tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution is poorly understood. Here we clarify the contribution of EMT to malignant progression in pancreatic cancer. We used somatic mosaic genome engineering technologies to trace and ablate malignant mesenchymal lineages along the EMT continuum. The experimental evidence clarifies the essential contribution of mesenchymal lineages to pancreatic cancer evolution. Spatial genomic analysis, single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of EMT clarifies its contribution to the emergence of genomic instability, including events of chromothripsis. Genetic ablation of mesenchymal lineages robustly abolished these mutational processes and evolutionary patterns, as confirmed by cross-species analysis of pancreatic and other human solid tumours. Mechanistically, we identified that malignant cells with mesenchymal features display increased chromatin accessibility, particularly in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions, in turn resulting in delayed mitosis and catastrophic cell division. Thus, EMT favours the emergence of genomic-unstable, highly fit tumour cells, which strongly supports the concept of cell-state-restricted patterns of evolution, whereby cancer cell speciation is propagated to progeny within restricted functional compartments. Restraining the evolutionary routes through ablation of clones capable of mesenchymal plasticity, and extinction of the derived lineages, halts the malignant potential of one of the most aggressive forms of human cancer.",

However, we know little on how temperature preference behaviour evolves during the colonization of new environments. Here we show that at least two distinct neurobiological mechanisms drive the evolution of temperature preference in flies of the genus Drosophila. Fly species from mild climates (D. melanogaster and D. persimilis) avoid both innocuous and noxious heat, and we show that the thermal activation threshold of the molecular heat receptor Gr28b.d precisely matches species-specific thresholds of behavioural heat avoidance. We find that desert-dwelling D. mojavensis are instead actively attracted to innocuous heat. Notably, heat attraction is also mediated by Gr28b.d (and by the antennal neurons that express it) and matches its threshold of heat activation. Rather, the switch in valence from heat aversion to attraction correlates with specific changes in thermosensory input to the lateral horn, the main target of central thermosensory pathways and a region of the fly brain implicated in the processing of innate valence1,2,3,4,5. Together, our results demonstrate that, in Drosophila, the adaptation to different thermal niches involves changes in thermal preference behaviour, and that this can be accomplished using distinct neurobiological solutions, ranging from shifts in the activation threshold of peripheral thermosensory receptor proteins to a substantial change in the way temperature valence is processed in the brain.",

Ecofriendly ZnSeTe QDs are an ideal alternative to cadmium-based blue QDs1,2, but face issues with colour impurity and inferior stability caused by the aggregated tellurium (Ten≥2) that dominates compositional inhomogeneity3,4. Here we developed an isoelectronic control strategy using congeneric sulfur coordinated with triphenyl phosphite (TPP-S) to construct homogeneous ZnSeTeS QDs with pure-blue emissions and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. TPP with low electron-donating capability promotes the reactivity balance among anionic precursors, favouring the growth of QDs with uniform composition. The acceptor-like S with high electronegativity weakens the hole localization of the Te atoms by interfering with their surrounding carriers, thereby suppressing the formation of Ten≥2 isoelectronic centres. Furthermore, the congeneric S increases the configurational entropy of the QDs and eliminates the stacking faults and oxygen defects, leading to improved structural stability and reduced non-radiative carrier density. Consequently, the resulting pure-blue QLEDs based on core–shell ZnSeTeS/ZnSe/ZnS QDs emitting at 460 nm show a high external quantum efficiency of 24.7%, a narrow linewidth of 17 nm, and long operational half-lifetime (T50) close to 30,000 hours at 100 cd cm−2, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue QLEDs.",

Although such approaches are highly valuable, they do not provide rigorous statistical detection of the temporal and spatial structure of Antarctic ozone recovery in the presence of internal climate variability. Here we apply pattern-based detection and attribution methods as used in climate-change studies5,6,7,8,9,10,11 to separate anthropogenically forced ozone responses from internal variability, relying on trend pattern information as a function of month and height. The analysis uses satellite observations together with single-model and multi-model ensemble simulations to identify and quantify the month–height Antarctic ozone recovery ‘fingerprint’12. We demonstrate that the data and simulations show compelling agreement in the fingerprint pattern of the ozone response to decreasing ODSs since 2005. We also show that ODS forcing has enhanced ozone internal variability during the austral spring, influencing detection of forced responses and their time of emergence. Our results provide robust statistical and physical evidence that actions taken under the Montreal Protocol to reduce ODSs are indeed resulting in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery, defined as increases in ozone consistent with expected month–height patterns.",

          "abstract": "Peptide hormones, a class of pharmacologically active molecules, have a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis. Prohormone convertase 1/3 (also known as PCSK1/3) represents a key enzymatic mechanism in peptide processing, as exemplified with the therapeutic target glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)1,2. However, the full spectrum of peptides generated by PCSK1 and their functional roles remain largely unknown. Here we use computational drug discovery to systematically map more than 2,600 previously uncharacterized human proteolytic peptide fragments cleaved by prohormone convertases, enabling the identification of novel bioactive peptides. Using this approach, we identified a 12-mer peptide, BRINP2-related peptide (BRP). When administered pharmacologically, BRP reduces food intake and exhibits anti-obesity effects in mice and pigs without inducing nausea or aversion. Mechanistically, BRP administration triggers central FOS activation and acts independently of leptin, GLP-1 receptor and melanocortin 4 receptor. Together, these data introduce a method to identify new bioactive peptides and establish pharmacologically that BRP may be useful for therapeutic modulation of body weight.",

          "abstract": "Mergers of binary neutron stars emit signals in both the gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic spectra. Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 (refs. 1,2 ) led to scientific discoveries across cosmology 3 , nuclear physics 4–6 and gravity 7 . Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from the GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated electromagnetic transient, AT 2017gfo (ref. 8 ), 11 h after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive electromagnetic observations. However, owing to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here we present a machine-learning framework that performs complete binary neutron star inference in just 1 s without making any such approximations. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing: (1) accurate localization even before the merger; (2) improved localization precision by around 30% compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (3) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors.",

          "abstract": "Bone tools excavated in Tanzania are the earliest known to be used by ancient humans.Credit: CSIC\n\nAncient humans consistently used bone tools at least one million years earlier than was previously thought.\n\n‘Truly gobsmacked’: Ancient-human genome count surpasses 10,000\n\nThe findings come from a study of bone tools discovered at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and dated to around 1.5 million years ago. The discovery joins other finds — such as a 1.4-million-year-old bone axe from Ethiopia — that suggest the human ancestor Homo erectus often used bones as tools.\n\nBone-tool culture is showing up in the archaeological record “much earlier than anyone thought possible”, says Michael Pante, a palaeontologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins who was not involved with the research. “It just speaks to this species having the ability to do things that no other species was able to do.” The findings were published1 on 5 March in Nature.\n\nTrench excavation\n\nTool use is a storied tradition among hominins. Members of the genus Australopithecus — which includes the famed fossil Lucy — were making stone tools at least 2.6 million years ago. Bone tools appear only much later in the human story, typically at sites in Europe and Asia around 400,000 years ago.\n\nThe Olduvai Gorge in the Great Rift Valley, Tanzania, has been the site of many fossil discoveries.Credit: Dietmar Rauscher/Alamy\n\nThe finds at Olduvai Gorge are among discoveries challenging that narrative. The region has a long history of fossil finds: specimens for the early hominin Homo habilis were discovered there in the 1960s, and researchers have found signs of bone tools in the area for years. Famed palaeoanthropologist Mary Leakey wrote about some of these findings but only partially published her results. This is, in part, because most bone tools were found outside their original context and so couldn’t be accurately dated.\n\nObjects found in carefully excavated trenches are easier to place in time and space. The latest findings are based on digs at Olduvai conducted between 2015 and 2022. Researchers spent several field seasons excavating trenches to study how technology changed when H. erectus — a small-brained predecessor to species including modern humans and Neanderthals — replaced H. habilis in the region, somewhere between 1.8 and 1.5 million years ago.\n\nTo shape bone tools, Homo erectus used a tactic similar to flinting stone.Credit: CSIC",

          "abstract": "There is a museum in Cambridge, on the corner of Spagnolo Street and Kleitman Avenue. The place is neatly preserved on the outside, just as it was a hundred years ago. It even goes by its original name: Little Shop of Dreams.\n\nI stumbled across it last month while visiting Maggie Sooth, a distinguished professor of real-life studies at the university. We catch up every few years, if we can, and take a spell in reality.\n\nDespite the winter drizzle, we had ventured outdoors, along the grey and empty streets, engrossed in conversation and neglectful of our surroundings. But as we strolled down Kleitman Avenue, its wet cobblestones slippery and difficult to walk on, the rain quickened, and we sheltered under an awning.\n\n“What’s that?” I asked, waving at a stone building across the road, indistinct through the hazy veil of the rain.\n\nMaggie flicked me a grin. “Oh, that’s Ground Zero,” she said. “Where the Theta Corporation tested the first dream incubation protocol. It’s the place that gave us dreaming-on-demand. Shall we go in? It’s a museum now.”\n\nNormally, I’m not one for real life; reality is only three-dimensional after all. Like most people, I prefer to see things properly curated in my dreams. But the rain was falling heavily, and I’ve never been entirely comfortable with nature’s raw elements.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“OK,” I said. So, we went inside, and marvellously back in time — for the place is crammed with antique curiosities of the human imagination.\n\nThere’s a little panelled-off section where you can try on those cloddish and nauseating headsets our great-great-grandparents so sweetly referred to as ‘Virtual Reality’. I did not like them, but Maggie said they reminded her of her childhood because she was a slow dreamer.\n\nThere’s also a large, dimmed room where you can sit and watch what they used to call a ‘movie’. We spent a few minutes in there, watching a flickering, two-dimensional projection about the sinking of a primitive passenger ship. I found it dreary and flat; but Maggie felt that the music had stood the test of time.\n\nElsewhere, to my surprise, we got to hold a book — a real book! — and each of us had a turn at folding over the genuine paper pages with our own hands. “Wow!” Maggie gasped. “Yes,” I said, “you can see why they stopped using these.”\n\nI am cynical about the past, I confess it. Undergoing first-hand the tedium of life as experienced by our forebears is, at best, a marvellous tutorial in the virtue of progress. There was one exhibit, however, that left me uneasy.\n\nOn the second floor of the Little Shop of Dreams they have recreated the original room in which Sophie Kanenas (“patient zero” as Maggie put it) lay when Spagnolo and Kleitman proved they could manufacture dreams.\n\nIn there, one can see the same kind of bed, the same old-style gelatinous electrodes, and an exact replica of the original brain modulation unit used to program the very first instantiation of a purposeful, pre-engineered, wakeful dream.\n\nFurthermore, because people so rarely visit, for a small fee you can lie down in that room, have the electrodes fastened to your own scalp, listen to the rhythmic hum of the brain modulator, and experience Sophie’s first dream exactly as she did.\n\nNaturally, I tried it out. It took only a few minutes. Stretched out upon the billet, my mind lulled into a theta state, I saw what Sophie saw:\n\nI was the emperor of China, sitting on a cushion behind a screen; a platter of delicacies on a lacquered table beside me …\n\nThere were silk screens on all sides, each intricately decorated with paintings of cranes and peacocks …\n\nBehind them, I could hear people moving and speaking …",

          "abstract": "Plaques (yellow-black) in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease contain amyloid-β, created by the breakdown of a protein called APP.Credit: Simon Fraser/Science Photo Library\n\nA protein involved in Alzheimer’s disease progression has been linked to normal brain ageing, raising the prospect that researchers could target it to stave off age-related mental decline.\n\nThe amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) helps to form links between the brain’s neurons. It has been highly studied because its breakdown creates amyloid-β peptides, which are often present in plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nWhat accelerates brain ageing? This AI ‘brain clock’ points to answers\n\nNow, Dario Valenzano, an evolutionary biologist at the Leibniz Institute on Aging in Jena, Germany, and his colleagues have found that knocking out the appa gene, which makes APP, in turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) reduces signs of ageing.\n\n“We found that there is probably an overlooked role of amyloid precursor protein in normal brain ageing,” says Valenzano. The work has not yet been peer reviewed and is posted on the bioRxiv preprint server1.\n\nRapid decline\n\nTurquoise killifish tend to live no more than about 9 months and exhibit rapid age-related brain decline. Valenzano’s team looked inside neurons of aged fish — those about 6 months old — and discovered an accumulation of APP derivatives, including a damaging type of amyloid-β, that aren’t present in 6-week-old fish.\n\nThis is different from what happens in Alzheimer’s disease, in which amyloid plaques form outside cells.\n\nHacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how\n\nThe researchers then looked at brain samples from people over 80 with and without Alzheimer’s disease. They found a similar accumulation of APP and amyloid-β inside cells in the cortex and the hippocampus in both healthy and diseased brains.\n\nNext, the team used CRISPR gene editing to breed killifish that don’t have the appa gene. Brain tissue studies showed that this slowed cell death and decreased brain inflammation in ageing fish. It also improved the age-related decline in neuronal activity and capacity for learning. “We see quite remarkable rescue of learning in elderly fish,” says Valenzano. “They learn in a way that’s more like younger fish.”\n\nThe team demonstrated this by training killifish to associate a burst of air bubbles with a light: when the light comes on, the fish must move away to avoid a bubble burst. The gene-edited fish learnt this faster than normal fish of the same age.",

          "authors": "Gemma Conroy",
          "abstract": "Resilience at work isn’t about wearing a suit of armour, but instead about learning when to persist and when to pivot.Credit: Getty\n\nMore than a decade ago, palaeoceanographer Summer Praetorius received some bad news: her mother had brain cancer. Praetorius was deep in her graduate studies at Oregon State University in Corvallis, but she somehow managed to juggle her mother’s care with her demanding workload. But in just a few short months, Praetorius’s mother died.\n\nIn the aftermath, Praetorius seemed like a picture of resilience to her colleagues as she continued to work and go to lectures. But beneath the surface she was torn between her grief and her desire to keep going with her graduate studies. The only way she felt she could stay on top of the demands of her studies was to shelve her emotions. “I often wanted to quit because I felt so run down and threadbare,” says Praetorius, who is now at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California. “But there wasn’t really the option.”\n\nHow a lupus diagnosis taught me that resilience in science is a double-edged sword\n\nPraetorius’s experience captures academia’s often misguided view of resilience — the ability to adapt and overcome challenges or adversity. Academia isn’t the only environment that encourages people to put on a brave face when the going gets tough — other workplaces show a similar cultural tendency. There’s no doubt that resilience is a necessary skill for dealing with the inevitable failure, rejection and fierce competition that comes with building a research career. Some institutions, including the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Imperial College London, are running courses that aim to help researchers to develop the resilience needed to navigate tough career challenges and maintain their well-being.\n\nBut some researchers say that the culture of academia is perpetuating harmful misconceptions about resilience, such as implying that researchers should ‘tough it out’ in a toxic environment. Others think that institutions need to do more to address systemic problems — such as low pay and a lack of inclusivity — before they place the onus on researchers to always weather the storm. “Instead of teaching people to dodge stones that we have thrown at them, it would be better not to throw stones from the very beginning,” says Roman Zviagintsev, an educational-equality researcher at the University of Vienna.\n\nWhat resilience is — and isn’t\n\nA simple definition of resilience is that “when something bad happens, it doesn’t derail you”, says David Yeager, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin. But this view has its limitations and underlies a lot of myths about resilience, such as equating it with suppressing negative emotions, adds Yeager. That approach, he says, often makes matters worse in the long run. “It’s a very poor emotion-regulation strategy,” says Yeager. Another harmful myth is that resilience is about continuing to work in environments in which inequity, disparity and bullying are rife, says Paul Seldon, a pharmacologist who runs an academic-resilience workshop at Imperial College London’s Early Career Research Institute (ECRI).\n\nThe expectation to live up to this version of resilience is familiar to Emily Wharton, a biomechanics researcher at Liverpool John Moores University, UK. On International Women’s Day in 2023, Wharton gave a presentation to her department about the issues students were facing regarding inclusivity, along with her own experiences. But a senior male colleague dismissed her concerns and struggled to understand where she was coming from. Although some other senior colleagues were supportive afterwards, most of them advised her not to share too much about her personal experiences. “I got told that I need to toughen up if I want to be in this world,” says Wharton. “Basically — I need to change,” rather than there being a shift in other people’s behaviour or the wider system, she says.\n\nPalaeoceanographer Summer Praetorius advises researchers to prioritize themselves during tough times.Credit: USGS\n\nBut true resilience isn’t about wearing a suit of armour to work or persisting with goals at the expense of mental health. Instead, it’s about making “calm, intentioned decisions in the face of setback and disappointment”, says Sharon Milgram, a biomedical researcher who heads the NIH’s Office of Intramural Training and Education (OITE) in Bethesda, Maryland. This often means setting boundaries and learning to say no to unreasonable demands or requests that don’t match a researcher’s values, she says. “It is the ability to know when to persist and when to pivot,” says Milgram.\n\nCommunication barriers for a Deaf PhD student meant risking burnout\n\nFor instance, an early-career researcher might continue working with a bully who is an influential principal investigator because they see them as a necessary stepping stone in their career. But in this case, finding a way out of this toxic situation is healthier than sticking it out and putting up with abuse, say interviewees.\n\nResilience also isn’t a fixed trait that people are born with, but a skill that is developed and practised over time (see ‘How to become resilient, the healthy way’), says Dusana Dorjee, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of York, UK. A big part of building resilience involves reflecting on challenges rather than reacting to them, as well as considering failures as opportunities to learn. “These are habits that need to be developed all the time, so they are there when adversity strikes,” she says.\n\nHow to become resilient, the healthy way\n\nShift your mindset. It’s easy to fall prey to negative ‘self-talk’ after a big grant rejection or failed experiment. But reframing thoughts to focus on what can be learnt from the experience can help you to bounce back sooner, says Diane Safer, who heads graduate career and professional development at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. “Instead of saying, ‘I’m really not good at that,’ it’s changing your mindset and saying, ‘I’m not good at that yet,’” says Safer.\n\nBe assertive. Contrary to popular belief, resilience isn’t about powering through challenges with superhuman strength and accommodating every demand, says Sharon Milgram, a biomedical researcher who heads the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Intramural Training and Education in Bethesda, Maryland. It’s about developing the assertiveness to set boundaries, say ‘no’ and ask for help. “It isn’t suffering because we’re supposed to work hard,” says Milgram. “It’s making sure we are doing something that brings us joy and value.”\n\nRemember your ‘why’. Although academia prizes prestige, publications and metrics, having a strong sense of purpose often has a more positive effect on mental health, says Dusana Dorjee, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of York, UK. “If you think about the purpose of science, it is about supporting the greater good and contributing knowledge,” says Dorjee. “That’s the primary drive, rather than awards.”\n\nBuild your connections. Developing resilience doesn’t just depend on individual effort. It also comes down to having strong social connections and support, which can help researchers to maintain their self-confidence and adaptability, says Paul Seldon, a cell biologist who runs an academic-resilience workshop at Imperial College London’s Early Career Research Institute. “It’s recognizing the need to be emotionally connected, beyond social media, having a work–life balance and accepting help,” says Seldon.",

          "title": "How much energy will AI really consume? The good, the bad and the unknown",
          "authors": "Sophia Chen",
          "abstract": "The aroma of hay and manure hangs over Culpeper County, Virginia, where there’s a cow for every three humans. “We’ve got big farms, most still family-owned, and a lot of forests,” says Sarah Parmelee, one of the county’s 55,000 residents. “It’s very charming small-town USA,” she adds.\n\nBut this pastoral idyll is in the middle of a twenty-first-century shift. Over the past few years, the county has approved the construction of seven large data-centre projects, which will support technology firms in their expansive plans for generative artificial intelligence (AI). Inside these giant structures, rows of computer servers will help to train the AI models behind chatbots such as ChatGPT, and deliver their answers to what might be billions of daily queries from around the world.\n\nIn Virginia, the construction will have profound effects. Each facility is likely to consume the same amount of electrical power as tens of thousands of residential homes, potentially driving up costs for residents and straining the area’s power infrastructure beyond its capacity. Parmelee and others in the community are wary of the data centres’ appetite for electricity — particularly because Virginia is already known as the data-centre capital of the world. A state-commissioned review, published in December 2024, noted that although data centres bring economic benefits, their growth could double electricity demand in Virginia within ten years1.\n\nLight bulbs have energy ratings — so why can’t AI chatbots?\n\n“Where is power going to come from?” asks Parmelee, who is mapping the rise of data centres in the state and works for the Piedmont Environmental Council, a non-profit organization headquartered in Warrenton, Virginia. “They’re all saying, ‘We’ll buy power from the next district over.’ But that district is planning to buy power from you.”\n\nSimilar conflicts about AI and energy are brewing in many places around the globe where data centres are sprouting up at a record pace. Big tech firms are betting hard on generative AI, which requires much more energy to operate compared with older AI models that extract patterns from data but don’t generate fresh text and images. That is driving companies to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on new data centres and servers to expand their capacity.\n\nFrom a global perspective, AI’s impact on future electricity demand is actually projected to be relatively small. But data centres are concentrated in dense clusters, where they can have profound local impacts. They are much more spatially concentrated than are other energy-intensive facilities, such as steel mills and coal mines. Companies tend to build data-centre buildings close together so that they can share power grids and cooling systems and transfer information efficiently, both among themselves and to users. Virginia, in particular, has attracted data-centre firms by providing tax breaks, leading to even more clustering.\n\n“If you have one, you’re likely to have more,” says Parmelee. Virginia already has 340 such facilities, and Parmelee has mapped 159 proposed data centres or expansions of existing ones in Virginia, where they account for more than one-quarter of the state’s electricity use, according to a report by EPRI, a research institute in Palo Alto, California2. In Ireland, data centres account for more than 20% of the country’s electricity consumption — with most of them situated on the edge of Dublin. And the facilities’ electricity consumption has surpassed 10% in at least 5 US states.\n\nComplicating matters further is a lack of transparency from firms about their AI systems’ electricity demands. “The real problem is that we’re operating with very little detailed data and knowledge of what’s happening,” says Jonathan Koomey, an independent researcher who has studied the energy use of computing for more than 30 years and who runs an analytics firm in Burlingame, California.\n\n“I think every researcher on this topic is going crazy because we’re not getting the stuff we need,” says Alex de Vries, a researcher at the Free University of Amsterdam and the founder of Digiconomist, a Dutch company that explores the unintended consequences of digital trends. “We’re just doing our best, trying all kinds of tricks to come up with some kind of numbers.”\n\nWorking out AI’s energy demands\n\nLacking detailed figures from firms, researchers have explored AI’s energy demand in two ways. In 2023, de Vries used a supply-chain (or market-based) method3. He examined the power draw of one of the NVIDIA servers that dominates the generative AI market and extrapolated that to the energy required over a year. He then multiplied that figure by estimates of the total number of such servers that are being shipped, or that might be required for a particular task.\n\nGenerative AI’s environmental costs are soaring — and mostly secret\n\nDe Vries used this method to estimate the energy needed if Google searches used generative AI. Two energy-analyst firms had estimated that implementing ChatGPT-like AI into every Google search would require between 400,000 and 500,000 NVIDIA A100 servers, which, based on the power demand of those servers, would amount to 23–29 terawatt hours (TWh) annually. Then, estimating that Google was processing up to 9 billion searches daily (a ballpark figure from various analysts), de Vries calculated that each request through an AI server requires 7–9 watt hours (Wh) of energy. That is 23–30 times the energy of a normal search, going by figures Google reported in a 2009 blogpost (see go.nature.com/3d8sd4t). When asked to comment on de Vries’ estimate, Google did not respond.\n\nThis energy calculation felt like “grasping at straws”, de Vries says, because he had to rely on third-party estimates that he could not replicate. And his numbers quickly became obsolete. The number of servers required for an AI-integrated Google search is likely to be lower now, because today’s AI models can match the accuracy of 2023 models at a fraction of the computational cost, as US energy-analyst firm SemiAnalysis (whose estimates de Vries had relied on) wrote in an e-mail to Nature.\n\nEven so, the firm says that the best way of assessing generative AI’s energy footprint is still to monitor server shipments and their power requirements, which is broadly the method used by many analysts. However, it is difficult for analysts to isolate the energy used solely by generative AI, because data centres generally perform non-AI tasks as well.\n\nBottom-up estimates\n\nThe other way to examine AI’s energy demand is ‘bottom-up’: researchers measure the energy demand of one AI-related request in a specific data centre. However, independent researchers can perform the measurements using only open-source AI models that are expected to resemble proprietary ones.\n\nThe concept behind these tests is that a user submits a prompt — such as a request to generate an image, or a text-based chat — and a Python software package called CodeCarbon then allows the user’s computer to access technical specifications of the chips that execute the model in the data centre. “At the end of the run, it’ll give you an estimate of how much energy was consumed by the hardware that you were using,” says Sasha Luccioni, an AI researcher who helped to develop CodeCarbon, and who works at Hugging Face, a firm based in New York City that hosts an open-source platform for AI models and data sets.\n\nLuccioni and others found that different tasks require varying amounts of energy. On average, according to their latest results, generating an image from a text prompt consumes about 0.5 Wh of energy, while generating text uses a little less. For comparison, a modern smartphone might need 22 Wh for a full charge. But there is wide variation: larger models require more energy (see ‘How much energy does AI use?’). De Vries says that the numbers are lower than those in his paper, but that might be because the models used by Luccioni and others are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the model underlying ChatGPT — and because AI is becoming more efficient.\n\nSource: HuggingFace AI Energy Score Leaderboard\n\nThe numbers are a lower bound, according to Emma Strubell, a computer scientist and collaborator of Luccioni’s at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Otherwise, “companies would be coming out and correcting us”, they say. “They’re not doing that.”\n\nWhat’s more, firms generally withhold the information the software needs to estimate the energy used for data-centre cooling. CodeCarbon also cannot access the energy consumption of some types of chip. This includes Google’s proprietary TPU chips, says Benoît Courty, a data scientist in France who maintains CodeCarbon.\n\nWill AI accelerate or delay the race to net-zero emissions?\n\nLuccioni has also studied how much energy it takes to train generative AI models — when a model extracts statistical patterns from massive amounts of data. But if models are receiving billions of queries daily, as de Vries assumed for his Google estimates, then the energy used to answer those queries — amounting to terawatt hours of electricity — will dominate AI’s annual energy demands. Training something the size of GPT-3, the model behind the first version of ChatGPT, requires energy in the order of a gigawatt hour.\n\nLast month, Luccioni and other researchers launched the AI Energy Score project, a public initiative to compare the energy efficiency of AI models on different tasks, which gives each model a star rating. Developers of proprietary, closed models are also able to upload test results, although only the US software firm Salesforce has participated so far, Luccioni says.\n\nCompanies are becoming increasingly close-mouthed about the energy requirements of their up-to-date industry models, Strubell says. As competition has heated up, “there has been a closing down of information shared outside of the company”, they say. But firms such as Google and Microsoft have reported that their carbon emissions are increasing, which they have ascribed to data-centre construction in support of AI. (Companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon didn’t address criticisms about a lack of transparency when asked by Nature; instead they emphasized that they were working with local authorities to ensure that new data centres don’t affect local utility supplies.)\n\nSome governments now require more transparency from companies. In 2023, the European Union adopted an Energy Efficiency Directive, which requires operators of data centres that are rated for at least 500 kilowatts of power to report their energy consumption each year.\n\nGlobal projections\n\nOn the basis of supply-chain estimation methods, analysts say that data centres currently use just a small proportion of the world’s electricity demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates4 that the electricity used by such facilities in 2022 was 240–340 TWh, or 1–1.3% of world demand (if cryptocurrency mining and data-transmission infrastructure are included, this raises the proportion to 2%).\n\nThe AI boom will increase this, but with world electricity consumption expected to grow by more than 80% by 2050 owing to the electrification of many industries, the rise of electric cars and greater demand for air conditioning, data centres “account for a relatively small share of overall electricity demand growth”, the IEA reports4 (see ‘World electricity growth’).\n\nSource: Ref. 4\n\nEven with approximations of AI’s current energy demands, it’s difficult to project future trends, warns Koomey. “Nobody has any idea what data centres, either AI or conventional, will use even a few years from now,” he says.\n\nThe main problem is disagreements about the number of servers and data centres that will be needed, and it’s an area where utilities and tech companies have financial incentives to inflate numbers, he says. Many of their predictions are based on “simple-minded assumptions” he adds. “They extrapolate recent trends out 10 or 15 years into the future.”\n\nLate last year, Koomey co-authored a report funded by the US Department of Energy5, which estimated that US data centres currently use 176 TWh (4.4%) of the country’s electricity, and that this might double or triple by 2028 to between 7% and 12%.",

          "authors": "David Matthews",
          "abstract": "China has introduced security-focused laws that affect researchers who want to send data overseas.Credit: Noel Celis/AFP via Getty\n\nDonald Trump’s second term as US president has brought fresh fears that the administration could resurrect the China Initiative, which launched legal cases against scientists from the country in a bid to counter scientific espionage.\n\nIn China, too, foreign researchers are navigating an increasingly authoritarian, security-focused environment. They have not faced a targeted campaign such as the China Initiative, and many still feel welcomed in the country. But tough regulations following the COVID-19 pandemic, new data laws and other restrictions pose challenges.\n\nUS and China sign new science pact — but with severe restrictions\n\n“There used to be a lot more foreigners, including foreign scientists, in China before COVID,” says an overseas researcher in Beijing, who did not want to be named because of uncertainty about how authorities might react. “So many friends left in the last five years.” But the researcher has a great job, which has kept them from leaving. “I love it here,” they say.\n\nStatistics on foreign researchers in China are hard to come by, but the number is thought to be relatively small. Halldór Berg Harðarson, who lived in Beijing and until last year ran Euraxess, a platform supporting European researchers in China, has analysed author names on scholarly publications and estimates that there are 5,000–10,000 foreign researchers in the country who have a PhD. By contrast, there are estimated to be at least 100,000 foreign scholars at this level in the United States.\n\nLockdown worries\n\nThe Chinese government’s strict management of the pandemic is one reason this number is low and has fallen over the past few years. China prevented foreigners who left from returning during parts of 2020, and imposed ultra-strict lockdown measures in 2022. “The way that they dealt with it from the beginning was not very conducive to keeping foreign talent,” says Harðarson, who now lives in Brussels. He returned to Europe for family and career reasons.\n\nA Euraxess survey found that by autumn 2022, 40–50% of foreign academics had left China, compared with 2019 figures. “It became very restrictive, really quickly,” says Harðarson. “That was a big factor.”\n\nThe anonymous researcher in Beijing recalls health officials calling in the middle of the night demanding that they take a new COVID-19 test after their previous test results were inconclusive.\n\nThe pandemic was “quite tough”, says another foreign academic in southern China, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely without needing approval from his research institution. The researcher says that foreigners experienced hostility because they were thought to be more likely to be infected with COVID-19 — for instance, some residents avoided sitting next to them on public transport. (China’s Ministry of Science and Technology did not respond to Nature’s request for comment about concerns about the impact of pandemic lockdowns.)\n\nChina’s strict restrictions during the COVID pandemic prompted an exodus of foreign researchers from China.Credit: AFP via Getty\n\nThe COVID-19 response gave foreign researchers a “dramatic realization” of how much control the Chinese state could exert, says Kārlis Rokpelnis, a Beijing-based social scientist with 15 years’ experience in China, who runs Euraxess and spoke to Nature in a personal capacity.\n\nData laws\n\nWhat’s more, over the past decade, China has implemented security-focused laws that have increased “vigilance” over whether academics in China can send potentially sensitive research overseas, says Annina Lattu, an open-science researcher at Peking University in Beijing. Many countries have data regulations. “But China’s laws, I would say, sit on the strictest and most ambiguous end of the spectrum.”\n\nUncertainty over these laws has scuppered some joint research projects. “I’ve heard about collaboration projects that didn’t pan out, because they were not able to reach a clear understanding with their Chinese counterparts,” says Harðarson.\n\nFor example, China’s Data Security Law, which covers all data types, including research data, can require official clearance to send certain information outside China. There is an exemption for academic data, unless they contain personal information or are deemed “important”; these require official checks before being exported. But what counts as “important” hasn’t yet been clarified, says Rogier Creemers, a specialist on Chinese data laws at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nSo far, the laws have mostly affected researchers working with medical data, says Rokpelnis. “I haven’t met anyone who said, ‘Oh, I wasn’t able to do my experiment,’” he says.\n\nVPN troubles\n\nAs in some other countries, posters warning of foreign spies have appeared in some Chinese research organizations, with a tip-off phone number. “The bad guy in the poster looked a lot like me,” says the researcher in southern China, recalling signage in his workplace. But, he says, “I haven’t felt anything about people accusing me of espionage.” In his experience, the Chinese companies he works with are less guarded about intellectual property than some UK firms he’s collaborated with.",

          "abstract": "Jay Bhattacharya, whom President Trump nominated as director of the National Institutes of Health, speaks with senators on 5 March during his confirmation hearing.Credit: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty\n\nAmid confusion about cuts affecting the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), Jay Bhattacharya, US President Donald Trump’s nominee for NIH director, said on Wednesday that he is committed to ensuring that scientists at the NIH and those who receive NIH grants have the funding to do their work ― but he was vague on how he would accomplish that.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing before the US Senate, Bhattacharya, who is a health economist at Stanford University in California, also seemed to distance himself from the recent turmoil at the agency. Grant processing has largely ground to a halt, and roughly 1,200 of the NIH’s 20,000 staff members were fired in mid-February. “I wasn’t involved in the personnel decisions to date,” he said, when asked about the firings. But he did not commit to rehiring those who have lost their jobs.\n\n“I thought that he came across as very reasonable,” said Carole LaBonne, a stem-cell biologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The exception, she said, was Bhattacharya’s discussion of COVID-19 ― a topic that has divided him from many scientists because of his views on lockdowns and COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“What I was most disturbed by during the hearing was that the topic of basic science didn’t come up,” LaBonne added. That omission led her to worry that Bhattacharya does not understand its importance, she said.\n\nTumultuous times\n\nIf confirmed, Bhattacharya will helm an agency with a budget of roughly US$47 billion, making it the world’s biggest funder of biomedical research.\n\nMajor biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0\n\nBut since Trump, a Republican, took office for the second time in January, there has been a sharp decline in new research grants awarded, leaving many scientists in limbo. Trump officials have also used procedural manoeuvres to prevent grant-review meetings from taking place, and the agency announced on 7 February that research ‘indirect cost’ funding, which is key to the functioning of universities across the country, would be capped, effective immediately. Courts have put many of these measures on hold.\n\nBhattacharya gained public prominence after co-authoring an open letter called the Great Barrington Declaration. Published in October 2020, it argued against COVID-19 lockdowns and in favour of normality to allow ‘herd immunity’ to take hold ― a proposal that was knocked down by numerous scientists and NIH officials. Francis Collins, the head of the NIH at the time, told television broadcaster Fox News in 2021 that “hundreds of thousands of people would have died if we had followed that strategy”. Bhattacharya also opposed vaccine and mask mandates.\n\nFresh priorities\n\nAt his confirmation hearing, Bhattacharya laid out his five priorities for the NIH: chronic disease research, research reproducibility, encouraging a culture of “scientific dissent”, funding cutting-edge research and regulating “risky research that has the possibility of causing a pandemic”.\n\nBhattacharya said that he would make sure that all scientists at the NIH and all those supported by the NIH “have the resources they need to do their research”. Asked whether he would immediately restart grant-review meetings, he responded, “Absolutely. My job would be to ensure that those fundamental scientific meetings and other activities happen.” He also affirmed the need for NIH funding to address the health needs of “minority populations” and for long COVID research.\n\nBut he didn’t commit explicitly to allowing new grants to start flowing again, or to rehiring NIH employees who were fired. Both Democratic and Republican senators brought up the 15% indirect-cost cap that the NIH attempted to impose on universities. Bhattacharya agreed that these funds pay for important things. But he also said that “there’s a lot of distrust” about how that money is spent, and he endorsed audits of indirect-cost spending.\n\nVaccine messaging\n\nBhattacharya spoke carefully when discussing infectious disease: if he is confirmed, his future boss will be Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, who has a long history of anti-vaccine activism. When asked about Kennedy’s statement at an anti-vaccine conference in 2023 that the NIH should give infectious-disease science “a break for about eight years,” Bhattacharya responded that Kennedy is “fully committed” to addressing the nation’s health needs, “including infectious disease”.\n\nVaccine sceptic RFK Jr is now a powerful force in US science: what will he do?",

Until now, they had been managed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) in New York. The new organization, named openRxiv, will have a board of directors and a scientific and medical advisory board. It is supported by a fresh US$16-million grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the projects’ main financial backer.\n\n“It’s just exciting to see this key piece of infrastructure really get the attention that it deserves as a dedicated initiative,” says Katie Corker, executive director of ASAPbio, a scientist-driven non-profit organization, which is based in San Francisco, California. Preprints are “the backbone of the scientific publishing ecosystem, maybe especially at the current moment, when there’s a lot of worries about who has control of information.”\n\nThe launch of openRxiv “reflects a maturation of the projects”, which started as an experiment at CSHL, says Richard Sever, a co-founder of both servers and chief science and strategy officer at openRxiv. It has “become so important that they should have their own organization running them, which is focused on the long-term sustainability of the servers, as opposed to being a side project within a big research institution”, says Sever.\n\nThousands of submissions\n\nSince its launch in 2013, bioRxiv, which covers biological science, including neuroscience, bioinformatics and genomics — has posted about 268,000 preprints by more than 970,000 authors. Its younger sibling medRxiv — founded in 2019 to cover medical sciences — has nearly 64,000 preprints from more than 380,000 authors.

          "authors": "Olival Freire Jr, Thiago Hartz",
          "abstract": "What makes matter stable? Why are atoms as they are? Why do different materials vary in their properties, such as electrical conductivity, density, melting temperature or light-absorption spectra?\n\nSuch questions exercised physicists greatly in the decades after Dmitri Mendeleev introduced his periodic table of the chemical elements in 1869. They received new impetus around the turn of the twentieth century with J. J. Thomson’s discovery that atoms were not indivisible, but contained smaller, negatively charged entities called electrons — the first subatomic particles to be identified. Then, in 1911, came Ernest Rutherford’s discovery that atoms contain a central ‘nucleus’ of densely packed positive charge.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nThis opened the door to a thrilling journey of discovery, to understand the rules governing subatomic structures. It reached some form of destination a century ago, at the beginning of 1925, with a principle that has underpinned our ideas of the stability of matter ever since.\n\nThis is the Pauli exclusion principle, named for the brilliant young Austrian theoretical physicist who devised it1, Wolfgang Pauli. It was a product of what is now labelled the old quantum theory — a period of ad hoc theorizing between 1900 and 1925 that led to the introduction of a consistent theory of quantum mechanics in 1925–27 by Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Max Born, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Dirac and others. Pauli’s principle can be considered the apex of the old quantum theory and, unusually, survived to be incorporated into the new one. Its centenary is an occasion to remember the odyssey of physicists in attempting to understand, amend and test properties predicted by the periodic table, and how this principle has guided our understanding of matter — and not just the conventional stuff.\n\nBold hypotheses\n\nThe discovery of a charged substructure to atoms, which are neutral overall, created considerable difficulty for pictures of how atoms worked. In 1842, the mathematician Samuel Earnshaw showed that there is no stable, static distribution of such charges, ruling out static models of the atom. Yet, despite numerous attempts following the discovery of subatomic structure, no one could arrive at a model that achieved atomic stability and explained features such as the distinct, discrete spectral lines of light emitted by atoms of different elements.\n\nShortly after Rutherford’s discovery of the nucleus, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr began to attack this problem using quantum principles. He harnessed an idea introduced by Max Planck in 1900 to explain the spectrum of light emitted by a non-reflective ‘black body’ — that energy comes only in discrete chunks, or quanta. Bohr applied it to the spectrum of light emitted and absorbed by hydrogen atoms. The basic hydrogen atom is the simplest of all atoms, now known to consist of a single proton and a single electron.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nBohr started with a picture in which electrons circle the atomic nucleus, rather as planets orbit a star. He postulated that there are specific values of orbital energies at which electrons do not radiate and, therefore, atoms remain stable. Light can be emitted and absorbed only at frequencies corresponding to the difference in energy between two of these stable orbits, which Bohr characterized with different values of a first, ‘principal’ quantum number2.\n\nThis bold hypothesis could explain some features of the hydrogen spectrum, but not all. Bohr’s odyssey continued, incorporating new spectroscopic data and theoretical conjectures. These were derived in part from classical mechanics, from applying the precepts of Albert Einstein’s 1905 special theory of relativity to atomic electrons, and by introducing more quantum ideas entirely at odds with classical physics. The ‘quantum of action’ introduced by Planck (now known as Planck’s constant, h, whose ‘reduced’ form when divided by 2π, ħ, is widely used), for example, suggests there is a minimum amount of energy a system can exchange. And Bohr’s own principle of correspondence stated that, when the principal quantum number is large, predictions achieved using this mixed theoretical toolkit should approach the results known from classical physics.\n\nThese efforts resulted in Bohr introducing two more quantum numbers3: an azimuthal quantum number, which represented the magnitude of the electron’s angular momentum; and the magnetic quantum number, which described the size of its magnetic moment. These additions made sense in Bohr’s picture of the atom: if the electron is moving along a circular orbit around the atomic nucleus, it would have an angular momentum; and as a charged body in circular motion, you would also expect it to have a magnetic moment.\n\nBut again, this couldn’t explain all features of the hydrogen spectrum. By 1923–24, the main puzzle was how to explain the Zeeman effect, in which new spectral lines appear when orbiting electrons interact with an external magnetic field. This is the point at which Pauli enters the story.\n\nElectron exclusion\n\nAt the turn of 1925, Pauli was just 24 years old. Already a lecturer in theoretical physics at the University of Hamburg, Germany, he was highly regarded by his peers. Since his youth in Vienna, he had been recognized as a mathematics prodigy — a mantle that he did not wear with ease, as is so often the case. He sought help through the new psychoanalysis promulgated by the psychologist Carl Jung, with whom Pauli maintained a lasting intellectual dialogue4. Pauli was a prolific correspondent, and his published letters are an important source for scientists as well as historians.\n\nWolfgang Pauli delivering a lecture in Copenhagen in 1929.Credit: Gondsmit/CERN/Science Photo Library\n\nPauli’s principle1 was informed by ideas from Edmund Clifton Stoner, but his approach was original — and unusual — in many senses. For a start, it seemed to be based mainly in numerology, with no direct connection to known physics. Pauli’s key addition to Bohr’s model was a fourth quantum number — one that, unlike Bohr’s, had no analogy with classical physics, and not even any visual representation in space-time. This new quantum number, spin, could have only two values, either +ħ/2 or −ħ/2. Electrons with opposite values of this quantum number would interact differently with an external magnetic field, leading to the splitting of spectral lines seen in the Zeeman effect.\n\nNowadays, we know that the spin quantum number cannot be interpreted visually: if you try to model an electron as a charged body spinning on its axis, you find its surface would be spinning at a velocity greater than that of light. It is the strongest indication in atomic models of just how bizarre quantum theory is, filled with features that defy classical intuitions.\n\nPauli did not formulate his exclusion principle on the basis of classical theories or dynamical principles, but stated it as a simple postulate: that no two electrons in an atom can share the same set of four quantum numbers. As characterized by historian John Heilbron, this statement was rather in the style of the biblical Ten Commandments: “It shall be forbidden for more than one electron [in the same atom] … to have the same values of [all applicable] quantum numbers”5. In this regard, Pauli anticipated the new quantum mechanics, which also — to the distress of many physicists, including Schrödinger and Einstein — abandoned intuitive visual models in the construction of the theory or in its interpretation.\n\n‘Shut up and calculate’: how Einstein lost the battle to explain quantum reality",

Bernat Bacete/Getty\n\nLate last year, media outlets worldwide warned that black plastic cooking utensils contained worrying levels of cancer-linked flame retardants. The risk was found to be overhyped — a mathematical error in the underlying research suggested a key chemical exceeded the safe limit when in fact it was ten times lower than the limit. Keen-eyed researchers quickly showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could have spotted the error in seconds.\n\nThe incident has spurred two projects that use AI to find mistakes in the scientific literature. The Black Spatula Project is an open-source AI tool that has so far analysed around 500 papers for errors. The group, which has around eight active developers and hundreds of volunteer advisers, hasn’t made the errors public yet; instead, it is approaching the affected authors directly, says Joaquin Gulloso, an independent AI researcher based in Cartagena, Colombia, who helps to coordinate the project. “Already, it’s catching many errors,” says Gulloso. “It’s a huge list. It’s just crazy.”\n\nThe other effort is called YesNoError and was inspired by the Black Spatula Project, says founder and AI entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. The initiative, funded by its own dedicated cryptocurrency, has set its sights even higher. “I thought, why don’t we go through, like, all of the papers?” says Schlicht. He says that their AI tool has analysed more than 37,000 papers in two months. Its website flags papers in which it has found flaws – many of which have yet to be verified by a human, although Schlicht says that YesNoError has a plan to eventually do so at scale. Currently, the YesNoError site lists errors which are not real and the initiative has not yet published a full account of how well the tool works.\n\nBoth projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish, the idea being to avoid mistakes, as well as fraud, making their way into the scientific literature.\n\nThe projects have tentative support from academic sleuths who work in research integrity. But there are also concerns over the potential risks, including that the tools could be used maliciously and before they are ready. How well the tools can spot mistakes, and whether their claims have been verified, must be made clear, says Michèle Nuijten, a researcher in metascience at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “If you start pointing fingers at people and then it turns out that there was no mistake, there might be reputational damage,” she says.\n\nOthers add that although there are risks and the projects need to be cautious about what they claim, the goal is the right one. It is much easier to churn out shoddy papers than it is to retract them, says James Heathers, a forensic metascientist at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. As a first step, AI could be used to triage papers for further scrutiny, says Heathers, who has acted as a consultant for the Black Spatula Project. “It’s early days, but I’m supportive” of the initiatives, he adds.\n\nAI sleuths\n\nMany researchers have dedicated their careers to spotting integrity concerns in papers — and tools to check certain facets of papers already exist. But advocates hope that AI could carry out a wider range of checks in a single shot and handle a larger volume of papers.\n\nBoth the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError use large language models (LLMs) to spot a range of errors in papers, including ones of fact as well as in calculations, methodology and referencing.\n\nThe systems first extract information, including tables and images, from the papers. They then craft a set of complex instructions, known as a prompt, which tells a ‘reasoning’ model — a specialist type of LLM — what it is looking at and what kinds of error to hunt for. The model might analyse a paper multiple times, either scanning for different types of error each time, or to cross-check results. The cost of analysing each paper ranges from 15 cents to a few dollars, depending on the length of the paper and the series of prompts used.\n\nThe rate of false positives, instances in which the AI claims an error where there is none, is a major hurdle. Currently, the Black Spatula Project’s system is wrong about an error around 10% of the time, says Gulloso. Each alleged error must be checked with experts in the subject, and finding them is the project’s greatest bottleneck, says Steve Newman, the software engineer and entrepreneur who founded the Black Spatula Project.\n\nSo far, Schlicht’s YesNoError team has quantified the false positives in only around 100 mathematical errors that the AI found in an initial batch of 10,000 papers. Of the 90% of authors who responded to Schlicht, all but one agreed that the error detected was valid, he says. Eventually, YesNoError is planning to work with ResearchHub, a platform which pays PhD scientists in cryptocurrency to carry out peer review. When the AI has checked a paper, YesNoError will trigger a request to verify the results, although this has not yet started.\n\nFalse positives",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "Microsoft unveiled its 'Majorana 1' quantum chip in February.Credit: John Brecher for Microsoft\n\nA physicist has cast doubt on a test that underlies a high-profile claim by Microsoft to have created the first ‘topological qubits’, a long-sought goal of the company’s quantum-computing effort. The critique comes amid mounting speculation about the validity of Microsoft’s claim.\n\nMicrosoft announced the breakthrough, which could lead to a quantum computer that is more resistant to information loss than with other approaches, on 19 February. Without a peer-reviewed paper backing up the claim, some researchers were sceptical. An accompanying paper in Nature described a method to measure the read-out from future topological qubits, but did not offer proof of their existence1.\n\n“While the Nature paper outlined our approach, it does not speak to our progress,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. The paper was submitted almost a year before it was published and since then “tremendous progress has occurred”, they said. (Nature’s news team is independent of its journals team.)\n\nIn the latest critique, posted as a preprint2, Henry Legg, a theoretical physicist at the University of St Andrews, UK, raises concerns about a test that Microsoft uses to look for Majoranas, so-far undiscovered quasiparticles arising from the collective behaviour of electrons that are needed for the topological qubits to work.\n\nKnown as the topological gap protocol (TGP), the test is not mentioned in the 19 February Microsoft announcement. But the company has subsequently indicated to Nature’s news team, and in a comment online, that it created the topological qubits using the TGP. “Since the TGP is flawed, the very foundations of the qubit are not there,” says Legg.\n\nChetan Nayak, a theoretical physicist leading Microsoft’s quantum computing effort in Redmond, Washington, stands by the qubit claim. “The criticism can be summarized as Legg constructing a false straw man of our paper and then attacking that,” he says.\n\nA Majorana test\n\nMajoranas have previously proved elusive. Several claimed sightings later proved to be Majorana mimics, in some cases leading to retractions.\n\nIn 2022, Microsoft researchers posted a preprint reporting that the TGP could indirectly identify Majoranas with ‘high probability’; the preprint was later published in Physical Review B (PRB)3. The test relies on electronic measurements of microscopic sandwiches of ultracold metal. If the measurement exhibits a specific feature characteristic of Majoranas, the device ‘passes’ and is said to host the elusive particles.\n\nLegg and his colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland went on to report that the test could be fooled by false positives, doppelgangers with the electronic features of Majoranas that lack their useful properties4.\n\nIn his latest critique, Legg reports further flaws with the protocol. Examining data in the PRB paper, he saw large variations in the external conditions, such as the range of magnetic field strengths, when electronic measurements were taken. The test was designed to measure the intrinsic properties of the device — and thus whether it contained Majoranas. Instead, Legg found that varying conditions made the test an inconsistent weathervane.\n\nNayak does not accept this criticism. “The ranges come from an initial scan we describe, and we always analyse the full data,” he says.\n\nAnother problem, says Legg, is that a key parameter in the code that implements the protocol, which Microsoft shared publicly, differs from the description in the PRB paper. When asked by Nature’s news team about the issue, Nayak said: “Legg claims there’s a difference between our described protocol and the implemented code. This is incorrect, so this is a non-issue.” Legg says that Nayak previously acknowledged this difference in an e-mail to him and planned to issue a correction, but changed his mind.\n\nLegg’s critique is “certainly valid”, says Carlo Beenakker, a theoretical physicist at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, although he remains “enthusiastic” about Microsoft’s goal of creating topological qubits. “I have a deep respect for people who basically go out and somehow are not distracted by others who say, ‘I don't believe it’,” he says.\n\nAnton Akhmerov, a theoretical physicist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, says that “Legg’s critique requires a public response from the Microsoft researchers”. A Microsoft spokesperson said that they would officially respond to Legg’s critique when contacted by editors of PRB.",

          "abstract": "The number of women now entering science, technology, engineering and mathematics and medicine (STEMM) careers is growing at a faster rate than that of men. And although women still account for only about 35% of the STEMM workforce, research has shown that they are more likely to excel when given access to mentoring, support and guidance from other women with similar lived experiences (see go.nature.com/416cjkb).\n\nTo mark International Women’s Day, held each year on 8 March, six previous winners of Nature’s annual Inspiring Women in Science Award nominated someone from their own lives who deserves recognition for their contributions to research and support for other women in the sciences. The prize, which launched in 2018 in partnership with the Estée Lauder Companies, headquartered in New York City, is given to individuals who advance gender equity.\n\nThe nominees, whose contributions and characteristics are described in the winners’ own words below, span the globe and a broad range of career disciplines, researching everything from the smallest pathogens to the farthest stars.\n\nThey include business founders, thoughtful mentors, mothers, carers and a Nobel prizewinner. Their experiences can inspire not only other women in science, but also anyone looking to make STEMM a more welcoming place.\n\nSHARON PEACOCK\nMicrobiologist Sharon Peacock led the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium — nominated by Claire Chewapreecha (inset).Credit: Sharon Peacock; Nature\n\nJob: microbiologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, and director of the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK).\n\nResearch focus: whole-genome sequencing in diagnostic and public-health microbiology.\n\nNominated by: 2024 winner Claire Chewapreecha, a computational biologist at the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Bangkok.\n\nC.C.: Sharon is an inspiring role model who, as someone who left school aged 16 before returning to academia later on, challenges the conventional image of a medical scientist. I first met Sharon at the University of Cambridge, UK, when I was an undergraduate student aiming to pursue a PhD and then return to Thailand. She offered me invaluable advice, including how to navigate the complexities of conducting research in Thailand and learning to take a helicopter view rather than focusing on individual challenges. She has been my mentor ever since, truly believing in my ability to succeed.\n\nWomen in science\n\nA true pioneer in public-health genomics, Sharon foresaw the transformative potential of sequencing technologies to combat infectious diseases. When genomic sequencing was still emerging, she led the way, setting a standard for its application in global health. Her leadership of the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (a group of UK academic institutions and public-health agencies in operation from April 2020 until March 2023) was extraordinary, enabling the United Kingdom to track SARS-CoV-2 lineages with precision, which provided crucial insights into the emergence and spread of variants, and aided vaccine development.\n\nSharon is a dedicated mentor, inspiring people from all backgrounds, including those from low- and middle-income countries, to push boundaries and give back to their communities. Her journey serves as a powerful reminder that talent exists everywhere, but opportunities do not. It inspires me to make the most of every opportunity that I get.\n\nSIERIN LIM\nSierin Lim advocates for women in STEMM alongside her bioengineering research — nominated by Hortense Le Ferrand (inset).Credit: 52 Photography\n\nJob: bioengineer at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.\n\nResearch focus: design and engineering of biomaterials for health and the environment.\n\nNominated by: 2023 winner Hortense Le Ferrand, a materials scientist at NTU, Singapore.\n\nH.L.F: Sierin Lim has been an active advocate for women in STEMM for more than a decade, starting and overseeing many programmes at our university on top of her full-time role as an associate professor. It’s only in the past couple of years, as I’ve started getting involved in planning events and courses myself, that I realized the amount of work, courage and energy that Sierin puts in to make these things happen.\n\nSeeing how hard she works inspired me to establish a joint workshop between NTU and Purdue University, in West Lafayette, Indiana. For the past four years, US students have come to our university in Singapore to explore my research focus, biomimicry. This is a great opportunity for students to practise intercultural skills and learn about a research topic outside their curriculum.\n\nOn top of all this, Sierin is also a charming person. She’s learning French, which demands a lot of time and motivation, and she takes great care of her mother, often going home to Jakarta. Everyone at the university knows Sierin, but she deserves a pedestal.\n\nYOON-KYOUNG CHO\nBiomedical engineer Yoon-Kyoung Cho developed lab-on-a-disc technology for academia and industry — nominated by Kiana Aran (inset).Credit: Yoon-Kyoung Cho; Kiana Aran\n\nJob: biomedical engineer at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), South Korea.\n\nResearch focus: lab-on-a-chip-based diagnostics, microfluidics and nanomedicine.\n\nNominated by: 2021 winner Kiana Aran, a biomedical entrepreneur and bioengineer at University of California, San Diego. (In February Aran also won the inaugural Sony Women in Technology award, in partnership with Nature.)\n\nK.A.: Yoon-Kyoung Cho embodies a unique blend of scientific brilliance, entrepreneurial spirit and calm leadership. I first met her at a conference in China in 2019 when I was a new professor. Initially, I felt out of place among the leading international faculty members invited to this small, exclusive gathering. She immediately stood out for her warm, encouraging demeanour, taking the time to engage with me about her groundbreaking research on centrifugal microfluidics, but also making me feel included in discussions in a group of highly accomplished scientists. Our conversation left a lasting impression. Since then, she has excelled in academia and translated her lab-on-a-disc technology into the real world, founding successful companies.\n\nIt is rare for scientists to successfully bridge the gap between academia and industry, because the mindsets required for each are distinct. Cho’s success in founding companies shows her determination to ensure that her laboratory’s research isn’t just in journals, but provides a tangible benefit to society. But what truly draws me to her is her leadership style and her genuine care for her trainees’ well-being. One practice I’ve consciously adopted from her is an emphasis on creating an inclusive and encouraging environment. I strive to approach mentoring with the same care and attentiveness, to ensure that my students feel supported in both their academic and personal growth.\n\nADA YONATH\nAda Yonath, who won a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry — nominated by Samira Asgari (inset).Credit: Miguel Lorenzo, Nathan Maddigan\n\nJob: crystallographer and structural biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.\n\nResearch focus: chemical and structural biology of ribosomes.\n\nNominated by: 2020 winner Samira Asgari, a computational biologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City.\n\nS.A.: I had the privilege of meeting Ada during the 2014 Global Young Scientists Summit, held in Singapore. I still remember how she spoke openly about the personal challenges she faced, her funding struggles, and the scepticism from peers while pursuing her groundbreaking work on the structure of the ribosome—a discovery that earned her a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009, with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz. She didn’t sugar-coat the realities of conducting ambitious science, nor did she shy away from discussing the obstacles she overcame. These include being dismissed and even ridiculed by some of her colleagues, the struggle to fund her early research determining the 3D structure, and therefore the mechanics, of the ribosome; and the strain that her career placed on her personal relationships. Ada’s story is a powerful reminder that resilience and a clear sense of purpose are essential to walking new paths as a scientist.\n\nResearchers don’t talk enough about how the measurement of scientific output has shifted to the amount of funding a researcher can secure early in their career, and the impact factor of the journals we publish in. As a result, most scientists in their early career now focus on writing low-risk grants with predictable results, instead of aiming for innovative, collaborative research that can lead to breakthroughs. Ada’s research inspired an entirely new field of science that continues to produce meaningful discoveries today.\n\nRACHEL KARCHIN\nComputational biologist Rachel Karchin’s mentorship has inspired others to have lifelong science careers — nominated by Jean Fan (inset).Credit: Rachel Karchin; Will Kirk\n\nJob: computational biologist at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.",

          "abstract": "Almost 40% of biologists who identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming report experiencing offensive, intimidating and hostile behaviour at work, a survey finds. So, too, do nearly one in five biologist respondents who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or queer, according to the study of more than 1,400 researchers, which its authors describe as the largest survey so far of professional life experiences among LGBTQ+ biologists1.\n\n“One person experiencing that is one person too many,” says lead author Katelyn Cooper, a biology education researcher at Arizona State University in Tempe, who has been recognized for her research into making science more inclusive for LGBTQ+ people.\n\nThose who identified as transgender or gender-nonconforming (TGNC) were much more likely to have lower morale and less of a sense of belonging and comfort in professional settings and workplaces than were both their straight peers and lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer (LGBQ) biologists who identify as cisgender — their sex assigned at birth, the survey found.\n\nThe study was published on the bioRxiv preprint server in late January; it has not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nThe survey was distributed by e-mail and social media in June and July 2023, through five professional societies, namely the American Society for Cell Biology, the Biophysical Society, the Genetics Society of America, the International Society for Stem Cell Research and the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research. The study team obtained responses from 1,419 biologists, 486 (34%) of whom identified as LGBTQ+, including 153 as TGNC.\n\nRespondents were mostly white (64%), were university faculty members (49%), and based in the United States (68%). Twenty per cent of respondents were university staff, lecturers or postdoctoral researchers, 15% were graduate or undergraduate students, and 11% held positions outside of academia. Eleven per cent of respondents identified as Asian, followed by 8% who identified as Hispanic, Latin or of Spanish origin. Outside the United States, respondents were mostly based in the United Kingdom (4.6%), Canada (4.2%) or Japan (1.8%). In all, the survey drew responses from 44 countries.\n\nGrowing hostility\n\nThe survey was conducted before the current Trump administration in the United States issued a flurry of executive orders cancelling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and seeking to ban the use of gender-related language by federal agencies. But it came amid a background of increasing political attacks against the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn 2023, when Cooper and her co-authors distributed the survey, 88 pieces of anti-LGBTQ legislation were enacted in the United States, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The LGBTQ+ community is afforded greater legal protections and acceptance in many parts of Europe, but an anti-LGBTQ+ disinformation backlash, reportedly orchestrated and financed mainly by Russia, seems to be growing there, as well.\n\nJess McLaughlin, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, who identifies as trans and non-binary, says that although they didn’t take the survey, they aren’t surprised by the number of trans biologists who reported hostile, intimidating or offensive behavior. “It’s something we’ve known anecdotally,” McLaughlin says — and, for them, through personal experience.\n\nWhile teaching during their PhD at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, despite wearing men’s suits to class, McLaughlin was criticized in student evaluations as unprofessional. “The problem to them was that I was the one wearing the suit,” they say.\n\nBut an incident near campus pushed McLaughlin to the brink and contributed to their decision to wrap up their PhD as quickly as possible and leave Oklahoma: “I was running and somebody was chasing me and yelling slurs,” they say.\n\nMcLaughlin’s experience aligns with the survey, in which 50% of TGNC respondents reported experiencing “exclusionary, intimidating, offensive or hostile conduct” outside of work.\n\nAt the same time, the survey documented a sharp increase, relative to a 2019 survey (also led by Cooper, who then was at the University of Central Florida in Orlando), in the proportion of LGBTQ biologists who were out to their undergraduate students (76% versus 20%).\n\nMaeve McLaughlin, a molecular microbiologist at the University of Michigan in Flint, who identifies as transgender, says that she goes out of her way to make her students feel comfortable, including highlighting the work of researchers affiliated with the group 500 Queer Scientists.\n\nDoing so, she says, makes it easier for students to come forward to seek guidance. “I have a lot of trans and gender-nonconforming students who are more comfortable asking questions,” she says.\n\nA constant push",

          "abstract": "The main historical building on the campus of the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.Credit: Gibson Green/Alamy\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has begun a mass termination of research grants that fund active scientific projects because they no longer meet “agency priorities”.\n\nRevealed: NIH research grants still frozen despite lawsuits challenging Trump order\n\nNIH staff members have been instructed to identify and potentially cancel grants for projects studying transgender populations, gender identity, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the scientific workforce, environmental justice and any other research that might be perceived to discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity, according to documents and an audio recording that Nature has obtained. Grants that allot funding to universities in China and those relating to climate change are also under scrutiny.\n\nAt least 16 termination letters have already been sent out, says Brittany Charlton, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, who has been tracking them. And hundreds more are coming, say two NIH officials, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\n“It’s extremely alarming that grants that have been vetted by the scientific community and deemed important and impactful to understand the world are now being cancelled because of political ideology,” says Lisa Fazio, a cognitive psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, who studies misinformation. “For all this talk about free speech, this is direct censorship of scientific research.”\n\nThe actions come in the second month of US President Donald Trump’s presidency; on his first day in office, Trump issued executive orders “restoring freedom of speech” to “the American people” and “defending women from gender ideology extremism” by banning the allocation of federal funding to projects that “promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology”.\n\nThe NIH, which is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, did not respond to Nature’s queries about the grant terminations, their legality or how many the agency anticipated sending out.\n\nCategories for cutting\n\nAlthough many NIH research grants run for longer, scientists generally receive their funding one year at a time and are required to submit a progress report to the agency annually. NIH staff members then review this report and can issue a continuation of funding.\n\nThe agency, based in Bethesda, Maryland, has now asked its employees to review new and ongoing projects for any DEI-related activities and to place them in one of four categories: projects that solely support DEI-related activities (category one), projects that partially support these activities (category two), projects that do not support these activities but include some DEI-related language (category three) and projects that do not support any DEI-related activities (category four).\n\nGuidance document obtained by Nature that describes the four categories all active NIH grants should now be grouped into (see below for PDF).\n\nThe NIH’s 27 institutes and centres should not issue awards for research in category one, according to a guidance document obtained by Nature and sent to some employees this week. Category-two research must be renegotiated with the lead researcher or institution on the grant to remove any DEI-related activities. If the work cannot be renegotiated, the institute must seek to terminate the project, the document says.\n\nCategory-three research can continue unimpeded as long as any DEI-related language is stripped from the application or progress report. Category-four research can proceed as usual.\n\nAlthough the guidance document focuses on DEI-related activities, it also includes an appendix with examples of other types of research that the NIH no longer supports. For example, projects funding research in China and those that touch on “transgender issues” will be terminated.\n\nThis guidance was drafted by the deputy director of the NIH’s Office of Extramural Research (OER), Liza Bundesen, and approved by acting NIH director Matthew Memoli, according to an e-mail that Nature has obtained. Bundesen, who took the helm of the OER less than three weeks ago, is leaving the agency on 7 March, according to an NIH official who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nThe guidance does not specify how to determine whether a project is discriminatory, which has caused confusion and anxiety among agency staff, another NIH official says. Many fear losing their jobs, a factor that might lead to over-interpretation of the guidance, which would hold back more science than “needs to be” affected, they say. “For example, is a grant providing culturally appropriate care specifically to Hispanic and Latino populations ‘discrimination’?”\n\nAppendices obtained by Nature describing research that NIH no longer supports (see below for PDF).\nLost data\n\nTara McKay, who studies the health of people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBT+) at Vanderbilt University, received an e-mail from the NIH late on 28 February. It said that the agency was pulling funding for her project tracking the health of more than 1,200 LGBT+ adults in the United States.\n\nExclusive: how NSF is scouring research grants for violations of Trump’s orders\n\nMcKay’s study aims to understand sources of stress and resilience for LGBT+ people, and to conduct cognitive screening and collect blood samples to understand how they are ageing over the span of a decade. “Longitudinal research gets its value from time points,” she says. Cancelling a grant part way through means that follow-up data will be lost, she says, and “it devalues the earlier money spent”.\n\nThe e-mail that McKay received said that her grant did not satisfy certain criteria and pointed to its inclusion of “transgender issues”, saying that such research programmes are “often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans”. This is the same wording given in the internal NIH guidance document.\n\nMcKay says that her project does not centre on the experience of transgender people, but merely includes people who identify as such. “That is not a population we’re willing to leave behind in our work,” she adds.",

But, in the nearly 200 years since the first historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) opened their doors, Black people in the country still have not achieved economic parity with white people.\n\nSpringboard to science: the institutions that shaped Black researchers’ careers\n\nYet this failure cannot be laid at the feet of the Black universities’ leadership. No strategy that they could have deployed would have made a difference. The suppression of African American achievement was intentional and systematic. It occurred because many of those who controlled white society (particularly in the former Confederate states) never wanted African Americans or their institutions to achieve social equality1 — and I argue that this is not a priority for the second administration of US President Donald Trump either. This does not mean that all white people are racists: indeed, many have taken an active role in the fight against structural racism. However, the majority have either bought into or been unwilling to take action against a social and political system that has and continues to deny opportunity to African Americans2.\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, the majority of this group accepted the inferiority of people of African descent as socially agreed ‘fact’. This allowed powerful institutions to discriminate against African Americans. For example, redlining, which occurred between 1934 and 1968, became a widespread practice in the United States to deny loans and housing to African Americans, and it led to different capacities for accumulating wealth. Today, owing in large part to such policies, the median wealth of white families is about 6.5 times greater than that of African American families3.\n\nHistoric inequality in Black education\n\nI have reviewed the history of African American higher education in the context of evolutionary science4, but the essential details of the story are the same across scientific disciplines. The second Morrill Land-Grant Act, enacted in 1890, established 19 HBCUs in the US South to provide opportunities for Black students. But these institutions and the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Act institutions, which educated white students, were never funded equitably (see ‘HBCUs: a history of underfunding’).\n\nJoseph L. Graves Jr shows students in his evolutionary-medicine class how to construct spreadsheets to analyse models of natural selection.\n\nCompared with their historically white institution (HWI) counterparts, HBCUs admit a disproportionate share of students from struggling school districts, a result of historical inequalities in primary and secondary education in the country. Yet, state appropriations to HWIs are larger than those to HBCUs in the US South. For example, in 2021–22 the state budget appropriation per undergraduate student at the North Carolina State University (NCSU), an HWI in Raleigh, was $35,513 per student, but at my institution, the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCATSU) in Greensboro, an HBCU, it was $19,083. This means that for every dollar spent on a student at the NCATSU, $1.86 is spent on a student at the NCSU.\n\nThis situation is common across the US Southeast, as documented in a 2023 report on the status of HBCUs5 from the Century Foundation, a think tank in New York City. Between 1987 and 2020, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas underfunded their HBCUs by $8.5 billion compared with their HWIs, according to letters to the governors of these states, sent in September 2023 by Miguel Cardona, secretary of education and Thomas Vilsack, secretary of agriculture. The NCSU and the NCATSU have a $2-billion funding disparity, one letter said. The federal government has never forced states to fund white and Black higher education equitably, and it has never denied funds to states that continue discriminatory funding practices.\n\nBiden must keep funding pledge to historically Black colleges and universities\n\nThis historical underfunding has produced an environment in which HCBU faculty members have to shoulder disproportionately heavy teaching loads, advise more students — many of whom are underprepared — and operate in facilities that are ill-suited for twenty-first century instruction and research in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). HBCUs operate on shoestring budgets, so they have fewer resources for research, teaching and student and community programmes. Owing to budgetary shortfalls, administrators at HBCUs often have to delay purchasing or repairing much-needed technology and infrastructure. For example, in January 2024, the central heating plant at the NCATSU failed, so the institution had to house students in hotels or send them home.",

The World RePORT project, which tracks global health-research spending, showed that, in 2022, the NIH spent 25 times more on grants than did the next biggest funder — the London-based charity Wellcome — that reported data to the initiative (see ‘World leader’).\n\nSource: World RePORT\n\nUS biomedical science dominates the world in terms of papers, discovery and drugs, says Miriam Merad, a cancer immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, who receives funding from the NIH and other sources (see ‘Publication prowess’). Merad points to a study1 that shows that NIH-funded research contributed to 354 of 356 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010–19.\n\n“Without NIH, there would be no cancer immunotherapy, no anti-overdose medication, no anti-heart attack or stroke medication, no cutting-edge treatments,” addiction researcher Olivier George at the University of California, San Diego, tweeted in February.\n\nSource: PubMed\n\nThe cuts mean “drug discovery is going to slow down, for sure”, says Merad. She is working with colleagues on new drugs, the development of which they will have to pause if they don’t have certainty on funding soon. “This is the type of thing that’s happening across the country.”\n\nThe NIH’s approach to funding scientists is unique in the world, says Merad. NIH grants often allow researchers to focus on scientific problems for four or five years without the need to raise further funds, she says. That provides freedom and stability that is not typically available in other regions, such as Europe, or in industry. “They trust the brain, the mind, the intellect of the people they fund. In industry, you don’t have the luxury to pivot, you are constantly constrained.”\n\nThe NIH’s “support to basic biomedical research enables fundamental breakthroughs, the path to which would be considered too risky for any venture capitals or biopharmaceutical companies”, says Wang.",

          "abstract": "Washington DC. Boston, Massachusetts. Denver, Colorado. Seattle, Washington. Trenton, New Jersey\n\nThousands of researchers and supporters of science protested in cities across the United States and Europe today against actions taken by the administration of US President Donald Trump to cut the US scientific workforce and slash spending on research worldwide.\n\nUS science is under threat ― now scientists are fighting back\n\nThe mood was defiant at many of the rallies, where chants of “Scientists will not be silenced”, “Facts over fear” and “What do we want? Peer review! When do we want it? Now!” were heard.\n\nQuoting musician Bob Marley, Rush Holt Jr, former chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, told the crowd in Trenton, New Jersey, “get up, stand up”.\n\nIn the crowd at Boston’s rally, Ana-Maria Vranceanu, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School whose work helps people with dementia, chronic pain and other conditions, said: “This is the time to actually stop this, before things get really bad.”\n\nOver the past month, “I’ve been waiting for someone to do something”, said Abraham Flaxman, a global-health metrics researcher at the University of Washington, who attended the Seattle rally. But “it’s dawned on me: nobody is coming to save us. We’re going to have to save ourselves”.\n\nMarie Walde, a biophysicist at the Roscoff Biological Station in France, posted about a rally she attended to the social-media platform BlueSky, saying: “In solidarity with our colleagues in the US, researchers and citizens all over France are protesting today for science and knowledge as a public good.”\n\n‘A five-alarm fire’\n\nThe Stand Up for Science rallies are a response to the Trump administration’s siege of the US research enterprise. Since taking office in January, Trump and his team have laid off, and in some cases then tried to rehire, thousands of employees at US science agencies, whose jobs involved nuclear safety, bird flu surveillance, extreme-weather forecasting and more. The administration has also attempted to freeze research grants at science-funding agencies, including the US National Science Foundation. And it has tried to slash ‘overhead costs’ awarded to biomedical research institutions by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) — although federal judges have since blocked this action. This week, Nature revealed that, under Trump, the NIH — the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research — has begun a mass termination of active research grants for projects studying certain topics, including the health of transgender populations, that do not align with the administration’s political ideology.\n\nProtesters took to the streets in Paris, to stand in solidarity with US scientists.Credit: Mohamad Salaheldin Abdelg Alsayed/Anadolu via Getty\n\nBewildered by these moves and wondering why people weren’t visibly ‘standing up for science’, five US researchers decided to organize today’s rallies. “This is a five-alarm fire,” says co-organizer Colette Delawalla, a psychologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. “If we don’t set down our work and turn attention to these matters”, and try to make policy changes, “there will not be science for us to come back to”, she says.\n\nBut the organizers know from past protests, such as the international March for Science in 2017 — which was organized by researchers critical of policies from Trump’s first presidency — that rallies alone will not effect change. “It’s not a one-and-done thing,” says Samantha Goldstein, who studies women’s health at the University of Florida in Gainesville and is one of the Stand Up for Science organizers. She adds: the organizers will continue to “be around, making sure our policy goals and demands are fulfilled — that’s what’s important”.\n\nA generation lost\n\nAt a number of the rallies today, speakers and attendees were worried about the chilling effect that the Trump administration’s actions will have on future science and scientists.\n\nIn Boston, Nancy Kanwisher, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, told the crowd: “You can’t just fire everyone and then rehire them when you need them. A generation of scientists will have been lost.”\n\nA demonstrator holds a sign at the rally in Washington Square Park, New York City.Credit: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty\n\nAtul Gawande, a public-health researcher and former assistant administrator at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), told the crowd in Washington DC that he has watched scientists get fired from their dream jobs, walking out carrying the remnants of their careers in boxes. (The Trump administration has fired thousands of workers from the USAID, which funds overseas health programmes and disaster-relief efforts, saying that it had been run by “radical left lunatics” and is party to “tremendous fraud”.) Scientists are being targeted, because “science doesn’t always give the answers that power wants”, Gawande said.\n\nOthers expressed anger at the way scientists are being treated. “I’m a scientist and I’m pissed off,” says Carolee Caffrey, a behavioural ecologist at Rider University in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, who was welcoming people to the Trenton rally. “I’m all the ‘D’ words: dismayed, depressed, disgusted.”\n\nSome viewed the rallies as a safe outlet for scientists to voice their feelings. Valerie H., who declined to give her full name for fear of reprisal, is a software engineer who works in crop science. Recent mass firings at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies have had a huge impact on her research. “I know hundreds of people on LinkedIn who are looking for work,” she said at the Denver rally. “People are glad to have a place to come say something.”",

          "abstract": "We’ve seen the headlines: on 14 February, the US Department of Education ruled that race-based scholarships and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes violate civil-rights law. Universities that don’t dismantle these programmes risk losing federal funding.\n\nThis is not an abstract threat. It is an orchestrated effort to erase decades of progress — the very infrastructure that has helped under-represented students to access, navigate and succeed in spaces that were never built for them. And it’s not just in the United States. Rollbacks are also taking place in parts of Europe, for example.\n\nThe question is not whether institutions will comply, but which ones will fight back — and how.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nIf universities, faculty members and students allow this ruling to take root, the consequences will extend beyond campus walls. Anti-inclusion policies risk severing international collaborations and global-talent pipelines, stifling innovation and weakening research partnerships.\n\nSilence is complicity. The administration of US President Donald Trump is betting on universities weighing up the cost of speaking out and deciding that federal funding is worth more than their commitment to equity. But the cost of inaction is greater. Compliance won’t just dismantle crucial programmes, it will signal that universities are prepared to abandon their values the moment they are tested.\n\nHigher education must not back down. But to win this fight, universities need a plan. For starters, they must reject the anti-DEI directive — clearly and unequivocally. No vague corporate messaging. No strategic hedging. Their statements must affirm that DEI programmes expand opportunities, rather than take them away.\n\nUniversities have taken a stand on this topic before. On 29 June 2023, just an hour after the US Supreme Court struck down race-conscious admissions, Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reaffirmed its commitment to such initiatives. In January 2024, Princeton University in New Jersey voiced its steadfast support for DEI initiatives amid nationwide attacks. Similar pressure must be applied now.\n\nTrump 2.0: an assault on science anywhere is an assault on science everywhere\n\nFaculty members hold more power than many realize. Without their labour, research and expertise, universities cannot function. The US administration might hope that academics will remain siloed, too consumed with their own work — or too afraid — to resist. However, if faculty members unite across institutions, they can become a force that the federal government cannot ignore.\n\nBut words won’t be enough. Faculty senates must formally call on universities to refuse compliance. Such resolutions aren’t just symbolic — they create a record that can be cited in lawsuits, the media and advocacy.\n\nIf faculty members are to take a stand, universities must back them up — protecting academic freedom, defending academics against retaliation and refusing to cave in to intimidation. Many faculty members are their family’s sole breadwinner. Others have been personally targeted or smeared in public campaigns. For some, organizing against this directive would not be just an act of resistance, it would be an act of professional and personal risk.\n\nFaculty members must also educate the public. This isn’t only about fairness — it’s about the global workforce. A diverse, well-educated talent pool fuels innovation and economic growth. The effects of access to higher education being narrowed down will ripple through industry and global research collaborations.\n\n‘Despair is not an option’ — how scientists can help protect federal research",

Now researchers have devised a machine-learning technique that could trigger such an observing campaign even before the collision occurs — and enable telescopes to watch how stars collide in real time.\n\nFive new ways to catch gravitational waves — and the secrets they’ll reveal\n\nThe algorithm was trained on simulations of the data that a gravitational-wave observatory collects in the minutes before two neutron stars merge, which creates a rarely observed event called a kilonova. These events are thought to produce some of the Universe’s heavier elements including gold, platinum and uranium. It would enable such observatories to alert other astronomers that a collision is about to happen at a given time and location in the sky, with 30% more accuracy than existing rapid-response techniques.\n\n“The combination of speed and accuracy in the localization presented in this paper is actually fantastic,” says Mansi Kasliwal, an astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The results are described in Nature1 on 5 March.\n\nSpiralling stars\n\nNeutron stars are the remnants of massive stars that collapsed at the end of their lifetimes, compressing more than a Sun’s worth of mass into a dense ball of neutrons just 20 kilometres or so across. Occasionally, neutron stars orbit each other in pairs, or binaries. If their orbit is tight enough, the effects of Einstein’s general theory of relativity kick in, and the binary starts to produce gravitational waves — ripples in the shape of space-time. By doing so, the stars lose energy and spiral into each other until they merge.\n\nResearchers have observed only a handful of neutron-star mergers, and only on one occasion — the 2017 event — has the merger also been seen by non-gravitational-wave observatories such as telescopes and γ-ray-burst detectors.\n\nLocation accuracy",

          "abstract": "A region in the brainstem, called the median raphe nucleus, contains neurons that control perseverance and exploration.Credit: K H Fung/Science Photo Library\n\nWhether mice persist with a task, explore new options or give up comes down to the activity of three types of neuron in the brain.\n\nIn experiments, researchers at University College London (UCL) were able to control the three behaviours by switching the neurons on and off in a part of the animals’ brainstem called the median raphe nucleus. The findings are reported in Nature today1.\n\n“It’s quite remarkable that manipulation of specific neural subtypes in the median raphe nucleus mediates certain strategic behaviours,” says neuroscientist Roger Marek at the Queensland Brain Institute in Brisbane, Australia, who was not involved in the work.\n\nWhether these behaviours are controlled in the same way in humans needs to be confirmed, but if they are, this could be relevant to certain neuropsychiatric conditions that are associated with imbalances in the three behavioural strategies, says Sonja Hofer, a co-author of the paper and a systems neuroscientist at UCL.\n\nFor instance, an overly high drive to persist with familiar actions and repetitive behaviours can be observed in people with obsessive–compulsive disorder and autism, she says. Conversely, pathological disengagement and lack of motivation are symptoms of major depressive disorder, and an excessive drive to explore and inability to persevere with a task is seen in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. “It could be that changes in the firing rate of specific median raphe cell types could contribute to certain aspects of these conditions,” says Hofer.\n\nLight ‘switch’\n\nThe researchers genetically engineered the three types of neuron — which release the neurotransmitters GABA, glutamate and serotonin — in the median raphe nucleus of mice to express a light-responsive protein, which meant the neurons could be switched on and off using light. Mice were then placed in a box with 20 objects they had never seen before.\n\nA group of control mice spent roughly equal amounts of time pursuing each of the three strategies: persisting in their interaction with one object by grabbing, carrying or biting it; exploring their options by interacting with many objects over a short period of time; or ignoring the objects and disengaging.\n\nWhen the researchers suppressed GABA-releasing, or GABAergic, neurons, mice persisted with individual objects for longer and switched between objects less frequently than control mice did. By comparison, activating the glutamatergic neurons — even for just two seconds — caused mice to spend more time leaping from one object to another in quick succession, indicating increased exploration.\n\nEven brief suppression of serotonergic neurons triggered the mice to spend more time in a disengaged state. The study also found that a midbrain region called the lateral habenula was involved in suppressing serotonergic neurons in the median raphe nucleus, causing the mice to disengage from tasks.\n\n“This is a really elegant and intriguing study,” says behavioural neuroscientist Mark Walton at the University of Oxford, UK.",

Credit: Daniel Munoz/AFP/Getty\n\nPostdoctoral students, graduate students and other junior scientists in large research groups are more likely to drop out of academia than are their peers in smaller groups, according to a new study of more than one million early-career researchers.\n\nBut the analysis also found that researchers trained in large groups who stay in academia have more career success. The work was published Monday in Nature Human Behaviour, amid a mass exodus of scientists from academia and a mental-health crisis among PhD students.\n\nThe findings are consistent with past anecdotal studies and survey results, but this is the first attempt to quantify the effects of different types of scientific mentorship, says co-author Roberta Sinatra, a social-data scientist at the University of Copenhagen.\n\n“I hope that this helps guide the choices of PhD students,” she says.\n\nBurnout and dropout\n\nSinatra and her team analysed academic mentorship networks using two data sets: the crowd-sourced website Academic Family Tree, which includes global records of scientists, their advisers and their students in more than 50 academic fields, and the online research catalog OpenAlex, which features records of authors and their papers, institutions and citations. Their final data set included about 1.5 million scientists and 1.8 million mentorships in chemistry, physics and neuroscience. These fields had enough long-term data for the authors’ analysis and are heavily represented in the family-tree website.\n\nThe results showed that the percentage of researchers who remain in science for at least ten years is lower for those who were trained in big groups than for those who were trained in small groups (see ‘Survival advantage’). Between the 1980s and 1995, for example, the “survival rate” of big-group protégés was 38–48% lower than that of their small-group counterparts.\n\nHowever, the big-group scientists publish papers that score higher on an index measuring average citations per year, and are more likely to be ranked among the most-cited scientists.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nTo understand why some big-group protégés succeed, the study’s authors examined papers on which a protégé was the first author and their mentor was the last author ― which suggests that the trainee had received substantial attention from their mentor. Big-group scientists who survived in academia had published “notably” more of these first-author papers than had the dropouts, the paper says.\n\n“Now we also have quantitative evidence that attention is important,” says Sinatra. “It’s not simply speculation.”\n\nHow a lab is like a city",

          "abstract": "Women usually have two X chromosomes (shown here in an artist’s rendering), and one of them is inactivated early in development.Credit: Cavallini James/BSIP/Alamy\n\nWomen tend to live longer than men and are often more resilient to cognitive decline as they age. Now researchers might have uncovered a source for this resilience: the second X chromosome in female cells that was previously considered ‘silent’.\n\nWhy the sexes don’t feel pain the same way\n\nIn work published today in the journal Science Advances1, a team reports that, at least in female mice, ageing activates expression of genes on what is usually the ‘silent’, or inactivated, X chromosome in cells in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial to learning and memory. And when the researchers gave mature mice of both sexes a type of gene therapy to boost expression of one of those genes, it improved their cognition, as measured by how well they explored a maze. Assuming these results can be confirmed in humans, the team suggests it could mean that women’s brains are being protected by their second X chromosome as they age — and that the finding could translate into future therapies boosting cognition for everyone.\n\n“The X chromosome is powerful,” says Rachel Buckley, a neurologist who studies sex differences in Alzheimer’s disease at Massachusetts General Hospital in Charlestown, and who was not involved in the research. This kind of work, she says, is helping researchers to understand “where female resilience lies and how to harness it”.\n\n(This article uses ‘women’ and ‘female’ to describe people with two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, reflecting the language of the study. Nature recognizes that not all people who identify as women have this chromosomal make-up.)\n\nDouble dose\n\nFemale cells typically have two X chromosomes, one from each parent; male cells usually have one X and one Y. Early in development, one of the two X chromosomes in female cells is inactivated — coated in various proteins and RNA molecules that prevent its genes from being expressed. Which one is ‘silenced’ — meaning which parent it comes from — is random, and the tissues in the body are a mosaic of both types.\n\nWhy autoimmune disease is more common in women: X chromosome holds clues\n\nIn theory, female and male cells both have an X chromosome that is active, so female cells have “the same dose of X chromosome as a male cell”, says Dena Dubal, a neuroscientist and neurologist at the University of California School of Medicine in San Francisco, who led the study. But scientists are learning that it’s not so simple. Dubal says that about 30% of the genes on the so-called silent X chromosome in people are active — although that percentage varies among women. Still, scientists know little about how expression of genes on the less-active X chromosome changes from tissue to tissue in the body, or how it shifts with age.\n\nTo study this in the mouse brain, Dubal’s team bred two types of laboratory mice to produce offspring with one X chromosome from each. The chromosomes were engineered such that one would always be the active X and the other would always be inactivated, and small genetic differences in the chromosomes would allow them to be identified in lab tests. Then the researchers tracked the activity of both X chromosomes in nine major cell types, including neurons, found in the hippocampus of both young and old mice.",

          "authors": "Dyani Lewis",
          "abstract": "Credit: Adam Gault/OJO Images via Getty\n\nResearchers who are accused of sexual misconduct start to receive fewer citations after the media covers the allegations. But the same cannot be said about scientists publicly accused of scientific fraud, whose citations remain unchanged, according to an analysis published this week in PLoS ONE1.\n\nIn the wake of the #MeToo movement that uncovered perpetrators of sexual harassment in Hollywood and other industries, including science, Giulia Maimone, a behavioural scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, wanted to know whether researchers in STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics — and the social sciences were avoiding the work of those accused of sexual harassment.\n\nShe and her colleagues compared citations for 15 researchers in the three years after they were publicly accused of sexual misconduct, with those of 15 researchers accused of data fabrication and other scientific misconduct and of 142 researchers who had not received any of such allegation. Their prediction: that scholars accused of scientific fraud would incur a greater penalty because the misconduct calls into question the merit of that person’s scientific work. “That’s not at all what we found,” says Maimone. “We were very surprised.”\n\nCitations of alleged sexual harassers fell in the aftermath of an allegation going public. But those of scientists accused of scientific misconduct held steady, even though publication rates fell for both categories.\n\n“It’s really valuable to have a study like this that looks at citational practices,” says Anna Bull, a sociologist at the University of York, UK, who studies sexual harassment in higher education. She says that the results could be a sign that attitudes towards sexual misconduct in science are changing.\n\nBut she says that the cases analysed — selected because the allegations had appeared in media reports and the accused had accrued at least 200 citations over the study period — probably represent only the severest forms of sexual misconduct. “In order for things to come out [in the media], they must be pretty egregious,” she says, noting that in many places, including the United Kingdom and European Union, few sexual-misconduct allegations reach the media owing to defamation laws.\n\nElisabeth Bik, a research-integrity consultant based in California, says that although it is good that peoples’ aversion to sexual misconduct is being reflected in the scientific community, it is concerning that there was no drop in citations for research misconduct. But she says that in cases of scientific misconduct, “it is often not clear who is responsible”, and papers might also be cited as examples of misconduct.\n\nBehavioural blind-spot\n\nThe reasons why researchers are choosing not to cite colleagues accused of sexual misconduct are unclear. They could be deliberately punishing sexual harassers by withholding citations, or they might want to preserve their own reputation, says Bull, or “maybe even both”.\n\nMaimone also says that researchers might not realize that they are punishing alleged sexual harassers more than they are scientific fraudsters.\n\nAs part of their study, she and her colleagues also surveyed 240 STEM and social-science researchers, and 231 non-academics about their attitudes towards sexual harassment and scientific misconduct.\n\nAt least 90% of non-academics said that sexual misconduct was more disgusting than scientific fraud, and three-quarters said it was more deserving of punishment. But 85% of academics surveyed said that if forced to choose, they would rather cite the article published by the sexual harasser than the fraudster. But given that the study shows that citations of scientists accused of harassment drop more than those of researchers accused of fraud, Maimone says that scientists might be overestimating their ability to judge the merit of scientific findings without considering who produced those findings.",

          "abstract": "Shai Berman and Tessa Montague need to carry their teaching materials in clear prison-issue bags when they help inmates to earn undergraduate degrees.Credit: Thomas Barlow\n\nFifty minutes north of Manhattan by train lies Sing Sing Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison for men. Sing Sing is one of the oldest and most notorious prisons in the United States. Its massive stone blocks and barbed-wire fences sit on a hill overlooking the Hudson Valley. Beyond its heavy metal gates is a group of students, largely invisible to the rest of the country, earning their undergraduate degrees. Every Monday afternoon, the two of us take the train, pass through those gates, and spend two hours teaching an “introduction to neuroscience” class to those students.\n\nTeaching in a prison comes with many challenges, but it has been one of the highlights of our professional careers. Here we describe our experience as postdoctoral fellows at New York City’s Columbia University providing instruction at Sing Sing, in partnership with Hudson Link, a non-profit organization that offers university programmes in various prisons in New York state, and Columbia’s Center for Justice, an organization that seeks to change how justice is approached through education, policy and research.\n\nThe US prison system and education\n\nThe United States is a nation of mass incarceration. There are some 1.9 million people behind bars in the country, and 14% of adults have an immediate family member who has been incarcerated for at least a year. This crisis has a disproportionate impact on low-income people, particularly in Black and Latino communities, which are affected by systemic racism and inequalities that lead to higher rates of arrest and conviction, and harsher sentences. Hudson Link and other organizations across the country are trying to disrupt the cycle and impact of incarceration in communities by providing higher-education opportunities to incarcerated individuals. Statistically speaking, education has a massive impact. In the United States, 67% of formerly incarcerated people return to prison within three years of their release, whereas less than 2% of Hudson Link graduates do.\n\nWe teach our course through Columbia University’s Prison Education Program. Official credits from this programme count towards associate’s and bachelor’s degrees. Diplomas awarded inside prison are exactly the same as those awarded outside. Thus, it is our job as instructors to provide the same quality and level of instruction to our students while working within the restrictions of the prison setting.\n\nEntering prison\n\nTo enter Sing Sing each week, we check our phones into a depot and then wait in front of the heavy gate to be called for security screening. Above us, an ornate sign reads “Through these doors pass some of the finest correctional professionals in the world”. Security is similar to that at an airport, except that our attire is inspected: only loose, professional clothing can be worn; no bold jewellery is permitted, nor anything green, which could be confused for the prison uniforms. Our possessions must be carried in prison-issue clear bags so that the contents can be inspected for contraband. We receive an ultraviolet stamp on our hand, which will be checked when we exit the prison. We then proceed to the school building in a minivan, sparing us a three-minute walk. We are assured that every step in this process is a precaution shaped by hard-learnt lessons.\n\nIn the classroom\n\nPreparation begins long before we enter the classroom. We are not allowed to take any technology into the prison. This is a challenge both for the students, who cannot use Google or ChatGPT, and for us, because we’ve grown accustomed to teaching with presentations and video demonstrations (how can you communicate flashing neurons with chalk?).\n\nFurthermore, all materials have to be submitted months in advance to be approved by prison leadership. To address these constraints, we created a custom textbook for the class, in which each chapter is a different lesson (such as the motor system, emotion and the use of animal models), and there is enough information for students to learn the material even if a class is cancelled or cut short (which they frequently are). Once we’re in the classroom, we teach everything using a blackboard, and then hand out homework, to be collected the following week. We have no means of communicating with students outside class, so the cycle of feedback is slow: by the time they receive feedback, they have already submitted another assignment. And learning about the brain tends to raise more questions than it answers — we are constantly trying to strike a balance between sticking to the planned material and going on an interesting side quest brought about by a student’s question.\n\nThe students\n\nWe have taught at both Sing Sing and Taconic Correctional Facility (a medium-security women’s prison), and the students are the best we’ve ever worked with. Students range in age from early 20s to late 60s, and their sentences probably range from less than 5 years to more than 50. One might try to guess (or actively find out) what the circumstances were that led to these long sentences. However, to us it ultimately doesn’t matter: we have found every student to be warm, laser focused and curious. There are no distractions from phones or laptops — a teacher’s dream. One of the main challenges is how to teach an intense scientific course to students with diverse educational backgrounds and lived experiences. We haven’t solved the problem, but we create homework sets that partly test the knowledge obtained in class, and partly provide the students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge and creativity to the design of experiments.",

          "title": "Are microplastics bad for your health? More rigorous science is needed",
          "authors": "Jun-Li Xu, Stephanie Wright, Cassandra Rauert, Kevin V. Thomas",
          "abstract": "In March last year, researchers found that among a group of nearly 300 participants, people who had higher concentrations of plastics in deposits of fat in their arteries (arterial plaques) were more likely to experience heart attacks or strokes, and more likely to die as a result, than those in whom plastics were not detected1. Since it was published, the New England Journal of Medicine study has been mentioned more than 6,600 times on social media and more than 800 times in news articles and blogs.\n\nThe issue of whether plastics are entering human tissues and what impacts they might have on health is understandably of great interest to scientists, industry and society. Indeed, for the past few years there have been news stories almost every month about peer-reviewed articles that have reported findings of plastic particles in all sorts of human tissues and bodily fluids — including the lungs, heart, penis, placenta and breast milk. And in multiple countries, policymakers are being urged to implement measures to limit people’s exposure to nanoplastics and microplastics.\n\nA plastics treaty is urgently needed, but getting it right will take time\n\nMany of the studies conducted so far, however, rely on small sample sizes (typically 20–50 samples) and lack appropriate controls. Modern laboratories are themselves hotspots of nanoplastic and microplastic pollution, and the approaches that are being used to detect plastics make it hard to rule out the possibility of contamination, or prove definitively that plastics are in a sample. Also, many findings are not biologically plausible based on what is known — mainly from nanomedicine — about the movement of tiny particles within the human body.\n\nFor an emerging area of research, such problems are unsurprising. But without more rigorous standards, transparency and collaboration — among researchers, policymakers and industrial stakeholders — a cycle of misinformation and ineffective regulation could undermine efforts to protect both human health and the environment.\n\nPlastic, plastic everywhere\n\nSince the term ‘microplastic’ — used to describe plastic particles less than five millimetres long — was introduced in 2004, microplastics have been found not just in the oceans but also in lakes and rivers, soils, food and air. In a study published last year, researchers estimated that people in Denmark inhale about 3,400 microplastic particles every day when indoors2.\n\nAssessing how these tiny particles behave in the human body and whether they accumulate over time requires first identifying and quantifying plastics in blood and tissue samples. To do this, many researchers use pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS), in which high temperatures (around 600–700 °C) break down plastics into smaller organic molecules. The resulting mix of molecules and the amount of each one provides a ‘signature’ that researchers can use to establish whether a certain plastic was in the original sample.\n\nBut there are limitations with this approach.\n\nPolyethylene is often the most common plastic that is found in human tissues.Credit: Leonard Ortiz/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty\n\nEven after samples have been treated, for instance with enzymes, to remove biological material, some residue can remain. And some compounds that indicate the presence of plastics can be produced when non-plastic substances are pyrolysed. Fatty acids, such as triglycerides, can break down into the same compounds as polyethylene3. Polyethylene is often the most commonly reported plastic in human-tissue studies using Py-GCMS4–6, although this is not the case for all studies that have used this method7,8.\n\nLikewise, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which is often used in combination with scanning electron microscopy, can reveal the presence of carbon-based molecules. But it identifies only what elements are present in a sample, not molecular structures — meaning that it can only suggest the presence of plastics.\n\nAnother issue with some of the data generated so far is that they don’t make sense biologically.\n\nIn a study9 published last month, researchers examined 91 brains from autopsied bodies and found that plastics made up 0.65% of the brain on average. That’s equivalent to saying that each person had around 4.5 polyethylene bottle caps’ worth of plastic in their brain.\n\nOther studies have reported the presence of large plastic particles, measuring up to 3 mm in length, in human blood samples10. One study that found microplastic particles 5.5–26.4 micrometres in size and synthetic fibres 19–24.5 µm in length in brain tissue, suggested that microplastics that are inhaled through the nose can travel along nerves to the olfactory bulb in the brain11.\n\nHow to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work\n\nYet, previous research suggests that particles bigger than 1 µm are probably too large to pass through the lung’s air–blood barrier, and any particle bigger than 10 µm is probably too large to pass through the gut–blood barrier12,13.\n\nWithout convincing mechanistic explanations of how larger particles might bypass biological barriers, it is difficult to accept conclusions that particles larger than 10 µm have entered human tissue.\n\nEven when, say, through the use of multiple approaches, it is clear that plastics are present in a sample, there is a high possibility that the sample could have been contaminated with nanoplastics or microplastics at each stage of the research — from sampling and transportation to storage, processing and analysis. Human-tissue samples are often collected in clinical settings in which plastics are commonly used, and intravenous infusion equipment that is used to deliver medication can shed microplastics into a person’s bloodstream. Also, because different researchers use different sampling strategies, materials and analytical approaches, it is hard to compare results across studies. Some laboratories use stainless-steel chambers, for instance, and try to minimize plastic contamination; others use plastic equipment to process their samples.",

          "abstract": "The Athena lander touched down in the region around the lunar south pole (pictured) on 6 March as planned, but its health is uncertain. Credit: Dave Tyler/Galaxy/Alamy\n\nUpdate: Intuitive Machines announced on 7 March that the Athena spacecraft had landed on its side in a lunar crater and has run out of power. The mission is over, because it has no way to recharge its batteries. “Teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission,” the company said, including on the NASA ice drill that was the main reason for going to the lunar south pole.\n\nThe latest attempt to land on the Moon went at least partially awry on 6 March, when an ice-seeking spacecraft named Athena apparently landed off-kilter near the lunar south pole.\n\nThe precise status of Athena, which was built by Intuitive Machines in Houston, Texas, remained unclear in the hours after touchdown, but “we don’t believe we’re in the correct attitude”, Stephen Altemus, chief executive of Intuitive Machines, said at a post-landing press conference. Last year, the first spacecraft that the company tried to land on the Moon also set down askew, although it did accomplish some science.\n\nThis was the second lunar disappointment this week. NASA reported on 4 March that communication problems would keep its Lunar Trailblazer probe from entering its planned science orbit around the Moon. But not all the news is bad: a third lunar craft, built by Firefly Aerospace in Cedar Park, Texas, made a safe arrival on 2 March.\n\nMoon mystery\n\nAltemus said the company is working to acquire images from Athena’s several cameras and determine which parts are damaged and which are functional, and that more information will be available in the coming hours and days. At least for now, the spacecraft is getting power, and mission controllers have been able to communicate with the science payloads on board, he said.\n\nPrivate companies are flocking to the Moon — what does that mean for science?\n\nDepending on its position on the lunar surface, Athena might still be able to perform some of its activities. To have enough power to keep operating, it needs to have at least one solar panel oriented to catch sunlight. The Sun stays close to the lunar horizon at the craft’s landing site, and Athena is meant to operate until sunset at the site, roughly ten days after touchdown.\n\nBut the mission’s main purpose — hunting for ice — might not be accomplished. A drill aboard Athena that was meant to bore into the lunar soil to find ice cannot operate unless it is close to upright. “We’re looking forward to hearing what we have to work with,” said Nicola Fox, NASA’s associate administrator for science, at the press conference. The success of other components, such as three rovers and an ice-sniffing robotic ‘hopper’ meant to hop into shadowy craters, also depends on Athena’s position.\n\nSpotty record\n\nThe outlook is also grim for Lunar Trailblazer’s mission to create high-resolution maps of water on the lunar surface. Trailblazer launched successfully alongside Athena on 26 February, but the NASA team “believes the spacecraft is spinning slowly in a low-power state”, the agency reported on 4 March. If mission controllers can restore communications in the coming days, they might be able to put Trailblazer into a less-than-optimal lunar orbit and eke out at least a little of its planned science.",

However, we also discuss how some of the factors that enable prosocial behaviour can also empower malicious actors—as well as the challenge of creating prosocial behaviour that is sustainable and impactful offline. We then propose a research agenda to help scholars, policymakers and corporate leaders to identify the causal factors that shape prosocial behaviour on social media. This agenda focuses on (1) the size and shape of social networks, (2) platform affordances, (3) social norms and (4) how prosocial behaviour can be embedded within existing and future business models of social media.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a unified computational framework connecting acoustic, speech and word-level linguistic structures to study the neural basis of everyday conversations in the human brain. We used electrocorticography to record neural signals across 100 h of speech production and comprehension as participants engaged in open-ended real-life conversations. We extracted low-level acoustic, mid-level speech and contextual word embeddings from a multimodal speech-to-text model (Whisper). We developed encoding models that linearly map these embeddings onto brain activity during speech production and comprehension. Remarkably, this model accurately predicts neural activity at each level of the language processing hierarchy across hours of new conversations not used in training the model. The internal processing hierarchy in the model is aligned with the cortical hierarchy for speech and language processing, where sensory and motor regions better align with the model’s speech embeddings, and higher-level language areas better align with the model’s language embeddings. The Whisper model captures the temporal sequence of language-to-speech encoding before word articulation (speech production) and speech-to-language encoding post articulation (speech comprehension). The embeddings learned by this model outperform symbolic models in capturing neural activity supporting natural speech and language. These findings support a paradigm shift towards unified computational models that capture the entire processing hierarchy for speech comprehension and production in real-world conversations.",

In human participants, imaginations can be explicitly instructed and reported. Here we investigate hippocampal theta oscillations during real-world and imagined navigation using motion capture and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from individuals with chronically implanted medial temporal lobe electrodes. Our results revealed intermittent theta dynamics, particularly within the hippocampus, encoding spatial information and partitioning navigational routes into linear segments during real-world navigation. During imagined navigation, theta dynamics exhibited similar patterns despite the absence of external cues. A statistical model successfully reconstructed real-world and imagined positions, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human navigation and imagination, with implications for understanding memory in real-world settings.",

          "abstract": "Large language models can now generate political messages as persuasive as those written by humans, raising concerns about how far this persuasiveness may continue to increase with model size. Here, we generate 720 persuasive messages on 10 US political issues from 24 language models spanning several orders of magnitude in size. We then deploy these messages in a large-scale randomized survey experiment ( N = 25,982) to estimate the persuasive capability of each model. Our findings are twofold. First, we find evidence that model persuasiveness is characterized by sharply diminishing returns, such that current frontier models are only slightly more persuasive than models smaller in size by an order of magnitude or more. Second, we find that the association between language model size and persuasiveness shrinks toward zero and is no longer statistically significant once we adjust for mere task completion (coherence, staying on topic), a pattern that highlights task completion as a potential mediator of larger models’ persuasive advantage. Given that current frontier models are already at ceiling on this task completion metric in our setting, taken together, our results suggest that further scaling model size may not much increase the persuasiveness of static LLM-generated political messages.",

          "abstract": "Despite legal protections, discrimination based on sexual orientation remains difficult to detect and measure in labor markets. We present evidence from a field experiment ( N = 1,128) conducted in Australia on a major gig economy platform that allows users to outsource everyday tasks. By manipulating both the sexual orientation of job posters (gay vs. straight male) and physical proximity requirements of tasks (inside vs. outside the home), we identify discrimination against gay profiles and demonstrate a specific mechanism for its emergence: physical proximity. Gay profiles received fewer offers and less engagement, and attracted workers with significantly lower quality ratings, but only for tasks requiring close physical proximity. Additional exploratory analysis further suggests that the results are driven by an anti-gay bias rather than an anti-men or pro-women bias and that discrimination is stronger for tasks with a higher degree of interaction between worker and job poster. Our findings demonstrate how digital labor platforms can perpetuate traditional forms of discrimination, while shedding light on physical proximity as one important mechanism. These results have important implications for users of the gig economy, a sector of increasing importance due to its rapid growth and comparatively lax regulatory frameworks.",

          "abstract": "U.S. Census Bureau officials recently reaffirmed the Bureau’s ongoing efforts to replace the American Community Survey (ACS) public use microdata sample with “fully synthetic” data to protect respondent confidentiality. With the growth of computing power and expansion of private sector data about the population, the Census Bureau has valid concerns about confidentiality threats to public data. The current plan for fully synthetic data, however, threatens a cornerstone of the nation’s scientific infrastructure. Census microdata samples are among the most frequently used sources in social science research, and they are an essential tool for policy formation and planning from the local to the national level. Synthetic census microdata are not suitable for most research and policy applications. There have been no recent attempts to quantify disclosure risk in the ACS microdata, and the sole existing study failed to establish a credible threat for positive identification of ACS respondents by external intruders. I argue that we need new empirical research to pinpoint specific vulnerabilities that could allow an intruder to determine a particular individual’s confidential census responses. If significant vulnerabilities are uncovered, the Census Bureau in partnership with the research community should develop targeted methods for disclosure risk reduction that minimize damage to data usability.",

          "abstract": "Visually guided grasping is a fundamental building block of animal behavior, the specific neural mechanisms of which remain poorly documented in the human brain. We have mapped the causal contribution of different brain parts to grasping behavior by studying the kinematic parameters of 33 patients with brain tumors, engaged in actions directed toward objects of different sizes. Using motion capture techniques, we analyzed the dynamics of grip aperture and wrist transport. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis was applied to correlate lesion volumes with specific behavioral deficits. Results showed that lesions in the anterior and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus produced impaired finger scaling related to object size. Conversely, impaired velocity of finger aperture was associated with lesions in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Grip aperture deficits following dominant hemisphere lesions were bilateral and were unilateral when following nondominant hemisphere lesions. Impaired wrist transport during reaching was associated with lesions in the first segment of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Our work highlights an architecture of the grasping network in humans, with unique species-specific features. We hypothesize a model of human neural architecture in which object geometry for hand preshaping is first coded in the left anterior intraparietal cortex and then shared with the right hemisphere. Execution of the motor program of hand preshaping is then performed by the PMd on the corresponding side.",

Efforts to bring learning to a more local scale indeed lead to valuable insights, however, a general constructive approach to describe local learning goals that is both interpretable and adaptable across diverse tasks is still missing. We have previously formulated a local information processing goal that is highly adaptable and interpretable for a model neuron with compartmental structure. Building on recent advances in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we here derive a corresponding parametric local learning rule, which allows us to introduce “infomorphic” neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility of these networks to perform tasks from supervised, unsupervised, and memory learning. By leveraging the interpretable nature of the PID framework, infomorphic networks represent a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the intricate structure of local learning.",

          "abstract": "Photosynthesis converts solar energy to chemical energy by splitting water molecules and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and carbohydrates with an efficiency that engineers working on solar energy device can only dream of. Photosystem II (PSII) is the enzyme that catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water that occurs during photosynthesis. This oxygen-producing reaction occurs in the Mn 4 Ca cluster found inside the enzyme’s oxygen-evolving center (OEC). Even though the structure and mechanism of action of the OEC have been intensively investigated for many decades, questions still remain about both. The Mn 4 Ca cluster stores the high-energy oxidizing equivalents required for water oxidation so that its own oxidation state depends on its chemical composition, i.e., the number of its oxygen ligands. The issue addressed here is the number of oxygen ligands associated with the Mn 4 Ca cluster after PSII has been exposed to two of the four flashes of light necessary for it to produce an oxygen molecule, PSII 2F. Comparisons of recently published cryo-EM maps and crystallographic OEC-omit maps described here reveal the OEC structure of PSII 2F contains only five internal oxygen ligands, and that the sixth O ligand identified earlier in PSII 2F crystal structures is an artifact caused by model bias. This finding should have a significant impact on our understanding of the mechanism of water oxidation that is catalyzed by PSII because it is incompatible with prevailing high valence paradigm (HVP) models for this process.",

          "abstract": "Our intuition suggests that when a movie is played in reverse, our perception of motion at each location in the reversed movie will be perfectly inverted compared to the original. This intuition is also reflected in classical theoretical and practical models of motion estimation, in which velocity flow fields invert when inputs are reversed in time. However, here we report that this symmetry of motion perception upon time reversal is broken in real visual systems. We designed a set of visual stimuli to investigate time reversal symmetry breaking in the fruit fly Drosophila ’s well-studied optomotor rotation behavior. We identified a suite of stimuli with a wide variety of properties that can uncover broken time reversal symmetry in fly behavioral responses. We then trained neural network models to predict the velocity of scenes with both natural and artificial contrast distributions. Training with naturalistic contrast distributions yielded models that broke time reversal symmetry, even when the training data themselves were time reversal symmetric. We show analytically and numerically that the breaking of time reversal symmetry in the model responses can arise from contrast asymmetry in the training data, but can also arise from other features of the contrast distribution. Furthermore, shallower neural network models can exhibit stronger symmetry breaking than deeper ones, suggesting that less flexible neural networks may be more prone to time reversal symmetry breaking. Overall, these results reveal a surprising feature of biological motion detectors and suggest that it could arise from constrained optimization in natural environments.",

We used LiLac, a lactate biosensor with a quantitative fluorescence-lifetime readout, as a model system to address these questions. X-ray crystal structures and engineered high-affinity metal bridges demonstrate that LiLac exhibits a large interdomain twist motion that pulls the fluorescent protein away from a “sealed,” high-lifetime state in the absence of lactate to a “cracked,” low-lifetime state in its presence.

Here, we investigate how initial population (propagule) size shapes the outcome of community coalescence by systematically mixing eight pairs of in vitro microbial communities at ratios that vary over six orders of magnitude, and we compare our results to neutral ecological theory. Although the composition of the resulting cocultures deviated substantially from neutral expectations, each coculture contained species whose relative abundance depended on propagule size even after ~40 generations of growth. Using a consumer–resource model, we show that this dose-dependent colonization can arise when resident and introduced species have high niche overlap and consume shared resources at similar rates. Strain isolates displayed longer-lasting dose dependence when introduced into diverse communities than in pairwise cocultures, consistent with our model’s prediction that propagule size should have larger, more persistent effects in diverse communities. Our model also successfully predicted that species with similar resource-utilization profiles, as inferred from growth in spent media and untargeted metabolomics, would show stronger dose dependence in pairwise coculture. This work demonstrates that transient, dose-dependent colonization dynamics can emerge from resource competition and exert long-term effects on the outcomes of community coalescence.",

Preclinical evidence suggests that imbalance of neuroimmune proresolving interactions within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) rather than at the site of inflammation plays mechanistic roles in persistent arthritis pain. Here, we inhibited production of proresolving lipid mediators by silencing 12/15-lipoxygenase expression in CX3CR1 + monocyte/macrophages conditional knockout (cKO) mice. In an arthritis model, hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity is exacerbated in male and female cKO mice in association with DRG infiltration of neutrophils, which migrate in response to leukotriene B 4 released by macrophages through 5-lipoxygenase conversion of arachidonic acid provided by neuron-derived vesicles. Neutrophils apoptosis promotes primary macrophage efferocytosis which is defective in cKO macrophages. In wild-type (WT) and cKO mice, intrathecal injection of MerTK activating antibody, attenuates persistent hypersensitivity and polarizes DRG macrophages toward a proresolving phenotype with production of antinociceptive lipoxin A 4 . Thus, we delineate a neuron–macrophage–neutrophil bidirectional circuit that can be exploited to reduce persistent arthritis pain.",

MAF induced drug tolerance in Mtb, remodeled its transcriptome, and protected Mtb from dying in microdroplets desiccating in air. Yet survival was not passive: Mtb appeared to rely on hundreds of genes to survive conditions associated with transmission. Essential genes subserving proteostasis offered most protection.

          "abstract": "The retina is responsible for converting light into electrical signals that, when transmitted to the brain, create the sensation of vision. The mammalian retina is epigenetically unique since the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) into retinal cells is accompanied by a decrease in DNA methylation in the promoters of many genes important for retinal development and function. However, the pathway responsible for DNA demethylation and its role in retinal development and function were unknown. We hypothesized that the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases plays a key role in this pathway. To this end, we knocked out the TET family in RPCs and characterized the TET-deficient and control retinas using various approaches including electron microscopy, electroretinogram tests, TUNEL, RNA-seq, WGBS, and 5hmC-Seal. We found that while the TET-dependent DNA demethylation pathway contributes to the development of many retinal cell types, it is the most significant contributor to rod and cone photoreceptor development and function. We found that genetic ablation of TET enzymes in RPCs prevents demethylation and the activity of genes essential for rod specification and for rod and cone maturation. Reduced activity of genes responsible for rod specification results in the TET-deficient retina being depleted of these neurons. Meanwhile, reduced activity of genes responsible for rod and cone maturation leads to the underdevelopment or complete absence of outer segments and synaptic termini in the TET-deficient photoreceptors, which results in loss of their function and leads to blindness. These function-deprived, underdeveloped photoreceptors die over time, leading to retinal dystrophy.",

This OBF13 variant single-chain fragment variable decreases the apparent affinity of IZUMO1 for membrane-bound murine JUNO and blocks the binding of acrosome-reacted sperm to eggs, thereby preventing fertilization. We propose allostery between the OBF13 epitope and the JUNO-binding site. OBF13 inhibits a conformational change in IZUMO1, preventing fusion-competent sperm from adhering to murine eggs during fertilization. Surprisingly, murine IZUMO1 binds to hamster JUNO with an affinity ~20-fold higher than to murine JUNO. The decreased affinity caused by OBF13 of murine IZUMO1 for hamster JUNO is sufficient for murine sperm to bind to and fuse with hamster eggs. Our studies provide a structural and mechanistic framework for species-specific, allosteric inhibition of IZUMO1 by a naturally occurring antisperm antibody and offer insights into the development of immunocontraceptives.",

Here, we generated a toolkit to visualize and quantify signaling in entire cell populations of the periderm, the outermost layer of the epidermis, in live developing zebrafish. We find that oriented cell divisions facilitate growth of the early periderm during axial elongation rather than cell addition from the basal layer. Activity levels of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a downstream effector of the MAPK pathway, gauged by a live biosensor, predict cell cycle entry, and optogenetic ERK activation regulates cell cycling dynamics. As development proceeds, rates of peridermal cell proliferation decrease, and ERK activity becomes more pulsatile and functionally transitions to promote hypertrophic cell growth. Targeted genetic blockade of cell division generates animals with oversized periderm cells, yet, unexpectedly, development to adulthood is not impaired. Our findings reveal stage-dependent differential responsiveness to ERK signaling and marked developmental robustness in growing teleost skin.",

Here, we report that OsWRKY36 suppresses the resistance to insects and pathogens via transcriptional repression of Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyases ( PALs ), a key enzyme in phenylpropanoid pathway in rice. Knocking out OsWRKY36 causes elevated lignin biosynthesis and increased sclerenchyma thickness of leaf sheath, leading to enhanced resistance to multiple pests and pathogens. Additionally, loss of OsWRKY36 also derepresses the transcription of Ideal Plant Architecture 1 ( IPA1 ) and MONOCULM2 ( MOC2 ), resulting in increased spikelet number per panicle and tiller number.

This is particularly related to translocation of actin into nucleus and highlighted in our interpretation of an “abnormal” phenomenon that large RGD nanospacing (&gt;70 nm) disassembles integrin clusters, inhibits cell adhesion, but promotes osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Our studies reveal that the unstable adhesion at the 150 nm RGD distance increases actin dynamics, resulting in the nuclear translocation of globular (G) actin. The compartment polymerization of more G-actins to filamentous actins in nucleus increases nuclear tension, facilitating transcription activity and releasing calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum.

However, it is often nearly impossible to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which a biological isotope effect manifests due to the complexity of these systems. As such, one proposed in vitro system of study for a quantum isotope effect is calcium phosphate aggregation, where symmetric calcium phosphate molecular species, known as Posner molecules, have been theorized to have phosphorus nuclear spin–dependent self-binding rates, which could be differently modulated by doping with stable lithium isotopes. Here, we present in vitro evidence for such a differential lithium isotope effect on the formation and aggregation of amorphous calcium phosphate from solution under certain conditions. Experiments confirm that lithium incorporates into amorphous calcium phosphate, with 7 Li found to promote a greater abundance of observable calcium phosphate particles than 6 Li under identical solution preparations. These in vitro results offer a potential explanation for in vivo biological studies that have shown differential lithium isotope effects. Given the importance of calcium phosphate in biological systems—ranging from mitochondrial signaling pathways to key biomineralization processes, as well as the proposed role of Posner molecules as a “neural qutrit”—these results present an important step in understanding calcium phosphate nucleation as well as the potential role of calcium phosphate for quantum biology and processing.",

Roughness and adhesion are known to constrain the relative motion of particles, and thus globally affect the shear response, but an experimental description of how they microscopically influence the transmission of forces and relative displacements within contacts is lacking. Here, we show that an innovative colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy technique allows the simultaneous measurement of normal and tangential forces exchanged between tailored surfaces and microparticles while tracking their relative sliding and rolling, unlocking the direct measurement of coefficients of rolling friction, as well as of sliding friction. We demonstrate that, in the presence of sufficient traction, particles spontaneously roll, reducing dissipation and promoting longer-lasting contacts. Conversely, when rolling is prevented, friction is greatly enhanced for rough and adhesive surfaces, while smooth particles coated by polymer brushes maintain well-lubricated contacts. We find that surface roughness induces rolling due to load-dependent asperity interlocking, leading to large off-axis particle rotations. In contrast, smooth, adhesive surfaces promote rolling along the principal axis of motion. Our results offer direct values of friction coefficients for numerical studies and an interpretation of the onset of discontinuous shear thickening based on them, opening up ways to tailor rheology via contact engineering.",

To elucidate the functional relevance of these interactions, we developed a mass spectrometry–based screening method for higher throughput in vitro enzyme assays. By systematically quantifying the effects of 79 metabolites on the activity of 20 central Escherichia coli enzymes, we not only assess functional relevance but also gauge the depth of the current understanding of regulatory interactions within one of the best-characterized networks. Our identification of 50 inhibitors and 14 activators not only expands the range of known input signals but also uncovers novel regulatory logic. For instance, we observed that AMP inhibits malic enzyme to safeguard the cyclic operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and erythrose-4-phosphate inhibits 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase to redirect flux from the pentose phosphate pathway into the Entner–Doudoroff pathway. Discrepancies between our standardized assays and existing database entries suggest that many previously reported interactions might occur only under specific, often nonphysiological conditions. Our dataset represents a systematically determined functional protein–metabolite interaction network, establishing a baseline for allosteric regulation in central metabolism. These results enhance our understanding of the regulatory logic governing metabolic processes and underscore its significance in cellular adaptation and growth.",

          "abstract": "Neural crest cells (NCC) comprise a heterogeneous population of cells with variable potency that contribute to nearly every tissue and organ throughout the body. Considered unique to vertebrates, NCC are transiently generated within the dorsolateral region of the neural plate or neural tube during neurulation. Their delamination and migration are crucial for embryo development as NCC differentiation is influenced by their final resting locations. Previous work in avian and aquatic species revealed that NCC delaminate via an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which transforms these progenitor cells from static polarized epithelial cells into migratory mesenchymal cells with fluid front and back polarity. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms facilitating NCC delamination in mammals are poorly understood. Through time-lapse imaging of NCC delamination in mouse embryos, we identified a subset of cells that exit the neuroepithelium as isolated round cells, which then halt for a short period prior to acquiring the mesenchymal migratory morphology classically associated with delaminating NCC. High-magnification imaging and protein localization analyses of the cytoskeleton, together with measurements of pressure and tension of delaminating NCC and neighboring neuroepithelial cells, revealed that round NCC are extruded from the neuroepithelium prior to completion of EMT. Furthermore, cranial NCC are extruded through activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel, PIEZO1. Our results support a model in which cell density, pressure, and tension in the neuroepithelium result in activation of the live cell extrusion pathway and delamination of a subpopulation of NCC in parallel with EMT, which has implications for cell delamination in development and disease.",

While traditional molecular diagnostics techniques like PCR are highly sensitive, they include nucleic acid amplification and many need to be performed in centralized laboratories, limiting their utility in point-of-care settings. Recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx) have demonstrated the potential for highly specific molecular detection, but the sensitivity is often constrained by the slow trans-cleavage activity of Cas enzymes, necessitating preamplification of target nucleic acids. In this study, we present a CRISPR-Cascade assay that overcomes these limitations by integrating a positive feedback loop that enables nucleic acid amplification-free detection of pathogenic DNA at atto-molar levels and achieves a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1.3 within just 10 min. The versatility of the assay is demonstrated through the detection of bloodstream infection pathogens, including Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli , and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) spiked in whole blood samples. Additionally, we introduce a multiplexing OR-function logic gate, further enhancing the potential of the CRISPR-Cascade assay for rapid and accurate diagnostics in clinical settings.

          "abstract": "While vegetation brings positive benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation, the impact of ongoing global greening remains controversial due to its uncertain effects on hydrological cycle. Here, we quantitatively assess the impact of vegetation dynamics on global water availability by proposing a comprehensive framework to quantify the terrestrial water sink and source scores associated with vegetation dynamics. These scores serve as indicators of whether large alterations in water resources have occurred in the lands due to either the greening or degradation of surface vegetation. We use multisource datasets from climate model projections, remote sensing, and local measurements to examine the impact of vegetation dynamics on water availability over the periods of 1982 to 2019 and 2015 to 2100. During historical observation periods, regions such as India and northern China experienced large depletion of water resources as a result of vegetation greening, leading to water scarcity. In the future, a shift is projected for India and northern China, transforming them into regions capable of meeting water demands arising from vegetation greening. This transition is largely attributed to wetting and warming climates. It indicates that trade-off effects between climate and underlying vegetation dynamics may result in strengthening regional hydrological resilience and ensuring the stable status of local water resources. Furthermore, tropical rainforests (except for the Amazon Rainforest) are experiencing greening with minimal impact on local water resources consistently. These insights are valuable for globally identifying optimal locations to implement ecological restoration, facilitating the balance of sustainable water resources and vegetation greening.",

We analyzed immune, glial, neuronal, and endothelial cell interactions within MS lesions and normal-appearing white matter across two independent cohorts. Our findings show the enrichment of EBV markers, particularly EBNA1 and LMP1, within MS lesions. EBV-positive cells interact closely with reactive astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Image analysis confirmed the presence of EBV-positive staining within neurons and glial cells, suggesting a direct role for EBV in neuronal and glial involvement in MS. Additionally, we observed altered immune cell interactions, including reduced associations with macrophages and memory T cells, and enhanced interactions with glial cells. Disruptions in blood–brain barrier integrity were also noted in regions of the MS brain. These results highlight EBV’s contribution to immune modulation, glial dysfunction, and neuronal damage in MS, particularly in progressive subtypes.

While considered a classic example of gene–culture coevolution, recently doubts have been raised about the link between selection at 2q21.3 and LP. Analysis of additional populations could shed further light; here, we demonstrate that a haplotype spanning ~467 kb at the 2q21.3 locus has risen to high frequency in East Asians (~25%) but is absent from Africans and Europeans. This haplotype likely derived from Neanderthals and has been under positive selection in East Asians. The East Asian–specific haplotype is associated with alterations in LCT expression and promoter methylation in certain cell types, similar to what is observed with LP-associated haplotypes in Europeans. Moreover, its frequency is comparable to that of LP in East Asians, suggesting a potential association with LP in East Asians. However, it is highly unlikely that selection in East Asians was related to milk-drinking habits. We find that this haplotype impacts the expression of UBXN4 , DARS1, and DARS1-AS1 in immune cells and is associated with neutrophil and white blood cell counts. Hence, the selection might be linked to certain aspects of immune function. This implies that selection on 2q21.3 has thus either occurred for different reasons in different populations or the selection observed in other populations is also not due to LP.",

One exception is the Sierra Nevada region, where big trees are declining. Additionally, we observed declines for several individual species.

Excitatory amino acid transporters mediate this process by uptaking the neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft back to the cell after its release. The archaeal homolog, Glt Ph , an aspartate transporter from Pyrococcus horikoshii , presents the best structurally characterized model for this family of transporters. In order to transport, Glt Ph undergoes elevator-like conformational changes between inward-facing (IF) and outward-facing (OF) states. Here, we characterize, at an atomic level, the OF⇌IF transition of Glt Ph in different apo /bound states using a combination of ensemble-based enhanced sampling techniques, employing more than two thousand of coupled simulation replicas of membrane-embedded Glt Ph . The resulting free-energy profiles portray the transition of apo /bound states as a complex four-stage process, while sodium binding alone locks the structure in one of its states. Along the transition, the transport domain (TD) disengages from the scaffold domain (SD), allowing it to move as a piston sliding vertically with respect to the membrane during the elevator-like motion of TD. Lipid interactions with residues comprising the SD–TD interface directly influence the large-scale conformational changes and, consequently, the energetics of transport. Structural intermediates formed during the transition leak water molecules and may correlate to the uncoupled Cl − ion conductance observed experimentally in both prokaryotic and mammalian glutamate transporters.

In semimetals, thermal transport at low-charge carrier density is expected to be phonon dominated, yet several experiments observe giant quantum oscillations in thermal transport. This raises the question of whether there is an overarching mechanism leading to sizable oscillations that survives in phonon-dominated semimetals. In this work, we show that such a mechanism exists. It relies on the peculiar phase-space allowed for phonon scattering by electrons when only a few Landau levels are filled. Our measurements on the Dirac semimetal ZrTe 5 support this counterintuitive mechanism through observation of pronounced thermal quantum oscillations, since they occur in similar magnitude and phase in directions parallel and transverse to the magnetic field. Our phase-space argument applies to all low-density semimetals, topological or not, including graphene and bismuth. Our work illustrates that phonon absorption can be leveraged to reveal degrees of freedom through their imprint on longitudinal thermal transport.",

          "abstract": "UvrD-family helicases are superfamily 1A motor proteins that function during DNA replication, recombination, repair, and transcription. UvrD family monomers translocate along single-stranded (ss) DNA but need to be activated by dimerization to unwind DNA in the absence of force or accessory factors. However, prior structural studies have only revealed monomeric complexes. Here, we report the first structures of a dimeric UvrD-family helicase, Mycobacterium tuberculosis UvrD1, both free and bound to a DNA junction. In each structure, the dimer interface occurs between the 2B subdomains of each subunit. The apo UvrD1 dimer is observed in symmetric compact and extended forms indicating substantial flexibility. This symmetry is broken in the DNA-bound dimer complex with leading and trailing subunits adopting distinct conformations. Biochemical experiments reveal that the Escherichia coli UvrD dimer shares the same 2B–2B interface. In contrast to the dimeric structures, an inactive, autoinhibited UvrD1 DNA-bound monomer structure reveals 2B subdomain–DNA contacts that are likely inhibitory. The major reorientation of the 2B subdomains that occurs upon UvrD1 dimerization prevents these duplex DNA interactions, thus relieving the autoinhibition. These structures reveal that the 2B subdomain serves a major regulatory role rather than participating directly in DNA unwinding.",

          "abstract": "Transmissibility of respiratory viruses is a complex viral trait that is intricately linked to tropism. Several highly transmissible viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Influenza viruses, specifically target multiciliated cells in the upper respiratory tract to facilitate efficient human-to-human transmission. In contrast, the zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) generally transmits poorly between humans, which is largely attributed to the absence of its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in the upper respiratory tract. At the same time, MERS-CoV epidemiology is characterized by occasional superspreading events, suggesting that some individuals can disseminate this virus effectively. Here, we utilized well-differentiated human pulmonary and nasal airway organoid-derived cultures to further delineate the respiratory tropism of MERS-CoV. We find that MERS-CoV replicated to high titers in both pulmonary and nasal airway cultures. Using single-cell messenger-RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry, we show that MERS-CoV preferentially targeted multiciliated cells, leading to loss of ciliary coverage. MERS-CoV cellular tropism was dependent on the differentiation of the organoid-derived cultures, and replication efficiency varied considerably between donors. Similarly, variable and focal expression of DPP4 was revealed in human nose tissues. This study indicates that the upper respiratory tract tropism of MERS-CoV may vary between individuals due to differences in DPP4 expression, providing an explanation for the unpredictable transmission pattern of MERS-CoV.",

The interplay between local and global activity is thought to underlie computational flexibility, yet the structure of multiregion neural activity and its origins in synaptic connectivity remain poorly understood. We investigate recurrent neural networks with multiple regions, each containing neurons with random and structured connections. Inspired by experimental evidence of communication subspaces, we use low-rank connectivity between regions to enable selective activity routing. These networks exhibit high-dimensional fluctuations within regions and low-dimensional signal transmission between them. Using dynamical mean-field theory, with cross-region currents as order parameters, we show that regions act as both generators and transmitters of activity—roles that are often in tension. Taming within-region activity can be crucial for effective signal routing. Unlike previous models that suppressed neural activity to control signal flow, our model achieves routing by exciting different high-dimensional activity patterns through connectivity structure and nonlinear dynamics. Our analysis of this disordered system offers insights into multiregion neural data and trained neural networks.",

          "abstract": "Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a devastating condition that leaves many undergoing fertility treatment childless. The human endometrium is receptive to a blastocyst for a brief period, the window of implantation. Critical knowledge underpinning biological processes leading to RIF, essential for effective treatment, is lacking. We employed spatial transcriptomics to define region- and cell-type-specific differences in endometrial gene expression in luteinizing hormone timed biopsies between women with RIF (n = 8) and fertile controls (FC) (n = 8). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing endometrial regions between FC and RIF (685 luminal epithelium, 293 glandular epithelium, 419 subluminal stroma, 264 functionalis stroma, 1,125 subluminal stromal CD45 + leukocytes, and 1,049 functionalis stromal CD56 + leukocytes). Only 57 DEGs were common to all subregions and cell types, which highlights that multiple DEGs are lost when the endometrium is examined as a single entity. When RIF-specific DEGs were leveraged against knowledge from mouse genetic models, genes associated with aberrant embryo implantation phenotypes were observed, mostly in immune cell populations. Dysregulated pathways in specific endometrial regions included the “WNT signaling pathway,” altered in the functionalis and subluminal stroma. “Response to estradiol” and “ovulation cycle” pathways were dysregulated in the subluminal stroma. In silico drug screening identified potential compounds that can reverse the RIF gene expression profile (e.g., raloxifene, bisoprolol). Our findings, in a well-characterized cohort, highly endorse consideration of each endometrial region and cell type as separate entities. Ignoring individual regions and composite cell populations will overlook important aberrations, forego potential treatment targets, and lead to research waste pursuing clinically irrelevant treatment options.",

However, arteriolar endothelial cells and other periarteriolar cells expressed increasing levels of interferon during aging. This increased the numbers of periarteriolar Sca1 + Cxcl9 + LepR + cells with an inflammatory gene signature and depleted lymphoid progenitors, at least some of which are also periarteriolar.

Here, we conduct a multiecosystem meta-analysis of 3,286 data points and reveal that MP exposure leads to a global reduction in photosynthesis of 7.05 to 12.12% in terrestrial plants, marine algae, and freshwater algae. These reductions align with those estimated by a constructed machine learning model using current MP pollution levels, showing that MP exposure reduces the chlorophyll content of photoautotrophs by 10.96 to 12.84%. Model estimates based on the identified MP-photosynthesis nexus indicate annual global losses of 4.11 to 13.52% (109.73 to 360.87 MT·y −1 ) for main crops and 0.31 to 7.24% (147.52 to 3415.11 MT C·y −1 ) for global aquatic net primary productivity induced by MPs. Under scenarios of efficient plastic mitigation, e.g., a ~13% global reduction in environmental MP levels, the MP-induced photosynthesis losses are estimated to decrease by ~30%, avoiding a global loss of 22.15 to 115.73 MT·y −1 in main crop production and 0.32 to 7.39 MT·y −1 in seafood production.

Here, we show a mathematical correspondence between a value function for goal-directed spatial navigation and an information measure for word embedding models in natural language processing. Based on this relationship, we integrate spatial and semantic computations into a neural representation model called “disentangled successor information” (DSI). DSI generates biologically plausible neural representations: spatial representations like place cells and grid cells, and concept-specific word representations which resemble concept cells. Furthermore, with DSI representations, we can perform inferences of spatial contexts and words by a common computational framework based on simple arithmetic operations. This computation can be biologically interpreted by partial modulations of cell assemblies of nongrid cells and concept cells. Our model offers a theoretical connection of spatial and semantic computations and suggests possible computational roles of hippocampal and entorhinal neural representations.",

          "abstract": "Variability in predator–prey interactions can modulate population dynamics with impacts scalable to entire ecosystems. As notorious corallivores, crown-of-thorns sea stars (CoTS; Acanthaster spp.) have caused extensive losses of coral habitat during unexplained population outbreaks across the Indo-Pacific. While predation of adult CoTS may help to suppress their outbreaks, it does not sufficiently explain their profound boom-bust dynamics and so remains equivocal. Factors influencing early postsettlement mortality are generally more impactful on population size, thus lower trophic interactions involving juvenile CoTS may better contribute to outbreak prevention. We evaluated the impact of key predatory decapods that interact with juvenile CoTS in their coral rubble nursery before they emerge as destructive corallivores. Decapod density was influenced by habitat complexity and varied regionally, inverse to spatial trends in CoTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef. Using eDNA gut content analysis, we confirmed seven species (~12% of individuals) of wild-caught decapod, collected from two reefs separated by &gt;1,000 km, as CoTS predators. Owing to spatial variation in predator abundance and community structure, we estimated potential (previous aquarium experiments) and realized (eDNA results here) rates of CoTS consumption were ~3-fold and ~1.6-fold lower, respectively, in outbreak hotspots. Through combination of field and molecular techniques, we demonstrated the appreciable impact of cryptic predators on early population success of this nuisance species, which expands our knowledge of CoTS outbreaks, pest species management, and reef conservation. Resolving predator–prey interactions at lower levels of the ecosystem can be crucial to understanding broader ecological outcomes.",

Here, we report that RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), an H3K27me3 demethylase, promotes hypocotyl elongation under R light in Arabidopsis . Upon exposure to R light, REF6 preferentially interacts with the active Pfr form of phyB. Consequently, phyB enhances REF6 accumulation and its binding ability, which are necessary for inducing cell-elongation-related genes from open chromatin, ensuring normal plant growth under prolonged light exposure. Moreover, REF6 acts together with the phyB-PIF4 module to mediate light regulation of hypocotyl growth.

Here, we present the Directed Multiplex Visibility Graph Irreversibility framework, a method for analyzing neural recordings using network analysis of time-series. Our approach constructs directed multilayer graphs from multivariate time-series where information about irreversibility can be decoded from the marginal degree distributions across the layers, which each represents a variable. This framework is able to quantify the irreversibility of every interaction in the complex system. Applying the method to magnetoencephalography recordings during a long-term memory recognition task, we quantify the multivariate irreversibility of interactions between brain regions and identify the combinations of regions which showed higher levels of nonequilibrium in their interactions. For individual regions, we find higher irreversibility in cognitive versus sensorial brain regions while for pairs, strong relationships are uncovered between cognitive and sensorial pairs in the same hemisphere. For triplets and quadruplets, the most nonequilibrium interactions are between cognitive–sensorial pairs alongside medial regions. Combining these results, we show that multilevel irreversibility offers unique insights into the higher-order, hierarchical organization of neural dynamics from the perspective of brain network dynamics.",

In this study, comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore how ligand binding modulates the conformational dynamics of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R). We observed a sequential occurrence of structural changes in the inactive-to-active transition of M2R induced by a superagonist iperoxo, which includes the orthosteric binding site contraction, the TM6 opening into an intermediate conformation, and a further structural change toward full activation upon binding to G protein or a G protein mimetic nanobody. Two activation intermediates were identified, which show structural features different from those reported for apo-GPCRs. Moreover, our results suggest that stabilization of a specific W400 6.48 conformation and enhanced F396 6.44 dynamics are crucial for activation, whereas distinct side-chain rotamer equilibriums of Y206 5.58 in the cytoplasmic cavity are correlated with agonist efficacies.

Here, we found that increasing BIN1 level exacerbated the phenotypes of the Dnm2 K562E/+ mouse carrying the most common DNM2 -CMT mutation. Conversely, whole-body reduction of Bin1 expression level, through the generation of Dnm2 K562E/+ mice with heterozygous loss of BIN1, restored motor performance and ameliorated muscle organization and structural defects of peripheral nerves. The rescue of motor defects was maintained at least up to 1 y of age. BIN1 inhibited the GTPase activity of DNM2, and the rescue was driven by an increased activity of the K562E DNM2 -CMT mutant, and a normalization of integrin localization in muscle. Overall, this study highlights BIN1 as a modifier of DNM2 -CMT, and its reduction as a potential therapeutic strategy. It also revealed an opposite pathological mechanism and inverse therapeutic concepts for DNM2 -CMT peripheral neuropathy versus DNM2 -CNM myopathy.",

          "abstract": "Restriction factors are dominant proteins that target different essential steps of the viral life cycle; thus, these proteins provide an early line of defense against viruses. Here, we found that the internalization of DR5, an important receptor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, initiates apoptosis to inhibit Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication. An evolutionary analysis of the DR5 sequence demonstrated that three amino acids underwent positive selection in primates. Notably, one of these positive selection sites, A62, is essential for the antiviral function of DR5 and is important for the binding of DR5 to its ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Moreover, DR5 exhibits broad antiviral activity against and inhibits various herpesviruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and herpes simplex virus type 2. As a countermeasure, the KSHV K5 protein interacts with DR5 and promotes DR5 degradation through the lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways; lysine 245 of DR5 is essential for K5-induced DR5 degradation. These findings demonstrate that DR5 is a restriction factor for human herpesviruses.",

          "abstract": "Topologically associating domains (TADs) are sub-Megabase regions in vertebrate genomes with enriched intradomain interactions that restrict enhancer–promoter contacts across their boundaries. However, the mechanisms that separate TADs remain incompletely understood. Most boundaries between TADs contain CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which individually contribute to the blocking of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Using genome-wide classification, here we show that the width of TAD boundaries forms a continuum from narrow to highly extended and correlates with CBSs distribution, chromatin features, and gene regulatory elements. To investigate how these boundary widths emerge, we modified the random crosslinker polymer model to incorporate specific boundary configurations, enabling us to evaluate the differential impact of boundary composition on TAD insulation. Our analysis, using three generic boundary categories, identifies differential influence on TAD insulation, with varying local and distal effects on neighboring domains. Notably, we find that increasing boundary width reduces long-range inter-TAD contacts, as confirmed by Hi-C data. While blocking loop extrusion at boundaries indirectly promotes spurious intermingling of neighboring TADs, extended boundaries counteract this effect, emphasizing their role in establishing genome organization. In conclusion, TAD boundary width not only enhances the efficiency of loop extrusion blocking but may also modulate enhancer–promoter contacts over long distances across TAD boundaries, providing a further mechanism for transcriptional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Genetic assimilation is a process by which a trait originally driven by the environment becomes independent of the initial cue and is expressed constitutively in a population. More than seven decades have passed since Waddington’s pioneering demonstration of the acquisition of morphological traits through genetic assimilation, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we address this gap by performing combined genomic analyses of Waddington’s genetic assimilation experiments using the ectopic veins (EV) phenocopy in Drosophila as a model. Our study reveals the assimilation of EV in both outbred and inbred fly natural populations, despite their limited genetic diversity. We identified key changes in the expression of developmental genes and pinpointed selected alleles involved in EV assimilation. The assimilation of EV is mainly driven by the selection of regulatory alleles already present in the ancestral populations, including the downregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Cad96Ca by the insertion of a transposable element in its 3′ untranslated region. The genetic variation at this locus in the inbred population is maintained by a large chromosomal inversion. In outbred populations, the evolution of EV results from a polygenic response shaped by the selective environment. Our results support a model in which selection for multiple preexisting alleles in the ancestral population, rather than stress-induced genetic or epigenetic variation, drives the evolution of EV in natural fly populations.",

          "abstract": "Androgen and estrogen, key sex hormones, were long thought to be exclusively produced by vertebrates. The O 2 -dependent aromatase that converts androgen to estrogen (estrogenesis) has never been identified in any prokaryotes. Here, we report the finding of anaerobic estrogenesis in a Peptococcaceae bacterium ( Phosphitispora sp. strain TUW77) isolated from the gut of the great blue-spotted mudskipper ( Boleophthalmus pectinirostris ). This strain exhibits testosterone fermentation pathways, transforming testosterone into estrogens and androstanediol under anaerobic conditions. Physiological experiments revealed that strain TUW77 grows exclusively on testosterone, utilizing the androgenic C-19 methyl group as both the carbon source and electron donor. The genomic analysis identified three copies of a polycistronic gene cluster, abeABC (anaerobic bacterial estrogenesis), encoding components of a classic cobalamin-dependent methyltransferase system. These genes, highly expressed under testosterone-fed conditions, show up to 57% protein identity to the characterized EmtAB from denitrifying Denitratisoma spp., known for methylating estrogen into androgen (the reverse reaction). Tiered transcriptomic and proteomic analyses suggest that the removed C-19 methyl group is completely oxidized to CO 2 via the oxidative Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (WLP), while the reducing equivalents (NADH) fully reduce remaining testosterone to androstanediol. Consistently, the addition of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, an extracellular electron acceptor, to testosterone-fed TUW77 cultures enabled complete testosterone conversion into estrogen without androstanediol accumulation (anaerobic testosterone oxidation). This finding of aromatase-independent estrogenesis in anaerobic bacteria suggests that the ancient WLP may have contributed to the emergence of estrogens in the early biosphere.",

Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed that binding the CA motif of the nucleation-promoting factor Neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASp) to inactive, splayed Arp2/3 complex shifts it toward the short-pitch active conformation and opens a binding site for an actin monomer on Arp3.

We show that serotypes AAV8, AAV9, and AAVPHP.eB are suitable viral vectors to infect both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations of the axolotl brain.

Pinched hysteresis I-V loop curve, scan rate dependency, and distinctive impedance spectra confirmed the memristive characteristics of the as-prepared device. Moreover, the memory mechanism was discussed theoretically and validated by finite-element modeling. The ISM features multiple neuromorphic functions, such as paired-pulse facilitation, paired-pulse depression, and learning–experience behavior. More importantly, the ion selectivity of the ISM was observed, which allowed further emulation of ion-selective neural functions like resting membrane potential. Benefiting from the structural similarity to membrane-embedded ion channels, the ISM opens the door for ion-based neuromorphic computing and sophisticated chemical regulation by manipulating multifarious ions with neuromorphic functions.",

The molecular mechanisms underlying this connection are only partially understood. We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM). Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk. Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading. Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele HLA-DRB1*15:01, and combinations of HLA-DRB1*15:01 with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion. In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly. Overall, we show that molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM is likely an important molecular mechanism contributing to MS pathology.",

          "abstract": "Some viruses counter host-cell efforts to digest invading viral RNA by using special structures resistant to host RNases, known as exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs). xrRNAs typically form an unusual fold with the 5′-end threaded through a ring consisting of a multihelix junction closed by a pseudoknot. By using single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), we previously showed that a Zika virus xrRNA is extremely rigid mechanically, withstanding very high forces, and that this mechanical resistance—not simply the knot-like fold topology—is essential for RNase resistance. Here, we have determined which interactions are most important for generating mechanical rigidity in the Zika virus xrRNA, by systematically mutating tertiary contacts. We found that removing any of the tertiary contacts involving the threaded 5′ end was sufficient to abrogate mechanical resistance. In contrast, breaking a single pseudoknot base pair was not sufficient to do so: Two broken pairs were needed. This hierarchy of interaction importance for mechanical rigidity was supported by simulations mapping how mechanical tension was distributed within the xrRNA. For all mutants, RNase resistance varied in lock-step with mechanical resistance, confirming the primary role of mechanical rigidity in xrRNA function. This work reveals which interactions are most important for Zika xrRNA function, with implications for targeting the xrRNA therapeutically.",

We calculate the scaling exponents and the macroscopic lag time associated with the presence of first- and second-order transitions and describe the regimes of coexistence of stable states and the accompanying hysteresis. Experiments with rolling cylinders corroborate our theoretical results on the scaling of the lag time. Experiments with spheres reveal closed orbits and their period-doubling in the overdamped and inertial limits, respectively, providing visible manifestations of the hairy ball theorem and the doubly connected nature of S O ( 3 ) , the space of 3D rotations.

Our model shows that random cell pulsation fluidizes solid epithelial tissues into a hyperuniform fluid state, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reverse solidification. Our results indicate this solidification is a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the annihilation of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation or anti-hyperuniformity.

All (+)RNA viruses reorganize cellular membranes from organelles to establish replication compartments (RCs). These RCs are thought to form a platform for membrane-associated replicases, in addition to protecting the viral RNAs from cytosolic innate immune signaling and RNA-degradation machinery. Previous work demonstrated that three families of (+)RNA viruses, namely Bromoviridae , Picornaviridae , and Flaviviridae , commonly induce the accumulation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) at their RCs. This phenomenon suggests a potential avenue for a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy targeting PC metabolism. Our study elucidates three key observations: i) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prompts the relocalization of CCTα, the rate-limiting enzyme in PC synthesis, to the RCs; ii) the enhancement of PC synthesis is contingent upon the protease activity of the NS3/4A protein; and iii) utilizing click chemistry, we demonstrate that HCV infection stimulates de novo PC synthesis at the viral replication site through the Kennedy pathway.

However, the contribution and biological significance of the totipotency-related gene duplication events in early embryo development remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on Dux cluster, the master regulator of ZGA that is necessary and sufficient for the induction of 2C-like cells and activation of totipotency-related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). By reducing Dux gene copies from 31 to 0 or 1 through CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we generate Dux -KO and Dux (n = 1) mESC lines, respectively. We uncover that the totipotency-related gene transcriptional profile is awakened to a much lesser extent in Dux (n = 1) mESCs compared to wild type mESCs following global DNA demethylation reprogramming or induction of DNA damage, mimicking the intrinsic events in preimplantation development.

These allow seed plants to adapt to diverse environments by optimizing resource allocation and structural integrity. In seed plants, SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-LIKE ( SMXL ) family members function in phloem development and strigolactone-induced inhibition of axillary bud outgrowth. Although strigolactone signaling regulates most SMXL family members, the only known regulator of SMXL4 and SMXL5 is the RNA-binding protein JULGI. We demonstrate that in angiosperms, by directly regulating SMXL4/5 expression, JULGI uncouples SMXL4/5 activity from strigolactone signaling. JULGI and ancestral SMXL s from seedless vascular plants or SMXL4/5 from seed plants are coexpressed in the phloem tissues of vascular plants, from lycophytes to angiosperms. Core angiosperm SMXL4/5 mRNAs contain a G-rich element in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) that serves as a target sequence for JULGI to negatively regulate SMXL4/5 expression. Heterologous expression of JULGI s from various angiosperms rescued the Arabidopsis jul1 jul2 mutant. Expressing SMXL4/5 s from seed plants and ancestral SMXL s rescued Arabidopsis smxl4 smxl5 . Angiosperm SMXL4/5s lack an RGKT motif for proteasomal degradation. Indeed, treatment with the synthetic strigolactone analog rac -GR24 induced proteasomal degradation of SMXL from ferns and SMXL5a from gymnosperms, but not SMXL4/5 from angiosperms. These findings suggest that in ancestral angiosperms, the 5′ UTR of SMXL4/5 gained G-rich elements, creating a regulatory module with JULGI that allows the phloem development pathway to act independently of strigolactone signaling.",

          "abstract": "To accurately describe the energetics of transition metal systems, density functional approximations (DFAs) must provide a balanced description of s- and d- electrons. One measure of this is the sd transfer error, which has previously been defined as E ( 3 d n − 1 4 s 1 ) − E ( 3 d n − 2 4 s 2 ) . Theoretical concerns have been raised about this definition due to its evaluation of excited-state energies using ground-state DFAs. A more serious concern appears to be strong correlation in the 4s 2 configuration. Here, we define a ground-state measure of the sd energy imbalance, based on the errors of s- and d-electron second ionization energies of the 3d atoms, that effectively circumvents the aforementioned problems. We find an improved performance as we move from the local spin density approximation (LSDA) to the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the regularized and restored Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (r 2 SCAN) meta-GGA for first-row transition metal atoms. However, we find large (∼2 eV) ground-state sd energy imbalances when applying a Perdew–Zunger 1981 self-interaction correction. This is attributed to an “energy penalty” associated with the noded 3d orbitals. A local scaling of the self-interaction correction to LSDA results in a balance of s- and d-errors.",

          "abstract": "Changing a circuit dynamically, without actually changing the hardware itself, is called reconfiguration, and is of great importance due to its manifold technological applications. Circuit reconfiguration appears to be a feature of the cerebral cortex, so understanding the dynamical principles underlying self-reconfiguration may prove of import to elucidate brain function. We present a very simple example of dynamical reconfiguration: a family of networks whose signal pathways can be switched on the fly, only through use of their inputs, with no changes to their synaptic weights. These are single-layer convolutional recurrent network with local unitary synaptic weights and a smooth sigmoidal activation function. We generate traveling waves using the high spatiotemporal frequencies of the input, and we use the low spatiotemporal frequencies of the input to landscape the ongoing activity, channeling said traveling waves through an input-specified spatial pattern. This mechanism uses inherent properties of marginally stable, dynamically critical systems, which are a direct consequence of their unitary convolution kernels: every network in the family can do this. We show these networks solve the classical connectedness detection problem, by allowing signal propagation only along the regions to be evaluated for connectedness, and forbidding it elsewhere.",

Glaucoma is comorbid with other neurodegenerative diseases, but how it might impact the environment of the full central nervous system to increase neurodegenerative vulnerability is unknown. Two neurodegenerative events occur early in the optic nerve, the structural link between the retina and brain: loss of anterograde transport in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and early alterations in astrocyte structure and function. Here, we used whole-mount tissue clearing of full mouse brains to image RGC anterograde transport function and astrocyte responses across retinorecipient regions early in a unilateral microbead occlusion model of glaucoma. Using light sheet imaging, we found that RGC projections terminating specifically in the accessory optic tract are the first to lose transport function. Although degeneration was induced in one retina, astrocytes in both brain hemispheres responded to transport loss in a retinotopic pattern that mirrored the degenerating RGCs. A subpopulation of these astrocytes in contact with large descending blood vessels were immunopositive for LCN2, a marker associated with astrocyte reactivity. Together, these data suggest that even early stages of unilateral glaucoma have broad impacts on the health of astrocytes across both hemispheres of the brain, implying a glial mechanism behind neurodegenerative comorbidity in glaucoma.",

Furthermore, high-quality satellite radiometer observations of the most recent solar cycle, 24, systematically differ from estimates that rely on TSI proxies for reasons that have been unclear. Using a Bayesian Kalman filtering approach to estimate TSI from both satellite-based observations and proxies gives two complementary explanations: recent satellite-based observations of TSI contain unaccounted-for positive linear drifts, and regression-based reconstructions are affected by commonly used solar magnetic proxies becoming less sensitive to TSI variations at low values. After accounting for satellite instrument drifts and reduced sensitivity, direct and proxy observations come into agreement and together indicate a linear trend in overall TSI of −0.15 W/m 2 per decade with a 95% CI of −0.17 to −0.13 W/m 2 per decade between 1980 and 2023.",

In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here, we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a space-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction, and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision-making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.",

Beyond its function as a chloride channel, interactions between CFTR, epithelium sodium channel, and solute carrier (SLC) transporter family membrane proteins and cytoplasmic proteins, including calmodulin and Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1), coregulate ion homeostasis. CFTR has also been observed to form mesoscale membrane clusters. However, the contributions of multivalent protein and lipid interactions to cluster formation are not well understood. Using a combination of computational modeling and biochemical reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that multivalent interactions with CFTR protein binding partners, calcium, and membrane cholesterol can induce mesoscale CFTR cluster formation on model membranes. Phosphorylation of the intracellular domains of CFTR also promotes mesoscale cluster formation in the absence of calcium, indicating that multiple mechanisms can contribute to CFTR cluster formation. Our findings reveal that coupling of multivalent protein and lipid interactions promotes CFTR cluster formation consistent with membrane-associated biological phase separation.",

          "abstract": "Microbial communities vary across space, time, and individual hosts, generating a need for statistical methods capable of quantifying variability across multiple microbiome samples at once. To understand heterogeneity across microbiome samples from different host individuals, sampling times, spatial locations, or experimental replicates, we present FAVA ( F ST -based Assessment of Variability across vectors of relative Abundances), a framework for characterizing compositional variability across two or more microbiome samples. FAVA quantifies variability across many samples of taxonomic or functional relative abundances in a single index ranging between 0 and 1, equaling 0 when all samples are identical and 1 when each sample is entirely composed of a single taxon (and at least two distinct taxa are present across samples). Its definition relies on the population-genetic statistic F ST , with samples playing the role of “populations” and taxa playing the role of “alleles.” Its mathematical properties allow users to compare datasets with different numbers of samples and taxonomic categories. We introduce extensions that incorporate phylogenetic similarity among taxa and spatial or temporal distances between samples. We demonstrate FAVA in two examples. First, we use FAVA to measure how the taxonomic and functional variability of gastrointestinal microbiomes across individuals from seven ruminant species changes along the gastrointestinal tract. Second, we use FAVA to quantify the increase in temporal variability of gut microbiomes in healthy humans following an antibiotic course and to measure the duration of the antibiotic’s influence on temporal microbiome variability. We have implemented this tool in an R package, FAVA , for use in pipelines for the analysis of microbial relative abundances.",

          "abstract": "Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.",

Our findings reveal a mean upslope shift of 1.8 to 2.7 meters per year since 1979 driven by the upslope retreat of the less thermophilic montane species. These shifts are mostly accompanied by retreating lower and upper edges attributed to varying degrees of species’ exposure to deforestation and climate change.

          "abstract": "Understanding the capacity of forests to adapt to climate change is of pivotal importance for conservation science, yet this is still widely unknown. This knowledge gap is particularly acute in high-biodiversity tropical forests. Here, we examined how tropical forests of the Americas have shifted community trait composition in recent decades as a response to changes in climate. Based on historical trait-climate relationships, we found that, overall, the studied functional traits show shifts of less than 8% of what would be expected given the observed changes in climate. However, the recruit assemblage shows shifts of 21% relative to climate change expectation. The most diverse forests on Earth are changing in functional trait composition but at a rate that is fundamentally insufficient to track climate change.",

This loss of peroxisomes impaired inflammation resolution and lung repair during severe respiratory viral infections. Peroxisomes were found to modulate lipid metabolism and mitochondrial health in a macrophage type-specific manner and enhanced alveolar macrophage-mediated tissue repair and alveolar regeneration after viral infection. Peroxisomes also prevented excessive macrophage inflammasome activation and IL-1β release, limiting accumulation of KRT8 high dysplastic epithelial progenitors following viral injury. Pharmacologically enhancing peroxisome biogenesis mitigated both acute symptoms and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in animal models. Thus, macrophage peroxisome dysfunction contributes to chronic lung pathology and fibrosis after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.",

The synergistic effect of graphene and poly(methyl methacrylate) restricted photoinduced lattice expansion and decreased the deformation ratio from 0.31 to 0.08%, which minimized the structural damage caused by dynamic lattice evolution.

Domestication for its starchy roots involved a near-total shift from sexual to clonal propagation, and almost all manioc worldwide is now grown from stem cuttings. In this work, we analyze 573 new and published genomes, focusing on traditional varieties from the Americas and wild relatives from herbaria, to reveal the effects of this shift to clonality. We observe kinship over large distances, maintenance of high genetic diversity, intergenerational heterozygosity enrichment, and genomic mosaics of identity-by-descent haploblocks that connect all manioc worldwide. Interviews with Indigenous traditional farmers in the Brazilian Cerrado illuminate how traditional management strategies for sustaining, diversifying, and sharing the gene pool have shaped manioc diversity.",

This seemingly straightforward question is often unanswerable because regulations, monitoring approaches, and reporting structures cannot keep up with the rapid human-induced shifts to the planet and atmosphere. The air is becoming more burdened by pollutants from new sources such as intense fires at the wildland-urban interface, an ever-expanding area where human development meets natural habitats. Air pollution is the second leading cause of human death worldwide, a statistic that excludes numerous indoor and acute outdoor exposures. To protect public health everywhere, air quality standards must be modernized, advanced instrumentation mobilized, and collaborative networks established to move air quality assessment into the 21st century.",

In this study, we demonstrated exciton formation in a single molecule through ultrafast electron tunneling processes between a molecule and a metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) using a phase-controlled terahertz (THz) pulse. The pronounced luminescence of the well-defined molecular system under the distinct carrier-envelope phase of the THz pulse revealed that sequential state-selective electron-tunneling processes to the frontier molecular orbitals promoted ultrafast exciton formation in the molecule at the STM junction. Furthermore, ultrafast control of exciton formation was achieved using phase- and delay-controlled THz pulse pairs, providing a route for the regulation of molecular dynamics and the emergence of new molecular functions.",

Here, we report the direct insertion of a nitrogen atom into unactivated carbon-carbon double bonds to access aza-allenium intermediates, which can be converted either into nitriles or amidine products, depending on the initial alkene substitution pattern. This operationally simple and highly functionally compatible reaction works on a wide range of unactivated alkenes. PIFA, a commercially available and inexpensive hypervalent iodine reagent, is key to this reactivity. Our mechanistic proposal is supported by chemical trapping experiments, which concomitantly demonstrate the utility of our method to access valuable N -heterocycles. Additionally, our method can be used as a general strategy for synthesizing amides and amines, as well as 15 N-labeled molecules.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotes have linear DNA and their telomeres are hotspots for transposons, which in some cases took over telomere maintenance. Here we identify several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria and Streptomyces . While these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, significantly influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.",

In this study, we demonstrate that proteins with shared functions share amino acid sequence codes that guide them to compartment destinations. We developed a protein language model, ProtGPS, that predicts with high performance the compartment localization of human proteins excluded from the training set. ProtGPS successfully guided generation of novel protein sequences that selectively assemble in the nucleolus. ProtGPS identified pathological mutations that change this code and lead to altered subcellular localization of proteins. Our results indicate that protein sequences contain not only a folding code but also a previously unrecognized code governing their distribution to diverse subcellular compartments.",

If accurate, such age-driven skill losses pose a major threat to the human capital of societies with rapidly aging populations. We estimate actual age-skill profiles from individual changes in literacy and numeracy skills at different ages. We use the unique German longitudinal component of the Programme of the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC-L) that retested a large representative sample of adults after 3.5 years. Our empirical approach separates age from cohort effects and corrects for measurement error from reversion to the mean. Two main results emerge. First, average skills increase strongly into the forties before decreasing slightly in literacy and more strongly in numeracy. Second, skills decline at older ages only for those with below-average skill usage. White-collar and higher-educated workers with above-average usage show increasing skills even beyond their forties. Women have larger skill losses at older age, particularly in numeracy.",

First, although women today report higher levels of life satisfaction and overall happiness than men, they experience worse outcomes in mental health and negative affect. Second, despite substantial advances in women’s social and economic status over the past 50 years, their well-being relative to men has declined. We explore the evidence supporting these paradoxes, considering potential explanations related to differential expectations, biology, and scale use. Using global data from 2006 to 2023 and long-term data from Europe and the US since the 1970s, we provide empirical illustrations. These findings reveal a diverse and seemingly inconsistent pattern of gender well-being gaps between countries, suggesting that the first paradox is not universally applicable. However, there is clear global evidence of a relative decline in women’s well-being, particularly in terms of negative affect.",

Comprehensive exploration of endogenous metabolites that drive aging remains insufficient. Here, we conducted an untargeted metabolomics analysis of aging mice, revealing citrulline as a consistently down-regulated metabolite associated with aging. Systematic investigations demonstrated that citrulline exhibited antiaging effects by reducing cellular senescence, protecting against DNA damage, preventing cell cycle arrest, modulating macrophage metabolism, and mitigating inflammaging. Long-term citrulline supplementation in aged mice yielded beneficial effects and ameliorated age-associated phenotypes. We further elucidated that citrulline acts as an endogenous metabolite antagonist to inflammation, suppressing proinflammatory responses in macrophages. Mechanistically, citrulline served as a potential inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in macrophage and regulated the mTOR–hypoxia-inducible factor 1α–glycolysis signaling pathway to counter inflammation and aging. These findings underscore the significance of citrulline deficiency as a driver of aging, highlighting citrulline supplementation as a promising therapeutic intervention to counteract aging-related changes.",

Accurate age models are key to unravel the sequence of events related to DT volcanism onset and effects on the global climate system. We establish a direct geochemical link between DT volcanism as recorded in marine osmium isotopic data and global climate change documented in benthic foraminifera carbon and oxygen isotope records. Based on our state-of-the-art astronomically calibrated age model, two major shifts in marine 187 Os/ 188 Os at 66.49 and 66.28 million years ago are contemporaneous with major eruption phases of the DT and disruptions of the global carbon cycle. Geochemical records and modeling suggest larger erupted volumes with high volatile emissions for the early phase of DT volcanism and point to differing emissions of SO 2 and CO 2 during the observed marine osmium shifts with diverse effects on the global climate system.",

Compound XT17 presented a multifaceted mode of actions, involving the disruption of cell wall by interacting with lipoteichoic acid or lipopolysaccharides and the suppression of DNA synthesis.

High HLA evolutionary divergence (HED) at the DQ locus in the donor was an independent predictor of BKPyV-free outcome. More generally, we highlighted the protective effect of highly divergent pairs of HLA-DQ heterodimers corresponding to heterozygous HLA-DQα01/non-DQα01 combinations. We then defined a functional divergence metrics assessed by the similarity of peptide-binding motifs between pairs of HLA-DQ molecules. Greater functional divergence correlated with the size of the BKPyV-derived DQ-bound immunopeptidome and a lower risk of BKPyV reactivation, thus providing a molecular basis for the observed genetic differences. Together, these data provide evidence for a direct link between donor HLA-DQ genetic and functional divergence, diversity of the DQ-bound immunopeptidome, and control of viral infection, likely reflecting stronger antiviral T cell responses.",

Earlier estrogen depletion—via earlier menopause—has been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction also incites and exacerbates AD progression. We investigated whether age at menopause and synaptic health together influence AD neuropathology and cognitive trajectories using clinical and autopsy data from 268 female decedents in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We observed significant interactions between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on cognitive decline and tau tangles, such that earlier menopause strengthened the associations of reduced synaptic integrity with faster cognitive decline and elevated tau. Exploratory analyses showed that these relationships were attenuated in women who took menopausal hormone therapy. These findings suggest that midlife endocrine processes or their sequalae may influence synaptic vulnerability to AD. Interventions addressing both hormonal factors and synaptic health could enhance resilience to dementia in women.",

Here, we reveal the nongenomic molecular mechanism of progesterone as the activation of human and murine inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir7.1, which is expressed in myometrium and placental pericytes during late gestation. Kir7.1 is also activated by selective steroids, including those used to prevent premature labor, such as 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and dydrogesterone, revealing their unexpected mode of action. Our results reveal that Kir7.1 is the molecular target of both endogenous and synthetic steroids that control uterine excitability and placental function.

          "abstract": "The loss of TBK1, or both TBK1 and the related kinase IKKε, results in uncontrolled cell death–driven inflammation. Here, we show that the pathway leading to cell death depends on the nature of the activating signal. Previous models suggest that in steady state, TBK1/IKKε-deficient cells die slowly and spontaneously predominantly by uncontrolled tumor necrosis factor–RIPK1–driven death. However, upon infection of cells that express the NLRP3 inflammasome, (e.g., macrophages), with pathogens that activate this pathway (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes ), TBK1/IKKε-deficient cells die rapidly, prematurely, and exclusively by enhanced NLRP3-driven pyroptosis. Even infection with the RIPK1-activating pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis , results in enhanced RIPK1–caspase-8 activation and enhanced secondary NLRP3 activation. Mechanistically, TBK1/IKKε control endosomal traffic, and their loss disrupts endosomal homeostasis, thereby signaling cell stress. This results in premature NLRP3 activation even upon sensing “signal 2” alone, without the obligatory “signal 1.” Collectively, TBK1/IKKε emerge as a central brake in limiting death-induced inflammation by both RIPK1 and NLRP3 death-inducing pathways.",

However, the role of isocyanic acid in inflammatory response remains elusive. Herein, we reveal that lipopolysaccharide stimulation increases LACC1-dependent isocyanic acid production, which attenuates inflammation by limiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages primed with lipopolysaccharide for 8 hours. Mechanistically, isocyanic acid directly carbamoylates NLRP3 at lysine-593 to disrupt NLRP3-NEK7 interaction, a key step in assembly of active NLRP3 inflammasome. Abrogation of isocyanic acid biosynthesis by LACC1 / Lacc1 knockout or expression of K593 carbamoylation (K593ca)–deficient NLRP3 mutant promotes macrophagic inflammatory response in vitro. Furthermore, Lacc1 −/− mice and mice harboring K593ca-deficient NLRP3 mutation manifest exacerbated inflammatory response in vivo. Hence, our findings identify isocyanic acid as an endogenous immunoregulatory metabolite that limits NLRP3-driven inflammation and provide valuable insights into the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, governed by metabolites.",

Hyperammonemia also induced dysregulation of its main metabolic pathway, the urea cycle, as reflected by down-regulation of urea cycle enzyme protein expression and accumulation of its metabolites. Inhibition of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and its upstream inducer Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protected against liver injury and further hyperammonemia. In clinically relevant rodent models of hyperammonemia (genetic ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and bile duct ligation–induced cirrhosis), TLR4 inhibition reduced circulating ammonia. In conclusion, hyperammonemia induces liver fibrogenesis and RIPK1-mediated cell death, which is associated with urea cycle dysfunction. Inhibition of RIPK1 and TLR4 protects against hyperammonemia-induced liver injury and are potential therapeutic targets for hyperammonemia and chronic liver disease progression.",

          "abstract": "Defective apoptosis mediated by B cell lymphoma 2 antagonist/killer (BAK) or B cell lymphoma 2–associated X protein (BAX) underlies various pathologies including autoimmune and degenerative conditions. On mitochondria, voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) interacts with BAK and BAX through a common interface to inhibit BAK or to facilitate BAX apoptotic activity. We identified a small molecule (WEHI-3773) that inhibits interaction between VDAC2 and BAK or BAX revealing contrasting effects on their apoptotic activity. WEHI-3773 inhibits apoptosis mediated by BAX by blocking VDAC2-mediated BAX recruitment to mitochondria. Conversely, WEHI-3773 promotes BAK-mediated apoptosis by limiting inhibitory sequestration by VDAC2. In cells expressing both pro-apoptotic proteins, apoptosis promotion by WEHI-3773 dominates, because activated BAK activates BAX through a feed-forward mechanism. Loss of BAX drives resistance to the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in some leukemias. WEHI-3773 overcomes this resistance by promoting BAK-mediated killing. This work highlights the coordination of BAX and BAK apoptotic activity through interaction with VDAC2 that may be targeted therapeutically.",

The X chromosome contributes to sex differences, as females harbor an inactive X (Xi) and active X (Xa), in contrast to males with only an Xa. Thus, reactivation of silent Xi genes may contribute to sex differences. We use allele-specific, single-nucleus RNA sequencing to show that aging remodels transcription of the Xi and Xa across hippocampal cell types. Aging preferentially changed gene expression on the X’s relative to autosomes. Select genes on the Xi underwent activation, with new escape across cells including in the dentate gyrus, critical to learning and memory. Expression of the Xi escapee Plp1 , a myelin component, was increased in the aging hippocampus of female mice and parahippocampus of women. AAV-mediated Plp1 elevation in the dentate gyrus of aging male and female mice improved cognition. Understanding how the Xi may confer female advantage could lead to novel targets that counter brain aging and disease in both sexes.",

We used multiplexed glycan immunofluorescence to distinguish between PDAC and noncancer cell subpopulations within tumor tissue, and we developed hybrid glycan sandwich assays to determine whether the aberrant glycan signatures could be detected in blood samples. We found that PDAC cells were identified by signatures of glycans detected by four glycan-binding proteins (VVL, CA19-9, sTRA, and GM2) and that there are three types of glycan-defined PDAC tumors: sTRA type, CA19-9 type, and intermixed. In patient-matched tumor and blood samples, the PDAC tumor type could be determined by the aberrant glycans in the blood. As a result, the combined assays of aberrant glycan signatures were more sensitive and specific than any individual assay. Our results demonstrate a methodology to detect and stratify PDAC.",

Palm1 binds to the amino-terminal region of βII-spectrin, and MINFLUX microscopy localizes it in close proximity (&lt;20 nanometers) to the actin-capping protein and MPS component adducin. Combining overexpression, knockout, and rescue experiments, we observe that the expression level of Palm1 controls the degree of periodicity of the MPS and also affects the electrophysiological properties of neurons. A single amino acid mutation (W54A) in Palm1 abolishes the MPS binding and remodeling activities of Palm1. Our findings identify Palm1 as a protein specifically dedicated to organizing the MPS and will advance the understanding of the assembly and plasticity of the actin-spectrin submembrane skeleton in general.",

This remarkable activity is largely attributable to the deltaproteobacterial family Desulfobacteraceae of complete oxidizers (to CO 2 ), which our biogeography focused meta-analysis verified as cosmopolitan. However, the catabolic/regulatory networks underlying this ecophysiological feat at the thermodynamic limit are essentially unknown. Integrating cultivation-based (80 conditions) proteogenomics of six representative Desulfobacteraceae spp., we identify molecular commonalities explaining the family’s environmental relevance and success. Desulfobacteraceae genomes are specifically enriched in substrate uptake, degradation capacities, and regulatory functions including fine-tuned sulfate uptake. Conserved gene arrangements and shared regulatory patterns translate into strikingly similar (sub-)proteome profiles. From 319 proteins, we constructed a meta-network for catabolizing 35 substrates. Therefrom, we defined a Desulfobacteraceae characteristic gene subset, which we found prevalent in metagenomes of organic-rich, marine sediments.

We show that gestational delays were triggered during nursing or optogenetic stimulation of oxytocin neurons simulating nursing patterns. Mouse blastocysts express oxytocin receptors, and oxytocin induced delayed implantation-like dispersion in cultured embryos. Last, oxytocin receptor–knockout embryos transferred into wild-type surrogates had low survival rates during diapause.

Here, we investigate (i) whether opening of KCNQ2 channels requires a concerted step or can result from independent subunit activation and (ii) how individual subunits regulate gate opening and conductance. The E140R mutation in the S2 segment prevents activated voltage sensor conformations, but concatemeric constructs containing up to three E140R subunits retain KCNQ2-like currents. The underlying single-channel currents show subconductance levels resulting from limitations in inner gate dimensions, determined by the number of activated subunits and their spatial arrangement.

Screening of KU01 to KU13 revealed that KU13 exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity against wild-type and macrolide-resistant MAC compared to AZM. Cryo–electron microscopy analysis indicated that the inserted tercyclic moiety of KU13 formed a robust anchor on the bacterial ribosome, creating a binding pocket with base flipping of U2847, potentially bypassing the standard mechanism of macrolide resistance.

Further investigation indicates that GPR132-deficient NK92 cells expressed more GzmB and IFN-γ and exhibited stronger cytotoxicity.

Down-regulation of GPR132 weakens the inhibition of NK cell function by lactate, thereby enhancing the functional execution of CAR-NK cells against colorectal cancer.

Specifically, erbb2 promotes PI3K activity and recruits the Arp2/3 complex, inducing a polarized accumulation of the actomyosin network to drive cell delamination. Subsequently, the lineage-committed nascent trabeculae trigger Notch activity in neighboring cardiomyocytes to suppress erbb2 expression and reduce cell tension, thereby confining them to the compact layer.

Distinct regions within the CARD bind to phosphate groups and long acyl chains of self- and nonself-lipids. Self-lipid binding capability is conserved across numerous caspase-11 homologs and orthologs.

This polarity modulation enhances the flux of hot holes into the plasmonic platform, thereby accelerating Landau damping stemming from increased effective heat capacity of hot electrons in the metallic nanomaterial.

To address this, we generated cerebral organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of patients with ALS-FTLD harboring the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion alongside CRISPR-corrected isogenic and healthy controls. Here, we show a higher mtDNA single-nucleotide variant (mtSNV) burden in astroglia derived from C9ORF72 -mutant organoids, with some de novo mtSNVs likely due to the C9ORF72 repeat and others evading selection to reach higher heteroplasmy levels.

Behavioral assays demonstrate YY-23’s rapid antidepressant effects in both stress-naïve and stress-exposed models, which are lost in mice with global or selective knockout of the grin2d gene in parvalbumin-positive interneurons. These findings highlight GluN2D-containing NMDARs on GABAergic interneurons as potential depression treatment targets.",

          "abstract": "The metazoan transcription elongation complex (EC) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) generally stalls between the transcription start site and the first (+1) nucleosome. This promoter-proximal pausing involves negative elongation factor (NELF), 5,6-dichloro-1-β- d -ribobenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), and transcription elongation factor IIS (TFIIS) and is critical for subsequent productive transcription elongation. However, the detailed pausing mechanism and the involvement of the +1 nucleosome remain enigmatic. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of ECs stalled on nucleosomal DNA. In the absence of TFIIS, the EC is backtracked/arrested due to conflicts between NELF and the nucleosome. We identified two alternative binding modes of NELF, one of which reveals a critical contact with the downstream DNA through the conserved NELF-E basic helix. Upon binding with TFIIS, the EC progressed to the nucleosome to establish a paused EC with a partially unwrapped nucleosome. This paused EC strongly restricts EC progression further downstream. These structures illuminate the mechanism of RNAPII pausing/stalling at the +1 nucleosome.",

In this work, a minimally invasive annular microneedle (A-MN) patch was developed avoiding direct puncture into the central cornea for ophthalmic drug delivery. The feasible mechanical strength of A-MNs was achieved by adjusting the ratio of PVP-β-CD and PVA to puncture the cornea barrier. Through effective diffusion to corneal stroma, bioavailability of hydrophilic small-molecule drugs, hydrophobic drugs, and macromolecular protein drugs through an A-MN patch was 24.36, 17.47, and 5.36 times higher than that of free drug administration. A-MNs effectively maintained light transmittance of the cornea with a light transmittance of 96.33 to 100%, which was higher than that of S-MNs. Furthermore, A-MNs effectively avoided corneal tissue and nerve damage along with the pain. The efficiency and safety of A-MNs were also examined through both an in vitro cell experiment and an in vivo animal experimental model, which showed great potential in clinical application.",

Here, we describe in situ formation of an adhesive lubricative Janus nanocoating (ALJN) to enable long-lasting comfort drug delivery. By iron complexation, an asymmetric ALJN is formed on ocular surface via facile sequential instillation. The adhesive polyphenol inner layer binding with ocular surface enables drug loading and sustained release, while the lubricative zwitterionic polymer outer layer prevents eyelid adhesion to ensure comfort. Following instillation, ALJN retains on ocular surface over 24 hours and reduces blinking frequency to normal level. Moreover, ALJN demonstrates remarkable therapeutic potential in mouse and rabbit models of corneal contusion and alkali burn.

Using Ni-Fe bimetallic phosphides as a model catalyst, operando Q-XAFS experiments reveal that the structural transformation initiates at the preferential oxidation of Fe sites over Ni sites. The in situ–generated O-Fe-P structure serves as the origin of the enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity of the catalyst, a finding supported by theoretical calculations.

Several ASD mouse models ( Scn2a +/− , Fmr1 −/− , Cdkl5 −/− ) exhibit impaired spatial learning, with these deficits often attributed to hippocampal dysfunction. However, we identify the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as a critical driver of these deficits. Cortical-wide Scn2a reduction in excitatory neurons replicated the spatial learning and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments—a cellular correlate of learning—seen in Scn2a +/− mice, while hippocampal-wide reduction did not. PRC-specific viral-mediated Scn2a reduction in excitatory neurons decreased release probability, which consequently disrupted synaptic transmission and LTP in the hippocampus, as well as spatial learning. As PRC activity was reduced, chemogenetic activation of the PRC reversed these deficits in Scn2a +/− mice and rescued spatial learning and LTP impairments in Fmr1 and Cdkl5 knockout mice. Thus, in several genetic models of ASD, PRC abnormalities may disrupt hippocampal function to impair learning and memory.",

This study identifies an interplay between the circadian clock within muscle stem cells (SCs) and their capacity to modulate the immune microenvironment during muscle regeneration. We reveal that the SC clock triggers TOD–dependent inflammatory gene transcription after injury, particularly genes related to neutrophil activity and chemotaxis. These responses are driven by cytosolic regeneration of the signaling metabolite nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), as enhancing cytosolic NAD + regeneration in SCs is sufficient to induce inflammatory responses that influence muscle regeneration. Mononuclear single-cell sequencing of the regenerating muscle niche further implicates the cytokine CCL2 in mediating SC-neutrophil cross-talk in a TOD-dependent manner. Our findings highlight the intersection between SC metabolic shifts and immune responses within the muscle microenvironment, dictated by circadian rhythms, and underscore the potential for targeting circadian and metabolic pathways to enhance tissue regeneration.",

Here, a cascaded strategy is demonstrated for the hierarchical assembly of OLHs with in-plane multicolor emission, from red-blue and red-green to lateral red-green-blue (RGB), with a lateral size of ~15 micrometers. The tunable regions of 2D OLHs are realized by synergistic effects of the molecular doping method and the photo-induced oxidation route during the epitaxial growth process. The obtained OLHs can actively achieve full-spectrum light transport from 420 to 720 nanometers depending on different excitation positions and thus function as multimode RGB signal converters.

We show that these emergent features can be used to predict mechanical property enhancements arising from postspin drawing. Simulations recapitulate a purely process-dependent mechanical property envelope in which order enhances fiber strength while preserving toughness. The relationship between chain extension and crystalline domain alignment observed in simulations is validated by Raman spectroscopy of wet-spun fibers.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases.

Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects.

We identify enhanced myeloid cell prothrombotic activity as a maladaptive consequence of trained immunity. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of macrophages trained previously with β-glucan or heme exhibited significantly enhanced procoagulant activity compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone, which was mediated by enhanced acid sphingomyelinase–mediated tissue factor decryption. Furthermore, splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan–trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Moreover, hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid from β-glucan–trained mice had enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice.

In this longitudinal neuroimaging study, we assessed 88 first-time gestational mothers in late pregnancy and early postpartum and 30 nulliparous control women. We used optimized high-resolution MRI scans to quantify volumetric changes in the hippocampus and amygdala, along with their substructures. We found that increases in depression symptoms during the peripartum were positively correlated with changes in the right amygdala.

Here, we used a NbSe 2 substrate to break both the C 3 rotational and inversion symmetries in monolayer VCl 3 and, thus, introduced exceptional in-plane ferroelectricity into a two-dimensional magnet. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy directly visualized ferroelectric domains and manipulated their domain boundaries in monolayer VCl 3 , where coexisting antiferromagnetic order with canted magnetic moments was verified by vibrating sample magnetometer measurements. Our density functional theory calculations highlight the crucial role that highly directional interfacial Cl-Se interactions play in breaking the symmetries and, thus, in introducing in-plane ferroelectricity, which was further verified by examining an ML-VCl 3 /graphene sample. Our work demonstrates an approach to manipulate the ferroelectric states in monolayered magnets through van der Waals interfacial interactions.",

          "abstract": "Credible projections of Arctic warming and wetting (AWW) are essential for informed decision-making in a changing climate. However, current AWW projections from state-of-the-art climate models carry uncertainties. Using observational datasets and CMIP6 model simulations, we demonstrate that the observed historical global warming trend and the climatological mean pattern of Arctic sea ice can serve as effective constraints on AWW projections. Under SSP2-4.5, the constrained warming by the end of the century is reduced from 5.5° to 4.6°C. Similarly, the projected wetting decreases from 6.8 to 5.7 millimeter per month. The inter-model spread in warming and wetting is reduced by 25 and 15%, respectively. The reduction is the largest in the Barents-Kara seas, reducing warming by 1.2°C, lessening wetting by 1.7 millimeter per month, and decreasing the inter-model spread by one-third. Our findings suggest that unconstrained CMIP6 projections overestimate future AWW, particularly in the Barents-Kara seas, due to an overestimation of historical global warming and excessive sea ice in the models.",

          "abstract": "Latent infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a strong risk factor for the development of multiple sclerosis (MS), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this association, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in immunodeficient mice reconstituted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals with or without a history of EBV infection and/or relapsing MS (RRMS). HuPBMC EAE mice generated from EBV-seronegative healthy donors were less susceptible to developing severe neurological symptoms than healthy EBV-seropositive and RRMS donor groups. Donor EBV seropositivity and RRMS diagnosis were associated with a significant increase in the number of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrating effector T cells due to enhanced proliferation of proinflammatory T cells and limited expansion of regulatory T cells. The data indicate that a history of EBV infection, further compounded by a diagnosis of RRMS, promotes T cell–mediated xenogeneic CNS disease in a humanized mouse model of MS.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria respond to environmental stimuli and attacks from competing organisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa assembles the type VI secretion system (H1-T6SS) to precisely retaliate against aggressive competing bacteria. However, we lack an understanding of how the H1-T6SS assembly dynamically responds to nanomechanical forces. To address this, we analyzed live cells using correlative atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy. We show that indentation forces above 7 nanonewtons trigger local, repeated and targeted H1-T6SS assemblies within seconds of impact by the AFM tip. Analysis of the corresponding AFM force curves shows that a breach of a single layer of the cell envelope is necessary and sufficient for triggering H1-T6SS assembly. Accordingly, polymyxin B nonapeptide, which damages the outer membrane, also triggers H1-T6SS assembly. This suggests that P. aeruginosa has evolved a danger-sensing mechanism that enables rapid and precise deployment of its antibacterial H1-T6SS in response to breaches in the outer membrane.",
