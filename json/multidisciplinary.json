          "abstract": "Mitochondria serve a crucial role in cell growth and proliferation by supporting both ATP synthesis and the production of macromolecular precursors. Whereas oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depends mainly on the oxidation of intermediates from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the mitochondrial production of proline and ornithine relies on reductive synthesis1. How these competing metabolic pathways take place in the same organelle is not clear. Here we show that when cellular dependence on OXPHOS increases, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS)—the rate-limiting enzyme in the reductive synthesis of proline and ornithine—becomes sequestered in a subset of mitochondria that lack cristae and ATP synthase. This sequestration is driven by both the intrinsic ability of P5CS to form filaments and the mitochondrial fusion and fission cycle. Disruption of mitochondrial dynamics, by impeding mitofusin-mediated fusion or dynamin-like-protein-1-mediated fission, impairs the separation of P5CS-containing mitochondria from mitochondria that are enriched in cristae and ATP synthase. Failure to segregate these metabolic pathways through mitochondrial fusion and fission results in cells either sacrificing the capacity for OXPHOS while sustaining the reductive synthesis of proline, or foregoing proline synthesis while preserving adaptive OXPHOS. These findings provide evidence of the key role of mitochondrial fission and fusion in maintaining both oxidative and reductive biosyntheses in response to changing nutrient availability and bioenergetic demand.",

          "abstract": "Neuropeptides have important roles in neural plasticity, spiking and behaviour1. Yet, many fundamental questions remain regarding their spatiotemporal transmission, integration and functions in the awake brain. Here we examined how MC4R-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVHMC4R) integrate neuropeptide signals to modulate feeding-related fast synaptic transmission and titrate the transition to satiety2,3,4,5,6. We show that hunger-promoting AgRP axons release the neuropeptide NPY to decrease the second messenger cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons, while satiety-promoting POMC axons release the neuropeptide αMSH to increase cAMP. Each release event is all-or-none, stochastic and can impact multiple neurons within an approximately 100-µm-diameter region. After release, NPY and αMSH peptides compete to control cAMP—the amplitude and persistence of NPY signalling is blunted by high αMSH in the fed state, while αMSH signalling is blunted by high NPY in the fasted state. Feeding resolves this competition by simultaneously elevating αMSH release and suppressing NPY release7,8, thereby sustaining elevated cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons throughout a meal. In turn, elevated cAMP facilitates potentiation of feeding-related excitatory inputs with each bite to gradually promote satiation across many minutes. Our findings highlight biochemical modes of peptide signal integration and information accumulation to guide behavioural state transitions.",

Despite the remarkable conservation of early embryogenesis across animals, the evolutionary origins of how and when this process first emerged remain elusive. Here, by combining time-resolved imaging and transcriptomic profiling, we show that single cells of the ichthyosporean Chromosphaera perkinsii—a close relative that diverged from animals about 1 billion years ago3,4—undergo symmetry breaking and develop through cleavage divisions to produce a prolonged multicellular colony with distinct co-existing cell types. Our findings about the autonomous and palintomic developmental program of C. perkinsii hint that such multicellular development either is much older than previously thought or evolved convergently in ichthyosporeans.",

          "abstract": "Ion-conducting polymer membranes are essential in many separation processes and electrochemical devices, including electrodialysis 1 , redox flow batteries 2 , fuel cells 3 and electrolysers 4,5 . Controlling ion transport and selectivity in these membranes largely hinges on the manipulation of pore size. Although membrane pore structures can be designed in the dry state 6 , they are redefined upon hydration owing to swelling in electrolyte solutions. Strategies to control pore hydration and a deeper understanding of pore structure evolution are vital for accurate pore size tuning. Here we report polymer membranes containing pendant groups of varying hydrophobicity, strategically positioned near charged groups to regulate their hydration capacity and pore swelling. Modulation of the hydrated micropore size (less than two nanometres) enables direct control over water and ion transport across broad length scales, as quantified by spectroscopic and computational methods. Ion selectivity improves in hydration-restrained pores created by more hydrophobic pendant groups. These highly interconnected ion transport channels, with tuned pore gate sizes, show higher ionic conductivity and orders-of-magnitude lower permeation rates of redox-active species compared with conventional membranes, enabling stable cycling of energy-dense aqueous organic redox flow batteries. This pore size tailoring approach provides a promising avenue to membranes with precisely controlled ionic and molecular transport functions.",

          "abstract": "The chromosomal theory of inheritance dictates that genes on the same chromosome segregate together while genes on different chromosomes assort independently 1 . Extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are common in cancer and drive oncogene amplification, dysregulated gene expression and intratumoural heterogeneity through random segregation during cell division 2,3 . Distinct ecDNA sequences, termed ecDNA species, can co-exist to facilitate intermolecular cooperation in cancer cells 4 . How multiple ecDNA species within a tumour cell are assorted and maintained across somatic cell generations is unclear. Here we show that cooperative ecDNA species are coordinately inherited through mitotic co-segregation. Imaging and single-cell analyses show that multiple ecDNAs encoding distinct oncogenes co-occur and are correlated in copy number in human cancer cells. ecDNA species are coordinately segregated asymmetrically during mitosis, resulting in daughter cells with simultaneous copy-number gains in multiple ecDNA species before any selection. Intermolecular proximity and active transcription at the start of mitosis facilitate the coordinated segregation of ecDNA species, and transcription inhibition reduces co-segregation. Computational modelling reveals the quantitative principles of ecDNA co-segregation and co-selection, predicting their observed distributions in cancer cells. Coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs enables co-amplification of specialized ecDNAs containing only enhancer elements and guides therapeutic strategies to jointly deplete cooperating ecDNA oncogenes. Coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs confers stability to oncogene cooperation and novel gene regulatory circuits, allowing winning combinations of epigenetic states to be transmitted across cell generations.",

          "abstract": "Crystalline solids typically show robust long-range structural ordering, vital for their remarkable electronic properties and use in functional electronics, albeit with limited customization space. By contrast, synthetic molecular systems provide highly tunable structural topologies and versatile functionalities but are often too delicate for scalable electronic integration. Combining these two systems could harness the strengths of both, yet realizing this integration is challenging owing to distinct chemical bonding structures and processing conditions. Two-dimensional atomic crystals comprise crystalline atomic layers separated by non-bonding van der Waals gaps, allowing diverse atomic or molecular intercalants to be inserted without disrupting existing covalent bonds. This enables the creation of a diverse set of layered hybrid superlattices (LHSLs) composed of alternating crystalline atomic layers of variable electronic properties and self-assembled atomic or molecular interlayers featuring customizable chemical compositions and structural motifs. Here we outline strategies to prepare LHSLs and discuss emergent properties. With the versatile molecular design strategies and modular assembly processes, LHSLs offer vast flexibility for weaving distinct chemical constituents and quantum properties into monolithic artificial solids with a designable three-dimensional potential landscape. This opens unprecedented opportunities to tailor charge correlations, quantum properties and topological phases, thereby defining a rich material platform for advancing quantum information science.",

Targeted multisensory engagement of these afferent units, however, faces persistent challenges, especially for wearable, programmable systems that need to operate adaptively across the body8,9,10,11. Here we present a miniaturized electromechanical structure that, when combined with skin as an elastic, energy-storing element, supports bistable, self-sensing modes of deformation. Targeting specific classes of mechanoreceptors as the basis for distinct, programmed sensory responses, this haptic unit can deliver both dynamic and static stimuli, directed as either normal or shear forces. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies establish foundational principles and practical criteria for low-energy operation across natural anatomical variations in the mechanical properties of human skin. A wireless, skin-conformable haptic interface, integrating an array of these bistable transducers, serves as a high-density channel capable of rendering input from smartphone-based 3D scanning and inertial sensors. Demonstrations of this system include sensory substitution designed to improve the quality of life for patients with visual and proprioceptive impairments.",

          "abstract": "The yeast SWR1 complex catalyses the exchange of histone H2A–H2B dimers in nucleosomes, with Htz1–H2B dimers 1–3 . Here we used single-molecule analysis to demonstrate two-step double exchange of the two H2A–H2B dimers in a canonical yeast nucleosome with Htz1–H2B dimers, and showed that double exchange can be processive without release of the nucleosome from the SWR1 complex. Further analysis showed that bound nucleosomes flip between two states, with each presenting a different face, and hence histone dimer, to SWR1. The bound dwell time is longer when an H2A–H2B dimer is presented for exchange than when presented with an Htz1–H2B dimer. A hexasome intermediate in the reaction is bound to the SWR1 complex in a single orientation with the ‘empty’ site presented for dimer insertion. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed different populations of complexes showing nucleosomes caught ‘flipping’ between different conformations without release, each placing a different dimer into position for exchange, with the Swc2 subunit having a key role in this process. Together, the data reveal a processive mechanism for double dimer exchange that explains how SWR1 can ‘proofread’ the dimer identities within nucleosomes.",

The pathogenesis of irMyocarditis and its relationship to antitumour immunity remain poorly understood. Here we sought to define immune responses in heart, tumour and blood in patients with irMyocarditis by leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, microscopy and proteomics analyses of samples from 28 patients with irMyocarditis and 41 unaffected individuals. Analyses of 84,576 cardiac cells by single-cell RNA sequencing combined with multiplexed microscopy demonstrated increased frequencies and co-localization of cytotoxic T cells, conventional dendritic cells and inflammatory fibroblasts in irMyocarditis heart tissue. Analyses of 366,066 blood cells revealed decreased frequencies of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conventional dendritic cells and B lineage cells but an increased frequency of other mononuclear phagocytes in irMyocarditis. Fifty-two heart-expanded TCR clones from eight patients did not recognize the putative cardiac autoantigens α-myosin, troponin I or troponin T. Additionally, TCRs enriched in heart tissue were largely nonoverlapping with those enriched in paired tumour tissue. The presence of heart-expanded TCRs in a cycling blood CD8 T cell population was associated with fatal irMyocarditis case status.

          "abstract": "Various bacteria are suggested to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) development1,2,3,4,5, including pks+Escherichia coli, which produces the genotoxin colibactin that induces characteristic mutational signatures in host epithelial cells6. However, it remains unclear how the highly unstable colibactin molecule is able to access host epithelial cells to cause harm. Here, using the microbiota-dependent ZEB2-transgenic mouse model of invasive CRC7, we demonstrate that the oncogenic potential of pks+E. coli critically depends on bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells, mediated by the type 1 pilus adhesin FimH and the F9 pilus adhesin FmlH. Blocking bacterial adhesion using a pharmacological FimH inhibitor attenuates colibactin-mediated genotoxicity and CRC exacerbation. We also show that allelic switching of FimH strongly influences the genotoxic potential of pks+E. coli and can induce a genotoxic gain-of-function in the probiotic strain Nissle 1917. Adhesin-mediated epithelial binding subsequently allows the production of the genotoxin colibactin in close proximity to host epithelial cells, which promotes DNA damage and drives CRC development. These findings present promising therapeutic routes for the development of anti-adhesive therapies aimed at mitigating colibactin-induced DNA damage and inhibiting the initiation and progression of CRC, particularly in individuals at risk for developing CRC.",

          "abstract": "The fast increase of convergence rate between India and Eurasia around 65 million years ago (Ma)—from approximately 8 cm yr−1 to a peak rate of approximately 18 cm yr−1—remains a complex geological event to explain1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, given the inherent uncertainty surrounding the tectonic history and the intricate interplay of forces influencing plate speed9,10,11. Here we use a combination of geochemical analysis and geodynamic modelling to propose that this rapid convergence can be explained by sediment subduction derived from the northern Indian passive margin. Through isotope and trace element analysis, we find an enhanced contribution of terrigenous sediment melt to the mantle source of the Gangdese magmatic rocks around 65 Ma, concurrent with the acceleration of India–Eurasia convergence. Numerical experiments suggest that subduction of sediments more than 1 km thick covering an approximately 1,000-km-wide ocean basin abutting the northern Indian passive margin starting from 65 Ma could have spurred the increased convergence rate and further led to significant crustal extension, consistent with empirical observations. Our study implies that the acceleration of India–Eurasia convergence marks the arrival of passive-margin-derived sediments, constraining the initial India–Eurasia collision to be around 60 Ma. It further suggests that temporary accelerations in subduction rates might be a common feature at the final stage of continental assembly.",

Patient data are often stored in unstructured text and siloed datasets.

MSK-CHORD includes data for non-small-cell lung (n = 7,809), breast (n = 5,368), colorectal (n = 5,543), prostate (n = 3,211) and pancreatic (n = 3,109) cancers and enables discovery of clinicogenomic relationships not apparent in smaller datasets. Leveraging MSK-CHORD to train machine learning models to predict overall survival, we find that models including features derived from natural language processing, such as sites of disease, outperform those based on genomic data or stage alone as tested by cross-validation and an external, multi-institution dataset. By annotating 705,241 radiology reports, MSK-CHORD also uncovers predictors of metastasis to specific organ sites, including a relationship between SETD2 mutation and lower metastatic potential in immunotherapy-treated lung adenocarcinoma corroborated in independent datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of automated annotation from unstructured notes and its utility in predicting patient outcomes.

          "abstract": "Persistent, memorandum-specific neuronal spiking activity has long been hypothesized to underlie working memory 1,2 . However, emerging evidence suggests a potential role for ‘activity-silent’ synaptic mechanisms 3–5 . This issue remains controversial because evidence for either view has largely relied either on datasets that fail to capture single-trial population dynamics or on indirect measures of neuronal spiking. We addressed this controversy by examining the dynamics of mnemonic information on single trials obtained from large, local populations of lateral prefrontal neurons recorded simultaneously in monkeys performing a working memory task. Here we show that mnemonic information does not persist in the spiking activity of neuronal populations during memory delays, but instead alternates between coordinated ‘On’ and ‘Off’ states. At the level of single neurons, Off states are driven by both a loss of selectivity for memoranda and a return of firing rates to spontaneous levels. Further exploiting the large-scale recordings used here, we show that mnemonic information is available in the patterns of functional connections among neuronal ensembles during Off states. Our results suggest that intermittent periods of memorandum-specific spiking coexist with synaptic mechanisms to support working memory.",

          "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major contributor to treatment resistance and poor outcome for patients with cancer 1,2 . Here we examine the diversity of ecDNA elements across cancer, revealing the associated tissue, genetic and mutational contexts. By analysing data from 14,778 patients with 39 tumour types from the 100,000 Genomes Project, we demonstrate that 17.1% of tumour samples contain ecDNA. We reveal a pattern highly indicative of tissue-context-based selection for ecDNAs, linking their genomic content to their tissue of origin. We show that not only is ecDNA a mechanism for amplification of driver oncogenes, but it also a mechanism that frequently amplifies immunomodulatory and inflammatory genes, such as those that modulate lymphocyte-mediated immunity and immune effector processes. Moreover, ecDNAs carrying immunomodulatory genes are associated with reduced tumour T cell infiltration. We identify ecDNAs bearing only enhancers, promoters and lncRNA elements, suggesting the combinatorial power of interactions between ecDNAs in trans . We also identify intrinsic and environmental mutational processes linked to ecDNA, including those linked to its formation, such as tobacco exposure, and progression, such as homologous recombination repair deficiency. Clinically, ecDNA detection was associated with tumour stage, more prevalent after targeted therapy and cytotoxic treatments, and associated with metastases and shorter overall survival. These results shed light on why ecDNA is a substantial clinical problem that can cooperatively drive tumour growth signals, alter transcriptional landscapes and suppress the immune system.",

          "abstract": "Autonomous laboratories can accelerate discoveries in chemical synthesis, but this requires automated measurements coupled with reliable decision-making 1,2 . Most autonomous laboratories involve bespoke automated equipment 3–6 , and reaction outcomes are often assessed using a single, hard-wired characterization technique 7 . Any decision-making algorithms 8 must then operate using this narrow range of characterization data 9,10 . By contrast, manual experiments tend to draw on a wider range of instruments to characterize reaction products, and decisions are rarely taken based on one measurement alone. Here we show that a synthesis laboratory can be integrated into an autonomous laboratory by using mobile robots 11–13 that operate equipment and make decisions in a human-like way. Our modular workflow combines mobile robots, an automated synthesis platform, a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometer and a benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. This allows robots to share existing laboratory equipment with human researchers without monopolizing it or requiring extensive redesign. A heuristic decision-maker processes the orthogonal measurement data, selecting successful reactions to take forward and automatically checking the reproducibility of any screening hits. We exemplify this approach in the three areas of structural diversification chemistry, supramolecular host–guest chemistry and photochemical synthesis. This strategy is particularly suited to exploratory chemistry that can yield multiple potential products, as for supramolecular assemblies, where we also extend the method to an autonomous function assay by evaluating host–guest binding properties.",

Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the humoral immune response to XBB and JN.1 human exposure. We demonstrate the antigenic distinctiveness of XBB and JN.1 lineages in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals, and JN.1 infection elicits superior plasma neutralization against its subvariants. We highlight KP.3’s strong immune evasion and receptor binding capability, supporting its foreseeable prevalence. Extensive analysis of the BCR repertoire, isolating ~2000 RBD-specific antibodies with their targeting epitopes characterized by deep mutational scanning (DMS), underscores the superiority of JN.1-elicited memory B cells 4,5. Class 1 IGHV3-53/3-66-derived neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) contribute majorly within wildtype-reactive NAbs against JN.1. However, KP.2 and KP.3 evade a substantial subset, even those induced by JN.1, advocating for booster updates to KP.2/KP.3. JN.1-induced Omicron-specific antibodies also demonstrate high potency across Omicron. Escape hotspots of these NAbs have already been mutated, resulting in higher immune barrier to escape, considering probable recovery of escaped NAbs. Additionally, the prevalence of IGHV3-53/3-66-derived antibodies, and their capability of competing with all Omicron-specific NAbs suggests their inhibitory role on the activation of Omicron-specific naive B cells, potentially explaining the heavy immune imprinting in mRNA-vaccinated individuals 6–8. These findings delineate the evolving antibody response to Omicron antigenic shift from XBB to JN.1, and highlight the importance of developing JN.1-lineage, especially KP.2/KP.3-based vaccine boosters.",

However, understanding the precise physiological state and genetic basis of persister formation has been a longstanding challenge. Here we generated a high-resolution single-cell2 RNA atlas of Escherichia coli growth transitions, which revealed that persisters from diverse genetic and physiological models converge to transcriptional states that are distinct from standard growth phases and instead exhibit a dominant signature of translational deficiency. We then used ultra-dense CRISPR interference3 to determine how every E. coli gene contributes to persister formation across genetic models. Among critical genes with large effects, we found lon, which encodes a highly conserved protease4, and yqgE, a poorly characterized gene whose product strongly modulates the duration of post-starvation dormancy and persistence. Our work reveals key physiologic and genetic factors that underlie starvation-triggered persistence, a critical step towards targeting persisters in recalcitrant bacterial infections.",

          "abstract": "Hypoxic cancer cells resist many antineoplastic therapies and can seed recurrence1,2. We previously found that either deficiency or inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP1B) promotes human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer cell death in hypoxia by activation of RNF213 (ref. 3), a large protein with multiple AAA-ATPase domains and two ubiquitin ligase domains (RING and RZ) implicated in Moyamoya disease, lipotoxicity and innate immunity4. Here we report that PTP1B and ABL1/2 reciprocally control RNF213 tyrosine phosphorylation and, consequently, its oligomerization and RZ domain activation. The RZ domain ubiquitylates and induces the degradation of the major NF-κB regulator CYLD/SPATA2. Decreased CYLD/SPATA2 levels lead to NF-κB activation and induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome which, together with hypoxia-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, triggers pyroptotic cell death. Consistent with this model, CYLD deletion phenocopies, whereas NLRP3 deletion blocks, the effects of PTP1B deficiency on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer xenograft growth. Reconstitution studies with RNF213 mutants confirm that the RZ domain mediates tumour cell death. In concert, our results identify a unique, potentially targetable PTP1B–RNF213–CYLD–SPATA2 pathway critical for the control of inflammatory cell death in hypoxic tumours, provide new insights into RNF213 regulation and have potential implications for the pathogenesis of Moyamoya disease, inflammatory disorders and autoimmune disease.",

          "abstract": "Somatic alterations in the oncogenic kinase AKT1 have been identified in a broad spectrum of solid tumours. The most common AKT1 alteration replaces Glu17 with Lys (E17K) in the regulatory pleckstrin homology domain1, resulting in constitutive membrane localization and activation of oncogenic signalling. In clinical studies, pan-AKT inhibitors have been found to cause dose-limiting hyperglycaemia2,3,4,5,6, which has motivated the search for mutant-selective inhibitors. We exploited the E17K mutation to design allosteric, lysine-targeted salicylaldehyde inhibitors with selectivity for AKT1 (E17K) over wild-type AKT paralogues, a major challenge given the presence of three conserved lysines near the allosteric site. Crystallographic analysis of the covalent inhibitor complex unexpectedly revealed an adventitious tetrahedral zinc ion that coordinates two proximal cysteines in the kinase activation loop while simultaneously engaging the E17K–imine conjugate. The salicylaldimine complex with AKT1 (E17K), but not that with wild-type AKT1, recruits endogenous Zn2+ in cells, resulting in sustained inhibition. A salicylaldehyde-based inhibitor was efficacious in AKT1 (E17K) tumour xenograft models at doses that did not induce hyperglycaemia. Our study demonstrates the potential to achieve exquisite residence-time-based selectivity for AKT1 (E17K) by targeting the mutant lysine together with Zn2+ chelation by the resulting salicylaldimine adduct.",

At present, there are no ecDNA-specific treatments. Here we show that enhancing transcription–replication conflict enables targeted elimination of ecDNA-containing cancers. Stepwise analyses of ecDNA transcription reveal pervasive RNA transcription and associated single-stranded DNA, leading to excessive transcription–replication conflicts and replication stress compared with chromosomal loci. Nucleotide incorporation on ecDNA is markedly slower, and replication stress is significantly higher in ecDNA-containing tumours regardless of cancer type or oncogene cargo. pRPA2-S33, a mediator of DNA damage repair that binds single-stranded DNA, shows elevated localization on ecDNA in a transcription-dependent manner, along with increased DNA double strand breaks, and activation of the S-phase checkpoint kinase, CHK1. Genetic or pharmacological CHK1 inhibition causes extensive and preferential tumour cell death in ecDNA-containing tumours. We advance a highly selective, potent and bioavailable oral CHK1 inhibitor, BBI-2779, that preferentially kills ecDNA-containing tumour cells. In a gastric cancer model containing FGFR2 amplified on ecDNA, BBI-2779 suppresses tumour growth and prevents ecDNA-mediated acquired resistance to the pan-FGFR inhibitor infigratinib, resulting in potent and sustained tumour regression in mice. Transcription–replication conflict emerges as a target for ecDNA-directed therapy, exploiting a synthetic lethality of excess to treat cancer.",

These complex systems manifest a variety of shapes 1–3 , traditionally explored using non-invasive spectroscopic techniques at low energies 4,5 . However, at these energies, their instantaneous shapes are obscured by long-timescale quantum fluctuations, making direct observation challenging. Here we introduce the collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method, which images the nuclear global shape by colliding them at ultrarelativistic speeds and analysing the collective response of outgoing debris. This technique captures a collision-specific snapshot of the spatial matter distribution within the nuclei, which, through the hydrodynamic expansion, imprints patterns on the particle momentum distribution observed in detectors 6,7 . We benchmark this method in collisions of ground-state uranium-238 nuclei, known for their elongated, axial-symmetric shape. Our findings show a large deformation with a slight deviation from axial symmetry in the nuclear ground state, aligning broadly with previous low-energy experiments. This approach offers a new method for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances our understanding of the initial conditions in high-energy collisions and addresses the important issue of nuclear structure evolution across energy scales.",

Using intelligent reconstruction algorithms, multi-channel images can be recovered from each frame, realizing real-time hyperspectral imaging. Following this framework, we fabricated a broadband visible–near-infrared (400–1,700 nm) hyperspectral image sensor using photolithography, with an average light throughput of 74.8% and 96 wavelength channels. The demonstrated resolution is 1,024 × 1,024 pixels at 124 fps. We demonstrated its wide applications, including chlorophyll and sugar quantification for intelligent agriculture, blood oxygen and water quality monitoring for human health, textile classification and apple bruise detection for industrial automation, and remote lunar detection for astronomy. The integrated hyperspectral image sensor weighs only tens of grams and can be assembled on various resource-limited platforms or equipped with off-the-shelf optical systems.

          "abstract": "Memories are encoded in neural ensembles during learning 1–6 and are stabilized by post-learning reactivation 7–17 . Integrating recent experiences into existing memories ensures that memories contain the most recently available information, but how the brain accomplishes this critical process remains unclear. Here we show that in mice, a strong aversive experience drives offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed 2 days before, linking fear of the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory. Fear specifically links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral memories across days. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the recent aversive memory ensemble is reactivated during the offline period after learning. However, a strong aversive experience also increases co-reactivation of the aversive and neutral memory ensembles during the offline period. Ensemble co-reactivation occurs more during wake than during sleep. Finally, the expression of fear in the neutral context is associated with reactivation of the shared ensemble between the aversive and neutral memories. Collectively, these results demonstrate that offline ensemble co-reactivation is a neural mechanism by which memories are integrated across days.",

Here, we use perturbation experiments to probe this ultradian rhythm in sleeping lizards ( Pogona vitticeps ) 7–9 and test the hypothesis that it originates in a central pattern generator 10,11 —circuits that are typically susceptible to phase-dependent reset and entrainment by external stimuli 12 . Using light pulses, we find that Pogona ’s ultradian rhythm 8 can be reset in a phase-dependent manner, with a critical transition from phase delay to phase advance in the middle of SW. The ultradian rhythm frequency can be decreased or increased, within limits, by entrainment with light pulses. During entrainment, Pogona REM (REM P ) can be shortened but not lengthened, whereas SW can be dilated more flexibly. In awake animals, a few alternating light/dark epochs matching natural REM P and SW durations entrain a sleep-like brain rhythm, suggesting the transient activation of an ultradian rhythm generator. In sleeping animals, a light pulse delivered to a single eye causes an immediate ultradian rhythm reset, but only of the contralateral hemisphere; both sides resynchronize spontaneously, indicating that sleep is controlled by paired rhythm-generating circuits linked by functional excitation. Our results indicate that central pattern generators of a type usually known to control motor rhythms may also organize the ultradian sleep rhythm in a vertebrate.",

          "abstract": "The physical manifestations of memory formation and recall are fundamental questions that remain unresolved1. At the cellular level, ensembles of neurons called engrams are activated by learning events and control memory recall1,2,3,4,5. Astrocytes are found in close proximity to neurons and engage in a range of activities that support neurotransmission and circuit plasticity6,7,8,9,10. Moreover, astrocytes exhibit experience-dependent plasticity11,12,13, although whether specific ensembles of astrocytes participate in memory recall remains obscure. Here we show that learning events induce c-Fos expression in a subset of hippocampal astrocytes, and that this subsequently regulates the function of the hippocampal circuit in mice. Intersectional labelling of astrocyte ensembles with c-Fos after learning events shows that they are closely affiliated with engram neurons, and reactivation of these astrocyte ensembles stimulates memory recall. At the molecular level, learning-associated astrocyte (LAA) ensembles exhibit elevated expression of nuclear factor I-A, and its selective deletion from this population suppresses memory recall. Taken together, our data identify LAA ensembles as a form of plasticity that is sufficient to provoke memory recall and indicate that astrocytes are an active component of the engram.",

However, if the melting step can be avoided and solid-state amorphization can be realized electrically, it opens up the possibility for low-power device applications2,3,4,5. Here we report an energy-efficient, unconventional long-range solid-state amorphization in a new ferroic β″-phase of indium selenide nanowires through the application of a direct-current bias rather than a pulsed electrical stimulus. The complex interplay of the applied electric field perpendicular to the polarization, current flow parallel to the van der Waals layer and piezoelectric stress results in the formation of interlayer sliding defects and coupled disorder induced by in-plane polarization rotation in this layered material. On reaching a critical limit of the electrically induced disorder, the structure becomes frustrated and locally collapses into an amorphous phase6, and this phenomenon is replicated over a much larger microscopic-length scale through acoustic jerks7,8. Our work uncovers previously unknown multimodal coupling mechanisms of the ferroic order in materials to the externally applied electric field, current and internally generated stress, and can be useful to design new materials and devices for low-power electronic and photonic applications.",

          "abstract": "The phosphorylation of synaptic proteins is a significant biochemical reaction that controls the sleep–wake cycle in mammals1,2,3. Protein phosphorylation in vivo is reversibly regulated by kinases and phosphatases. In this study, we investigate a pair of kinases and phosphatases that reciprocally regulate sleep duration. First, we perform a comprehensive screen of protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family genes by generating 40 gene knockout mouse lines using prenatal and postnatal CRISPR targeting. We identify a regulatory subunit of PKA (Prkar2b), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1; Pppr1r9b) and catalytic and regulatory subunits of calcineurin (also known as PP2B) (Ppp3ca and Ppp3r1) as sleep control genes. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated stimulation of PKA and PP1–calcineurin activities, we show that PKA is a wake-promoting kinase, whereas PP1 and calcineurin function as sleep-promoting phosphatases. The importance of these phosphatases in sleep regulation is supported by the marked changes in sleep duration associated with their increased and decreased activities, ranging from approximately 17.3 h per day (PP1 expression) to 4.3 h per day (postnatal CRISPR targeting of calcineurin). Localization signals to the excitatory post-synapse are necessary for these phosphatases to exert their sleep-promoting effects. Furthermore, the wake-promoting effect of PKA localized to the excitatory post-synapse negated the sleep-promoting effect of PP1–calcineurin. These findings indicate that PKA and PP1–calcineurin have competing functions in sleep regulation at excitatory post-synapses.",

Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been investigated through, for example, measurements of the phase coherence8,9,10 and gapless Goldstone modes13, but quantized vortices, a hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here, with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate vortices in dipolar gases14,15 and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline order11,16,17, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation of vortices in the supersolid phase (SSP). Our work reveals a fundamental difference in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids.

          "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events detected from beyond the Milky Way. FRB emission characteristics favour highly magnetized neutron stars, or magnetars, as the sources1, as evidenced by FRB-like bursts from a galactic magnetar2,3, and the star-forming nature of FRB host galaxies4,5. However, the processes that produce FRB sources remain unknown6. Although galactic magnetars are often linked to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe)7, it is uncertain what determines which supernovae result in magnetars. The galactic environments of FRB sources can be used to investigate their progenitors. Here, we present the stellar population properties of 30 FRB host galaxies discovered by the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110). Our analysis shows a marked deficit of low-mass FRB hosts compared with the occurrence of star formation in the Universe, implying that FRBs are a biased tracer of star formation, preferentially selecting massive star-forming galaxies. This bias may be driven by galaxy metallicity, which is positively correlated with stellar mass8. Metal-rich environments may favour the formation of magnetar progenitors through stellar mergers9,10, as higher-metallicity stars are less compact and more likely to fill their Roche lobes, leading to unstable mass transfer. Although massive stars do not have convective interiors to generate strong magnetic fields by dynamo11, merger remnants are thought to have the requisite internal magnetic-field strengths to result in magnetars11,12. The preferential occurrence of FRBs in massive star-forming galaxies suggests that a core-collapse supernova of merger remnants preferentially forms magnetars.",

Classical molecular dynamics simulation is fast but lacks chemical accuracy4,5. Quantum chemistry methods such as density functional theory can reach chemical accuracy but cannot scale to support large biomolecules6. Here we introduce an artificial intelligence-based ab initio biomolecular dynamics system (AI2BMD) that can efficiently simulate full-atom large biomolecules with ab initio accuracy. AI2BMD uses a protein fragmentation scheme and a machine learning force field7 to achieve generalizable ab initio accuracy for energy and force calculations for various proteins comprising more than 10,000 atoms. Compared to density functional theory, it reduces the computational time by several orders of magnitude. With several hundred nanoseconds of dynamics simulations, AI2BMD demonstrated its ability to efficiently explore the conformational space of peptides and proteins, deriving accurate 3J couplings that match nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, and showing protein folding and unfolding processes. Furthermore, AI2BMD enables precise free-energy calculations for protein folding, and the estimated thermodynamic properties are well aligned with experiments. AI2BMD could potentially complement wet-lab experiments, detect the dynamic processes of bioactivities and enable biomedical research that is impossible to conduct at present.",

          "abstract": "To flexibly adapt to new situations, our brains must understand the regularities in the world, as well as those in our own patterns of behaviour. A wealth of findings is beginning to reveal the algorithms that we use to map the outside world 1–6 . However, the biological algorithms that map the complex structured behaviours that we compose to reach our goals remain unknown. Here we reveal a neuronal implementation of an algorithm for mapping abstract behavioural structure and transferring it to new scenarios. We trained mice on many tasks that shared a common structure (organizing a sequence of goals) but differed in the specific goal locations. The mice discovered the underlying task structure, enabling zero-shot inferences on the first trial of new tasks. The activity of most neurons in the medial frontal cortex tiled progress to goal, akin to how place cells map physical space. These ‘goal-progress cells’ generalized, stretching and compressing their tiling to accommodate different goal distances. By contrast, progress along the overall sequence of goals was not encoded explicitly. Instead, a subset of goal-progress cells was further tuned such that individual neurons fired with a fixed task lag from a particular behavioural step. Together, these cells acted as task-structured memory buffers, implementing an algorithm that instantaneously encoded the entire sequence of future behavioural steps, and whose dynamics automatically computed the appropriate action at each step. These dynamics mirrored the abstract task structure both on-task and during offline sleep. Our findings suggest that schemata of complex behavioural structures can be generated by sculpting progress-to-goal tuning into task-structured buffers of individual behavioural steps.",

It might therefore seem reasonable to think of the nucleus as a tiny, point-like ball. Further investigation, however, reveals that nuclei take on a range of shapes, with ellipsoids being the most common. Information about nuclear shape is typically obtained by shooting a beam of particles onto a fixed target at velocities of a few per cent of the speed of light1. Writing in Nature, the STAR Collaboration2 reports that detailed imaging of nuclear shapes is also possible using data collected when heavy ions collide at velocities that approach the speed of light.",

          "abstract": "Depression represents a significant global public health challenge, and marital status has been recognized as a potential risk factor. However, previous investigations of this association have primarily focused on Western samples with substantial heterogeneity. Our study aimed to examine the association between marital status and depressive symptoms across countries with diverse cultural backgrounds using a large-scale, two-stage, cross-country analysis. We used nationally representative, de-identified individual-level data from seven countries, including the USA, the UK, Mexico, Ireland, Korea, China and Indonesia (106,556 cross-sectional and 20,865 longitudinal participants), representing approximately 541 million adults. The follow-up duration ranged from 4 to 18 years. Our analysis revealed that unmarried individuals had a higher risk of depressive symptoms than their married counterparts across all countries (pooled odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.61–2.14). However, the magnitude of this risk was influenced by country, sex and education level, with greater risk in Western versus Eastern countries (β = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16–0.56; P < 0.001), among males versus females (β = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.003–0.47; P = 0.047) and among those with higher versus lower educational attainment (β2 = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.11–0.56; P = 0.003). Furthermore, alcohol drinking causally mediated increased later depressive symptom risk among widowed, divorced/separated and single Chinese, Korean and Mexican participants (all P < 0.001). Similarly, smoking was as identified as a causal mediator among single individuals in China and Mexico, and the results remained unchanged in the bootstrap resampling validation and the sensitivity analyses. Our cross-country analysis suggests that unmarried individuals may be at greater risk of depression, and any efforts to mitigate this risk should consider the roles of cultural context, sex, educational attainment and substance use.",

          "abstract": "Widely used in research since the 1800s, SCR (also known as the galvanic skin response or electrodermal activity) measures changes in the electrical conductivity of the skin due to sweat gland activity. SCR has historically been considered a ‘gold standard’ for the objective biological measurement of fear and anxiety. However, myriad emotional, cognitive and physical factors can influence sweating and thereby SCR magnitude, which demonstrates it indexes general arousal. Individuals may exhibit increased SCR when stressed (for example, being deceptive or simply attempting to understand a difficult question) or for reasons unrelated to stress (for example, positive emotions such as happiness or non-emotional processes such as focusing attention4). As such, SCR has inherently poor specificity and discriminant validity as a measure of anxiety5.\n\nSince the 1920s, SCR has been a major component of polygraph testing, which has entrenched it in the criminal legal system4. Currently, polygraph examinations remain controversial owing to concerns about reliability and validity. Although judges have substantial discretion over whether polygraph results can be presented to the jury6, about half of US states still allow polygraph evidence with stipulated agreement by both the defence and prosecution before administering the test. Furthermore, polygraph examinations are also widely accepted as evidence in criminal cases across Europe, in civil cases in China and for all cases in Colombia6. Polygraphs are also used at earlier stages of law enforcement to verify witness statements and to justify further interrogation of suspects6, and at later stages to track progress under court supervision (for example, monitoring of individuals convicted of a sexual offence).",

Psychological inoculation—an intervention intended to help people identify manipulation techniques—is being adopted at scale around the globe. Yet the efficacy of this approach for increasing belief accuracy remains unclear, as prior work uses synthetic materials that do not contain claims of truth. To address this issue, we conducted five studies with 7,286 online participants using a set of news headlines based on real-world true/false content in which we systematically varied the presence or absence of emotional manipulation. Although an emotional manipulation inoculation did help participants identify emotional manipulation, there was no improvement in participants’ ability to tell truth from falsehood. However, when the inoculation was paired with an intervention that draws people’s attention to accuracy, the combined intervention did successfully improve truth discernment (by increasing belief in true content). These results provide evidence for synergy between popular misinformation interventions.",

          "abstract": "Movies are a massively popular and influential form of media, but their computational study at scale has largely been off-limits to researchers in the United States due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In this work, we illustrate use of a new regulatory framework to enable computational research on film that permits circumvention of technological protection measures on digital video discs (DVDs). We use this exemption to legally digitize a collection of 2,307 films representing the top 50 movies by U.S. box office over the period 1980 to 2022, along with award nominees. We design a computational pipeline for measuring the representation of gender and race/ethnicity in film, drawing on computer vision models for recognizing actors and human perceptions of gender and race/ethnicity. Doing so allows us to learn substantive facts about representation and diversity in Hollywood over this period, confirming earlier studies that see an increase in diversity over the past decade, while allowing us to use computational methods to uncover a range of ad hoc analytical findings. Our work illustrates the affordances of the data-driven analysis of film at a large scale.",

          "authors": "Saroja Adhikari, Wolfgang Lutz, Endale Kebede",
          "abstract": "While female education has long been recognized as a key driver of fertility decline during the process of demographic transition and most population projection models consider it implicitly or explicitly in their forecasts of overall fertility, there still is need for a method to forecast education-specific fertility trends directly. Here we propose a method for projecting education-specific fertility declines for cohorts of women in Sub-Saharan Africa based on all available demographic and health surveys data for African countries (including 1.03Mio cases). We study at different levels of aggregation (sample clusters, strata, and national) the associations between ideal family size and completed cohort fertility for education groups, on the one hand, and the average level of education in those units, on the other. The consistently very strong empirical associations suggest a plausible narrative by which a higher prevalence of educated women in a spatial unit influences the fertility levels of women in all specific education categories. Empirical associations between education-specific cohort fertility trends at the national level and newly available quality-adjusted human capital data for these cohorts are then operationalized to produce education-specific population projections as they are needed for—among other uses—the shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios that are widely used in the climate change research community. Sensitivity analyses including out-of-sample projections support the validity of the proposed method which is then applied to 37 African countries.",

          "abstract": "A country’s national income broadly depends on the quantity and quality of workers and capital. But how well these factors are managed within and between firms may be a key determinant of a country’s productivity and its GDP. Although social scientists have long studied the role of management practices in shaping business performance, their primary tool has been individual case studies. While useful for theory-building, such qualitative work is hard to scale and quantify. We present a large, scalable dataset measuring structured management practices at the business level across multiple countries. We measure practices related to performance monitoring, target-setting, and human resources. We document a set of key stylized facts, which we label “the international empirics of management”. In all countries, firms with more structured practices tend to also have superior economic performance: they are larger in scale, are more profitable, have higher labor productivity and are more likely to export. This consistency was not obvious ex-ante, and being able to quantify these relationships is valuable. We also document significant variation in practices across and within countries, which is important in explaining differences in the wealth of nations. The positive relationship between firm size and structured management practices is stronger in countries with more open and free markets, suggesting that stronger competition may allow firms with more structured management practices to grow larger, thereby potentially raising aggregate national income.",

We propose that exposure to a stereotype, regardless of whether one agrees with it, can shape how one experiences and learns from interactions with members of the stereotyped group, such that it induces individual-level prejudice—a process involving the interplay of semantic knowledge and instrumental learning. In a series of experiments, participants interacted with players from two groups, described with either positive or negative stereotypes, in a reinforcement learning (RL) task presented as a money-sharing game. Although players’ actual sharing rates were equated between groups, participants formed more positive reward associations with players from positively stereotyped than negatively stereotyped groups. This effect persisted even when stereotypes were described as unreliable and participants were instructed to ignore them. Computational modeling revealed that this preference was due to stereotype effects on priors regarding group members’ behavior as well as the learning rates through which reward associations were updated in response to player feedback. We then show that these stereotype-induced preferences, once formed, spread unwittingly to others who observe these interactions, illustrating a pathway through which stereotypes may be transmitted and propagated between society and individuals. By identifying a mechanism through which stereotype knowledge can bypass explicit beliefs to induce prejudice, via the interplay of semantic and instrumental learning processes, these findings illuminate the impact of stereotype messages on the formation and propagation of individual-level prejudice.",

          "abstract": "As the world’s climate continues to change, human populations are exposed to increasingly severe and extreme weather conditions that can promote migration. Here, we examine how extreme weather influences the likelihood of undocumented migration and return between Mexico and the United States. We used data from 48,313 individuals observed between 1992 and 2018 in 84 Mexican agricultural communities. While controlling for regional and temporal confounding factors, we related individual decisions to migrate to the United States without documents and subsequently return to Mexico with lagged weather deviations from the historical norm during the corn-growing season (May to August). Undocumented migration was most likely from areas experiencing extreme drought, and migrants were less likely to return to their communities of origin when extreme weather persisted. These findings establish the role of weather shocks in undocumented Mexican migration to, and eventual settlement in, the United States. The findings also suggest that extreme weather conditions, which are likely to increase with climate change, promote clandestine mobility across borders and, thus, expose migrants to risks associated with crossing dangerous terrain and relying upon smugglers.",

          "abstract": "The “27 Club” refers to the widespread legend that notable people, particularly musicians, are unusually likely to die at age 27. A 2011 inquiry in The BMJ showed this is not the case, dismissing the 27 Club as a myth. We expand on this discourse by demonstrating that although the existence of the phenomenon cannot be empirically validated, it is real in its consequences. Using Wikipedia data, we show that while age 27 does not hold greater risk of mortality for notable persons, those who died at 27 are as a group exceptionally notable compared to those who died at other young ages. The 27 Club legend originated from a statistically improbable event circa 1970, wherein four superstar musicians died within the span of 2 y all at age 27. This coincidence captured the public imagination such that our fascination with the 27 Club brought itself into being, producing greater interest in those who died at age 27 than would have been otherwise. This demonstrates path dependence in cultural evolution, whereby an effectively random event evolves into a narrative that shapes otherwise unrelated events and thus the way we make and interpret history.",

Methionine oxidation can result in structural damage or be the basis of functional regulation of enzymes. In addition to participating in redox reactions, methionines play an important role as the initiator residue of translated proteins where they are commonly modified at their α-amine group by formylation or acetylation. Here, we investigated how formylation and acetylation of initiator methionines impact their propensity for oxidation and reduction. We show that in vitro, N-terminal methionine residues are particularly prone to chemical oxidation and that their modification by formylation or acetylation greatly enhances their subsequent enzymatic reduction by MsrA and MsrB. Concordantly, in vivo ablation of methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTF) in Escherichia coli increases the prevalence of oxidized methionines within synthesized proteins. We show that oxidation of formylated initiator methionines is detrimental in part because it obstructs their ensuing deformylation by peptide deformylase (PDF) and hydrolysis by methionyl aminopeptidase (MAP). Thus, by facilitating their reduction, formylation mitigates the misprocessing of oxidized initiator methionines.",

ALKBH8 is a tRNA-modifying enzyme that methylates wobble uridines in a subset of tRNAs to modulate translation. Through methylation of tRNA-selenocysteine, ALKBH8 promotes selenoprotein synthesis and regulates redox homeostasis. Pathogenic variants in ALKBH8 have been linked to intellectual disability disorders in the human population, but the role of ALKBH8 in the nervous system is unknown. Through in vivo studies in Drosophila , we show that ALKBH8 controls oxidative stress in the brain to restrain synaptic growth and support learning and memory. ALKBH8 null animals lack wobble uridine methylation and exhibit reduced protein synthesis in the nervous system, including a specific decrease in selenoprotein levels. Either loss of ALKBH8 or independent disruption of selenoprotein synthesis results in ectopic synapse formation. Genetic expression of antioxidant enzymes fully suppresses synaptic overgrowth in ALKBH8 null animals, confirming oxidative stress as the underlying cause of dysregulation. ALKBH8 null animals also exhibit associative memory impairments that are reversed by pharmacological antioxidant treatment. Together, these findings demonstrate the critical role of tRNA wobble uridine modification in redox homeostasis in the developing nervous system and reveal antioxidants as a potential therapy for ALKBH8-associated intellectual disability.",

          "abstract": "Attraction and mating between male and female animals depend on effective communication between conspecifics. However, in mosquitoes, we have only a rudimentary understanding of the sensory cues and receptors critical for the communication that is essential for reproductive behavior. While it is known that male Aedes aegypti use sound to help them identify females, it is not unclear whether sound detection is absolutely required since other cues such as vision may also participate in mating behavior. To determine the effect of eliminating hearing on mating success, we knocked out the Ae. aegypti TRPVa channel, which is a protein expressed in chordotonal neurons in the Johnston’s organ (JO) that respond to sound-induced movements in the antenna. Loss of trpVa eradicated sound-induced responses from the JO, thereby abolishing hearing. Strikingly, mutation of trpVa eliminated mating behavior in males. In contrast, trpVa -null females mated, although this behavior was slightly delayed relative to wild-type females. Males and females produce sounds as they beat their wings at distinct frequencies during flight. Sound mimicking the female wingbeat induced flight, attraction, and copulatory-like behavior in wild-type males without females present, but not in trpVa -null males. Males are known to modulate their wingbeat frequencies before mating in the air, which is a phenomenon referred to as rapid frequency modulation (RFM). We found that RFM was absent in mosquitoes lacking TRPVa. We conclude that the requirement for trpVa and hearing for male reproductive behavior in Aedes is absolute, as mating in the deaf males is eliminated.",

          "abstract": "The precise control of flowering time is of utmost importance for crop adaptation to varying environmental conditions and consequently determines grain yield and plant fitness. Soybean E2 , the homolog of Arabidopsis GIGANTEA , is a major locus contributing to high-latitude adaptation and is involved in photoperiod sensitivity. However, due to major effects of E2 , additional genetic loci controlling soybean flowering and adaptation have historically been masked and difficult to identify. Here, by eliminating the effect of E2 , we identified a Tof9 locus controlling flowering in which ZEITLUPE 2 ( ZTL2 ) is the causal gene. ZTL2 encodes an F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase with homology to Arabidopsis ZEITLUPE and is shown to play a key role in the soybean photoperiodic flowering pathway. ZTL2 physically interacts with E2 to mediate its degradation. Intriguingly, ZTL2 and FKF1, both belong to the F-box-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase family, exhibit opposite roles in regulating soybean flowering. ZTL2 degrades E2, leading to early flowering, while FKF1 stabilizes E2, resulting in delayed flowering. The balance between ZTL2-mediated degradation and FKF1-mediated stabilization enables soybeans to finetune flowering time and maximize grain yield. Field-grown ztl2 mutants are taller, flower late, and have increased yield parameters. ZTL2 and FKF1b bear contrasting artificial-selection patterns to adapt to different latitudes. This antagonistic regulation is crucial for soybean adaptation to diverse ecological settings and allows plants to fine-tune their flowering time in response to photoperiod and latitudinal changes.",

          "abstract": "Killer meiotic drivers (KMDs) are selfish genetic elements that distort Mendelian inheritance by selectively killing meiotic products lacking the KMD element, thereby promoting their own propagation. Although KMDs have been found in diverse eukaryotes, only a limited number of them have been characterized at the molecular level, and their killing mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify that a gene previously deemed essential for cell survival in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a single-gene KMD. This gene, tdk1 , kills nearly all tdk1Δ progeny in a tdk1+ × tdk1Δ cross. By analyzing polymorphisms of tdk1 among natural strains, we identify a resistant haplotype, HT3. This haplotype lacks killing ability yet confers resistance to killing by the wild-type tdk1 . Proximity labeling experiments reveal an interaction between Tdk1, the protein product of tdk1 , and the epigenetic reader Bdf1. Interestingly, the nonkilling Tdk1-HT3 variant does not interact with Bdf1. Cryoelectron microscopy further elucidated the binding interface between Tdk1 and Bdf1, pinpointing mutations within Tdk1-HT3 that disrupt this interface. During sexual reproduction, Tdk1 forms stable Bdf1-binding nuclear foci in all spores after meiosis. These foci persist in germinated tdk1Δ progeny and impede chromosome segregation during mitosis by generating aberrant chromosomal adhesions. This study identifies a KMD that masquerades as an essential gene and reveals the molecular mechanism by which this KMD hijacks cellular machinery to execute killing. Additionally, we unveil that losing the hijacking ability is an evolutionary path for this single-gene KMD to evolve into a nonkilling resistant haplotype.",

          "abstract": "In sexual reproduction, selfish genetic elements known as killer meiotic drivers (KMDs) bias inheritance by eliminating gametes that do not carry them. The selective killing behavior of most KMDs can be explained by a toxin–antidote model, where a toxin harms all gametes while an antidote provides resistance to the toxin in carriers. This study investigates whether and how the KMD element tdk1 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe deploys this strategy. Intriguingly, tdk1 relies on a single protein product, Tdk1, for both killing and resistance. We show that Tdk1 exists in a nontoxic tetrameric form during vegetative growth and meiosis but transforms into a distinct toxic form in spores. This toxic form acquires the ability to interact with the histone reader Bdf1 and assembles into supramolecular foci that disrupt mitosis in noncarriers after spore germination. In contrast, Tdk1 synthesized during germination of carrier spores is nontoxic and acts as an antidote, dismantling the preformed toxic Tdk1 assemblies. Replacement of the N-terminal region of Tdk1 with a tetramer-forming peptide reveals its dual roles in imposing an autoinhibited tetrameric conformation and facilitating the assembly of supramolecular foci when autoinhibition is released. Moreover, we successfully reconstituted a functional KMD element by combining a construct that exclusively expresses Tdk1 during meiosis (“toxin-only”) with another construct that expresses Tdk1 specifically during germination (“antidote-only”). This work uncovers a remarkable example of a single protein employing structural duality to form a toxin–antidote pair, expanding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying toxin–antidote systems.",

          "abstract": "Pastures, on which ruminant livestock graze, occupy one third of the earth’s surface. Removing livestock from pastures can support climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration in regrowing vegetation and recovering soils, particularly in potentially forested areas. However, this would also decrease food and fiber production, generating a tradeoff with pasture productivity and the ruminant meat production pastures support. We evaluate the magnitude and distribution of this tradeoff globally, called the “carbon opportunity intensity” of pastures, at a 5-arcminute resolution. We find that removing beef–producing cattle from high–carbon intensity pastures could sequester 34 (22 to 43) GtC i.e. 125 (80 to 158) GtCO 2 into ecosystems, which is an amount greater than global fossil CO 2 emissions from 2021–2023. This would lead to only a minor loss of 13 (9 to 18)% of the global total beef production on pastures, predominantly within high- and upper-middle-income countries. If areas with low–carbon intensity pastures and less efficient beef production simultaneously intensified their beef production to 47% of OECD levels, this could fully counterbalance the global loss of beef production. The carbon opportunity intensity can inform policy approaches to restore ecosystems while minimizing food losses. Future work should aim to provide higher-resolution estimates for use at local and farm scales, and to incorporate a wider set of environmental indicators of outcomes beyond carbon.",

Their biogenesis in Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria involves two machineries: Isc and Suf. Under conditions where cells operate with the Suf system, such as during oxidative stress or iron limitation, the entry of aminoglycosides is reduced, leading to resistance to these antibiotics. The transition between Isc and Suf machineries is controlled by the transcriptional regulator IscR. Here, we found that two small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), FnrS and OxyS, control iscR expression by base pairing to the 5′-UTR of the iscR mRNA. These sRNAs act in opposite ways and in opposite conditions: FnrS, expressed in anaerobiosis, represses the expression of iscR while OxyS, expressed during oxidative stress, activates it. Using an E. coli strain experiencing protracted oxidative stress, we further demonstrate that iscR expression is rapidly and significantly enhanced in the presence of OxyS. Consequently, we further show that OxyS induces resistance to aminoglycosides during oxidative stress through regulation of Fe–S cluster biogenesis, revealing a major role for this sRNA.",

Compared with the HW control, the HWs+ZnO group presented increases in the grain yield, grain protein content, and amino acid content of 22.1%, 11.8%, and 77.5%, respectively. Nanoscale ZnO aggregated on the leaf surface and interacted with leaf surface molecules. Compared with that at ambient temperature, HW treatment increased the dissolution of ZnO NPs on the leaf surface by 25.9% and facilitated their translocation to mesophyll cells. The Zn in the leaves existed as both ionic Zn and particulate ZnO. Compared with the HW control, foliar application of ZnO NPs under HW conditions increased leaf nutrient levels (Zn, Mn, Cu, Fe, and Mg) by 15.8 to 416.9%, the chlorophyll content by 22.2 to 24.8%, Rubisco enzyme activity by 21.2%, and antioxidant activity by 26.7 to 31.2%. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that ZnO NPs reversed HW-induced transcriptomic dysregulation, thereby enhancing leaf photosynthesis by 74.4%. Additionally, ZnO NPs increased the diversity, stability, and enrichment of beneficial microbial taxa and protected the phyllosphere microbial community from HW damage. This work elucidates how NPs interact with the phyllosphere, highlighting the potential of NPs to promote sustainable agriculture, especially under extreme climate events (e.g., HWs).",

Receptor signaling initiating the symbiotic pathway depends on the kinase activity of NFR1, while the signaling mechanism of the catalytically inactive NFR5 pseudokinase is unknown. Here, we present the crystal structure of the signaling-competent Lotus japonicus NFR5 intracellular domain, comprising the juxtamembrane region and pseudokinase domain. The juxtamembrane region is structurally well defined and forms two α-helices, αA and αA′, which contain an exposed hydrophobic motif. We demonstrate that this “juxtamembrane motif” promotes NFR5–NFR5 and NFR1–NFR5 interactions and is essential for symbiotic signaling. Conservation analysis reveals that the juxtamembrane motif is present throughout NFR5-type receptors and is required for symbiosis signaling from barley RLK10, suggesting a conserved and broader function for this motif in plant–microbe symbioses.",

The vast majority of these appear to be sporadic cases associated with small contamination episodes and do not trigger investigations. A “contamination episode” refers to one or more contamination events from a single source over a period of time. We examine clusters of sequenced clinical isolates of Salmonella , Escherichia coli , Campylobacter , and Listeria that differ by only a small number of mutations (SNPs) to identify features of the underlying contamination episodes. These analyses provide additional evidence that the youngest age groups have greater susceptibility to infection by Salmonella , E. coli , and Campylobacter than older age groups. This age bias is weaker for the common Salmonella serovar Enteritidis than Salmonella in general. A large fraction of the contamination episodes causing sickness appear to have a long duration. For example, 50% of the Salmonella cases are in clusters that persist for almost 3 y. For all four pathogen species, the majority of the cases were part of genetic clusters with illnesses in multiple states and likely to be caused by contaminated commercially distributed foods. Salmonella infections in infants under 3 mo are predominantly acquired from the same contaminated food, pet food, or environmental sources as older individuals, rather than infant formula contaminated during production.",

To decode key molecular and cellular processes that occur after ischemia, we performed spatial and single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the male mouse brain during the first week of injury. Cortical gene expression was severely disrupted, defined by inflammation and cell death in the lesion core, and glial scar formation orchestrated by multiple cell types on the periphery. The glial scar was identified as a zone with intense cell–cell communication, with prominent ApoE-Trem2 signaling pathway modulating microglial activation. For each of the three major glial populations, an inflammatory-responsive state, resembling the reactive states observed in neurodegenerative contexts, was observed. The recovered spectrum of ischemia-induced oligodendrocyte states supports the emerging hypothesis that oligodendrocytes actively respond to and modulate the neuroinflammatory stimulus. The findings are further supported by analysis of other spatial transcriptomic datasets from different mouse models of ischemic brain injury. Collectively, we present a landmark transcriptomic dataset accompanied by interactive visualization that provides a comprehensive view of spatiotemporal organization of processes in the postischemic mouse brain.",

In the absence of N6AMT1 , or when its catalytic activity is abolished, RNA processing within mitochondria is impaired, leading to the accumulation of unprocessed and double-stranded RNA, thus preventing mitochondrial protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, and leading to an immune response.

By contrast, plastidial genomes of photosynthetic land plants generally possess a complete set of tRNA genes and the existence of plastidial tRNA import remains a long-standing question. The early vascular plants of the Selaginella genus show an extensive loss of plastidial tRNA genes while retaining photosynthetic capacity, and represent an ideal model for answering this question. Using purification, northern blot hybridization, and high-throughput tRNA sequencing, a global analysis of total and plastidial tRNA populations was undertaken in Selaginella kraussiana. We confirmed the expression of all plastidial tRNA genes and, conversely, observed that nucleus-encoded tRNAs corresponding to these plastidial tRNAs were generally excluded from the chloroplasts. We then demonstrated a selective and differential plastidial import of around forty nucleus-encoded tRNA species, likely compensating for the insufficient coding capacity of plastidial-encoded tRNAs. In-depth analysis revealed differential import of tRNA isodecoders, leading to the identification of specific situations. This includes the expression and import of nucleus-encoded tRNAs expressed from plastidial or bacterial-like genes inserted into the nuclear genome. Overall, our results confirm the existence of molecular processes that enable tRNAs to be selectively imported not only into mitochondria, as previously described, but also into chloroplasts, when necessary.",

The fate of m 6 A-marked mRNA is uniquely diverse, ranging from degradation to stabilization/translation, which has been suggested to be largely dependent on its interaction with the family of YT521-B homology (YTH) domain-containing proteins. Here, we highlight a series of control levers that impinge on the RNA demethylases. We present evidence to indicate that intermediary metabolism and various posttranslation modifications modulate the activity, stability, and the subcellular localization of FTO and ALKBH5, further dispelling the notion that m 6 A methylation is not a dynamic process. We also discuss how examination of these underappreciated regulatory nodes adds a more nuanced view of the role of FTO and ALKBH5 and should guide their study in cancer and nonmalignant conditions alike.",

In Vibrio cholerae colonies, a program of spatial-temporal cell death is among the QS-controlled traits. Cell death occurs in two phases, first along the colony rim, and subsequently, at the colony center. Both cell death phases are driven by the type 6 secretion system (T6SS). Here, we show that HapR, the master QS regulator, does not control t6ss gene expression nor T6SS-mediated killing activity. Nonetheless, a Δ hapR strain displays no cell death at the colony rim. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses reveal that HapR activates expression of an operon containing four genes of unknown function, vca0646-0649. Epistasis and overexpression studies show that two of the genes, vca0646 and vca0647 , are required to drive cell death in both a Δ hapR and a Δ hapR Δ t6ss strain. Thus, vca0646 - 0649 are regulated by HapR but act independently of the T6SS machinery to cause cell death, suggesting that a second, parallel pathway to cell death exists in V. cholerae .",

Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the transition barrier vanishes at the transition temperature. The simulations further show that two low-frequency vibrational–librational modes are directly related to the order parameter that describes this phase transition, which is supported by experimental Raman spectroscopy studies.

Defrosting the planet would result in a plume of fresh glacial meltwater with a different chemical composition from underlying hypersaline seawater, generating both vertical and lateral salinity gradients. Here, we test the plumeworld hypothesis using lithium isotope compositions in the Ediacaran Doushantuo cap dolostone that accumulated in the aftermath of the Marinoan snowball Earth along a proximal–distal (nearshore–offshore) transect in South China. Our data show an overall decreasing δ 7 Li trend with distance from the shoreline, consistent with the variable mixing of a meltwater plume with high δ 7 Li (due to incongruent silicate weathering on the continent) and hypersaline seawater with low δ 7 Li (due to synglacial distillation). The evolution of low δ 7 Li of synglacial seawater, as opposed to the modern oceans with high δ 7 Li, was likely driven by weak continental chemical weathering coupled with strong reverse weathering on the seafloor underneath silica-rich oceans. The spatial pattern of δ 7 Li is also consistent with the development and then collapse of the meltwater plume that occurred at the time scale of cap dolostone accumulation. Therefore, the δ 7 Li data are consistent with the plumeworld hypothesis, considerably reduced chemical weathering on the continent during the Marinoan snowball Earth, and enhanced reverse weathering on the seafloor of Precambrian oceans.",

          "abstract": "The proton-motive force (PMF), consisting of a pH gradient and a membrane potential (ΔΨ) underpins many processes essential to bacterial growth and/or survival. Yet bacteria often enter a bioenergetically diminished state characterized by a low PMF. Consequently, they have increased tolerance for diverse stressors, including clinical antibiotics. Despite the ubiquity of low metabolic rates in the environment, the extent to which bacteria have agency over entry into such a low-bioenergetic state has received relatively little attention. Here, we tested the hypothesis that production of redox-active metabolites (RAMs) could drive such a physiological transition. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that produces phenazines, model RAMs that are highly toxic in the presence of molecular oxygen (O 2 ). Under oxic conditions, the phenazines pyocyanin and phenazine-1-carboximide, as well as toxoflavin—a RAM produced by Burkholderia species—suppress the ΔΨ in distinct ways across distributions of single cells, reduce the efficiency of proton pumping, and lower cellular adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels. In planktonic culture, the degree and rate by which each RAM lowers the ΔΨ correlates with the protection it confers against antibiotics that strongly impact cellular energy flux. This bioenergetic suppression requires the RAM’s presence and corresponds to its cellular reduction rate and abiotic oxidation rate by O 2 ; it can be reversed by increasing the ΔΨ with nigericin. RAMs similarly impact the bioenergetic state of cells in (hyp)oxic biofilm aggregates. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that bacteria can suppress their bioenergetic state by the production of endogenous toxins in a manner that bolsters stress resilience.",

Birds can adjust their wingbeat in multiple ways to accommodate this change in aerodynamic force, but the relative costs of different strategies remain largely unknown. To evaluate the efficiency of several kinematic strategies, I used a robotic wing [E. Ajanic, A. Paolini, C. Coster, D. Floreano, C. Johansson, Adv. Intell. Syst. 5 , 2200148 (2023)] and quantitative flow measurements. I found that, among the tested strategies, changing the mean wingbeat elevation provides the most efficient solution to changing thrust-to-lift ratio ( T / L) , offering insight into why birds tend to beat their wings with a greater ventral than dorsal excursion. I also found that although propulsive efficiency (η p ) may peak at a Strouhal number ( St , measure of relative flapping speed) near 0.3, the overall efficiency of generating force decreases with St . This challenges the expectance of a specific optimal St for flapping flight and instead suggest the chosen St depends on T / L . This may explain variation in preferred St among birds and why bats prefer flying at higher St than birds [G. K. Taylor, R. L. Nudds, A. L. Thomas, Nature 425 , 707–711 (2003)], since their body shape imposes relatively higher thrust requirements [F. T. Muijres, L. C. Johansson, M. S. Bowlin, Y. Winter, A.

However, some putative diazotrophic bacteria, like Roseiflexus sp. RS-1, lack the nifEN genes, suggesting an alternative pathway for maturation of FeMo-co that does not require NifEN. In this study, the Roseiflexus NifH, NifB, and apo-NifDK proteins produced in Escherichia coli are shown to be sufficient for FeMo-co maturation and insertion into the NifDK protein to achieve active nitrogenase. The E. coli expressed NifDK RS contained P-clusters but was devoid of FeMo-co (referred to as apo-NifDK RS ). Apo-NifDK RS could be activated for N 2 reduction by addition of preformed FeMo-co. Further, it was found that apo-NifDK RS plus E. coli produced NifB RS and NifH RS were sufficient to yield active NifDK RS when incubated with the necessary substrates (homocitrate, molybdate, and S -adenosylmethionine [SAM]), demonstrating that these proteins can replace the need for NifEN in maturation of Mo-nitrogenase. The E. coli produced NifH RS and NifB RS proteins were independently shown to be functional. The reconstituted NifDK RS demonstrated reduction of N 2 , protons, and acetylene in ratios observed for Azotobacter vinelandii NifDK. These findings reveal a distinct NifEN-independent pathway for nitrogenase activation involving NifH RS , NifB RS , and apo-NifDK RS .",

Dendritic Ca 2+ spikes are generally thought to produce plateau-like dendritic depolarization and somatic complex spike burst (CSB) firing, which can initiate rapid changes in spatial coding properties of hippocampal pyramidal cells (PCs). However, here we reveal that a morpho-topographically distinguishable subpopulation of rat and mouse hippocampal CA3PCs exhibits compound apical dendritic Ca 2+ spikes with unusually short duration that do not support the firing of sustained CSBs. These Ca 2+ spikes are mediated by L-type Ca 2+ channels and their time course is restricted by A- and M-type K + channels. Cholinergic activation powerfully converts short Ca 2+ spikes to long-duration forms, and facilitates and prolongs CSB firing. We propose that cholinergic neuromodulation controls the ability of a CA3PC subtype to generate sustained plateau potentials, providing a state-dependent dendritic mechanism for memory encoding and retrieval.",

We found that, in addition to the foramina Magendie and Luschka for CSF flow toward the subarachnoid space and glymphatic system, CSF outflow could also occur along periaxonal spaces (termed “PAS pathway”) from the spinal cord to peripheral organs, such as the liver and pancreas. When interrogating the latter route, we found that serotonin, acting through 5-HT 2B receptors expressed in ependymocytes that line the central canal, triggered Ca 2+ signals to induce polymerization of F-actin, a cytoskeletal protein, to reduce the volume of ependymal cells. This paralleled an increased rate of PAS-mediated CSF redistribution toward peripheral organs. In the liver, CSF was received by hepatic stellate cells. CSF efflux toward peripheral organs through the PAS pathway represents a mechanism dynamically connecting the nervous system with the periphery. Our findings are compatible with the traditional theory of CSF efflux into the glymphatic system to clear metabolic waste from the cerebral parenchyma. Thus, we extend the knowledge of CSF flow and expand the understanding of connectivity between the CNS and peripheral organs.",

Unphosphorylated CFTR engages PKA-C at two locations, establishing two “catalytic stations” near to, but not directly involving, the R domain. This configuration, coupled with the conformational flexibility of the R domain, permits transient interactions of the eleven spatially separated phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, we determined two structures of the open-pore CFTR stabilized by PKA-C, providing a molecular basis to understand how PKA-C stimulates CFTR currents even in the absence of phosphorylation.",

While protection from host immune reaction is essential for islet engraftment and their subsequent functioning, intrinsic physiological properties of used cells are also a key factor. We have previously shown that islets with adenoviral-mediated expression of a dipeptidyl peptidase-resistant form of glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) and a constitutively activated form of type 3 muscarinic receptor (M3R) in their beta cells have greatly improved insulin secretory response to glucose stimulation that is otherwise 4 to 10 times lower than human islets. Here, we describe in vitro characterization of the secretory function of pancreatic islets, derived from transgenic pigs expressing the GLP-1M3R cassette under the porcine insulin promoter (InsGLP-1M3R), and their usage to treat insulin-dependent diabetes in an immunodeficient mouse model. Our results show that InsGLP-1M3R islets isolated from neonatal and adult pigs secrete up to 15-fold more insulin in response to glucose stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) islets. They also proved to be more efficient in treating diabetes in a preclinical model as shown by a significantly higher percentage of normoglycemic recipients and higher porcine C-peptide levels up to 9 mo post implantation.",

Moreover, m 5 C levels in this tRNA are significantly elevated under high reactive oxygen specieis (ROS) conditions in E. coli cells. We identified the known ribosomal RNA methyltransferase rsmF as the enzyme responsible for m 5 C synthesis in tRNA and enzyme transcript levels are responsive to elevated levels of ROS in the cell. We further find that changes in m 5 C levels in this tRNA are not specific to Fenton-like reaction conditions elevating ROS, but heat shock can also induce increased modification of tRNA Tyr-QUA-II. Altogether, this work illustrates how cells adapt to changing environmental conditions through variations in tRNA modification profiles.",

          "abstract": "Caste differentiation involves many functional traits that diverge during larval growth and metamorphosis to produce adults irreversibly adapted to reproductive division of labor. Investigating developmental differentiation is important for general biological understanding and has increasingly been explored for social phenotypes that diverge in parallel from similar genotypes. Here, we use Monomorium pharaonis ants to investigate the extent to which canalized worker development can be shifted toward gyne (virgin-queen) phenotypes by juvenile hormone (JH) treatment. We show that excess JH can activate gyne-biased development in workers so that wing-buds, ocelli, antennal and genital imaginal discs, flight muscles, and gyne-like fat bodies and brains emerge after pupation. However, ovary development remained unresponsive to JH treatment, indicating that JH-sensitive germline sequestration happens well before somatic differentiation. Our findings reveal important qualitative restrictions in the extent to which JH treatment can redirect larval development and that these constraints are independent of body size. Our findings corroborate that JH is a key hormone for inducing caste differentiation but show that this process can be asymmetric for higher colony-level germline versus somatic caste differentiation in superorganisms as defined a century ago by Wheeler. We quantified gene expression changes in response to JH treatment throughout development and identified a set of JH-sensitive genes responsible for the emergence of gyne-like somatic traits. Our study suggests that the gonadotropic role of JH in ovary maturation has shifted from the individual level in solitary insects to the colony level in an evolutionary-derived and highly polygynous superorganism like the pharaoh ant.",

          "abstract": "Carboxysomes are protein microcompartments found in cyanobacteria, whose shell encapsulates rubisco at the heart of carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle. Carboxysomes are thought to locally concentrate CO 2 in the shell interior to improve rubisco efficiency through selective metabolite permeability, creating a concentrated catalytic center. However, permeability coefficients have not previously been determined for these gases, or for Calvin-cycle intermediates such as bicarbonate ( HCO 3 − ), 3-phosphoglycerate, or ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Starting from a high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a synthetic β -carboxysome shell, we perform unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics to track metabolite permeability across the shell. The synthetic carboxysome shell structure, lacking the bacterial microcompartment trimer proteins and encapsulation peptides, is found to have similar permeability coefficients for multiple metabolites, and is not selectively permeable to HCO 3 − relative to CO 2 . To resolve how these comparable permeabilities can be reconciled with the clear role of the carboxysome in the CO 2 -concentrating mechanism in cyanobacteria, complementary atomic-resolution Brownian Dynamics simulations estimate the mean first passage time for CO 2 assimilation in a crowded model carboxysome. Despite a relatively high CO 2 permeability of approximately 10 −2 cm/s across the carboxysome shell, the shell proteins reflect enough CO 2 back toward rubisco that 2,650 CO 2 molecules can be fixed by rubisco for every 1 CO 2 molecule that escapes under typical conditions. The permeabilities determined from all-atom molecular simulation are key inputs into flux modeling, and the insight gained into carbon fixation can facilitate the engineering of carboxysomes and other bacterial microcompartments for multiple applications.",

Studies in vitro and in anesthetized animals suggest that nonlinearities emerge in cells’ input–output (IO; activation) functions as network activity increases, yet how neurons transform inputs in vivo has been unclear. Here, we characterize cortical principal neurons’ activation functions in awake mice using two-photon optogenetics. We deliver fixed inputs at the soma while neurons’ activity varies with sensory stimuli. We find that responses to fixed optogenetic input are nearly unchanged as neurons are excited, reflecting a linear response regime above neurons’ resting point. In contrast, responses are dramatically attenuated by suppression. This attenuation is a powerful means to filter inputs arriving to suppressed cells, privileging other inputs arriving to excited neurons. These results have two major implications. First, somatic neural activation functions in vivo accord with the activation functions used in recent machine learning systems. Second, neurons’ IO functions can filter sensory inputs—not only do sensory stimuli change neurons’ spiking outputs, but these changes also affect responses to input, attenuating responses to some inputs while leaving others unchanged.",

Each of the three most clearly resolved fingers on the African side of the MAR corresponds to a separate group of whole mantle plumes rooted in distinct patches at the core–mantle boundary, feeding hotspots, and volcanic lines with distinct isotopic signatures. Plumes of a given group appear to merge at the top of the lower mantle before separating again, suggesting interaction of deep mantle flow with a more vigorous mesoscale circulation in the upper mantle. The corresponding hotspots are generally offset from the location of the deep mantle plume roots. The distinct isotopic signatures of these hotspot groups are also detected in the mid-ocean ridge basalts at the location where the fingers meet the ridge. Meanwhile, at least some of the variability within each plume group could originate in the upper mantle and extended transition zone where plumes in a given group appear to merge and pond. This study also adds to mounting evidence that the African large low shear velocity province is not a uniform, unbroken pile of dense material rising high above the core–mantle boundary, but rather a collection of mantle plumes rooted in patches of distinct composition.",

Accordingly, the precise timing in the transcriptional activation of these genes may impact upon body length. Unlike other Hox clusters, HoxB lacks posterior genes between Hoxb9 and Hoxb13 , two genes separated by a ca. 70 kb large DNA segment containing a high number of CTCF sites, potentially isolating Hoxb13 from the rest of the cluster and thereby delaying its negative impact on trunk extension. We deleted the spacer DNA to induce a potential heterochronic gain of function of Hoxb13 at physiological concentration and observed a shortening of the tail as well as other abnormal phenotypes. These defects were all rescued by inactivating Hoxb13 in-cis with the deletion. A comparable gain of function was observed in mutant Embryonic Stem (ES) cells grown as pseudoembryos in vitro, which allowed us to examine in detail the importance of both the number and the orientation of CTCF sites in the insulating activity of the DNA spacer. A short cassette containing all the CTCF sites was sufficient to insulate Hoxb13 from the rest of HoxB , and additional modifications of this CTCF cassette showed that two CTCF sites in convergent orientations were already capable of importantly delaying Hoxb13 activation in these conditions. We discuss the relative importance of genomic distance versus number and orientation of CTCF sites in preventing Hoxb13 to be activated too early during trunk extension and hence to modulate tail length.",

          "abstract": "To maintain CO 2 fixation in the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle, multistep regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase (CF 1 F o ) is crucial to balance the ATP output of photosynthesis with protection of the apparatus. A well-studied mechanism is thiol modulation; a light/dark regulation through reversible cleavage of a disulfide in the CF 1 F o γ-subunit. The disulfide hampers ATP synthesis and hydrolysis reactions in dark-adapted CF 1 F o from land plants by increasing the required transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient ( Δ μ ∼ H + ). Here, we show in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that algal CF 1 F o is differently regulated in vivo. A specific hairpin structure in the γ-subunit redox domain disconnects activity regulation from disulfide formation in the dark. Electrochromic shift measurements suggested that the hairpin kept wild-type CF 1 F o active, whereas the enzyme was switched off in algal mutant cells expressing a plant-like hairpin structure. The hairpin segment swap resulted in an elevated Δ μ ∼ H + threshold to activate plant-like CF 1 F o , increased by ~1.4 photosystem (PS) I charge separations. The resulting dark-equilibrated Δ μ ∼ H + dropped in the mutants by ~2.7 PSI charge separation equivalents. Photobioreactor experiments showed no phenotypes in autotrophic aerated mutant cultures. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements under heterotrophic dark conditions point to an altered dark metabolism in cells with the plant-like CF 1 F o as the result of bioenergetic deviations from wild-type. Our results suggest that the lifestyle of C. reinhardtii requires a specific CF 1 F o dark regulation that partakes in metabolic coupling between the chloroplast and acetate-fueled mitochondria.",

          "abstract": "Collagens are the foundational component of diverse tissues, including skin, bone, cartilage, and basement membranes, and are the most abundant protein class in animals. The fibrillar collagens are large, complex, multidomain proteins, all containing the characteristic triple helix motif. The most prevalent collagens are heterotrimeric, meaning that cells express at least two distinctive procollagen polypeptides that must assemble into specific heterotrimer compositions. The molecular mechanisms ensuring correct heterotrimeric assemblies are poorly understood – even for the most common collagen, type-I. The longstanding paradigm is that assembly is controlled entirely by the ~30 kDa globular C-propeptide (C-Pro) domain. Still, this dominating model for procollagen assembly has left many questions unanswered. Here, we show that the C-Pro paradigm is incomplete. In addition to the critical role of the C-Pro domain in templating assembly, we find that the amino acid sequence near the C terminus of procollagen’s triple-helical domain plays an essential role in defining procollagen assembly outcomes. These sequences near the C terminus of the triple-helical domain encode conformationally stabilizing features that ensure only desirable C-Pro-mediated trimeric templates are committed to irreversible triple-helix folding. Incorrect C-Pro trimer assemblies avoid commitment to triple-helix formation thanks to destabilizing features in the amino acid sequences of their triple helix. Incorrect C-Pro assemblies are consequently able to dissociate and search for new binding partners. These findings provide a distinctive perspective on the mechanism of procollagen assembly, revealing the molecular basis by which incorrect homotrimer assemblies are avoided and setting the stage for a deeper understanding of the biogenesis of this ubiquitous protein.",

          "abstract": "Skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1) mutations are a prevalent cause of skeletal myopathies consistent with ACTA1’s high expression in skeletal muscle. Rare de novo mutations in ACTA1 associated with combined cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported, but ACTA1 represents only ~20% of the total actin pool in cardiomyocytes, making its role in cardiomyopathy controversial. Here we demonstrate how a mutation in an actin isoform expressed at low levels in cardiomyocytes can cause cardiomyopathy by focusing on a unique ACTA1 variant, R256H. We previously identified this variant in a family with dilated cardiomyopathy, who had reduced systolic function without clinical skeletal myopathy. Using a battery of multiscale biophysical tools, we show that R256H has potent effects on ACTA1 function at the molecular scale and in human cardiomyocytes. Importantly, we demonstrate that R256H acts in a dominant manner, where the incorporation of small amounts of mutant protein into thin filaments is sufficient to disrupt molecular contractility, and that this effect is dependent on the presence of troponin and tropomyosin. To understand the structural basis of this change in regulation, we resolved a structure of R256H filaments using cryoelectron microscopy, and we see alterations in actin’s structure that have the potential to disrupt interactions with tropomyosin. Finally, we show that ACTA1 R256H/+ human-induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes demonstrate reduced contractility and sarcomeric organization. Taken together, we demonstrate that R256H has multiple effects on ACTA1 function that are sufficient to cause reduced contractility and establish a likely causative relationship between ACTA1 R256H and clinical cardiomyopathy.",

          "abstract": "While hydrogen-rich materials have been demonstrated to exhibit high T c superconductivity at high pressures, there is an ongoing search for ternary, quaternary, and more chemically complex hydrides that achieve such high critical temperatures at much lower pressures. First-principles searches are impeded by the computational complexity of solving the Eliashberg equations for large, complex crystal structures. Here, we adopt a simplified approach using electronic indicators previously established to be correlated with superconductivity in hydrides. This is used to study complex hydride structures, which are predicted to exhibit promisingly high critical temperatures for superconductivity. In particular, we propose three classes of hydrides inspired by the Fm 3 ¯ m RH 3 structures that exhibit strong hydrogen network connectivity, as defined through the electron localization function. The first class [RH 11 X 3 Y] is based on a Pm 3 ¯ m structure showing moderately high T c , where the T c estimate from electronic properties is compared with direct Eliashberg calculations and found to be surprisingly accurate. The second class of structures [(RH 11 ) 2 X 6 YZ] improves on this with promisingly high density of states with dominant hydrogen character at the Fermi energy, typically enhancing T c . The third class [(R 1 H 11 )(R 2 H 11 )X 6 YZ] improves the strong hydrogen network connectivity by introducing anisotropy in the hydrogen network through a specific doping pattern. These design principles and associated model structures provide flexibility to optimize both T c and the structural stability of complex hydrides.",

Recent work has revealed clear latitudinal patterns in C:N:P, yet the relative importance of ecological, physiological, or biochemical processes in creating these patterns is unclear. We present high-resolution, concurrent measurements of particulate C:N:P, macromolecular composition, environmental conditions, and plankton community composition from a transect spanning a subtropical-subpolar boundary, the North Pacific Transition Zone. We find that the summed contribution of macromolecules to particulate C, N, and P is consistent with, and provides interpretation for, particulate C:N:P patterns. A decline in particulate C:N from the subtropical to subpolar North Pacific largely reflects an increase in the relative contribution of protein compared to carbohydrate and lipid, whereas variation in C:P and N:P correspond to shifts in protein relative to polyphosphate, DNA, and RNA. Possible causes for the corresponding trends in C:N and macromolecular composition include physiological responses and changes in community structure of phytoplankton, which represented approximately 1/3 rd of particulate C across the transect. Comparison with culture experiments and an allocation-based model of phytoplankton macromolecular composition suggest that physiological acclimation to changing nutrient supply is the most likely explanation for the latitudinal trend in C:N, offering both a mechanistic interpretation and biochemical basis for large-scale patterns in C:N:P.",

We argue that this is a consequence of the shortcomings of technologies to model these diseases, limiting our understanding of which transcripts are being oxidized, which RNA-binding proteins are interacting with these RNAs, what their implications are in RNA processing, and as a result, what their potential role is in disease onset and progression.

Thus, tumor cells seize regulatory pathways to rapidly adapt to distinct physiologic conditions to promote cellular survival, including manipulation of mRNA translation. While it is now well established that metastatic tumor cells must up-regulate their antioxidant capacity to effectively spread and that regulation of antioxidant enzymes is imperative to disease progression, relatively few studies have assessed how translation and the hijacking of RNA systems contribute to antioxidant responses of tumors. Here, we review the major stress signaling pathways involved in translational regulation and discuss how these are affected by oxidative stress to promote prosurvival changes that manipulate antioxidant enzyme expression. We describe how tumors elicit these adaptive responses and detail how stress-induced translation can be regulated by kinases, RNA-binding proteins, RNA species, and RNA modification systems. We also highlight opportunities for further studies focused on the role of mRNA translation and RNA systems in the regulation of antioxidant enzyme expression, which may be of particular importance in the context of metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance.",

In the current work, we show that the folate biosynthetic enzyme FolE2 is permissive under standard growth conditions but essential for B. thailandensis in the presence of subinhibitory doses of trimethoprim. Reasoning that FolE2 may serve as an attractive drug target, we screened for and identified ten inhibitors, including dehydrocostus lactone (DHL), parthenolide, and β-lapachone, all of which are innocuous individually but form a chemical-synthetic lethal combination with subinhibitory doses of trimethoprim. We show that DHL is a mechanism-based inhibitor of FolE2 and capture the structure of the covalently inhibited enzyme using X-ray crystallography. In vitro, the combination of subinhibitory trimethoprim and DHL is more potent than Bactrim, the current standard of care against melioidosis. Moreover, unlike Bactrim, this combination does not affect the growth of most commensal and beneficial gut bacteria tested, thereby providing a degree of specificity against B. pseudomallei . Our work provides a path for identifying antimicrobial drug targets and for utilizing binary combinations of molecules that form a toxic cocktail based on metabolic idiosyncrasies of specific pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Urban heat mitigation is a pressing concern for cities. Intense urban heat poses a threat to human health and urban sustainability. Tree planting is one of the most widely employed nature-based heat mitigation methods worldwide. Therefore, city policy makers require knowledge of how much temperature will be reduced by increasing urban tree canopy (UTC). Cooling efficiency (CE), which was been proposed to quantify the magnitude of temperature reduction associated with a 1% increase in UTC, has been primarily investigated at smaller scales previously. However, such small-scale results cannot be used to develop policy at the whole-city scale. This study developed a method that reveals the scaling relations of CE so as to predict its effects at the city scale. CE was found to follow the form of a power law as spatial scale increased from the small analytical units through intermediate size units up to the extent of a whole city. The power law form appeared consistently across cities with different climate backgrounds during summer daylight hours. Furthermore, the power law form was robust within cities under different summer weather conditions. The power-law scaling approach can thus be used to predict CE at the whole-city scale, providing a useful tool for managers to set UTC goals to mitigate extreme urban heat.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade, several novel functions of the mammalian Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APE1) have been discovered, going far beyond its canonical function as DNA repair enzyme and unveiling its potential roles in cancer development. Indeed, it was shown to be involved in DNA G-quadruplex biology and RNA metabolism, most importantly in the miRNA maturation pathway and the decay of oxidized or abasic miRNAs during oxidative stress conditions. In recent years, several noncanonical pathways of miRNA biogenesis have emerged, with a specific focus on guanosine-rich precursors that can form RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) structures. Here, we show that several miRNA precursors, dysregulated upon APE1 depletion, contain an rG4 motif and that their corresponding target genes are up-regulated after APE1 depletion. We also demonstrate, both by in vitro assays and by using different cancer cell lines, that APE1 can modulate the folding of an rG4 structure contained in pre-miR-92b, with a mechanism strictly dependent on lysine residues present in its N-terminal disordered region. Furthermore, APE1 cellular depletion alters the maturation process of miR-92b, mainly affecting the shuttling between the nucleus and cytosol. Bioinformatic analysis of APE1-regulated rG4-containing miRNAs supports the relevance of our findings in cancer biology. Specifically, these miRNAs exhibit high prognostic significance in lung, cervical, and liver tumors, as suggested by their involvement in several cancer-related pathways.",

          "abstract": "Stroke causes pronounced and widespread slowing of neural activity. Despite decades of work exploring these abnormal neural dynamics and their associated functional impairments, their causes remain largely unclear. To close this gap in understanding, we applied a neurophysiological corticothalamic circuit model to simulate magnetoencephalography (MEG) power spectra recorded from chronic stroke patients. Comparing model-estimated physiological parameters to those of controls, patients demonstrated significantly lower intrathalamic inhibition in the lesioned hemisphere, despite the absence of direct damage to the thalamus itself. We hypothesized that this disinhibition could instead be related to secondary degeneration of the thalamus, for which growing evidence exists in the literature. Further analyses confirmed that spectral slowing correlated significantly with overall secondary degeneration of the ipsilesional thalamus, encompassing decreased thalamic volume, altered tissue microstructure, and decreased blood flow. Crucially, this relationship was mediated by model-estimated thalamic disinhibition, suggesting a causal link between secondary thalamic degeneration and abnormal brain dynamics via thalamic disinhibition. Finally, thalamic degeneration was correlated significantly with poorer cognitive and language outcomes, but not lesion volume, reinforcing that thalamus damage may account for additional individual variability in poststroke disability. Overall, our findings indicate that the frequently observed poststroke slowing reflects a disruption of corticothalamic circuit dynamics due to secondary thalamic dysfunction, and highlights the thalamus as an important target for understanding and potentially treating poststroke brain dysfunction.",

However, many populations of the noctuid moth Helicoverpa zea , one of the most important crop pests in the United States, have evolved practical resistance to several Cry proteins including Cry1Ac. Although mutations in single genes that confer resistance to Cry proteins have been identified in lab-selected and gene-edited strains of H. zea and other lepidopteran pests, the genetic basis of field-evolved resistance to Cry proteins in H. zea has remained elusive. We used a genomic approach to analyze the genetic basis of field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ac in 937 H. zea derived from 17 sites in seven states of the southern United States. We found evidence for extensive gene flow among all populations studied. Field-evolved resistance was not associated with mutations in 20 single candidate genes previously implicated in resistance or susceptibility to Cry proteins in H. zea or other lepidopterans. Instead, resistance in field samples was associated with increased copy number of a cluster of nine trypsin genes. However, trypsin gene amplification occurred in a susceptible sample and not in all resistant samples, implying that this amplification does not always confer resistance and mutations in other genes also contribute to field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ac in H. zea . The mismatch between lab-generated and field-evolved resistance in H. zea is unlike other cases of Bt resistance and reflects challenges for managing this pest.",

          "abstract": "Northeast China’s Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation preserves spectacular fossils that have proved extraordinarily important in testing evolutionary hypotheses involving the origin of birds and the distribution of feathers among nonavian dinosaurs. These fossils occur either flattened with soft tissue preservation (including feathers and color) in laminated lacustrine strata or as three-dimensional (3D) skeletons in “life-like” postures in more massive deposits. The relationships of these deposits to each other, their absolute ages, and the origin of the extraordinary fossil preservation have been vigorously debated for nearly a half century, with the prevailing view being that preservation was linked to violent volcanic eruptions or lahars, similar to processes that preserved human remains at Pompeii. We present high-precision zircon U-Pb geochronology from cores and outcrops, demonstrating that Yixian Formation accumulation rates are more than an order of magnitude higher than usually estimated. Additionally, we provide zircon provenance and sedimentological data from 3D dinosaur fossils, which imply that their death and burial occurred in collapsed burrows, rather than via a catastrophic volcanogenic mechanism. In the studied area, the three principal fossil-rich intervals of the Yixian occur as a cyclic sequence that correspond to periods of high precipitation. Using Bayesian–Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches, we constrain the total duration of the sequence to less than ~93,000 y and suggest that climatic precession paced the expression of these cyclic sediments. Rather than representing multiple, Pompeii-like catastrophes, the Yixian Formation is instead a brief snapshot of normal life and death in an Early Cretaceous continental community.",

CRS increased Cx43 hemichannel activity and extracellular glutamate levels in the vHipp and blocking astroglial Cx43 hemichannel-dependent gliotransmission during CRS prevented the development of depression and glutamate buildup. Moreover, the acute blockade of Cx43 hemichannels induced antidepressant effects in rats previously subjected to CRS or CUMS. This antidepressant effect was prevented by coinjection of glutamate and D-serine. Furthermore, Cx43 hemichannel blockade decreased postsynaptic NMDAR currents in vHipp slices in a glutamate and D-serine-dependent manner. Notably, chronic microinfusion of glutamate and D-serine, L-serine, or the NMDAR agonist NMDA, into the vHipp induced depressive-like symptoms in nonstressed rats. We also identified a small molecule, cacotheline, which blocks Cx43 hemichannels and its systemic administration induced rapid antidepressant effects, preventing stress-induced increases in astroglial Cx43 hemichannel activity and extracellular glutamate in the vHipp, without sedative or locomotor side effects. In conclusion, chronic stress increases Cx43 hemichannel-dependent release of glutamate and D-/L-serine from astrocytes in the vHipp, overactivating postsynaptic NMDARs and triggering depressive-like symptoms. This study highlights the critical role of astroglial gliotransmitter release in chronic stress-induced depression and suggests it can be used as a target for the prevention and treatment of depression.",

          "abstract": "Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly in the developed world. While the introduction of therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has provided the first opportunity to significantly improve vision in patients with nvAMD, many patients respond inadequately to current anti-VEGF therapies. It was recently demonstrated that expression of a second angiogenic mediator, angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), synergizes with VEGF to promote choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in mice and correlates with reduced response to anti-VEGF therapy in patients with nvAMD. Here, we report that expression of ANGPTL4 in patients with nvAMD increases following treatment with anti-VEGF therapy and that this increase is dependent on accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α in response to inhibition of VEGF/KDR signaling in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We therefore explored HIF-1 inhibition with 32-134D, a recently developed pharmacologic HIF-inhibitor, for the treatment of nvAMD. 32-134D prevented the expression of both VEGF and ANGPTL4 and was at least as effective as aflibercept in treating CNV in mice. Moreover, by preventing the increase in HIF-1α accumulation in the RPE in response to anti-VEGF therapy, combining 32-134D with aflibercept was more effective than either drug alone for the treatment of CNV. Collectively, these results help explain why many patients with nvAMD respond inadequately to anti-VEGF therapy and suggest that the HIF inhibitor 32-134D will be an effective drug—alone or in combination with current anti-VEGF therapies—for the treatment of patients with this blinding disease.",

In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, experiments and theory increasingly attest that these networks can and do consume biochemical energy. How does this dissipation enable cellular behaviors forbidden in equilibrium? This open question demands quantitative models that transcend thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we study the control of simple, ubiquitous gene regulatory networks to explore the consequences of departing equilibrium in transcription. Employing graph theory to model a set of especially common regulatory motifs, we find that dissipation unlocks nonmonotonicity and enhanced sensitivity of gene expression with respect to a transcription factor’s concentration. These features allow a single transcription factor to act as both a repressor and activator at different concentrations or achieve outputs with multiple concentration regimes of locally enhanced sensitivity. We systematically dissect how energetically driving individual transitions within regulatory networks, or pairs of transitions, generates a wide range of more adjustable and sensitive phenotypic responses than in equilibrium. These results generalize to more complex regulatory scenarios, including combinatorial control by multiple transcription factors, which we relate and often find collapse to simple mathematical behaviors. Our findings quantify necessary conditions and detectable consequences of energy expenditure. These richer mathematical behaviors—feasibly accessed using biological energy budgets and rates—may empower cells to accomplish sophisticated regulation with simpler architectures than those required at equilibrium.",

The most common lexicalization strategies are the reuse and combination of existing words, but they have typically been studied separately in the areas of word meaning extension and word formation. Here, we offer an information-theoretic account of how both strategies are constrained by a fundamental tradeoff between competing communicative pressures: Word reuse tends to preserve the average length of word forms at the cost of less precision, while word combination tends to produce more informative words at the expense of greater word length. We test our proposal against a large dataset of reuse items and compounds that appeared in English, French, and Finnish over the past century. We find that these historically emerging items achieve higher levels of communicative efficiency than hypothetical ways of constructing the lexicon, and both literal reuse items and compounds tend to be more efficient than their nonliteral counterparts. These results suggest that reuse and combination are both consistent with a unified account of lexicalization grounded in the theory of efficient communication.",

          "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), the anion channel mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, is activated by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C). PKA-C activates CFTR both noncatalytically, through binding, and catalytically, through phosphorylation of multiple serines in CFTR’s regulatory (R) domain. Here, we identify key molecular determinants of the CFTR/PKA-C interaction essential for these processes. By comparing CFTR current activation in the presence of ATP or an ATP analog unsuitable for phosphotransfer, as well as pseudosubstrate peptides of various lengths, we identify two distinct specific regions of the PKA-C surface which interact with CFTR to cause noncatalytic and catalytic CFTR stimulation, respectively. Whereas the “substrate site” mediates CFTR phosphorylation, a distinct hydrophobic patch (the “docking site”) is responsible for noncatalytic CFTR activation, achieved by stabilizing the R domain in a “released” conformation permissive to channel gating. Furthermore, by comparing PKA-C variants with different posttranslational modification patterns, we find that direct membrane tethering of the kinase through its N-terminal myristoyl group is an unappreciated fundamental requirement for CFTR activation: PKA-C demyristoylation abolishes noncatalytic, and profoundly slows catalytic, CFTR stimulation. For the F508del CFTR mutant, present in ~90% of CF patients, maximal activation by demyristoylated PKA-C is reduced by ~10-fold compared to that by myristoylated PKA-C. Finally, in bacterial genera that contain common CF pathogens, we identify virulence factors that demyristoylate PKA-C in vitro, raising the possibility that during recurrent bacterial infections in CF patients, PKA-C demyristoylation may contribute to the exacerbation of lung disease.",

For nearly 100 y, a mysterious mud harvested from an undisclosed river site in New Jersey (USA) has been the agent of choice in the USA’s Major League Baseball for “de-glossing” new baseballs. It is unclear, however, what makes this “Rubbing Mud” work. Here, we perform a multiscale investigation of the rheology and tribology of this mud material under baseball-relevant conditions and identify three mechanisms by which the mud alters the surface properties of the baseball. First, the mud creates a more uniform baseball surface by filling in pores in the leather; this is possible because of its relatively high cohesion (clays and organics) making the material remarkably shear thinning. Second, the residue of cohesive particles coating the baseball effectively doubles contact adhesion. Third, a sparse population of angular sand grains are bonded to the baseball by clay-sized particles, leaving a studded surface that enhances friction. The proportions of cohesive, frictional, and viscous elements in Rubbing Mud conspire to create a soft material with an unusual mix of properties, that could find other applications in the development of sustainable geomaterials. Our improved understanding of the flow and friction of natural muds may also find use in modeling natural hazards such as mudslides and for locomotion in muddy environments.",

          "abstract": "RNA oxidation, predominantly through the accumulation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxo-rG), represents an important biomarker for cellular oxidative stress. Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease that has been shown to preferentially recognize 8-oxo-rG-containing RNA and protect E scherichia coli cells from oxidative stress. However, the impact of 8-oxo-rG on PNPase-mediated RNA degradation has not been studied. Here, we show that the presence of 8-oxo-rG in RNA leads to catalytic stalling of E. coli PNPase through in vitro RNA degradation experiments and electrophoretic analysis. We also link this stalling to the active site of the enzyme through resolution of single-particle cryo-EM structures for PNPase in complex with singly or doubly oxidized RNA oligonucleotides. Following identification of Arg399 as a key residue in recognition of both single and sequential 8-oxo-rG nucleotides, we perform follow-up in vitro analysis to confirm the importance of this residue in 8-oxo-rG-specific PNPase stalling. Finally, we investigate the effects of mutations to active site residues implicated in 8-oxo-rG binding through E. coli cell growth experiments under H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress. Specifically, Arg399 mutations show significant effects on cell growth under oxidative stress. Overall, we demonstrate that 8-oxo-rG-specific stalling of PNPase is relevant to bacterial survival under oxidative stress and speculate that this enzyme might associate with other cellular factors to mediate this stress.",

We assessed the effect of perceptual relevance on V1 responses using human neuroimaging, macaque electrophysiology, and computational modeling. We report that perceptually relevant borders elicit stronger responses in the early visual cortex than irrelevant ones, even if simple features, such as contrast and the energy of oriented filters, are matched. Moreover, V1 neurons discriminate perceptually relevant borders surprisingly fast, during the early feedforward-driven activity at a latency of ~50 ms, indicating that they are tuned to the features that characterize them. We also revealed a delayed, contextual effect that enhances the V1 responses that are elicited by perceptually relevant borders at a longer latency.

          "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a considerable threat to human health with a significant risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, currently, both the molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic treatment of IBD remain limited. In this report, using both systemic and intestinal epithelium-specific gene knockout mouse models, we demonstrate that FBXO22, a substrate receptor within the SKP1-Cullin 1-F-box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, plays an inhibitory role in the Azoxymethane / Dextran Sodium Sulfate–induced colorectal inflammatory responses and CRC. FBXO22 targets the serine 2448-phosphorylated form of mammalian mechanistic target of rapamycin (pS2448-mTOR) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This proteolytic targeting effect is established based on multiple lines of evidence including the results of colon tissue immunoblots, analysis of cultured cells with altered abundance of FBXO22 by depletion or overexpression, comparison of protein decay rate, effects on mTOR substrates S6K1 and 4E-BP1, analysis of protein–protein interactions, phosphor–peptide binding and competition, as well as reconstituted and cellular ubiquitination. Finally, we have shown that mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA) was able to alleviate the effects of fbxo22 deletion on colorectal inflammatory response and CRC. These RAPA effects are correlated with the ability of RAPA to inhibit pS2448-mTOR, pS6K1, and p4E-BP1. Collectively, our data support a suppressive role for FBXO22 in colorectal inflammation signaling and CRC initiation by targeting pS2448-mTOR for degradation.",

Consequently, cities are frequently perceived as participating in intercity networks to “add flowers to the brocade”—a gesture of enhancement—rather than to achieve any substantial improvement in their functional capacities.",

We report a synthetic strategy for (−)-cylindrocyclophane A that uses 10 C−H functionalization reactions, resulting in a streamlined route with high enantioselectivity and efficiency (17 steps). The use of chiral dirhodium tetracarboxylate catalysis enabled the C–H functionalization of primary and secondary positions, which was complemented by palladium-catalyzed C(sp 2 )–C(sp 2 ) cross-couplings, resulting in the rapid formation of the macrocyclic core and all stereocenters with high regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity. The use of a late-stage palladium-catalyzed fourfold C(sp 2 )–H acetoxylation installed the bis-resorcinol moieties.

One prevailing hypothesis for the origin of the MPT is that glacial deep ocean circulation fundamentally changed, marked by a circulation “crisis” at ~0.90 Ma (marine isotope stages 24 to 22) ( 3 ). Using high-resolution paired neodymium, carbon, and oxygen isotope data from the South Atlantic Ocean (Cape Basin) across the MPT, we find no evidence of a substantial change in deep ocean circulation. Before and during the early MPT (~1.30 to 1.12 Ma), the glacial deep ocean variability closely resembled that of the most recent glacial cycle. The carbon storage facilitated by developing deep ocean stratification across the MPT required only modest circulation adjustments.",

Genetic analyses linked OST-A to HSP90B1, an ER chaperone for membrane receptors, and CCDC134, an ER luminal protein. During its translocation into the ER, an N-terminal peptide in HSP90B1 templates the assembly of a translocon complex containing CCDC134 and OST-A that protects HSP90B1 during folding, preventing its hyperglycosylation and degradation. Disruption of this pathway impairs WNT and IGF1R signaling and causes the bone developmental disorder osteogenesis imperfecta. Thus, N-glycosylation can be regulated by specificity factors in the ER to control cell surface receptor signaling and tissue development.",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the mouse projects to the contralateral nucleus accumbens (NAc) through the AC, independent of its ipsilateral projections. Aversive stimuli activated contralateral BLA-NAc projections. Positive stimuli, however, activated ipsilateral projections. Selective activation of contralateral BLA-NAc projections activated D2-positive medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs), reduced NAc dopamine levels, and caused aversion, whereas selective activation of ipsilateral BLA-NAc projections activated D1-MSNs, increased NAc dopamine levels, and induced reward.

We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage.

          "abstract": "Given the negative fitness effects that pathogens impose on their hosts, the benefits of resistance should be universal. However, there is marked variation across plant species in the number of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors, which form a cornerstone of defense. The growth–defense trade-off hypothesis predicts costs associated with defense investment to generate variation in these traits. Our analysis comparing features of the intracellular immune-receptor repertoires with trait data of 187 species shows that in wild plants, the size of the molecular defense repertoire correlates negatively with growth. By contrast, we do not find evidence for a growth–defense trade-off in agricultural plants. Our cross-species approach highlights the central role of defense investment in shaping ecological trait variation and its sensitivity to domestication.",

          "abstract": "The Ca 2+ sensor, ROD1, is a master regulator of immunity in rice. By screening suppressors of rod1 mutants, we show that ROD1 governs immune homeostasis by surveilling the activation of a canonical immune pathway. Mutations in OsTIR ( TIR-only protein ), OsEDS1 ( Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 ), OsPAD4 ( Phytoalexin Deficient 4 ), and OsADR1 ( Activated Disease Resistance 1 ) all abolish enhanced disease resistance of rod1 plants. OsTIR catalyzes the production of second messengers 2′-(5′′-phosphoribosyl)-5′-adenosine monophosphate (pRib-AMP) and diphosphate (pRib-ADP), which trigger formation of an OsEDS1-OsPAD4-OsADR1 (EPA) immune complex. ROD1 interacts with OsTIR and inhibits its enzymatic activity while mutation of ROD1 leads to constitutive activation of the EPA complex. Thus, we unveil an immune network that fine-tunes immune homeostasis and multipathogen resistance in rice.",

ABOs have been known since 1924, and conventional wisdom maintains that ABOs are difficult or impossible to access. We provide a solution to this long-standing problem.

We present velocity-resolved kinetics measurements for catalytic hydrogen oxidation on palladium over a wide range of surface concentrations and at high temperatures. The rates exhibit a complex dependence on oxygen coverage and step density, which can be quantitatively explained by a density functional and transition-state theory–based kinetic model involving a cooperatively stabilized configuration of at least three oxygen atoms at steps. Here, two oxygen atoms recruit a third oxygen atom to a nearby binding site to produce an active configuration that is far more reactive than isolated oxygen atoms. Thus, hydrogen oxidation on palladium provides a clear example of how reactivity can be enhanced on a working catalyst.",

ILC2s expanded and produced IL-13 in the developing brain meninges. Loss of ILC2s or IL-13 signaling to interneurons decreased inhibitory, but not excitatory, cortical synapses. Conversely, ILC2s and IL-13 were sufficient to increase inhibitory synapses. Loss of this signaling pathway led to selective impairments in social interaction.

We show that bats can identify their location after translocation and conduct several-kilometer map-based navigation using solely echolocation.

Although fundamental for plant multicellularity, the molecular events leading to bridge stabilization, as opposed to severing, remain unknown. Using electron tomography, we mapped the transition from cell plate fenestrae to plasmodesmata. We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) connects daughter cells across fenestrae, and as the cell plate matures, fenestrae contract, causing the plasma membrane (PM) to mold around constricted ER tubes. The ER’s presence prevents fenestrae fusion, forming plasmodesmata, whereas its absence results in closure. The ER-PM protein tethers MCTP3, MCTP4, and MCTP6 further stabilize nascent plasmodesmata during fenestrae contraction. Genetic deletion in Arabidopsis reduces plasmodesmata formation.

Through genetic mapping, biochemical assays, and single-cell genomics, we identified a critical player in this process, the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2 , which oxidizes aldehyde psittacofulvins into carboxyl forms in late-differentiating keratinocytes during feather development.

PBP2a can replace the transpeptidase activity of the endogenous and essential PBP2 but not that of PBP1, which is responsible for the distinctive native septal peptidoglycan architecture.

These excitons, inherent to the reconstructed band structure, exhibit high oscillator strength. Most importantly, they inherit the linear polarization from BP, which allows light polarization to be used to select the dipole direction. Moreover, the dipole moment and resonance energy can be widely tuned by the thickness of the BP. Our results demonstrate a useful platform for exploring tunable correlated dipolar excitons.",

DCP5 harbors a plant-specific intramolecular crowding sensor (ICS) that undergoes conformational change and drives phase separation in response to osmotically intensified molecular crowding. Upon hyperosmolarity exposure, DCP5 rapidly and reversibly assembles to DCP5-enriched osmotic stress granules (DOSGs), which sequestrate plenty of mRNA and regulatory proteins, and thus adaptively reprograms both the translatome and transcriptome to facilitate plant osmotic stress adaptation. Our findings uncover a cytoplasmic osmosensing mechanism mediated by DCP5 with plant-specific molecular crowding sensitivity and suggest a stress sensory function for hyperosmotically induced stress granules.",

          "abstract": "Patterns of wins and lo sses in pairwise contests, such as occur in sports and games, consumer research and paired comparison studies, and human and animal social hierarchies, are commonly analyzed using probabilistic models that allow one to quantify the strength of competitors or predict the outcome of future contests. Here, we generalize this approach to incorporate two additional features: an element of randomness or luck that leads to upset wins, and a “depth of competition” variable that measures the complexity of a game or hierarchy. Fitting the resulting model, we estimate depth and luck in a range of games, sports, and social situations. In general, we find that social competition tends to be “deep,” meaning it has a pronounced hierarchy with many distinct levels, but also that there is often a nonzero chance of an upset victory. Competition in sports and games, by contrast, tends to be shallow, and in most cases, there is little evidence of upset wins.",

          "abstract": "Do search engine algorithms systematically expose users to content from unreliable sites? There is widespread concern that they do, but little systematic evidence that search engine algorithms, rather than user-expressed preferences, are driving current exposure to and engagement with unreliable information sources. Using two datasets totaling roughly 14 billion search engine result pages (SERPs) from Bing, the second most popular search engine in the U.S., we show that search exposes users to few unreliable information sources. The vast majority of engagement with unreliable information sources from search occurs when users are explicitly searching for information from those sites, despite those searches being an extremely small share of the overall search volume. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for user preference when examining engagement with unreliable sources from web search.",

          "abstract": "The intricate process of α-synuclein aggregation and fibrillization holds pivotal roles in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). While mouse α-synuclein can fibrillize in vitro, whether these fibrils commonly used in research to induce this process or form can reproduce structures in the human brain remains unknown. Here, we report the first atomic structure of mouse α-synuclein fibrils, which was solved in parallel by two independent teams. The structure shows striking similarity to MSA-amplified and PD-associated E46K fibrils. However, mouse α-synuclein fibrils display altered packing arrangements, reduced hydrophobicity, and heightened fragmentation sensitivity and evoke only weak immunological responses. Furthermore, mouse α-synuclein fibrils exhibit exacerbated pathological spread in neurons and humanized α-synuclein mice. These findings provide critical insights into the structural underpinnings of α-synuclein pathogenicity and emphasize a need to reassess the role of mouse α-synuclein fibrils in the development of related diagnostic probes and therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy. Current intensified therapeutic protocols coincide with severe side effects, and no salvage therapy is available for primary therapy-resistant or relapsed patients. This highlights the need to identify new therapeutic targets in T-ALL. PSIP1, dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, is a dependency factor in KMT2A -rearranged myeloid leukemia. Nonetheless, loss-of-function mutations suggest a tumor suppressor role for PSIP1 in T-ALL. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of Psip1 accelerates T-ALL initiation in mice which we correlated with reduced H3K27me3 binding. Contrastingly, loss of PSIP1 impaired cell proliferation in several T-ALL cell lines. In cell lines, PSIP1 down-regulation leads to a reduction of COX20, an assembly factor of the cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria, and to a reduction in mitochondrial respiration. This indicates that PSIP1 can exert a dual role in the context of T-ALL, either as a tumor suppressor gene during tumor initiation or as a dependency factor in tumor maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma is a common aggressive cancer and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Here, we report an important in vivo role for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number during lung adenocarcinoma progression in the mouse. We found that lung tumors induced by KRAS G12D expression have increased mtDNA levels and enhanced mitochondrial respiration. To experimentally assess a possible causative role in tumor progression, we induced lung cancer in transgenic mice with a general increase in mtDNA copy number and found that they developed a larger tumor burden, whereas mtDNA depletion in tumor cells reduced tumor growth. Immune cell populations in the lung and cytokine levels in plasma were not affected by increased mtDNA levels. Analyses of large cancer databases indicate that mtDNA copy number is also important in human lung cancer. Our study thus reports experimental evidence for a tumor-intrinsic causative role for mtDNA in lung cancer progression, which could be exploited for development of future cancer therapies.",

The resulting polarons play a central role in many materials properties including electrical transport, interaction with light, surface reactivity, and magnetoresistance, and polarons are typically investigated indirectly through these macroscopic characteristics. Here, noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) is used to directly image polarons in Fe 2 O 3 at the single quasiparticle limit. A combination of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations shows that the mobility of electron polarons can be markedly increased by Ti doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that a transition from polaronic to metastable free-carrier states can play a key role in migration of electron polarons. In contrast, hole polarons are significantly less mobile, and their hopping is hampered further by trapping centers.",

Here, inspired by organic photovoltaic structures, we demonstrate a bio-artificial photosynthetic system based on the hybridization of polymer semiconductor films and bacteria. The study suggests that the polymer-based semiconductor film can efficiently drive the non-photosynthetic bacteria to convert CO 2 to acetate. By systematically characterizing the charge transport behavior of the bio-artificial photosynthetic system, the bulk-heterojunction structure and charge transport layers are proven to enhance the system performance markedly. The scalable floating artificial bio-leaf system can produce acetate to gram scale in a week. Notably, the semiconductor film is easy to recycle and maintains stable performance, showing good sustainable production capability of the system. A quasi–solid-state artificial bio-leaf is successfully prepared using agar to simulate the morphology and function of natural leaves. Last, the acetate production converted from CO 2 was used to grow yeast for food production, thus achieving a complete simulation of natural photosynthesis.",

Here, we demonstrate that 3.3 positive charges are translocated with the negatively charged substrate in each transport step. They can be assigned to three positively charged residues of the central substrate-binding site and two asparagine/arginine pairs. In this way, the membrane potential stimulates not only the ATP 4− export step, as a net −0.7 charge is transported, but also the ADP 3− import step, as a net +0.3 charge is transported with the electric field. These positive charge movements also inhibit the import of ATP and export of ADP in the presence of a membrane potential, allowing these nucleotides to be maintained at high concentrations in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix to drive the hydrolysis and synthesis of ATP, respectively. Thus, this is the mechanism by which the membrane potential drives adenine nucleotide exchange with high directional fluxes to fuel the cellular processes.",

To address how erupted steam bursts from underwater volcanoes generate tsunamis, we present the experiments, using pressurized steam injected vertically into a water tank. Results over various eruption conditions identify three eruption regimes, namely, shallow-, intermediate-, and deep-water eruptions, according to the combined effects of water depths, source strengths, and source durations. The transition between shallow and intermediate eruptions is characterized by critical depths maximizing tsunami wave heights, while the transition between intermediate and deep eruptions is characterized by containment depths inhibiting surface disturbances. Water depth and source intensity are the dominant factors controlling maximum wave amplitudes, more so than aspects of jet duration and condensation. These experiments and supporting dimensional analysis improve our understanding of how underwater volcanic eruptions form tsunamis, while also providing a complete dataset for advancing tsunami generation models.",

Iridium-based oxide catalysts are widely studied for electrocatalytic technologies, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, but insufficient techniques for quantifying electrochemically accessible iridium active sites impede accurate assessment of intrinsic activity improvements. We develop mercury underpotential deposition and stripping as a reversible electrochemical adsorption process to robustly quantify iridium sites and consistently normalize OER performance of benchmark IrO x electrodes to a single intrinsic activity curve, where other commonly used normalization methods cannot. Through rigorous deconvolution of mercury redox and reproportionation reactions, we extract net monolayer deposition and stripping of mercury on iridium sites throughout testing using a rotating ring disk electrode. This technique is a transformative method to standardize OER performance across a wide range of iridium-based materials and quantify electrochemical iridium active sites.",

          "abstract": "Historically, meteorological drought in the western United States (WUS) has been driven primarily by precipitation deficits. However, our observational analysis shows that, since around 2000, rising surface temperature and the resulting high evaporative demand have contributed more to drought severity (62%) and coverage (66%) over the WUS than precipitation deficit. This increase in evaporative demand during droughts, mostly attributable to anthropogenic warming according to analyses of both observations and climate model simulations, is the main cause of the increased drought severity and coverage. The unprecedented 2020–2022 WUS drought exemplifies this shift in drought drivers, with high evaporative demand accounting for 61% of its severity, compared to 39% from precipitation deficit. Climate model simulations corroborate this shift and project that, under the fossil-fueled development scenario (SSP5-8.5), droughts like the 2020–2022 event will transition from a one-in-more-than-a-thousand-year event in the pre-2022 period to a 1-in-60-year event by the mid-21st century and to a 1-in-6-year event by the late-21st century.",

Here, we show that partial inhibition of non-muscle myosin II (NM II) augmented the traction force exerted by T cells and potentiated T cell cytotoxicity against tumors. By using T cells from mice and patients with cancer, we found that NM II is required for the activity of NKX3-2 in maintaining the expression of ADGRB3, which shapes the filamentous actin (F-actin) organization and ultimately attributes to the reduced traction force of T cells in the tumor microenvironment. In animal models, suppressing the NM II–NKX3-2–ADGRB3 pathway in T cells effectively suppressed tumor growth and improved the efficacy of the checkpoint-specific immunotherapy. Overall, this work provides insights into the biomechanical regulation of T cell cytotoxicity that can be exploited to optimize clinical immunotherapies.",

The incorporation of pyramid-based asymmetrical optical transmission (AOT) array to a transparent silver electrode suppresses the escaping of front sunlight without sacrificing the harvesting of albedo light. Parasitic absorption induced by the excitation of surface plasmons in an AOT electrode is further reduced by doping organic emitter in electron transport layer and capping high dielectric constant film to silver. The rear electrode achieves a front transmittance of 7% and a rear transmission of 86%. At a conventional albedo of 0.2, the synergistic effect of AOT and minimized optical loss endow the bifacial OSCs with power conversion efficiency of 20.4%.

Quantum error correction can preserve coherence through active feedback wherein quantum information is encoded into a logical state with a high degree of symmetry. Perturbations are detected by measuring the symmetries of the state and corrected by applying gates based on these measurements. To measure the symmetries without perturbing the data, ancillary quantum states are required. Shor error correction uses a separate quantum state for the measurement of each symmetry. Steane error correction maps the perturbations onto a logical ancilla qubit, which is then measured to check several symmetries simultaneously. We experimentally compare Shor and Steane correction of bit flip errors using the Bacon-Shor code implemented in a chain of 23 trapped atomic ions. We find that the Steane method produces fewer errors after a single round of error correction and less disturbance to the data qubits without error correction.",

This adaptive nature of synapses is considered one of the key features contributing to the superior energy efficiency of the brain. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate synaptic-like plasticity in a subnanoporous two-dimensional membrane. We show that a train of voltage spikes dynamically modifies the membrane’s ionic permeability in a process involving competitive bicationic transport. This process is shown to be repeatable after a given resting period. Because of a combination of subnanometer pore size and the atomic thinness of the membrane, this system exhibits energy dissipation of 0.1 to 100 aJ per voltage spike, which is several orders of magnitude lower than 0.1 to 10 fJ per spike in the human synapse. We reveal the underlying physical mechanisms at molecular detail and investigate the local energetics underlying this apparent synaptic-like behavior.",

Two families of cyclopentadienone derivatives were synthesized, featuring the inter-pyridyl main conductance channel and the inter-radical paths that are linear (FCF) or cross conjugated (PCP). Using a scanning tunneling microscope break junction technique, we find that the injection of mono- and diradicals in the PCP system unexpectedly decreases the conductance regarding the closed-shell analog, while that of FCF systems increases. Through-bond and through-space conductance mechanisms are found in the FCF and PCP series, respectively, and jointly modulate the overall charge transmission.

To study the impact of mitochondrial dynamics on metastasis, we promoted mitochondrial elongation in metastatic breast cancer cells by individual genetic deletion of three key regulators of mitochondrial fission (Drp1, Fis1, Mff) or by pharmacological intervention with leflunomide. Omics analyses revealed that mitochondrial elongation causes substantial alterations in metabolic pathways and processes related to cell adhesion. In vivo, enhanced mitochondrial elongation by loss of mitochondrial fission mediators or treatment with leflunomide notably reduced metastasis formation. Furthermore, the transcriptomic signature associated with elongated mitochondria correlated with improved clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer.

Temperature, light, and mixed layer depth show pronounced influences on global phytoplankton interdecadal variations. Climate forcing over interdecadal timescales directly affects phytoplankton biomass in the equatorial Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian Oceans, with more uncertain biomass variability in the equatorial Pacific due to multiple climate events.

Here, we explore dormancy-inducing 3D engineered matrices, which generate mechanical confinement and induce growth arrest and survival against chemotherapy in cancer cells. We characterized the dormant phenotype of solitary cells by P-ERK low :P-p38 high dormancy signaling ratio, along with Ki67 − expression. As underlying mechanism, we identified stiffness-dependent nuclear localization of the four-and-a-half LIM domain 2 (FHL2) protein, leading to p53-independent high p21 Cip1/Waf1 nuclear expression, validated in murine and human tissue. Suggestive of a resistance-causing role, cells in the dormancy-inducing matrix became sensitive against chemotherapy upon FHL2 down-regulation.

Direct generation of high-dimensional structured single photons remains challenging, being still in its infancy. Here, we propose a general strategy to design highly entangled high-dimensional spin-orbital single-photon sources by taking full advantage of the spatial freedom to design QE-coupled composite (i.e., Moiré/multipart) metasurfaces. We demonstrate the generation of arbitrary vectorial spin-orbital photon emission in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, mapping the generated states on hybrid-order Bloch spheres. We further realize single-photon sources of high-dimensional spin-orbital quantum emission and experimentally verify the entanglement of high-dimensional superposition states with high fidelity. We believe that the results obtained facilitate further progress in integrated solutions for the deployment of next-generation high-capacity quantum information technologies.",

The last stage of the process is spontaneous light emission, which usually governs and limits the scintillator emission rate and light yield. For decades, scintillator research focused on developing faster-emitting materials or external photonic coatings for improving light yields. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different approach: enhancing the scintillation rate and yield via the Purcell effect, utilizing optical environment engineering to boost spontaneous emission. This enhancement is universally applicable to any scintillating material and dopant when the material’s nanoscale geometry is engineered. We design a thin multilayer nanophotonic scintillator, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced scintillation with 50% enhancement in emission rate and 80% enhancement in light yield. The emission is robust to fabrication disorder, further highlighting its potential for x-ray applications. Our results show prospects for bridging nanophotonics and scintillator science toward reduced radiation dosage and increased resolution for high-energy particle detection.",

In vivo efficacy studies in HD transgenic mice (R6/2) confirm the superior bioactivity of PLP compared to free peptide through behavioral and neuropathological analyses.

Our study shows that blocking the JAK2/STAT3 pathway enhances immunogenic efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib (Ali)–induced senescence by reducing immunosuppressive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) while preserving immunogenic SASP. Hypothesizing that SASP reprogramming with Ali and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Rux) will benefit cancer immunotherapy, we create nanoparticulate crystals (Ali-Rux) composed of Ali and Rux with a fully active pharmaceutical ingredient. Immunization with Ali-Rux–orchestrated senescent cells promotes stronger activation of antigen-presenting cells, enhancing antitumor immune surveillance. This approach remodels the TME by increasing CD8 + T cell and NK recruitment and activation while decreasing MDSCs. Combined with PD-L1 blockade, Ali-Rux elicits a durable antitumor immune response, suggesting the TME reshaping approach as a potential cancer immunotherapy.",

We used a heterostructure comprising SrSnO 3 /La:SrSnO 3 /GdScO 3 (110), and applied electrostatic gating, which allow us to effectively separate charge carriers in SrSnO 3 from dopants and achieve phonon-limited transport behavior in strain-stabilized tetragonal SrSnO 3 . This led to a modulation of carrier density from 10 18 to 10 20 cm −3 , with room temperature mobilities ranging from 40 to 140 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . The phonon-limited mobility, calculated from first principles, closely matched experimental results, suggesting that room temperature mobility could be further increased with higher electron density. In addition, the sample exhibited 85% optical transparency at a 300-nm wavelength.

Here, using a transfer learning framework, we train a model on functional neuroimaging data from the UK Biobank to predict cognitive functioning in three transdiagnostic samples (ns = 101 to 224). We demonstrate prediction performance in all three samples comparable to that reported in larger prediction studies and a boost of up to 116% relative to classical models trained directly in the smaller samples. Critically, the model generalizes across datasets, maintaining performance when trained and tested across independent samples.

Compared with common planktonic probiotic formulations, probiotic biofilms forming on a robust GCS exhibit enhanced stress tolerance and better colonization capacity in the mouse vagina. Moreover, DNA nanodevices are decorated on the GCS and dynamically report the microenvironment change of biofilms for timely evaluating bacterium activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, GCS-LBs are used for treating AV in an Escherichia coli –infected mouse model, which shows enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared with conventional antibiotic or lactobacillus monotherapy.

Computer-based individual behavioral tracking of worker bees with biallelic stop mutations in colonies revealed that the dsx gene is required for the rate and duration of group-supporting behavior that scales the relationship between bees and their work. General sensorimotor functions remained unaffected. Unexpectedly, unlike in other insects, the dsx gene is required for the neuronal wiring of the mushroom body in which the gene is spatially restricted expressed.

Mutagenesis of the oligomerization interface abolished immune signaling, confirming the functional significance of the NbNRC2 resistosome. Comparative structural analyses between the resting state homodimer and sensor-activated homohexamer revealed substantial rearrangements, providing insights into NLR activation mechanisms. Furthermore, structural comparisons between NbNRC2 hexamer and previously reported CC-NLR pentameric assemblies revealed features allowing an additional protomer integration. Using the NbNRC2 hexamer structure, we assessed the recently released AlphaFold 3 for predicting activated CC-NLR oligomers, revealing high-confidence modeling of NbNRC2 and other CC-NLR amino-terminal α1 helices, a region proven difficult to resolve structurally.

Incident light with a specific wavelength induces linear -to- cyclic isomerization of DASAs, which generates an absorption gap at the wavelength and accordingly switches the color.

Multiple alternating jets, resembling those of Jupiter’s atmosphere, are sustained by these baroclinic eddies. We establish a theoretical model of the stratification and circulation and present scaling laws for the magnitude of the meridional heat transport. These are tested against numerical simulations.

          "abstract": "We elucidate a previously unknown synthesis pathway that leads to polymeric nanospheres, orientation-controlled microgels, or microspheroids via single-step polymerization of divinylbenzene (DVB) using initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) in liquid crystals (LC). iCVD supplies vapor-phase reactants continuously, avoiding the critical limitation of reactant-induced disruption of LC structure that has plagued past LC-templated polymerization processes. LC is leveraged as a real-time display of the polymerization conditions and particle emergence, captured using an in situ long–focal range microscope. Detailed image analysis unravels key LC-guided mechanisms during polymerization. pDVB forms nanospheres due to poor solubilization by nematic LC. The nanospheres partition to the LC-solid interface and further assemble into microgel clusters whose orientation is guided by the LC molecular alignment. On further polymerization, microgel clusters transition to microspheroids that resemble liquid drops. We identify key energetic factors that guide trajectories along the synthesis pathway, providing the fundamental basis of a framework for engineering particle synthesis with shape control.",

We demonstrate that PFAS molecules can be electrochemically sensed by interacting with a γ-CD in a nanopore. Using HP-γ-CDs with increased steric resistance, we can identify homologs of the perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid and the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid families and detect common PFAS in drinking water at 0.4 to 2 parts per million levels, which are further lowered to 400 parts per trillion by sample preconcentration. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the underlying chemical mechanism of PFAS-CD interactions.

Endosomal adaptor TAPE regulates the endosomal TLR and cytosolic RLR pathways. The potential interplay between RIG-I signaling and endosomes has been explored.

Ablation of endosomes impaired RIG-I signaling to type I IFN activation. TAPE mediates the interaction and polyubiquitination of RIG-I and TRIM25.

Catch-up saccades are accurately directed to the moving target but the motion stimulus appears to jump in space with each saccade. Our results reveal four major findings about perception and the visuomotor system: (i) Pursuit fails for certain types of motion; (ii) pursuit and catch-up saccades are independently controlled; (iii) prediction of saccade consequences is independent from saccade control; and (iv) the visual stability of moving objects relies on similar motion mechanisms as pursuit.",

But despite the large trial-to-trial variability of neural activity, humans show a remarkable adaptability to conditions with uncertainty during goal-directed behavior. The origin of this cognitive ability, constitutive of general intelligence, remains elusive. Here, we show that moderate levels of computation noise in artificial neural networks promote zero-shot generalization for decision-making under uncertainty. Unlike networks featuring noise-free computations, but like human participants tested on similar decision problems (ranging from probabilistic reasoning to reversal learning), noisy networks exhibit behavioral hallmarks of optimal inference in uncertain conditions entirely unseen during training. Computation noise enables this cognitive ability jointly through “structural” regularization of network weights during training and “functional” regularization by shaping the stochastic dynamics of network activity after training. Together, these findings indicate that human cognition may ride on neural variability to support adaptive decisions under uncertainty without extensive experience or engineered sophistication.",

We investigate these processes using Lagrangian tracer particles to track s and ds dt in direct numerical simulations, and we show that their evolution can be modeled as a stochastic differential process with time-correlated noise. The temporal correlation functions of s and ds dt decay exponentially, as predicted by the model, and the decay timescale is ≈ 1 / 6 the eddy turnover time. The behaviors of the conditional averages of ds dt and d 2 s dt 2 are also well explained by the model, which shows that the density PDF arises from a balance between stochastic compressions/expansions, which tend to broaden the PDF, and the acceleration/deceleration of shocks by density gradients, which tends to narrow it.",

Biophysical analysis of the mechanical properties of the mutant cells revealed a markedly softened cell cortex in the poorly adherent state. Unexpectedly, in the highly adherent state, associated with a hyperstretched morphology with exaggerated focal adhesions and prominent high-strain stress fibers, they exhibited even higher cortical tension compared to control. Notably, misguidance of intracellular forces, frequently accompanied by stress-fiber rupture, culminated in the formation of tension- and contractility-induced macroapertures, which was instantly followed by excessive lamellipodial protrusion at the periphery, providing critical insights into mechanotransduction of mechanically stressed and highly adherent cells.",

Here, we used an invasive in vivo mechanistic approach to interrogate muscle insulin action while selectively manipulating the mitochondrial redox state in humans. To this end, we conducted insulin clamp studies combining intravenous infusion of a lipid overload with intake of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (mitoquinone). Under lipid overload, selective modulation of mitochondrial redox state by mitoquinone enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, mitoquinone did not affect canonical insulin signaling but augmented insulin-stimulated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation while reducing the mitochondrial oxidative burden under lipid oversupply. Complementary ex vivo studies in human muscle fibers exposed to high intracellular lipid levels revealed that mitoquinone improves features of mitochondrial bioenergetics, including diminished mitochondrial H 2 O 2 emission. These findings provide translational and mechanistic evidence implicating mitochondrial oxidants in the development of lipid-induced muscle insulin resistance in humans.",

How inorganic carbon inputs ultimately generate lake CO 2 outgassing remains a blind spot. We develop and introduce a calcite module in a coupled one-dimensional physical-biogeochemical model that we use to simulate the carbon cycle of the large Lake Geneva over the past 40 years. We mechanistically demonstrate how the so-far neglected process of calcite precipitation boosts net CO 2 emissions at the annual scale.

Despite the low response rate of TNBC to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), here, we report that inhibition of Notch-driven cytokine-mediated programs reduces TAMs and induces responsiveness to sequentially delivered ICB. This is characterized by the emergence of GrB + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the primary tumor. A more impressive effect of sequential treatment is observed in the lung where TAM depletion and increased CTLs are accompanied by near-complete abolition of metastases. This is due to (i) therapeutic reduction in Notch-dependent, prometastatic circulating factors released by the primary tumor, and (ii) elevated PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in lung metastases, rendering them profoundly sensitive to ICB.

          "abstract": "The reactivity of Bi n − clusters ( n = 2 to 30) with O 2 is found to display even-odd alternations. The open-shell even-sized Bi n − clusters are more reactive than the closed-shell odd-sized clusters, except Bi 18 − , which exhibits no observable reactivity toward O 2 . We have investigated the structure and bonding of Bi 18 − to understand its remarkable resistance to oxidation. We find that the most stable structure of Bi 18 − consists of two Bi 8 cages linked by a Bi 2 dimer, where each atom is bonded to three neighboring atoms. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that each Bi uses its three 6 p electrons to form three covalent bonds with its neighbors, resulting in a Bi 18 − cluster without any dangling bonds. We find that the robust Bi 18 framework along with the totally delocalized unpaired electron is responsible for the surprising inertness of Bi 18 − toward O 2 . The Bi 18 framework is similar to that in Hittorf’s phosphorus, suggesting the possibility to create bismuth nanoclusters with interesting structures and properties.",

          "abstract": "Over 200 genetic mutations in copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Among these, two ALS-causing mutants, histidine-46→arginine (H46R) and glycine-85→arginine (G85R), exhibit a decreased capacity to bind metal ions. Here, we report two cryo–electron microscopy structures of amyloid fibrils formed by H46R and G85R. These mutations lead to the formation of amyloid fibrils with unique structures distinct from those of the native fibril. The core of these fibrils features a serpentine arrangement with seven or eight β strands, secured by a hydrophobic cavity and a salt bridge between arginine-85 and aspartic acid–101 in the G85R fibril. We demonstrate that these mutant fibrils are notably more toxic and capable of promoting the aggregation of wild-type SOD1 more effectively, causing mitochondrial impairment and activating ferroptosis in cell cultures, compared to wild-type SOD1 fibrils. Our study provides insights into the structural mechanisms by which SOD1 mutants aggregate and induce cytotoxicity in ALS.",

          "abstract": "The growth of the Internet of Things has focused attention on visualized sensors as a key technology. However, it remains challenging to achieve high sensing accuracy and self-power ability. Here, we propose a self-powered visualized tactile-acoustic sensor (SVTAS) based on an elaborated triboelectrification-induced electroluminescence (TIEL) unit. To date, it features a high brightness of 0.5 mW cm −2 (32 cd m −2 ) and a record-low detection limit of 0.5 kPa in horizontal-sliding mode. Meanwhile, the SVTAS is applicable to convert acoustic waves into TIEL signals in contact-separation mode, showing the highest response to the 44.07 Hz sound, a high signal-to-noise ratio of 8.7 dB −1 , and an ultrafast response time of 0.8 ms. Furthermore, advanced artificial visualized perception systems are constructed with excellent performance in recognizing motion trajectories and human speech with different words/sentences. This work paves the way for the highly efficient and sustainable development of new-generation self-powered visualized perception systems, contributing a solution to wireless communication free from electromagnetic interference.",

          "abstract": "Because of the depth of the hippocampal-entorhinal complex (HC-EC) in the brain, understanding of its role in spatial navigation via neuromodulation was limited in humans. Here, we aimed to better elucidate this relationship in healthy volunteers, using transcranial temporal interference electric stimulation (tTIS), a noninvasive technique allowing to selectively neuromodulate deep brain structures. We applied tTIS to the right HC-EC in either continuous or intermittent theta-burst stimulation patterns (cTBS or iTBS), compared to a control condition, during a virtual reality–based spatial navigation task and concomitant functional magnetic resonance imaging. iTBS improved spatial navigation performance, correlated with hippocampal activity modulation, and decreased grid cell–like activity in EC. Collectively, these data provide the evidence that human HC-EC activity can be directly and noninvasively modulated leading to changes of spatial navigation behavior. These findings suggest promising perspectives for patients suffering from cognitive impairment such as following traumatic brain injury or dementia.",

Nevertheless, primitive microbes could only present limited therapeutic functionalities against tumors. Hybridization of the microbes with multifunctional nanocatalysts is of great significance to achieve enhanced tumor catalytic therapy. In the present work, nitric oxide synthase (NOS)–engineered Escherichia coli strain MG1655 (NOBac) was used to hybridize with the sonopiezocatalytic BaTiO 3 nanoparticles (BTO NPs) for efficient tumor-targeted accumulation and antitumor therapy. Under ultrasound irradiation, superoxide anions created by the piezocatalytic reaction of BTO NPs could immediately react with nitric oxide (NO) generated from NOBac to produce highly oxidative peroxynitrite ONOO − species in cascade, resulting in robust tumor piezocatalytic therapeutic efficacy, prompting prominent and sustained antitumoral immunoactivation simultaneously.

          "abstract": "Geminal bromofluoroalkenes are an important subclass of versatile organic interhalide, which can serve as useful synthetic precursors to monofluoroalkenes that are valuable amide group isosteres. Nonetheless, despite the vast advancement of olefination methodologies, the broadly applicable stereoselective synthesis remained elusive for geminal bromofluoroalkenes before our work. In particular, the seemingly straightforward Wittig-type approach with interhalogenated phosphorus ylide has been unsuccessful because of the difficulty in the diastereoselective oxaphosphetane formation. Here, we describe a conceptually distinctive strategy, by which the stereoselectivity is gained via the selective decomposition of the oxaphosphetane intermediates. The suitably identified phosphorus(III) reagent and reaction medium enabled efficient kinetic differentiation, which was supported by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and density functional theory calculation. Through our method, the highly diastereoselective synthesis of geminal E -bromofluoroalkenes was accomplished in one step. Furthermore, the generality was demonstrated by accommodating a wide range of readily available carbonyl compounds, including ketones and pharmaceutical substrates.",

          "abstract": "Secondary metabolites often function as antipredator defenses, but when bioactive at low concentrations, their off-target effects on other organisms may be overlooked. Candidate “keystone molecules” are proposed to affect community structure and ecosystem functions, generally originating as defenses of primary producers; the broader effects of animal chemistry remain largely unexplored, however. Here, we characterize five previously unreported polyketides (alderenes A to E) biosynthesized by sea slugs reaching exceptional densities (up to 9000 slugs per square meter) in Northern Hemisphere estuaries. Alderenes comprise only 0.1% of slug wet weight, yet rendered live slugs or dead flesh unpalatable to three co-occurring consumers, making a potential food resource unavailable and redirecting energy flow in critical nursery habitat. Alderenes also displaced infauna from the upper sediment of the mudflat but attracted ovipositing snails. By altering communities, such compounds may have unexpected cascading effects on processes ranging from bioturbation to reproduction of species not obviously connected to the producing organisms, warranting greater attention by ecologists.",

          "abstract": "Centrosomes are membrane-less organelles that orchestrate a wide array of biological functions by acting as microtubule organizing centers. Here, we report that caspase-2–driven apoptosis is elicited in blood cells failing cytokinesis and that extra centrosomes are necessary to trigger this cell death. Activation of caspase-2 depends on the PIDDosome multi-protein complex, and priming of PIDD1 at extra centrosomes is necessary for pathway activation. Accordingly, loss of its centrosomal adapter, ANKRD26, allows for cell survival and unrestricted polyploidization in response to cytokinesis failure. Mechanistically, cell death is initiated upstream of mitochondria via caspase-2–mediated processing of the BCL2 family protein BID, driving BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Remarkably, BID-deficient cells enforce apoptosis by engaging p53-dependent proapoptotic transcriptional responses initiated by caspase-2. Consistently, BID and MDM2 act as shared caspase-2 substrates, with BID being kinetically favored. Our findings document that the centrosome limits its own unscheduled duplication by the induction of PIDDosome-driven mitochondrial apoptosis to avoid potentially pathogenic polyploidization events.",

NK cells have impaired cytotoxicity when cultured in hypoxia (1% oxygen) but not physiologic (&gt;5%) or atmospheric oxygen (20%). We found that changes to cytotoxicity were regulated at the transcriptional level and accompanied by metabolic dysregulation. Dosing with interleukin-15 (IL-15) enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity in hypoxia, but preactivation with feeder cells bearing IL-21 and 4-1BBL was even better. Preactivation resulted in less perturbed metabolism in hypoxia; greater resistance to oxidative stress; and no hypoxia-induced loss of transcription factors (T-bet and Eomes), activating receptors, adhesion molecules (CD2), and cytotoxic proteins (TRAIL and FasL). There remained a deficit in CD122/IL-2Rβ when exposed to hypoxia, which affected IL-15 signaling. However, tri-specific killer engager molecules that deliver IL-15 in the context of anti-CD16/FcγRIII were able to bypass this deficit, enhancing cytotoxicity of both fresh and preactivated NK cells in hypoxia.",

          "abstract": "Slim cameras are essential in state-of-the-art consumer electronics such as smartphones or augmented/virtual reality devices. However, reducing the camera thickness faces challenges primarily due to the thick lens systems. Current lens systems, composed of stacked refractive lenses, are fundamentally constrained from becoming thinner due to the presence of empty spaces between lenses and the excessive volume of each lens. Here, we present a lens system using metasurface folded optics to overcome these pervasive issues. In our design, metasurfaces are arranged horizontally on a glass wafer and direct light along multifolded paths inside the substrate. This approach achieves an ultra-slim lens system with a thickness of 0.7 millimeters and 2× thinner relative to the EFL, thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional optical platforms. It delivers quasi-diffraction–limited imaging quality with a 10° field of view and an f number of 4 at an operational wavelength of 852 nanometers. Our findings provide a compelling platform for compact cameras using folded nano-optics.",
