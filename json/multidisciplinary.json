          "abstract": "When humans assemble into face-to-face social networks, they create an extended social environment that permits exposure to the microbiome of others, thereby shaping the composition and diversity of the microbiome at individual and population levels1,2,3,4,5,6. Here we use comprehensive social network mapping and detailed microbiome sequencing data in 1,787 adults within 18 isolated villages in Honduras7 to investigate the relationship between network structure and gut microbiome composition. Using both species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial sharing occurs between many relationship types, notably including non-familial and non-household connections. Furthermore, strain-sharing extends to second-degree social connections, suggesting the relevance of a person’s broader network. We also observe that socially central people are more microbially similar to the overall village than socially peripheral people. Among 301 people whose microbiome was re-measured 2 years later, we observe greater convergence in strain-sharing in connected versus otherwise similar unconnected co-villagers. Clusters of species and strains occur within clusters of people in village social networks, meaning that social networks provide the social niches within which microbiome biology and phenotypic impact are manifested.",

          "abstract": "Unravelling the volcanic history of the enigmatic lunar farside is essential for understanding the hemispheric dichotomy of the Moon1-3. Cratering chronology established for the lunar nearside has been used to suggest long-lived volcanism on the farside of the Moon3,4, but without sample verification. Here we report two newly recognized episodes of basaltic volcanism with Pb-Pb dating for basalt fragments returned by the Chang’e-6 mission. One high-Al basalt fragment dated at 4,203 ± 4 million years ago (Ma) has a source 238U/204Pb ratio (µ value) of ~1,620, implying a KREEP-rich (K, rare earth elements, and P) source for this oldest-known occurrence of basaltic volcanism among returned samples. The main volcanic episode of the Chang’e-6 basalt documents a surprisingly young eruption age of 2,807 ± 3 Ma, which is not recognized from the nearside of the Moon. The initial Pb isotope compositions of these younger basalts indicate derivation from a source with a µ value of ~360, indicating a KREEP-poor mantle source. Mare volcanism on the lunar farside thus persisted for >1.4 billion years even with a shift to a source depleted in heat-producing elements. The consistency between the 2.8-billion-year basalt age and its crater-counting age indicates that the cratering chronology model established for the lunar nearside is also applicable to the farside of the Moon.",

Our data show that all women harboured rare aneuploid epithelial cells (median 3.19%) that increased with age. Many aneuploid epithelial cells (median 82.22%) in normal breast tissues underwent clonal expansions and harboured copy number alterations reminiscent of invasive breast cancers (gains of 1q; losses of 10q, 16q and 22q). Co-assay profiling showed that the aneuploid cells were mainly associated with the two luminal epithelial lineages, and spatial mapping showed that they localized in ductal and lobular structures with normal histopathology. Collectively, these data show that even healthy women have clonal expansions of rare aneuploid epithelial cells in their breast tissues.",

          "authors": "Hao Zhang, Jin-Xiang Chen, Jian-Ping Qu, Yan-Biao Kang",
          "abstract": "Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are found in many everyday consumer products, often because of their high thermal and chemical stabilities, as well as their hydrophobic and oleophobic properties1. However, the inert carbon–fluorine (C–F) bonds that give PFASs their properties also provide resistance to decomposition through defluorination, leading to long-term persistence in the environment, as well as in the human body, raising substantial safety and health concerns1,2,3,4,5. Despite recent advances in non-incineration approaches for the destruction of functionalized PFASs, processes for the recycling of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as well as polymeric PFASs such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are limited to methods that use either elevated temperatures or strong reducing reagents. Here we report the defluorination of PFASs with a highly twisted carbazole-cored super-photoreductant KQGZ. A series of PFASs could be defluorinated photocatalytically at 40–60 °C. PTFE gave amorphous carbon and fluoride salts as the major products. Oligomeric PFASs such as PFCs, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), polyfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and derivatives give carbonate, formate, oxalate and trifluoroacetate as the defluorinated products. This allows for the recycling of fluorine in PFASs as inorganic fluoride salt. The mechanistic investigation reveals the difference in reaction behaviour and product components for PTFE and oligomeric PFASs. This work opens a window for the low-temperature photoreductive defluorination of the ‘forever chemicals’ PFASs, especially for PTFE, as well as the discovery of new super-photoreductants.",

          "abstract": "The binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to genomic enhancers drives gene expression in mammalian cells1. However, the molecular details that link enhancer sequence to TF binding, promoter state and transcription levels remain unclear. Here we applied single-molecule footprinting2,3 to measure the simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes and other regulatory proteins on engineered enhancer–promoter constructs with variable numbers of TF binding sites for both a synthetic TF and an endogenous TF involved in the type I interferon response. Although TF binding events on nucleosome-free DNA are independent, activation domains recruit cofactors that destabilize nucleosomes, driving observed TF binding cooperativity. Average TF occupancy linearly determines promoter activity, and we decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the enhancer binding microstates and gene expression dynamics. This work provides a template for the quantitative dissection of distinct contributors to gene expression, including TF activation domains, concentration, binding affinity, binding site configuration and recruitment of chromatin regulators.",

Here we use a nanoscale superconducting sensor1,2 to map the magnetic fringe fields in twisted bilayers of MoTe2, in which transport3,4 and optical sensing5,6 experiments have revealed the formation of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states at zero magnetic field. We observe oscillations in the local magnetic field associated with fillings ν = −1, −2/3, −3/5, −4/7 and −5/9 of the first moiré hole band, consistent with the formation of FCIs at these fillings. We determine the local thermodynamic gaps of the most robust FCI state at ν = −2/3, finding −2/3Δ as large as 7 meV. We also characterize sample spatial disorder, which is dominated by both inhomogeneity in the effective unit cell area7 as well as inhomogeneity in the band edge offset and bound dipole moment. Our results highlight both the challenges posed by structural disorder in the study of twisted homobilayer moiré systems and the opportunities afforded by the robust nature of the underlying correlated topological states.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma is incurable and in urgent need of improved therapeutics1. Here we identify a small compound, gliocidin, that kills glioblastoma cells while sparing non-tumour replicative cells. Gliocidin activity targets a de novo purine synthesis vulnerability in glioblastoma through indirect inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2). IMPDH2 blockade reduces intracellular guanine nucleotide levels, causing nucleotide imbalance, replication stress and tumour cell death2. Gliocidin is a prodrug that is anabolized into its tumoricidal metabolite, gliocidin–adenine dinucleotide (GAD), by the enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1) of the NAD+ salvage pathway. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of GAD together with IMPDH2 demonstrates its entry, deformation and blockade of the NAD+ pocket3. In vivo, gliocidin penetrates the blood–brain barrier and extends the survival of mice with orthotopic glioblastoma. The DNA alkylating agent temozolomide induces Nmnat1 expression, causing synergistic tumour cell killing and additional survival benefit in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models. This study brings gliocidin to light as a prodrug with the potential to improve the survival of patients with glioblastoma.",

We provide a programmatic interface to browse the atlas and query new datasets, and showcase the power of the atlas to annotate organoid cell types and evaluate new organoid protocols. Finally, we show that the atlas can be used as a diverse control cohort to annotate and compare organoid models of neural disease, identifying genes and pathways that may underlie pathological mechanisms with the neural models. The human neural organoid cell atlas will be useful to assess organoid fidelity, characterize perturbed and diseased states and facilitate protocol development.",

          "abstract": "Although rare neurodevelopmental conditions have a large Mendelian component 1 , common genetic variants also contribute to risk 2,3 . However, little is known about how this polygenic risk is distributed among patients with these conditions and their parents nor its interplay with rare variants. It is also unclear whether polygenic background affects risk directly through alleles transmitted from parents to children, or whether indirect genetic effects mediated through the family environment 4 also play a role. Here we addressed these questions using genetic data from 11,573 patients with rare neurodevelopmental conditions, 9,128 of their parents and 26,869 controls. Common variants explained around 10% of variance in risk. Patients with a monogenic diagnosis had significantly less polygenic risk than those without, supporting a liability threshold model 5 . A polygenic score for neurodevelopmental conditions showed only a direct genetic effect. By contrast, polygenic scores for educational attainment and cognitive performance showed no direct genetic effect, but the non-transmitted alleles in the parents were correlated with the child’s risk, potentially due to indirect genetic effects and/or parental assortment for these traits 4 . Indeed, as expected under parental assortment, we show that common variant predisposition for neurodevelopmental conditions is correlated with the rare variant component of risk. These findings indicate that future studies should investigate the possible role and nature of indirect genetic effects on rare neurodevelopmental conditions, and consider the contribution of common and rare variants simultaneously when studying cognition-related phenotypes.",

          "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) is the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in humans. It is life-threatening and has a first peak of incidence in childhood, during primary infection. Children with HSE are not particularly prone to other infections, including HSV-1 infections of tissues other than the brain. About 8–10% of childhood cases are due to monogenic inborn errors of 19 genes, two-thirds of which are recessive, and most of which display incomplete clinical penetrance. Childhood HSE can therefore be sporadic but genetic, enabling new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this Review, we examine essential cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity in the brain that are disrupted in individuals with HSE. These mechanisms include both known (such as mutations in the TLR3 pathway) and previously unknown (such as the TMEFF1 restriction factor) antiviral pathways, which may be dependent (for example, IFNAR1) or independent (for example, through RIPK3) of type I interferons. They operate in cortical or brainstem neurons, and underlie forebrain and brainstem infections, respectively. Conversely, the most severe inborn errors of leukocytes, including a complete lack of myeloid and/or lymphoid blood cells, do not underlie HSE. Thus congenital defects in intrinsic immunity in brain-resident neurons that underlie HSE broaden natural host defences against HSV-1 from the leukocytes of the immune system to other cells in the organism.",

          "abstract": "Since Hampé’s classic developmental experiments in the mid-twentieth century1,2, the reduced avian fibula has sparked sustained curiosity3,4,5,6. The fibula transformed throughout dinosaur evolution from a columnar structure into its splint-like avian form, a change long thought to be of little biomechanical consequence3,6. Here we integrated comparative three-dimensional kinematic analyses with transitional morphologies from the fossil record to refute this assumption and show that the reduced fibula serves a crucial function in enabling extreme knee long-axis rotation (LAR). Extreme LAR is fundamental to avian locomotion and is regularly exploited by living birds to execute complex terrestrial manoeuvres7. We infer that the evolution of this capacity was preceded by restriction of the knee to hinge-like motion in early theropod dinosaurs, driven by the origin of a mid-shank articulation8 that precluded ancestral patterns of tibiofibular motion. Freeing of the fibula from the ankle joint later enabled mobilization of this initially static articulation and, in doing so, established a novel pattern of tibiofibular kinematics essential to the extreme levels of LAR retained by modern birds. Fibular reduction thus ushered in a transition to LAR-dominated three-dimensional limb control, profoundly altering the course of theropod locomotor evolution.",

Here we develop a recurrent, transformer-based neural network that learns to decode the surface code, the leading quantum error-correction code 3 . Our decoder outperforms other state-of-the-art decoders on real-world data from Google’s Sycamore quantum processor for distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes 4 . On distances up to 11, the decoder maintains its advantage on simulated data with realistic noise including cross-talk and leakage, utilizing soft readouts and leakage information. After training on approximate synthetic data, the decoder adapts to the more complex, but unknown, underlying error distribution by training on a limited budget of experimental samples. Our work illustrates the ability of machine learning to go beyond human-designed algorithms by learning from data directly, highlighting machine learning as a strong contender for decoding in quantum computers.",

Current quantum hardware is noisy, can only store information for a short time and is limited to a few quantum bits, that is, qubits, typically arranged in a planar connectivity1. However, many applications of quantum computing require more connectivity than the planar lattice offered by the hardware on more qubits than is available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU). The community hopes to tackle these limitations by connecting QPUs using classical communication, which has not yet been proven experimentally. Here we experimentally realize error-mitigated dynamic circuits and circuit cutting to create quantum states requiring periodic connectivity using up to 142 qubits spanning two QPUs with 127 qubits each connected in real time with a classical link. In a dynamic circuit, quantum gates can be classically controlled by the outcomes of mid-circuit measurements within run-time, that is, within a fraction of the coherence time of the qubits. Our real-time classical link enables us to apply a quantum gate on one QPU conditioned on the outcome of a measurement on another QPU. Furthermore, the error-mitigated control flow enhances qubit connectivity and the instruction set of the hardware thus increasing the versatility of our quantum computers. Our work demonstrates that we can use several quantum processors as one with error-mitigated dynamic circuits enabled by a real-time classical link.",

It is unclear, however, whether the predicted decorrelation and redundancy reduction in the activity of ganglion cells, the retina’s output neurons, hold under gaze shifts, which dominate the dynamics of the natural visual input 5 . We show here that species-specific gaze patterns in natural stimuli can drive correlated spiking responses both in and across distinct types of ganglion cells in marmoset as well as mouse retina. These concerted responses disrupt redundancy reduction to signal fixation periods with locally high spatial contrast. Model-based analyses of ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli show that the observed response correlations follow from nonlinear pooling of ganglion cell inputs.

          "abstract": "Malaria pathology is driven by the accumulation of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in microvessels1. This process is mediated by the polymorphic erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesion proteins of the parasite. A subset of PfEMP1 variants that bind to human endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) through their CIDRα1 domains is responsible for severe malaria pathogenesis2. A longstanding question is whether individual antibodies can recognize the large repertoire of circulating PfEMP1 variants. Here we describe two broadly reactive and inhibitory human monoclonal antibodies to CIDRα1. The antibodies isolated from two different individuals exhibited similar and consistent EPCR-binding inhibition of diverse CIDRα1 domains, representing five of the six subclasses of CIDRα1. Both antibodies inhibited EPCR binding of both recombinant full-length and native PfEMP1 proteins, as well as parasite sequestration in bioengineered 3D human brain microvessels under physiologically relevant flow conditions. Structural analyses of the two antibodies in complex with three different CIDRα1 antigen variants reveal similar binding mechanisms that depend on interactions with three highly conserved amino acid residues of the EPCR-binding site in CIDRα1. These broadly reactive antibodies are likely to represent a common mechanism of acquired immunity to severe malaria and offer novel insights for the design of a vaccine or treatment targeting severe malaria.",

          "abstract": "Cross-electrophile coupling reactions have evolved into a major strategy for rapidly assembling important organic molecules 1 . Two readily accessible electrophiles are coupled to form new C–C bonds, providing a key advantage over traditional cross-coupling strategies that require the preformation of reactive organometallic species. Yet, the formation of C( sp 3 )–C( sp 3 ) bonds that form the core of nearly all organic compounds remains highly challenging with current approaches, calling for the design of innovative new strategies. Here we report a distinct, transition-metal-free platform to form such bonds without the need for activating or stabilizing groups on the coupling partners. The reaction is enabled by an unusual single-electron transfer in a frustrated ion pair, and it can couple fragments containing functional groups that would be challenging in related transition-metal-catalysed processes. Moreover, we could further leverage this new mechanistic manifold in the design of other reactions, showing the broad potential of this type of reactivity. We anticipate that our results will provide a framework for further exploration of this reactivity pattern to tackle challenging problems in organic synthesis.",

The lack of such discoveries may be because planets have not fully formed at this age or because our view is blocked by the protoplanetary disk. However, we now know that many outer disks are warped or broken2; provided the inner disk is depleted, transiting planets may thus be visible. Here we report observations of the transiting planet IRAS 04125+2902 b orbiting a 3-million-year-old, 0.7-solar-mass, pre-main-sequence star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The host star harbours a nearly face-on (30 degrees inclination) transitional disk3 and a wide binary companion. The planet has a period of 8.83 days, a radius of 10.7 Earth radii (0.96 Jupiter radii) and a 95%-confidence upper limit on its mass of 90 Earth masses (0.3 Jupiter masses) from radial-velocity measurements, making it a possible precursor of the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes frequently found around main-sequence stars. The rotational broadening of the star and the orbit of the wide (4 arcseconds, 635 astronomical units) companion are both consistent with edge-on orientations. Thus, all components of the system are consistent with alignment except the outer disk; the origin of this misalignment is unclear.",

The intestinal epithelium requires precise regulation during continuous homeostatic and damage-induced tissue renewal to prevent neoplastic transformation, suggesting that pathways unlinking tumour growth from regenerative processes must exist. Here, by mining RNA-sequencing datasets from two intestinal damage models 4,5 and using pharmacological, transcriptomics and genetic tools, we identified liver X receptor (LXR) pathway activation as a tissue adaptation to damage that reciprocally regulates intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, intestinal organoids, and gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that LXR activation in intestinal epithelial cells induces amphiregulin ( Areg ), enhancing regenerative responses. This response is coordinated by the LXR-ligand-producing enzyme CYP27A1, which was upregulated in damaged intestinal crypt niches. Deletion of Cyp27a1 impaired intestinal regeneration, which was rescued by exogenous LXR agonists. Notably, in tumour models, Cyp27a1 deficiency led to increased tumour growth, whereas LXR activation elicited anti-tumour responses dependent on adaptive immunity. Consistently, human colorectal cancer specimens exhibited reduced levels of CYP27A1 , LXR target genes, and B and CD8 T cell gene signatures. We therefore identify an epithelial adaptation mechanism to damage, whereby LXR functions as a rheostat, promoting tissue repair while limiting tumorigenesis.",

          "abstract": "The observed temperature record, which combines sea surface temperatures with near-surface air temperatures over land, is crucial for understanding climate variability and change 1–4 . However, early records of global mean surface temperature are uncertain owing to changes in measurement technology and practice, partial documentation 5–8 , and incomplete spatial coverage 9 . Here we show that existing estimates of ocean temperatures in the early twentieth century (1900–1930) are too cold, based on independent statistical reconstructions of the global mean surface temperature from either ocean or land data. The ocean-based reconstruction is on average about 0.26 °C colder than the land-based one, despite very high agreement in all other periods. The ocean cold anomaly is unforced, and internal variability in climate models cannot explain the observed land–ocean discrepancy. Several lines of evidence based on attribution, timescale analysis, coastal grid cells and palaeoclimate data support the argument of a substantial cold bias in the observed global sea-surface-temperature record in the early twentieth century. Although estimates of global warming since the mid-nineteenth century are not affected, correcting the ocean cold bias would result in a more modest early-twentieth-century warming trend 10 , a lower estimate of decadal-scale variability inferred from the instrumental record 3 , and better agreement between simulated and observed warming than existing datasets suggest 2 .",

CO2 emissions will continue to drive warming until fully balanced by active anthropogenic CO2 removals. For practical reasons, however, many greenhouse gas accounting systems allow some “passive” CO2 uptake, such as enhanced vegetation growth due to CO2 fertilisation, to be included as removals in the definition of net anthropogenic emissions. By including passive CO2 uptake, nominal net zero emissions would not halt global warming, undermining the Paris Agreement. Here we discuss measures addressing this problem, to ensure residual fossil fuel use does not cause further global warming: land management categories should be disaggregated in emissions reporting and targets to better separate the role of passive CO2 uptake; where possible, claimed removals should be additional to passive uptake; and targets should acknowledge the need for Geological Net Zero, meaning one tonne of CO2 permanently restored to the solid Earth for every tonne still generated from fossil sources. We also argue that scientific understanding of net zero provides a basis for allocating responsibility for the protection of passive carbon sinks during and after the transition to Geological Net Zero.",

          "abstract": "The half-filled lowest Landau level is a fascinating platform for researching interacting topological phases. A celebrated example is the composite Fermi liquid, a non-Fermi liquid formed by composite fermions in strong magnetic fields1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Its zero-field counterpart is predicted in a twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2)11,12—a recently discovered fractional Chern insulator exhibiting the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect13,14,15,16. Although transport measurements at ν = −1/2 show signatures consistent with a zero-field composite Fermi liquid14, new probes are crucial to investigate the state and its elementary excitations. Here, by using the unique valley properties of tMoTe2, we report optical signatures of a zero-field composite Fermi liquid. We measured the degree of circular polarization (ρ) of trion photoluminescence versus hole doping and electric field. We found that, within the phase space showing robust ferromagnetism, ρ is near unity for Fermi liquid states. However, ρ is quenched at both integer and fractional Chern insulators, and in a hole doping range near ν = −1/2. Temperature, optical excitation power and electric-field-dependence measurements demonstrate that the quenching of ρ is a direct consequence of an energy gap (pseudogap) for electronic excitations of the Chern insulators (composite Fermi liquid): because the local spin-polarized excitations necessary to form trions are strongly suppressed, trion formation at the corresponding filling factors relies on optically generated unpolarized itinerant holes. Our work highlights a new excitonic probe of zero-field fractional Chern insulator physics, unique to tMoTe2.",

Using combined modelling of transcriptional and epigenetic data, we characterized regionally distinct limb and cranial osteoprogenitor trajectories across the embryonic skeleton and further described regulatory networks that govern intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Spatial localization of cell clusters in our in situ sequencing data using a new tool, ISS-Patcher, revealed mechanisms of progenitor zonation during bone and joint formation. Through trajectory analysis, we predicted potential non-canonical cellular origins for human chondrocytes from Schwann cells. We also introduce SNP2Cell, a tool to link cell-type-specific regulatory networks to polygenic traits such as osteoarthritis. Using osteolineage trajectories characterized here, we simulated in silico perturbations of genes that cause monogenic craniosynostosis and implicate potential cell states and disease mechanisms.

However, the mechanism by which cellular valine abundancy is sensed for subsequent cellular functions remains undefined. Here we identify that human histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) serves as a valine sensor by directly binding valine through a primate-specific SE14 repeat domain. The nucleus and cytoplasm shuttling of human, but not mouse, HDAC6 is tightly controlled by the intracellular levels of valine. Valine deprivation leads to HDAC6 retention in the nucleus and induces DNA damage. Mechanistically, nuclear-localized HDAC6 binds and deacetylates ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) to initiate active DNA demethylation, which promotes DNA damage through thymine DNA glycosylase-driven excision. Dietary valine restriction inhibits tumour growth in xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models, and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PARP inhibitors. Collectively, our study identifies human HDAC6 as a valine sensor that mediates active DNA demethylation and DNA damage in response to valine deprivation, and highlights the potential of dietary valine restriction for cancer treatment.",

The neuronal circuits that detect and relay visual features have been well studied 1–8 . Much less is known about how an animal adjusts its visual attention as its goals or environmental conditions change. During social behaviours, flies need to focus on nearby flies 9–11 . Here we study how the flow of visual information is altered when female Drosophila enter an aggressive state. From the connectome, we identify three state-dependent circuit motifs poised to modify the response of an aggressive female to fly-sized visual objects: convergence of excitatory inputs from neurons conveying select visual features and internal state; dendritic disinhibition of select visual feature detectors; and a switch that toggles between two visual feature detectors. Using cell-type-specific genetic tools, together with behavioural and neurophysiological analyses, we show that each of these circuit motifs is used during female aggression. We reveal that features of this same switch operate in male Drosophila during courtship pursuit, suggesting that disparate social behaviours may share circuit mechanisms. Our study provides a compelling example of using the connectome to infer circuit mechanisms that underlie dynamic processing of sensory signals.",

          "abstract": "The fractional quantum Hall effect is a key example of topological quantum many-body phenomena, arising from the interplay between strong electron correlation, topological order and time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, a lattice analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect at zero magnetic field has been observed, confirming the existence of a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI). Despite this, the bulk–edge correspondence—a hallmark of a FCI featuring an insulating bulk with conductive edges—has not been directly observed. In fact, this correspondence has not been visualized in any system for fractional states owing to experimental challenges. Here we report the imaging of FCI edge states in twisted MoTe2 (t-MoTe2) using microwave impedance microscopy1. By tuning the carrier density, we observe the system evolving between metallic and FCI states, the latter of which exhibits insulating bulk and conductive edges, as expected from the bulk–boundary correspondence. Further analysis suggests the composite nature of the FCI edge states. We also observe the evolution of edge states across the topological phase transition as a function of interlayer electric field and reveal exciting prospects of neighbouring domains with different fractional orders. These findings pave the way for research into topologically protected one-dimensional interfaces between various anyonic states at zero magnetic field, such as gapped one-dimensional symmetry-protected phases with non-zero topological entanglement entropy, Halperin–Laughlin interfaces and the creation of non-abelian anyons.",

          "abstract": "Reducing body weight to improve metabolic health and related comorbidities is a primary goal in treating obesity 1,2 . However, maintaining weight loss is a considerable challenge, especially as the body seems to retain an obesogenic memory that defends against body weight changes 3,4 . Overcoming this barrier for long-term treatment success is difficult because the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Here, by using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we show that both human and mouse adipose tissues retain cellular transcriptional changes after appreciable weight loss. Furthermore, we find persistent obesity-induced alterations in the epigenome of mouse adipocytes that negatively affect their function and response to metabolic stimuli. Mice carrying this obesogenic memory show accelerated rebound weight gain, and the epigenetic memory can explain future transcriptional deregulation in adipocytes in response to further high-fat diet feeding. In summary, our findings indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory, largely on the basis of stable epigenetic changes, in mouse adipocytes and probably other cell types. These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic ‘yo-yo’ effect often seen with dieting. Targeting these changes in the future could improve long-term weight management and health outcomes.",

Unfortunately, the factors that underlie these limitations remain unclear and, therefore, no clear device-engineering guidelines are available. Here, by using electrically excited transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that the low efficiency of state-of-the-art green cadmium-free QD-LEDs (which ubiquitously adopt the InP–ZnSeS–ZnS core–shell–shell structure) originates from the ZnSeS interlayer because it imposes a high injection barrier that limits the electron concentration and trap saturation. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that replacing the currently widely used ZnSeS interlayer with a thickened ZnSe interlayer enables improved electron injection and depressed leakage simultaneously, allowing to achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.68% and T95 lifetime (time for the luminance to drop to 95% of the initial value) of 1,241 h at an initial brightness of 1,000 cd m–2 in green InP-based QD-LEDs emitting at 543 nm—exceeding the previous best values by a factor of 1.6 and 165, respectively3,4.",

          "abstract": "The intestine is characterized by an environment in which host requirements for nutrient and water absorption are consequently paired with the requirements to establish tolerance to the outside environment. To better understand how the intestine functions in health and disease, large efforts have been made to characterize the identity and composition of cells from different intestinal regions1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, the robustness, nature of adaptability and extent of resilience of the transcriptional landscape and cellular underpinning of the intestine in space are still poorly understood. Here we generated an integrated resource of the spatial and cellular landscape of the murine intestine in the steady and perturbed states. Leveraging these data, we demonstrated that the spatial landscape of the intestine was robust to the influence of the microbiota and was adaptable in a spatially restricted manner. Deploying a model of spatiotemporal acute inflammation, we demonstrated that both robust and adaptable features of the landscape were resilient. Moreover, highlighting the physiological relevance and value of our dataset, we identified a region of the middle colon characterized by an immune-driven multicellular spatial adaptation of structural cells to the microbiota. Our results demonstrate that intestinal regionalization is characterized by robust and resilient structural cell states and that the intestine can adapt to environmental stress in a spatially controlled manner through the crosstalk between immunity and structural cell homeostasis.",

However, the activation of carbon-fluorine bonds, the most commercially abundant organohalide and found in PFAS, or “forever chemicals”, are much rarer. Current approaches based on photoredox chemistry for activation of small molecule carbon-fluorine (C–F) bonds are limited by the substrates and transition-metal catalysts needed4. A general method for the direct activation of organofluorines would have significant value in organic and environmental chemistry. Here, we report an organic photoredox catalyst system that can efficiently reduce C–F bonds to generate carbon-centered radicals, which can then be intercepted for hydrodefluorination (swapping F for H) and cross-coupling reactions. This system enables the general use of organofluorines as synthons under mild reaction conditions. We extend this method to the defluorination of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and fluorinated polymers, a critical challenge in the breakdown of persistent and environmentally damaging forever chemicals.",

GROWdb profiles the identity, distribution, function and expression of microbial genomes across river surface waters covering 90% of United States watersheds. Specifically, GROWdb encompasses microbial lineages from 27 phyla, including novel members from 10 families and 128 genera, and defines the core river microbiome at the genome level. GROWdb analyses coupled to extensive geospatial information reveals local and regional drivers of microbial community structuring, while also presenting foundational hypotheses about ecosystem function. Building on the previously conceived River Continuum Concept1, we layer on microbial functional trait expression, which suggests that the structure and function of river microbiomes is predictable. We make GROWdb available through various collaborative cyberinfrastructures2,3, so that it can be widely accessed across disciplines for watershed predictive modelling and microbiome-based management practices.",

These require a common measure of cell similarity across the body and an efficient way to search. Here, we develop SCimilarity, a metric learning framework to learn a unified and interpretable representation that enables rapid queries of tens of millions of cell profiles from diverse studies for cells that are transcriptionally similar to an input cell profile or state. We use SCimilarity to query a 23.4 million cell atlas of 412 scRNA-seq studies for macrophage and fibroblast profiles from interstitial lung disease1 and reveal similar cell profiles across other fibrotic diseases and tissues. The top scoring in vitro hit for the macrophage query was a 3D hydrogel system2, which we experimentally demonstrated reproduces this cell state.

          "abstract": "C 4 photosynthesis is used by the most productive plants on the planet, and compared with the ancestral C 3 pathway, it confers a 50% increase in efficiency 1 . In more than 60 C 4 lineages, CO 2 fixation is compartmentalized between tissues, and bundle-sheath cells become photosynthetically activated 2 . How the bundle sheath acquires this alternate identity that allows efficient photosynthesis is unclear. Here we show that changes to bundle-sheath gene expression in C 4 leaves are associated with the gain of a pre-existing cis -code found in the C 3 leaf. From single-nucleus gene-expression and chromatin-accessibility atlases, we uncover DNA binding with one finger (DOF) motifs that define bundle-sheath identity in the major crops C 3 rice and C 4 sorghum. Photosynthesis genes that are rewired to be strongly expressed in the bundle-sheath cells of C 4 sorghum acquire cis -elements that are recognized by DOFs. Our findings are consistent with a simple model in which C 4 photosynthesis is based on the recruitment of an ancestral cis -code associated with bundle-sheath identity. Gain of such elements harnessed a stable patterning of transcription factors between cell types that are found in both C 3 and C 4 leaves to activate photosynthesis in the bundle sheath. Our findings provide molecular insights into the evolution of the complex C 4 pathway, and might also guide the rational engineering of C 4 photosynthesis in C 3 crops to improve crop productivity and resilience 3,4 .",

We anchor 12 gastrointestinal disease datasets spanning gastrointestinal cancers, coeliac disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease to this reference. Utilizing this 1.6 million cell resource (gutcellatlas.org), we discover epithelial cell metaplasia originating from stem cells in intestinal inflammatory diseases with transcriptional similarity to cells found in pyloric and Brunner’s glands. Although previously linked to mucosal healing 4 , we now implicate pyloric gland metaplastic cells in inflammation through recruitment of immune cells including T cells and neutrophils.

Recently, chemical catalytic radical sorting has emerged as an enabling strategy for a variety of useful reactions7,8. However, making such processes enantioselective is highly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in the stereochemical control of radicals9. Here, we repurpose a thiamine-dependent enzyme10,11 through directed evolution, combine it with photoredox catalysis, to achieve a photobiocatalytic enantioselective three-component radical cross-coupling. This approach combines three readily available starting materials — aldehydes, α-bromo-carbonyls and alkenes — to give access to enantioenriched ketone products. Mechanistic investigations provide insights into how this dual photo-/enzyme system precisely directs the three distinct radicals involved in the transformation, unlocking new enzyme reactivity. Our approach has achieved exceptional stereoselectivity, with 25 out of 33 examples achieving ≥97% enantiomeric excess.",

          "abstract": "One of the most aggressive brain tumours in adults is glioblastoma. Survival rates are poor despite advances made in treatment. Current therapies, including surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy with the drug temozolomide are unable to improve survival times owing to the invasive nature of glioblastoma, the genetic diversity of these tumours and problems arising from treatment resistance1. Furthermore, the blood−brain barrier complicates drug delivery, acting as an obstacle that restricts access for therapeutic agents that target glioblastoma tumours2. Writing in Nature, Chen et al.3 report the identification of a small molecule called gliocidin, which has promising therapeutic potential against glioblastoma through its innovative targeting of tumour metabolism.",

Indeed, it has a central role in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which aims to limit the increase in this temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. Accurate estimates of how the global temperature has changed over time are therefore crucial for tracking efforts to mitigate the threat of climate change. Writing in Nature, Sippel et al.1 provide evidence that existing estimates for between 1900 and 1930 are too low, owing to an unresolved systematic error in ocean surface temperatures. Correcting the record would improve researchers’ understanding of long-term temperature change and its causes.",

Humans, like nearly all living things, are fuelled by the products of photosynthesis. However, the central enzyme of the process can engage in non-productive reactions in hot and dry climates, which poses a problem for crop growing as global temperatures increase. Writing in Nature, Swift et al.1 create comprehensive maps of where photosynthesis genes are turned on and off in the leaves of rice (Oryza sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), a plant that bypasses the problem of inefficiency by using an alternative mode of photosynthesis. Differences in these maps enabled the authors to decipher codes that might pave the way for engineering this alternative, and efficient, version of photosynthesis in rice.",

          "abstract": "Public trust in scientists is critical to our ability to face societal threats. Here, across five pre-registered studies (N = 2,034), we assessed whether perceptions of scientists’ intellectual humility affect perceived trustworthiness of scientists and their research. In study 1, we found that seeing scientists as higher in intellectual humility was associated with greater perceived trustworthiness of scientists and support for science-based beliefs. We then demonstrated that describing a scientist as high (versus low) in intellectual humility increased perceived trustworthiness of the scientist (studies 2–4), belief in their research (studies 2–4), intentions to follow their research-based recommendations (study 3) and information-seeking behaviour (study 4). We further demonstrated that these effects were not moderated by the scientist’s gender (study 3) or race/ethnicity (study 4). In study 5, we experimentally tested communication approaches that scientists can use to convey intellectual humility. These studies reveal the benefits of seeing scientists as intellectually humble across medical, psychological and climate science topics.",

In western Nepal, the tradition of chhaupadi prohibits menstruating individuals from cooking and they must spend the time outside the home2. Seclusion may also be evident in ancient societies. In the UK, taboos surrounding menstruation have led to period poverty. Although negative menstrual taboos are nearly universal, there are exceptions. Ojibwe women (Minnesota) traditionally secluded themselves for the duration of their period, which was seen as a healthy time of rest, regeneration and a way to celebrate womanhood.\n\nFew studies have been able to detect evidence of menstrual seclusion archaeologically. Evidence can be detected when it is deemed important enough to consider. An example of archaeological evidence of menstruation and seclusion is at the Newt Kash shelter (eastern Kentucky). Claassen3 determined that the activities conducted within the shelter (the production of string and cord) were ‘women’s activities’ carried out during menstruation. Equally, menstrual huts are often used for childbirth and the pacifiers, cradleboards and a child’s mobile could be evidence of children and women using this space at times of ‘impurity’3.",

          "abstract": "Young adults from low socioeconomic backgrounds face an increased risk of early mortality. Here we utilize population-wide data from 17 Norwegian birth cohorts (N = 986,573) to assess whether this risk gradient was explained by early-life educational performance, specifically grade point average at 16 years of age. We show that the gradients in both parental education and income largely disappeared when adjusting for school performance in the models. Specifically, among boys, those with the lowest parental education had an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.86–2.22) compared with peers with the highest parental education, while for girls, the HR was 1.64 (95% CI 1.35–1.93). After adjusting for school performance, these estimates dropped to 0.99 (95% CI 0.79–1.19) for boys and 0.87 (95% CI 0.55–1.19) for girls. Similarly, the mortality risk for those from the lowest parental income quartile decreased from 1.79 (95% CI 1.67–1.91) to 1.25 (95% CI 1.12–1.38) for boys and from 1.63 (95% CI 1.44–1.83) to 1.24 (95% CI 1.03–1.46) for girls. Low educational performance remained strongly associated with early mortality in analyses accounting for unobserved heterogeneity at the family level; boys with a grade point average in the lowest quartile had an HR of 3.04 (95% CI 2.38–3.89), while for girls, the HR was 1.79 (95% CI 1.22–2.63). External causes of death, particularly accidents and poisoning, were most overrepresented among individuals with poor school performance.",

Many individuals share such links without first reading the linked information. Here we analysed over 35 million public Facebook posts with uniform resource locators shared between 2017 and 2020, and discovered that such ‘shares without clicks’ (SwoCs) constitute around 75% of forwarded links. Extreme and user-aligned political content received more SwoCs, with partisans engaging in it more than politically neutral users. In addition, analyses with 2,969 false uniform resource locators revealed higher shares and, hence, SwoCs by conservatives (76.94%) than liberals (14.25%), probably because, in our dataset, the vast majority (76–82%) of them originated from conservative news domains. Findings suggest that the virality of political content on social media (including misinformation) is driven by superficial processing of headlines and blurbs rather than systematic processing of core content, which has design implications for promoting deliberate discourse in the online public sphere.",

Subsequently, the problem of period poverty or poor menstrual hygiene management is represented as ‘(unmanaged) periods make girls or women miss school or work’3. This, unfortunately, frames periods and female bodies as the problem rather than the government policies and societal gender inequalities that directly contribute to increasing poverty especially among women and girls4; or the fact that most schools (and workplaces) are not fit for people who menstruate5; or the huge profit margins involved in the sale of expensive disposable period products (and other products subject to ‘pink tax’)3.",

For others, including those who have prioritized professional ambitions or suffered medical setbacks, the years of peak fertility are far too short. And with menopause comes a new menu of irksome side effects and serious health concerns, which include a sharp increase in the risks of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. For these reasons, biomedicine views menopause not only as a public health priority but also often as a medical condition.\n\nThe medicalization of menopause, similar to that of ageing or pregnancy, serves a practical purpose in directing research efforts towards improving health and quality of life for women. At its most literal, this perspective has stimulated new interest in clinical interventions to delay menopause1. However, the development of sound clinical approaches can be improved by understanding menopause within its context as a natural phenomenon that is shaped by evolutionary processes. Evolutionary thinking about menopause often involves hypotheses about the past that are only of tangential interest in medicine, but evolutionary perspectives also have a lot to offer for understanding the interactions of reproduction, health and our complex environments.",

          "abstract": "The history of people’s movements and interactions shapes both genetic and linguistic variation. Genes and languages are transmitted separately and their distributions reflect different aspects of human history, but some demographic processes can cause them to be similarly distributed. In particular, forms of societal organization, including movements in and out of a community, may have shaped the transmission of both genes and languages. If children were more likely to learn their mother’s language than their father’s when their parents were from populations that spoke different languages or dialects, then language variation might show a closer association with maternally transmitted genetic markers than autosomal ones; this association could be further reinforced if children reside with predominantly maternal kin. We analyze the worldwide relationship between linguistic and genomic variation, leveraging the sex-biased transmission of X chromosomes to assess whether language has tended to be preferentially transmitted along the male or female line. In addition, we measure the effects of postmarital residence with female kin, matrilineal descent, and endogamy on the covariation of mitochondrial DNA and languages, using mtDNA because genomic data were available for very few populations with these ethnographic traits. We find that while there is little evidence for a consistent or widespread sex bias in the transmission of language, such biased transmission may have occurred locally in several parts of the world and might have been influenced by population-level ethnographic characteristics, such as female-based descent or residence patterns. Our results highlight the complex relationships between genes, language, ethnography, and geography.",

Here, we review the main experimental designs used in the field of cultural evolution, as well as major findings related to the generation of cultural variation, content- and model-based biases, cumulative cultural evolution, and nonhuman culture. We then identify methodological advances that demonstrate the iterative improvement of cultural evolution experimental methods. Finally, we focus on one common critique of cultural evolution experiments, the appropriate individual learning control condition needed to demonstrate cumulative culture, and present an original experimental investigation relevant to this critique. Participants completed a combinatorial innovation task allowing for cumulative improvement over time in one of four commonly used experimental designs/conditions: social learners in chains, social learners in groups, individual learners experiencing an extended session lasting the same accumulated time as an entire chain or group, and individual learners experiencing repeated sessions adding up to the same total time. We found that repeated individual learning resulted in superior performance to any other condition. We discuss these findings in light of the relevance of the specific criticism of previous experimental studies that purport to have demonstrated cumulative culture. We also use our findings to discuss the broad trade-offs that participants face when learning individually and socially in different contexts, including variable acquisition costs, redundancy of effort in groups, and cognitive and motivational fatigue.",

As property insurance markets in the United States face higher levels of turmoil, policymakers are weighing various interventions to stabilize not only insurance but also housing and mortgage markets. We identify policy lessons based on the investigation of three bounding scenarios designed to address the question of how near-term (1 to 3 y) policy and regulatory choices surrounding insurance markets in Florida could influence medium-term (3 to 15 y) risk levels, disaster recovery, housing markets, and local economic outcomes. Since our policy choices today have a profound impact on future outcomes, careful consideration of the longer-term impacts of today’s policy choices is required to secure more effective and equitable adaptation decisions and pathways.",

These studies incorporated cultural transmission and its interaction with genetics in contributing to patterns of human variation. Neither CE nor GCC results were consistent with racist claims of ubiquitous genetic differences between socially defined races. We summarize how genetic data refute the notion of racial substructure for human populations and address naive interpretations of race across the biological sciences, including those related to ancestry, health, and intelligence, that help to perpetuate racist ideas.

          "abstract": "Cultural evolution applies evolutionary concepts and tools to explain the change of culture over time. Despite advances in both theoretical and empirical methods, the connections between cultural evolutionary theory and evidence are often vague, limiting progress. Theoretical models influence empirical research but rarely guide data collection and analysis in logical and transparent ways. Theoretical models themselves are often too abstract to apply to specific empirical contexts and guide statistical inference. To help bridge this gap, we outline a quality-assurance computational workflow that starts from generative models of empirical phenomena and logically connects statistical estimates to both theory and real-world explanatory goals. We emphasize and demonstrate validation of the workflow using synthetic data. Using the interplay between conformity, migration, and cultural diversity as a case study, we present coded and repeatable examples of directed acyclic graphs, tailored agent-based simulations, a probabilistic transmission model for longitudinal data, and an approximate Bayesian computation model for cross-sectional data. We discuss the assumptions, opportunities, and pitfalls of different approaches to generative modeling and show how each can be used to improve data analysis depending on the structure of available data and the depth of theoretical understanding. Throughout, we highlight the significance of ethnography and of collecting basic cultural and demographic information about study populations and call for more emphasis on logical and theory-driven workflows as part of science reform.",

          "abstract": "We examine from whom children learn in mobile hunter-gatherers, a way of life that characterized much of human history. Recent studies on the modes of transmission in hunter-gatherers are reviewed before presenting an analysis of five modes of transmission described by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman [L. L. Cavalli-Sforza, M. W. Feldman, Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach (1981)] but not previously evaluated in hunter-gatherer research. We also present two modes of group transmission, conformist transmission, and concerted transmission, seldom mentioned in hunter-gatherer social learning research, and propose a unique mode of group transmission called cumulative transmission. The analysis of the additional modes of transmission indicated that cultural evolutionary signatures of vertical transmission, such as the conservation of cultural traits, have been underestimated because previous studies have seldom considered remote generations or distinguished intrafamilial from extrafamilial horizontal and oblique transmission. However, field data also indicate that hunter-gatherer children interacted with and learned from many nongenetically related individuals; about half of children’s and adolescents’ horizontal and oblique social learning came from nongenetically related individuals. Intimate living conditions of hunter-gatherers provide opportunities for group transmission, and ethnographic evidence presented demonstrates that at least three types of group transmission exist. All three forms of group transmission theoretically contribute to the conservation of culture, homogeneity of intracultural diversity, and high intercultural diversity. Analysis of additional modes of oblique and horizontal transmission and discussion of previous and unique modes of group transmission demonstrate the various mechanisms by which hunter-gatherer children learn and how cultures are conserved and contribute to cumulative culture.",

          "abstract": "Modern cultural evolution theory adopts a variety of concepts and methods developed in mathematical biology, in particular population genetics theory. In addition to forward-looking approaches such as two-locus models, backward-looking approaches such as coalescent theory, which describe ancestral states of the current population, have played an important role in population genetics. Here, we show how forward and backward approaches can be applied to two examples in cultural evolution. The first example deals with the number of cultural traits, which can be analyzed by a backward approach. Cultural coalescent theory illustrates many unique aspects of cultural processes such as information transfer (i.e., social learning) from many donors (“cultural parents”), including or excluding the biological parents. Theory predicts that many cultural traits of intermediate (or higher) frequency (popularity) can exist that are surprisingly old. Many unsolved issues remain, however, such as how to incorporate social structure as well as natural and/or cultural selection, which we believe to be an urgent agenda. The second example is the punishment of sibling incest, a problem to which cultural coalescent theory cannot currently be usefully applied. By analyzing forward recursions, we show that punishment is ineffective in suppressing incest, unless the incestuous inclination is diminished by the presence of punishers. Based on these examples, we discuss the merits and demerits of forward and backward approaches.",

Here, we examine such cultural hitchhiking processes using an individual-based model that portrays the cultural interaction between a migrant and an incumbent population. Our model is loosely based on the interaction between farming and foraging populations during the initial stages of the adoption and diffusion of agricultural practices. The two populations are characterized by different variants for their neutral and adaptive cultural traits, with the latter set providing a reproductive advantage for the migrant communities over the incumbent ones. We explore how the neutral traits of the migrant population spread and how this process is conditioned by the following factors: 1) the possibility of transmission of the adaptive traits; 2) the extent of the increased reproductive advantage provided by the adaptive variants of the migrant population; 3) postmarital residence rules; and 4) how and when neutral traits are transmitted. Our results reveal a diverse range of outputs, highlighting the relevance of factors such as the nature of postmarital resocialization and the specific combination of postmarital residence rules and sex-biased transmission.",

          "abstract": "Cultural practices perceived to be adaptive—from clearing land for food production to medical innovations—can disseminate quickly through human populations. However, these same practices often have unintended maladaptive effects. A particularly consequential effect is the emergence of diseases. In numerous instances, a cultural change is followed by the appearance of a new pathogen. Here, we develop mathematical models to analyze the population processes through which cultural evolution precipitates the emergence of a new disease. We find that when a risk-bearing cultural practice spreads, emergence can be an unavoidable cost even if a safer alternative practice eventually evolves from the original. Social learning and a fitness advantage associated with the evolving practice drive early disease emergence but the two factors have distinct effects on the time to mutation of the pathogen and significant stochastic variation is observed. For example, a disease can take longer to emerge in a population that adopts the risk-bearing practice quickly than in a population that is slow to transition. Extending the model to explore the effects of an alternative practice evolving from the original, we find a nonmonotonic relationship between relative risk of the two practices and the median time to disease emergence. Our findings contribute to understanding how cultural evolution can shape pathogen evolution and highlight the unpredictability of disease emergence.",

We test its validity and applicability by using daily data on state-level COVID-19 responses in the United States. Social distancing via shelter-in-place (SIP) strategies and wearing masks emerged as the most effective nonpharmaceutical ways of combatting COVID-19. In the United States, choices about these policies are made by individual states. We develop a game-theoretic model of such choices and test it econometrically, confirming strong interdependence in the implementation of these policies. If enough states engage in social distancing or mask wearing, others will be tipped to follow suit. Policy choices are influenced mainly by the choices of other states, especially those of similar political orientation and to a lesser degree by the number of new COVID-19 cases. The choice of mask-wearing policies is more sensitive to peer choices than the choice of SIP policies, and Republican states are much less likely than Democratic to introduce mask-wearing policies. The choices of policies are influenced more by political than public health considerations. These findings emphasize strategic interdependence in policy choice and offer an analytical framework for these complex dynamics.",

          "abstract": "How do people search for information when they are given the opportunity to freely explore their options? Previous research has suggested that people focus on reducing uncertainty before making a decision, but it remains unclear how exactly they do so and whether they do so consistently. We present an analysis of over 1,000,000 information-search decisions made by over 2,500 individuals in a decisions-from-experience setting that cleanly separates information search from choice. Using a data-driven approach supported by a formal measurement framework, we examine how people allocate samples to options and how they decide to terminate search. Three major insights emerge. First, predecisional information search has at least three drivers that can be interpreted as reducing three types of uncertainty: structural, estimation, and computational. Second, the selection of these drivers of information search is adaptive, sequential, and guided by environmental knowledge that integrates prior expectations, task instructions, and personal experiences. Third, predecisional information search exhibits substantial interindividual heterogeneity, with individuals recruiting different drivers of information search. Together, these insights suggest that human information search is complex in ways that cannot be fully explained by monolithic accounts of information search, including proposals focused on estimation uncertainty or cost–benefit analysis. We conclude that broader theories of human information-search behavior are necessary.",

          "abstract": "Animals chain movements into long-lived motor strategies, exhibiting variability across scales that reflects the interplay between internal states and environmental cues. To reveal structure in such variability, we build Markov models of movement sequences that bridge across timescales and enable a quantitative comparison of behavioral phenotypes among individuals. Applied to larval zebrafish responding to diverse sensory cues, we uncover a hierarchy of long-lived motor strategies, dominated by changes in orientation distinguishing cruising versus wandering strategies. Environmental cues induce preferences along these modes at the population level: while fish cruise in the light, they wander in response to aversive stimuli, or in search for appetitive prey. As our method encodes the behavioral dynamics of each individual fish in the transitions among coarse-grained motor strategies, we use it to uncover a hierarchical structure in the phenotypic variability that reflects exploration–exploitation trade-offs. Across a wide range of sensory cues, a major source of variation among fish is driven by prior and/or immediate exposure to prey that induces exploitation phenotypes. A large degree of variability that is not explained by environmental cues unravels hidden states that override the sensory context to induce contrasting exploration–exploitation phenotypes. Altogether, by extracting the timescales of motor strategies deployed during navigation, our approach exposes structure among individuals and reveals internal states tuned by prior experience.",

          "authors": "Jarrod M. Hicks, Josh H. McDermott",
          "abstract": "Human hearing is robust to noise, but the basis of this robustness is poorly understood. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the idea that the auditory system adapts to sound components that are stable over time, potentially achieving noise robustness by suppressing noise-like signals. Yet background noise often provides behaviorally relevant information about the environment and thus seems unlikely to be completely discarded by the auditory system. Motivated by this observation, we explored whether noise robustness might instead be mediated by internal models of noise structure that could facilitate the separation of background noise from other sounds. We found that detection, recognition, and localization in real-world background noise were better for foreground sounds positioned later in a noise excerpt, with performance improving over the initial second of exposure to a noise. These results are consistent with both adaptation-based and model-based accounts (adaptation increases over time and online noise estimation should benefit from acquiring more samples). However, performance was also robust to interruptions in the background noise and was enhanced for intermittently recurring backgrounds, neither of which would be expected from known forms of adaptation. Additionally, the performance benefit observed for foreground sounds occurring later within a noise excerpt was reduced for recurring noises, suggesting that a noise representation is built up during exposure to a new background noise and then maintained in memory. These findings suggest that noise robustness is supported by internal models—“noise schemas”—that are rapidly estimated, stored over time, and used to estimate other concurrent sounds.",

With a Young’s modulus of less than 1 kPa, the ultrasoft microrobot adapts its shape within narrow blood vessels, ensuring a uniform distribution of MSCs within the corpus cavernosum. Our findings showed that compared with traditional MSC injections, the MSC delivery microrobot (MSC-Rob) significantly enhanced MSC retention and survival. In both rat and beagle ED models, MSC-Rob treatment accelerated the repair of corpus cavernosum tissue and restored erectile function. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that MSC-Rob treatment facilitates nerve and blood vessel regeneration in the corpus cavernosum by increasing the presence of regenerative macrophages.

          "abstract": "Rhodopsin, the prototypical class-A G-protein coupled receptor, is a highly sensitive receptor for light that enables phototransduction in rod photoreceptors. Rhodopsin plays not only a sensory role but also a structural role as a major component of the rod outer segment disc, comprising over 90% of the protein content of the disc membrane. Mutations in RHO which lead to structural or functional abnormalities, including the autosomal recessive E150K mutation, result in rod dysfunction and death. Therefore, correction of deleterious rhodopsin mutations could rescue inherited retinal degeneration, as demonstrated for other visual genes such as RPE65 and PDE6B. In this study, we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 adenine base editing strategy to correct the E150K mutation and demonstrate precise in vivo editing in a Rho -E150K mouse model of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and the G-protein activation assay, we characterized wild-type rhodopsin and rhodopsin variants containing bystander base edits. Subretinal injection of dual-adeno-associated viruses delivering our base editing strategy yielded up to 44% Rho correction in homozygous Rho -E150K mice. Injection at postnatal day 15, but not later time points, restored rhodopsin expression, partially rescued retinal function, and partially preserved retinal structure. These findings demonstrate that in vivo base editing can restore the function of mutated structural and functional proteins in animal models of disease, including rhodopsin-associated RP and suggest that the timing of gene-editing is a crucial determinant of successful treatment outcomes for degenerative genetic diseases.",

Traditional anthropological divisions of “foragers” and “farmers” have shaped our understanding of ancient cultivation practices but have several limitations, including how people stewarded and managed nondomesticated species. To investigate the long-term effects of plant management in the Pacific Northwest, this study focuses on beaked hazelnut ( Corylus cornuta ) which has a long, precolonial history of management, transportation, and cultivation in British Columbia (BC, Canada). In particular, isolated hazelnut populations in northwestern BC are thought to be the result of historical transplanting and management. We sampled individual hazelnuts (n = 219) representing three distinct regions in and assessed 9,650 genome-wide SNPs identified with nextRAD genotyping-by-sequencing libraries to test for population genetic structure. We used linear measurements of individuals to assess morphological phenotypes and to identify variation between individuals and lineages. These data reveal shared genetic clusters in distant and disjunct northwestern and interior regions consistent with the movement of humans across the landscape. We also find several small genetically distinct populations in the northwestern region. The Genetic structure of hazelnut in the previously labeled “disjunct” region in Gitxsan, Ts’msyen, and Nis g a’a homelands is consistent with the enduring influence of people on the distribution of purportedly “wild” plant species. Our results support the hypothesis that hazelnut was likely transplanted long distances and also managed in situ.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has been reported to allosterically activate iPLA 2 , and this has now been verified with a lipidomics-based mixed-micelle assay, but its mechanism of action has been unknown. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was employed to identify ATP interaction peptide regions located within the ankyrin repeat domain at which ATP interacts. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which ATP binds to its site and the main residues that interact. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to verify the importance of these residues in the role of ATP in regulating iPLA 2 activity. Importantly, calcium was found to abolish the enhancing regulatory function of ATP and to promote the inhibitory activity by calmodulin. Given previous evidence that calcium does not bind directly to iPLA 2 , its effect appears to be indirect via association with ATP and/or calmodulin. Using HDX-MS, we found that calmodulin interacts with the N terminus peptide region of iPLA 2 consisting of residues 20 to 28. These two regulatory iPLA 2 sites open the road to the development of potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Here, we report that HS lesional skin is characterized by the expansion of innate lymphocytes and T cells expressing CD2, an essential activation receptor and adhesion molecule. Lymphocytes expressing elevated CD2 predominated with unique spatial distribution throughout the epidermis and hypodermis in the HS lesion. CD2 + cells were mainly innate lymphocytes expressing the NK cell marker, CD56, and CD4 + T cells. Importantly, these CD2 + cells interacted with CD58 (LFA3) expressing epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the hypodermis. Granzyme A bright NKT cells (CD2 + CD3 + CD56 bright ) clustered with α-SMA expressing fibroblasts juxtaposed to epithelialized tunnels and fibrotic regions of the hypodermis. Whereas NK cells (CD2 + CD56 dim ) were perforin + , granzymes A + and B + , and enriched adjacent to hyperplastic follicular epidermis and tunnels of HS showing presence of apoptotic cells. The cytokines IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18, which enhance NK cell maturation and function were significantly elevated in HS. Ex vivo HS skin explant cultures treated with CD2:CD58 interaction-blocking anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody attenuated secretion of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and suppressed inflammatory gene signature. Additionally, CD2:CD58 blockade altered miRNAs involved in NK/NKT differentiation and/or function. In summary, we show that a cellular network of heterogenous NKT and NK cell populations drives inflammation and is critical in the pathobiology of HS, including tunnel formation and fibrosis. Finally, CD2 blockade is a viable immunotherapeutic approach for the effective management of HS.",

          "abstract": "The human lens is composed of a monolayer of lens epithelial cells (LECs) and elongated fibers that align tightly but are separated by the plasma membrane. The integrity of the lens plasma membrane is crucial for maintaining lens cellular structure, homeostasis, and transparency. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a selenoenzyme, plays a critical role in protecting against lipid peroxidation. This study aims to elucidate the role of GPX4 in lens plasma membrane stability during lens development using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo systems. Our findings reveal that GPX4 deficiency triggers lens epithelial apoptosis-independent but ferroptosis-mediated cell death. Blocking lens GPX4 activity during ex vivo culture induces lens opacification, LEC death, and disruption of lens fiber cell arrangement. Deletion of lens-specific Gpx4 results in significant unsaturated phospholipid loss and an increase in oxidized phospholipids. Consequently, lenses with Gpx4 deficiency exhibit massive disruption of lens fiber cell structure, significant loss of LECs via ferroptosis, and formation of newborn cataracts. Remarkably, administering the lipid peroxidation inhibitor, liproxstatin-1, to pregnant mothers at embryonic days 9.5 significantly prevents lipid peroxidation, LEC death, and lens developmental defects. Our study unveils the crucial role of GPX4 in lens development and transparency, and also provides a successful intervention approach to prevent lens developmental defects through lipid peroxidation inhibition.",

          "abstract": "Persistent pain frequently precipitates the development of anxiety disorders, yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we employed a mouse model that simulates trigeminal neuralgia and observed a marked reduction in the activity of GABAergic neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb), a critical region for modulating pain and anxiety. We utilized precise optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques to modulate these neurons, which significantly alleviated behaviors associated with pain and anxiety. Our investigations revealed an inhibitory pathway from the LHb GABAergic neurons to the posterior paraventricular thalamus. Activation of this pathway primarily mitigated pain-related behaviors, with minimal effects on anxiety. Conversely, interactions between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons within the LHb were essential in alleviating both pain and anxiety following trigeminal nerve damage. Additionally, we identified that β-sitosterol interacts directly with LHb GABAergic neurons via the estrogen receptor α, providing dual therapeutic effects for both pain and anxiety. These findings highlight the critical role of reduced GABAergic neuronal activity in the LHb in the intersection of pain and anxiety, pointing to promising therapeutic possibilities.",

To investigate the molecular mechanism of XCL-induced XCR1 signaling, we determined a high-resolution structure of the human XCR1 and G i complex with an engineered form of XCL1, XCL1 CC3, by cryoelectron microscopy. Through mutagenesis and structural analysis, we elucidated the molecular details for the binding of the N-terminal segment of XCL1 CC3, which is vital for activating XCR1. The unique arrangement within the XCL1 CC3 binding site confers specificity for XCL1 in XCR1. We propose an activation mechanism for XCR1 involving structural alterations of key residues at the bottom of the XCL1 binding pocket.

          "abstract": "Investigating microbe–microbe interactions at the single-cell level is critical to unraveling the ecology and dynamics of microbial communities. In many situations, microbes assemble themselves into densely packed multispecies biofilms. The density and complexity pose acute difficulties for visualizing individual cells and analyzing their interactions. Here, we address this problem through an unconventional application of expansion microscopy, which allows for the “decrowding” of individual bacterial cells within a multispecies community. Expansion microscopy generally has been carried out under isotropic expansion conditions and used as a resolution-enhancing method. In our variation of expansion microscopy, we carry out expansion under heterotropic conditions; that is, we expand the space between bacterial cells but not the space within individual cells. The separation of individual bacterial cells from each other reflects the competition between the expansion force pulling them apart and the adhesion force holding them together. We employed heterotropic expansion microscopy to study the relative strength of adhesion in model biofilm communities. These included mono- and dual-species Streptococcus biofilms and a three-species synthetic community ( Fusobacterium nucleatum , Streptococcus mutans , and Streptococcus sanguinis ) under conditions that facilitated interspecies coaggregation. Using adhesion mutants, we investigated the interplay between F. nucleatum outer membrane protein RadD and different Streptococcus species. We also examined the Schaalia-TM7 epibiont association. Quantitative proximity analysis was used to evaluate the separation of individual microbial members. Our study demonstrates that heterotropic expansion microscopy can “decrowd” dense biofilm communities, improve visualization of individual bacterial members, and enable analysis of microbe–microbe adhesive interactions at the single-cell level.",

          "abstract": "The gut microbiota produces high concentrations of antimicrobial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that restrict the growth of invading microorganisms. The enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar ( S. ) Typhimurium triggers inflammation in the large intestine to ultimately reduce microbiota density and bloom, but it is unclear how the pathogen gains a foothold in the homeostatic gut when SCFA-producing commensals are abundant. Here, we show that S. Typhimurium invasion of the ileal mucosa triggers malabsorption of dietary amino acids to produce downstream changes in nutrient availability in the large intestine. In gnotobiotic mice engrafted with a community of 17 human Clostridia isolates, S. Typhimurium virulence factors triggered marked changes in the cecal metabolome, including an elevated abundance of amino acids. In an ex vivo fecal culture model, we found that two of these amino acids, lysine and ornithine, countered SCFA-mediated growth inhibition by restoring S. Typhimurium pH homeostasis through the inducible amino acid decarboxylases CadA and SpeF, respectively. In a mouse model of gastrointestinal infection, S. Typhimurium CadA activity depleted dietary lysine to promote cecal ecosystem invasion in the presence of an intact microbiota. From these findings, we conclude that virulence factor–induced malabsorption of dietary amino acids in the small intestine changes the nutritional environment of the large intestine to provide S. Typhimurium with resources needed to counter growth inhibition by microbiota-derived SCFAs.",

In the present study, by using a metabolomics approach, we identified the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) as a therapeutic target for HSD-mediated gut barrier dysfunction. Specifically, 16-week feeding on an HSD caused gut barrier dysfunction, such as colon inflammation and tight junction impairment in a murine model. A metabolomics analysis of mouse colon tissue showed a decrease in the 5(6)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid [5(6)-EET] level and an increase in soluble epoxide hydrolase, which is related to HSD-mediated injuries to the gut barrier. The mice treated with a chemical inhibitor of sEH and the mice with genetic intervention by intestinal-specific knockout of the sEH gene significantly attenuated HSD-caused intestinal injuries by reducing HSD-mediated colon inflammation and improving the impaired tight junction caused by an HSD. Further, in vitro studies showed that treatment with 5(6)-EET, but not its hydrolytic product 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-DiHET), significantly ablated high sucrose-caused intestinal epithelial inflammation and impaired tight junction. Additionally, 5(6)-EET is anti-inflammatory and improves gut epithelial tight junction while 5,6-DiHET cannot do so. This study presents an underlying mechanism of and a therapeutic strategy for the gut barrier dysfunction caused by an HSD.",

          "abstract": "Many enveloped viruses bud from the plasma membrane that is tightly associated with a dense and thick actin cortex. This actin network represents a significant challenge for membrane deformation and scission, and how it is remodeled during the late steps of the viral cycle is largely unknown. Using superresolution microscopy, we show that HIV-1 buds in areas of the plasma membrane with low cortical F-actin levels. We find that the cellular oxidoreductase MICAL1 locally depolymerizes actin at budding sites to promote HIV-1 budding and release. Upon MICAL1 depletion, F-actin abnormally remains at viral budding sites, incompletely budded viruses accumulate at the plasma membrane and viral release is impaired. Remarkably, normal viral release can be restored in MICAL1-depleted cells by inhibiting Arp2/3-dependent branched actin networks. Mechanistically, we find that MICAL1 directly disassembles branched-actin networks and controls the timely recruitment of the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport scission machinery during viral budding. In addition, the MICAL1 activator Rab35 is recruited at budding sites, functions in the same pathway as MICAL1, and is also required for viral release. This work reveals a role for oxidoreduction in triggering local actin depolymerization to control HIV-1 budding, a mechanism that may be widely used by other viruses. The debranching activity of MICAL1 could be involved beyond viral budding in various other cellular functions requiring local plasma membrane deformation.",

          "abstract": "One driver of the high failure rates of clinical trials for therapeutic cancer vaccines is likely the inability to sufficiently engage conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), the antigen-presenting cell (APC) subset that is specialized in priming antitumor T cells. Here, we demonstrate that, relative to vaccination with an injectable mesoporous silica rod (MPS) vaccine alone (Vax), combining MPS vaccines with CD122-biased IL-2/anti-IL-2 antibody complexes (IL-2cx) drives ~3-fold expansion of cDCs at the vaccination sites, vaccine-draining lymph nodes, and spleens of treated mice. Furthermore, relative to Vax alone, Vax+IL-2cx led to a ~3-fold increase in the numbers of CD8 + T cells and ~15-fold increase in the numbers of NK cells at the vaccination site. Notably, with both the model protein antigen OVA as well as various peptide neoantigens, Vax+IL-2cx induced ~5 to 30-fold greater numbers of circulating antigen-specific CD8 + T cells relative to Vax alone. We further demonstrate that Vax+IL-2cx leads to significantly improved efficacy in the MC38 colon carcinoma model relative to either monotherapy alone, driving complete regressions in 50% of mice in a cDC-dependent manner. Relative to vaccine alone, Vax+IL-2cx led to comparable numbers of CD8 + T cells, but markedly greater numbers of NK cells and activated cDCs in the B16F10 melanoma tumor microenvironment post-therapy. Taken together, these findings suggest that the administration of factors that engage both the cDC-CD8 + T cell and cDC-NK cell axes can boost the potency of therapeutic cancer vaccines.",

Loss of IFN-γ signaling in Tregs and of T cell-derived IFN-γ impaired the Th1-Treg polarization and worsened the disease.

Determination of these structures has been facilitated by the presence of large extramembrane components (such as G protein, arrestin, or Venus flytrap domains) in these complexes that aid in particle alignment during the processing of the cryo-EM data. In contrast, determination of the inactive state structure of Family A GPCRs is more challenging due to the relatively small size of the seven transmembrane domain (7TM) and to the surrounding detergent micelle that, in the absence of other features, make particle alignment impossible. Here, we describe an alternative protein engineering strategy where the heterodimeric protein calcineurin is fused to a GPCR by three points of attachment, the cytoplasmic ends of TM5, TM6, and TM7. This three-point attachment provides a more rigid link with the GPCR transmembrane domain that facilitates particle alignment during data processing, allowing us to determine the structures of the β 2 adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) in the apo, antagonist-bound, and agonist-bound states.

          "abstract": "The distinctive characteristics of water, evident in its thermodynamic anomalies, have implications across disciplines from biology to geophysics. Considered a valid hypothesis to rationalize its unique properties, a liquid–liquid phase transition in water below the freezing point, in the so-called supercooled regime, has nowadays been observed in several molecular dynamics simulations and is being actively researched experimentally. The hypothesis of ferroelectric phase transition in supercooled water can be traced back to 1977, due to Stillinger. In this work, we highlight intriguing and far-reaching implications of water: The ferroelectric and liquid–liquid phase transitions can be designed as two facets of the same underlying phenomenon. Our results are based on the analysis of extensive molecular dynamics simulations and are explained in the context of a classical density functional theory in mean-field approximation valid for a polar liquid, where dipolar interaction is treated perturbatively. The theory underpins the potential role of ferroelectricity in promoting the liquid–liquid phase transition, being the density-polarization coupling inherent in the dipolar interaction potential. The existence of ferroelectric order in supercooled low-density liquid water is confirmed by the observation in molecular dynamics simulations of collective modes in space-time polarization correlation functions, traceable to spontaneous breaking of continuous rotational symmetry. Our work sheds light on water’s supercooled behavior and opens the door to experimental investigations of the static and dynamic behavior of water’s polarization.",

          "abstract": "RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs)-mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) are crucial for type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway and innate immune responses triggered by RNA viruses. However, the regulatory molecular mechanisms underlying RNA virus-activated type I IFN signaling pathway remain incompletely understood. Here, we found that protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) serves as a negative regulator of the type I IFN signaling pathway by interacting with MAVS and catalyzing monomethylation of arginine 232 (R232me1) in MAVS. RNA virus infection leads to the downregulation and dissociation of PRMT7 from MAVS as well as the decrease of R232me1 methylation, enhancing MAVS/RIG-I interaction, MAVS aggregation, type I IFN signaling activation, and antiviral immune responses. Knock-in mice with MAVS R232 substituted with lysine ( Mavs R232K -KI) are more resistant to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus infection due to enhanced antiviral immune responses. PiPRMT7-MAVS, a short peptide inhibitor designed to interrupt the interaction between PRMT7 and MAVS, inhibits R232me1 methylation, thereby enhancing MAVS/RIG-I interaction, promoting MAVS aggregation, activating type I IFN signaling, and bolstering antiviral immune responses to suppress RNA virus replication. Moreover, the clinical relevance of PRMT7 is highlighted that it is significantly downregulated in RNA virus-infected clinical samples, such as blood samples from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Ebola virus, as well as H1N1-infected bronchial epithelial cells. Our findings uncovered that PRMT7-mediated arginine methylation plays critical roles in regulating MAVS-mediated antiviral innate immune responses, and targeting arginine methylation might represent a therapeutic avenue for treating RNA viral infection.",

          "abstract": "Accurate estimation of the dispersal velocity or speed of evolving organisms is no mean feat. In fact, existing probabilistic models in phylogeography or spatial population genetics generally do not provide an adequate framework to define velocity in a relevant manner. For instance, the very concept of instantaneous speed simply does not exist under one of the most popular approaches that models the evolution of spatial coordinates as Brownian trajectories running along a phylogeny. Here, we introduce a family of models—the so-called Phylogenetic Integrated Velocity (PIV) models—that use Gaussian processes to explicitly model the velocity of evolving lineages instead of focusing on the fluctuation of spatial coordinates over time. We describe the properties of these models and show an increased accuracy of velocity estimates compared to previous approaches. Analyses of West Nile virus data in the United States indicate that PIV models provide sensible predictions of the dispersal of evolving pathogens at a one-year time horizon. These results demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of predictive phylogeography in monitoring epidemics in time and space.",

          "abstract": "The ability to follow the evolutionary trajectories of specific neuronal cell types has led to major insights into the evolution of the vertebrate brain. Here, we study how cave life in the Mexican tetra ( Astyanax mexicanus ) has affected an identified giant multisensory neuron, the Mauthner neuron (MN). Because this neuron is crucial in driving rapid escapes, the absence of predation risk in the cave forms predicts a massive reduction in this neuron. Moreover, the absence of functional eyes in the A. mexicanus Pachón form predicts an even stronger reduction in the cell’s large ventral dendrite that receives visual inputs in sighted fish species. We succeeded in recording in vivo from this neuron in the blind cavefish and two surface tetra ( A. mexicanus and Astyanax aeneus ), which offers unique chances to simultaneously study evolutionary changes in morphology and function in this giant neuron. In contrast to the predictions, we find that cave life, while sufficient to remove vision, has neither affected the cell's morphology nor its functional properties. This specifically includes the cell's ventral dendrite. Furthermore, cave life did not increase the variance in morphological or functional features. Rather, variability in surface and cave forms was the same, which suggests a complex stabilizing selection in this neuron and a continued role of its ventral dendrite. We found that adult cavefish are potent predators that readily attack smaller fish. So, one of the largely unknown stabilizing factors could be using the MN in such attacks and, in the young fish, escaping them.",

Contrary to previous analyses, these quotients reveal that nonhuman primates have total metabolic rates expected for similar-sized mammals in similar environments. In addition, data from several small-scale societies show that humans evolved exceptionally high resting, activity, and total metabolic rates apparently by overcoming tradeoffs between resting and active energy expenditures that constrain other primates.

We examined the metabolic cost of color change in octopuses by measuring oxygen consumption in samples of excised octopus skin during periods of chromatophore expansion and contraction and then modeled metabolic demand over the whole octopus as a function of octopus mass. The metabolic demand of the fully activated chromatophore system is nearly as great as an octopus’s resting metabolic rate. This high metabolic cost carries ecological and evolutionary implications, including selective pressures in octopuses that may influence the adoption of nocturnal lifestyles, the use of dens, the reduction of the chromatophore system in deep-sea species, and metabolic trade-offs associated with foraging.",

Thousands of plant species possess tiny structures called “domatia” that house mites which protect plants from pests, yet these traits remain woefully understudied. Here, we release a worldwide database of species with mite domatia and provide an evaluation of the phylogenetic and geographic distribution of this mutualistic trait. With &gt;2,500 additions based on digital herbarium scans and published reports, we increased the number of known species with domatia by 27% and, importantly, documented their absence in &gt;4,000 species. We show that mite domatia likely evolved hundreds of times among flowering plants, occurring in an estimated ~10% of woody species representing over a quarter of all angiosperm families. Contrary to classic hypotheses about the evolutionary drivers of mutualism, we find that mite domatia evolved more frequently in temperate regions and in deciduous lineages; this pattern is concordant with a large-scale geographic transition from predominantly ant-based plant defense mutualisms in the tropics to mite-based defense mutualisms in temperate climates. Our data also reveal a pattern of evolutionary convergence in domatia morphology, with tuft-form domatia more likely to evolve in dry temperate habitats and pit domatia more likely to evolve in wet tropical environments. We have shown climate-associated drivers of mite domatia evolution, demonstrating their utility and power as an evolutionarily replicated system for the study of plant defense mutualisms.",

From this heterogeneity, ordered mesoscopic structures emerge, such as liquid phases with controlled composition. The competition of these structures for the same components raises several questions: what types of interactions allow the retrieval of multiple ordered mesoscopic structures, and what are the physical limitations for the retrieval of said structures. In this work, we develop an analytically tractable model for multicomponent liquids capable of retrieving states with target compositions. We name this model the liquid Hopfield model in reference to corresponding work in the theory of associative neural networks. In this model, we show that nonlinear repulsive interactions are a general requirement for retrieval of target structures. We demonstrate that this is because liquid mixtures at low temperatures tend to transition to phases with few components, a phenomenon that we term localization. Taken together, our results reveal a trade-off between retrieval and localization phenomena in liquid mixtures, and pave the way for other connections between the phenomenologies of neural computation and liquid mixtures.",

We explored the opening of cryptic ligand binding sites in 16 proteins, where the closed and open conformations define the expected extreme points of the conformational variation. Due to the many structures of these proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we were able to study whether the distribution of X-ray structures affects the distribution of AF2 models. We have found that AF2 generates both a cluster of open and a cluster of closed models for proteins that have comparable numbers of open and closed structures in the PDB and not too many other conformations. This was observed even with default MSA parameters, thus without further subsampling. In contrast, with the exception of a single protein, AF2 did not yield multiple clusters of conformations for proteins that had imbalanced numbers of open and closed structures in the PDB, or had substantial numbers of other structures. Subsampling improved the results only for a single protein, but very shallow MSA led to incorrect structures. The ability of generating both open and closed conformations for six out of the 16 proteins agrees with the success rates of similar studies reported in the literature. However, we showed that this partial success is due to AF2 “remembering” the conformational distributions in the PDB and that the approach fails to predict rarely seen conformations.",

Systematic trend analysis of P, a nonrenewable resource, has been challenging, primarily due to sparse and inconsistent historical data.

We trained a multitask long short-term memory model for total P (TP) using data from 430 rivers across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Trend analysis of reconstructed daily records (1980–2019) shows widespread decline in concentrations, with declining, increasing, and insignificantly changing trends in 60%, 28%, and 12% of the rivers, respectively. Concentrations in urban rivers have declined the most despite rising urban population in the past decades; concentrations in agricultural rivers however have mostly increased, suggesting not-as-effective controls of nonpoint sources in agriculture lands compared to point sources in cities. TP loss, calculated as fluxes by multiplying concentration and discharge, however exhibited an overall increasing rate of 6.5% per decade at the CONUS scale over the past 40 y, largely due to increasing river discharge. Results highlight the challenge of reducing TP loss that is complicated by changing river discharge in a warming climate.",

In the north temperate zone, increased nest failure along edges of forest fragments is hypothesized to play a major role in the disappearance of bird species from disturbed landscapes. However, we lack comprehensive syntheses from tropical latitudes, where biodiversity is highest and increasingly threatened by habitat fragmentation and disturbance. We assembled data from five decades of field studies across the global tropics (1,112 populations of 661 species) and used phylogenetic models to evaluate proposed predictors of nest success. We found significant effects of several traits, including adult body mass and nest architecture. Contrary to results from many temperate locations, anthropogenic habitat disruption did not consistently reduce nest success; in fact, raw nest success rates were lower in large tracts of primary forest than in disturbed or fragmented landscapes. Follow-up analyses within species, using a subset of 76 species for which we had estimates of nest survival in habitats with different levels of disruption, confirmed that neither disturbance nor fragmentation significantly influenced nest success. These results suggest that nest predation alone cannot explain observed declines in avian biodiversity in tropical forest fragments, raising new questions about the demographic processes that drive extinction in the tropics.",

NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome assembly is initiated by the binding of a single NAIP to its cognate ligand, but a subset of bacterial flagellins or T3SS structural proteins are thought to evade NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome sensing by not binding to their cognate NAIPs. Unlike other inflammasome components such as NLRP3, AIM2, or some NAIPs, NLRC4 is constitutively present in resting macrophages and not known to be induced by inflammatory signals. Here, we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling up-regulates NLRC4 transcription and protein expression in murine macrophages, which licenses NAIP detection of evasive ligands. In contrast, TLR priming in human macrophages did not up-regulate NLRC4 expression, and human macrophages remained unable to detect NAIP-evasive ligands even following priming. Critically, ectopic expression of either murine or human NLRC4 was sufficient to induce pyroptosis in response to immunoevasive NAIP ligands, indicating that increased levels of NLRC4 enable the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome to detect these normally evasive ligands. Altogether, our data reveal that TLR priming tunes the threshold for the murine NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome to enable inflammasome responses against immunoevasive or suboptimal NAIP ligands. These findings provide insight into species-specific TLR regulation of NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation.",

Theoretical frameworks suggest that both the dynamics of social tolerance and transmission biases (or social learning strategies) influence the pathways of information diffusion in social groups. Bearded capuchins ( Sapajus libidinosus ) inhabiting the semiarid seasonal caatinga biome of the Serra da Capivara National Park (SCNP) form highly tolerant societies that possess the largest “tool-kit” described for monkeys, a feat likely facilitated by social learning. Here, we used social network analysis and an open diffusion experiment using an extractive foraging task to identify the occurrence of social learning and describe the pathways of social transmission of information in two wild primate populations. The dynamics of social tolerance outside of task introductions predicted opportunities for social learning, but it was tolerance during task introductions that predicted the actual pathways of social information diffusion. Our results also indicated that the capuchins mainly learned from others via direct observation and naïve individuals exhibited an observation bias toward successful males. This study supports the claims of cultural transmission in robust capuchins and empirically supports the role of social tolerance and social learning strategies in human and nonhuman primate cultural evolution.",

To understand individualities in the context of animal movement, we focused on one of the most remarkable migrations—the journey of the endangered European eel from their birthplace in the Sargasso Sea to freshwater environments. Laboratory observations unveiled a continuum of diverse phenotypes of migrating eels: Some displayed a heightened tendency to swim against a constant water flow, while others a greater propensity to climb obstacles. Looking for the biological underpinnings of this migratory diversity, we characterized the eels’ individual differences in traits of four key domains: life history, physiology, behavior, and cognition, among which we found significant variance and interconnectedness. Upon reducing this variance to its primary multivariate axes, we found that these predict the migratory types. Eels with 1) low exploration, high activity, low boldness, and high lateralization; 2) strong lateralization, enhanced quantitative abilities, short problem-solving time, high boldness, and low growth rates; or 3) enhanced problem-solving, reduced spatial learning, high cognitive flexibility, and shorter time to solve the cognitive tasks were more likely to display the climbing migratory type. Field sampling revealed how specific traits’ combinations seemed to influence the distribution of eels once they begin to settle in the freshwater environment. Our study underscores the impressive diversity of individuals during this critical migration, emphasizing an intrinsic connection to multidomain trait variance. Preserving this diversity becomes paramount, as it likely contributes to the resilience and adaptability of endangered migratory species.",

In this study, we explored the role of XIST (X-inactive specific transcript) long noncoding RNA in ovarian cancer stemness and plasticity through in silico and in vitro analyses. We found that XIST is significantly down-regulated in ovarian tumors, with low XIST expression linked to a higher stemness index and lower overall survival. Knocking down XIST in ovarian cancer cells enhanced stemness, particularly increasing mesenchymal-like CSCs, and under hypoxic conditions, it promoted epithelial-like CSC markers.

While phototaxis is a common strategy to cope with such fluctuations, nonmotile species must adopt alternative mechanisms to avoid light-induced damage. Here, we show that the nonmotile, single-celled marine dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula contains a chloroplast network that undergoes strong deformation in response to strong light. By exposing cells to various physiologically relevant light conditions and applying temporal illumination sequences, we find that the light-induced network morphodynamics follows dynamic rules similar to temporal low-pass filtering. We develop a mathematical formalism to model the light-regulated behavior, exposing the relevant timescales of the morphodynamic response. Moreover, confocal microscopy reveals that the unusual reticulated morphology exhibits properties similar to auxetic metamaterials, facilitating the rapid and drastic deformation necessary for the light-avoidance motion, confined by the cell wall. This mechanism reduces the effective chloroplast area under high light conditions, minimizing light absorption and preventing photodamage. Our findings demonstrate that the intricate connection between the chloroplasts topologically complex structure and active dynamics enables the dinoflagellate’s dynamic adaptation to changing light environments, thereby supporting essential life-sustaining processes.",

The major molecular feature of H3K27M mutant DMGs is a global loss of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a phenotype conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ). Here, we perform unbiased genome-wide suppressor screens in C. elegans expressing H3K27M and isolate 20 suppressors, all of which at least partially restore H3K27me3. 19/20 suppressor mutations map to the same histone H3.3 gene in which the K27M mutation was originally introduced. Most of these create single amino acid substitutions between residues R26-Y54, which do not disrupt oncohistone expression. Rather, they are predicted to impair interactions with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and are functionally conserved in human cells. Further, we mapped a single extragenic H3K27M suppressor to ubc-20 , an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, whose loss rescued H3K27me3 to nearly 50% wild-type levels despite continued oncohistone expression and chromatin incorporation. We demonstrate that ubc-20 is the major enzyme responsible for generating diubiquitinated histone H2B. Our study provides in vivo support for existing models of PRC2 inhibition via direct oncohistone contact and suggests that the effects of H3K27M may be modulated by H2B ubiquitination.",

          "abstract": "A critical host response against viral infections entails the activation of innate immune signaling that culminates in the production of antiviral proteins. DNA viruses are sensed by the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), which initiates a signaling pathway that results in production of proinflammatory cytokines such as Interferon-β (IFN-β) and activation of the antiviral response. Precise regulation of the antiviral innate immune response is required to avoid deleterious effects of its overactivation. We previously reported that the 4EHP/GIGYF2 translational repressor complex reduces the translation of Ifnb1 mRNA, which encodes IFN-β, upon RNA viral infections. Here, we report a distinct regulatory mechanism by which 4EHP controls replication of DNA viruses by translational repression of the Cgas mRNA, which encodes the DNA viral sensor cGAS. We show that 4EHP is required for effective translational repression of Cgas mRNA triggered by miR-23a. Upon infection, 4EHP deficiency bolsters the elicited innate immune response against the diverse DNA viruses Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Vaccinia Virus (VacV) and concomitantly reduces their rate of replication in vitro and in vivo. This study elucidates an intrinsic regulatory mechanism of the host response to DNA viruses which may provide unique opportunities for countering viral infections.",

          "abstract": "KCTD10, a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) family, is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders and functions as a substrate recognition component within the RING-type ubiquitin ligase complex. A rare de novo variant of KCTD10, p.C124W, was identified in schizophrenia cases, yet its underlying pathogenesis remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that heterozygous KCTD10 C124W mice display pronounced synaptic abnormalities and exhibit schizophrenia-like behaviors. Mechanistically, we reveal that KCTD10 undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process orchestrated by its intrinsically disordered region (IDR). p.C124W mutation disrupts this LLPS capability, leading to diminished degradation of RHOB and subsequent excessive accumulation in the postsynaptic density fractions. Notably, neither IDR deletion nor p.C124W mutation in KCTD10 mitigates the synaptic abnormalities caused by Kctd10 deficiency. Thus, our findings implicate that LLPS may be associated with the pathogenesis of KCTD10-associated brain disorders and highlight the potential of targeting RHOB as a therapeutic strategy for diseases linked to mutations in KCTD10 or RHOB.",

          "abstract": "Since their domestication, horses have accompanied mankind, and humans have constantly shaped horses according to their needs through stallion-centered breeding. Consequently, the male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) is extremely uniform in modern horse breeds. The majority of stallions worldwide carry MSY haplotypes (HT) attributed to an only ~1,500-y-old, so-called, “Crown” haplogroup. The predominance of the Crown in modern horse breeds is thought to represent a footprint of the vast impact of stallions of “Oriental origin” in the past millennium. Here, we report the results of a fine-scaled MSY haplotyping of large datasets of patrilines comprising 1,517 males of 189 modern horse breeds, covering a broad phenotypic and geographic spectrum. We can disentangle the multilayered influence of Oriental stallions over the last few hundred years, exposing the intense linebreeding and the wide-ranging impact of Arabian, English Thoroughbred, and Coldblood sires. Iberian and New World horse breeds contain a wide range of diversified Crown lineages. Their broad HT spectrum illustrates the spread of horses of Oriental origin via the Iberian Peninsula after the Middle Ages, which is commonly referred to as the “Spanish influence.” Our survey also revealed a second major historical dissemination of horses from Western Asia, attributed to the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. Our analysis shows that MSY analysis can uncover the complex history of horse breeds and can be used to establish the paternal ancestry of modern horse breeds.",

          "abstract": "Primates are known for their exceptional ability to recognize faces. However, we still have much to learn about how their brains process faces when they are partially hidden. When we cover parts of a face, it affects how our brains respond, even though we still perceive the face as a whole. This suggests that complex brain networks are at work in understanding partially hidden faces. To explore this further, we studied two brain regions, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), while showing primate images of faces with parts occluded. We found that vlPFC neurons were more active when faces were partially covered, while ITC neurons preferred fully visible faces. Interestingly, the ITC seemed to process occluded faces in a separate phase after the vlPFC responded. Our research revealed a coordinated effort between these brain regions based on the level of facial obstruction. Specifically, the vlPFC seemed to play a crucial role, driving the representation of occluded faces in the later phase of ITC processing. Importantly, we also found that the brain processes occluded faces differently from those that are fully visible, suggesting specialized mechanisms for handling these situations. These findings highlight the importance of feedback from the vlPFC in understanding occluded faces in the ITC region of the brain. Understanding these neural processes not only enhances our understanding of how primates perceive faces but also provides insights into broader aspects of visual cognition.",

Our national estimate is 698,000 Civil War deaths. This is substantially higher than the conventional historical estimate of 618,000 but lower than the most recent estimate of around 750,000 deaths based on a 1% census sample.

          "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections are one of the most common causes of acute viral hepatitis, annually causing over 3 million symptomatic cases and 70,000 deaths worldwide. Historically, HEV was described as a hepatotropic virus, but has recently been associated with various extrahepatic manifestations including neurological disorders such as Guillain–Barré syndrome and neuralgic amyotrophy. However, the underlying pathogenesis of these neurological diseases remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate extrahepatic HEV manifestations in a neuronal model system using human-induced primary neurons (iPNs). Renal epithelial cells from human urine were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells to generate neuronal progenitor cells, which were subsequently differentiated into iPNs over 21 d. These iPNs supported HEV infection preferentially in neurite-bearing cells. Transcriptional profiling of the neuronal development process as well as viral infection dynamics in iPNs uncovered a lack of antiviral innate immune responses to HEV infection with only an intrinsic expression of distinct interferon-regulated genes and signaling molecules. Viral open reading frame 2 encoded capsid protein could be visualized by volumetric three-dimensional reconstitution within the neurites, which were reduced in length in an HEV inoculation-dependent manner. In conclusion, this neuron-derived human model system provides a powerful tool for studying extrahepatic manifestations of HEV infection. It further indicates a potential mechanism of pathogenesis driven by the interaction between host and viral factors.",

          "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is a dePARylating enzyme which promotes DNA repair by removal of poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) from PARylated proteins. Loss or inhibition of PARG results in replication stress and sensitizes cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents. PARG inhibitors are now undergoing clinical development for patients having tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), such as cancer patients with germline or somatic BRCA1/2 -mutations. PARP inhibitors kill BRCA-deficient cancer cells by increasing single-stranded DNA gaps (ssGAPs) during replication. Here, we report that, like PARP inhibitor (PARPi), PARG inhibitor (PARGi) treatment also causes an accumulation of ssGAPs in sensitive cells. PARGi exposure increased accumulation of S-phase-specific PAR, a marker for Okazaki fragment processing (OFP) defects on lagging strands and induced ssGAPs, in sensitive cells but not in resistant cells. PARGi also caused accumulation of PAR at the replication forks and at the ssDNA sites in sensitive cells. Additionally, PARGi exhibited monotherapy activity in specific HR-deficient, as well as HR-proficient, patient-derived, or patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-derived organoids of ovarian cancer, and drug sensitivity directly correlated with the accumulation of ssGAPs. Taken together, PARGi treatment results in toxic accumulation of PAR at replication forks resulting in ssGAPs due to OFP defects during replication. Regardless of the BRCA/ HRD - status, the induction of ssGAPs in preclinical models of ovarian cancer cells correlates with PARGi sensitivity. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) may be a useful model system for testing PARGi sensitivity and functional biomarkers.",

Short- and long-term cold exposure is registered via parallel transcriptional shutdown and Polycomb-dependent epigenetic silencing of the Arabidopsis thaliana major flowering repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ). The cold-induced antisense transcripts ( COOLAIR ) determine the dynamics of FLC transcriptional shutdown, but the thermosensory mechanisms are still unresolved. Here, through a forward genetic screen, we identify a mutation that perturbs cold-induced COOLAIR expression and FLC repression. The mutation is a hypomorphic allele of SUPPRESSORS OF MEC-8 AND UNC-52 1 (SMU1), a conserved subunit of the spliceosomal B complex. SMU1 interacts in vivo with the proximal region of nascent COOLAIR and RNA 3′ processing/cotranscriptional regulators and enhances COOLAIR proximal intron splicing to promote specific COOLAIR isoforms. SMU1 also interacts with ELF7, an RNA Polymerase II Associated Factor (Paf1) component and limits COOLAIR transcription. Cold thus changes cotranscriptional splicing/RNA Pol II functionality in an SMU1-dependent mechanism to promote two different isoforms of COOLAIR that lead to reduced FLC transcription. Such cotranscriptional mechanisms are emerging as important regulators underlying plasticity in gene expression.",

We characterized optic tectal neuronal receptive fields using sparse noise stimuli and reverse correlation analysis. Neurons recognized movies of ~200-600 ms durations with defined start and stop stimuli. Movie durations from start to stop responses were tuned by sensory experience though a hierarchical algorithm. Neurons encoded families of image sequences following trigonometric functions. Spike sequence and information flow suggest that repetitive circuit motifs underlie movie detection. Principles of frog topographic retinotectal plasticity and cortical simple cells are employed in machine learning networks for static image recognition, suggesting that discoveries of principles of movie encoding in the brain, such as how image sequences and duration are encoded, may benefit movie recognition technology. We built and trained a machine learning network that mimicked neural principles of visual system movie encoders. The network, named MovieNet, outperformed current machine learning image recognition networks in classifying natural movie scenes, while reducing data size and steps to complete the classification task. This study reveals how movie sequences and time are encoded in the brain and demonstrates that brain-based movie processing principles enable efficient machine learning.",

          "abstract": "Desert ants are known to rely heavily on vision while venturing for food and returning to the nest. During these foraging trips, ants memorize and recognize their visual surroundings, which enables them to recapitulate individually learned routes in a fast and effective manner. The compound eyes are crucial for such visual navigation; however, it remains unclear how information from both eyes are integrated and how ants cope with visual impairment. Here, we manipulated the ants’ visual system by covering one of the two compound eyes and analyzed their ability to recognize familiar views. Monocular ants showed an immediate disruption of their ability to recapitulate their familiar route. However, they were able to compensate for this nonnatural impairment in a few hours by engaging in an extensive route-relearning ontogeny, composed of more learning walks than what naïve ants typically do. This relearning process with one eye forms novel memories, without erasing the previous memories acquired with two eyes. Additionally, ants having learned a route with one eye only are unable to recognize it with two eyes, even though more information is available. Together, this shows that visual memories are encoded and recalled in an egocentric and fundamentally binocular way, where the visual input as a whole must be matched to enable recognition. We show how this kind of visual processing fits with their neural circuitry.",

          "abstract": "Viruses with broad tissue distribution and cell tropism successfully replicate in various nutrient environments in the body. Several viruses reprogram metabolism for viral replication. However, many studies focus on metabolic reprogramming in nutrient-rich conditions that do not recapitulate physiological environments in the body. Here, we investigated how viruses may replicate when a metabolite thought to be essential for replication is limited. We use human cytomegalovirus infection in glucose-free conditions as a model to determine how glucose supports virus replication and how physiologically relevant nutrients contribute to glucose-independent virus production. We find that glucose supports viral genome synthesis, viral protein production and glycosylation, and infectious virus production. Notably, supplement of glucose-free cultures with uridine, ribose, or UDP-GlcNAc—metabolites that feed upper glycolytic branches like the pentose phosphate pathway—results in partially restored virus replication, including low levels of infectious virus production. Supplementing lower glycolysis in glucose-free cultures using pyruvate fails to restore virus replication. These results indicate that nutrients can compensate for glucose via feeding upper glycolytic branches to sustain low levels of virus production. More broadly, our findings suggest that viruses may successfully replicate in diverse metabolic niches, including those in the body with low glucose levels, through alternative nutrient usage.",

The hypothesis that DENV virions interact directly with specific mosquito midgut proteins was explored. We found that DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) pretreated with trypsin interacted with a single 31 kDa protein, identified as AAEL011180 by protein mass spectrometry. This putative receptor is a highly conserved protein and has orthologs in culicine and anopheline mosquitoes. We confirmed that impairing the expression of AAEL011180 in the midgut of Ae. aegypti females abolished the interaction with DENV2, and the virus also bound to immobilized recombinant purified receptor. Furthermore, recombinant DENV2 surface E glycoprotein bound to recombinant AAEL011180 with high affinity (38.2 nM) in binding kinetic analysis using surface plasmon resonance. The gene for this DENV2 E protein receptor (EPrRec) was disrupted, but since the gene is essential in Ae. aegypti, only heterozygote knockout (ΔEPrRec +/− ) females could be recovered. Further reducing EPrRec mRNA expression in the midgut of ΔEPrRec +/− females by systemic dsRNA injection significantly reduced the prevalence of DENV2 midgut infection. EPrRec also interacts with heat shock protein 70 cognate 3 (Hsc70-3), and silencing Hsc70-3 expression in ΔEPrRec females also reduced the prevalence of DENV2 midgut infection.",

Here, we report on experimental observation of pumping of a light beam in a genuinely continuous incommensurate photorefractive quasicrystal emulated by its periodic approximants. We observe a universal character of the transport which is determined by the ratio between periods of the constitutive sublattices, by the sliding angle between them, and by Chern numbers of the excited bands (in the time-coordinate space) of the approximant, for which pumping is adiabatic. This reveals that the properties of quasiperiodic systems determining the topological transport are tightly related to those of their periodic approximants and can be observed and studied in a large variety of physical systems. Our results suggest that the links between quasiperiodic systems and their periodic approximants go beyond the pure mathematical relations: They manifest themselves in physical phenomena which can be explored experimentally.",

Nevertheless, our understanding of the ways in which stably transmitted, evolutionarily relevant human cultural traits might interact with the human genome is incomplete, and methods to detect such interactions are limited. Here, we describe some rules of cultural transmission which could pertain to both humans and cultural nonhuman animals that could lead to the formation and maintenance of stable associations between cultural and genetic traits. Next, we show that, in the presence of such associations, a process analogous to genetic hitchhiking is possible in gene–culture systems. These could leave signatures in the human genome similar to, and perhaps indistinguishable from, those left by selection on genetic traits. Finally, we model selective interference between cultural and genetic traits. We show that selective interference between a cultural trait under selection and a genetic trait under selection can reduce the efficacy of natural selection in the human genome, both in terms of the probability of fixation of beneficial alleles and the dynamics of selective sweeps. We then show that the efficiency of selection at genetic loci can, however, be increased in the presence of strong cultural transmission biases. This implies that the signatures of gene–culture interactions in genetic data may be complex and wide-ranging in gene–culture coevolutionary systems.",

Using pharmaceutical sales data licensed from IQVIA, we estimate national-level trends in antibiotic consumption in 67 countries during 2016–2023 and analyze the effects of economic growth and the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we estimate global human consumption and project growth through 2030 assuming current trends. We find that estimated antibiotic consumption in reported countries increased 16.3% from 29.5 to 34.3 billion defined daily doses (DDDs) from 2016 to 2023, reflecting a 10.6% increase in the consumption rate from 13.7 to 15.2 DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day. Increases were most pronounced in upper-middle- and lower-middle-income countries. While the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced consumption globally, this was most pronounced in high-income countries, and in these countries, reductions in antibiotic use in 2020 were sharper, and lasted longer, than in other countries. By 2030, we project that, without reductions in rapidly developing nations, such as investments to improve infrastructure, particularly water and sanitation, along with improved access to vaccination, global antibiotic consumption will increase by 52.3% from an estimated 49.3 billion in 2023 to 75.1 billion DDDs.",

Here, we report on cobalt single atom-incorporated titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) monodispersed nanoparticles synthesized using a thermodynamic redistribution strategy. Using advanced synchrotron-based X-ray techniques and simulations, we find trivalent titanium is absent, indicating trivalent cations do not influence ferromagnetic (FM) stability. Density functional theory calculations show that the FM stability between Co 2+ ions is very weak. However, electron doping from additional oxygen vacancies can significantly enhance this FM stability, which explains the observed room-temperature ferromagnetism. Moreover, our calculations illustrate enhanced FM interactions between Co Ti + V O complexes with additional oxygen vacancies. This study explores the electronic structure and room-temperature ferromagnetism using monodispersed nanocrystallites with single-atom-incorporated TiO 2 nanostructures.

          "abstract": "In the late spring to summer season of 2023, Canada witnessed unprecedented wildfires, with an extensive burning area and smoke spreading as far as the East Coast of the United States and Europe. Here, using multisource data analysis and climate model simulations, we show that an abnormally warm North Atlantic, as well as an abnormally low Barents Sea ice concentration (SIC), are likely key climate drivers of this Canadian fire season, contributing to ~80% of the fire weather anomaly over Canada from June to August 2023. Specifically, the warm North Atlantic forms an anomalous regional zonal cell with ascending air over the Atlantic and descending air encircling Canada, creating hot and dry local conditions. Meanwhile, reduced Barents SIC leads to a high-pressure center and reinforces the dry northern winds in Canada through Rossby wave dynamics. These exacerbated dry and hot conditions create a favorable environment for the ignition and spread of fires, thus contributing to the prolonged and extreme fire season in Canada. These teleconnections can extend to decadal scales and have important implications for understanding and predicting decadal fire activity in Canada and the surrounding regions.",

Although adaptive immunity and specifically CD4 + T cells play a role in DED pathogenesis, the exact contribution of these cells to corneal epithelial and neural damage remains undetermined. To address this, we explored the progression of a surgical DED model in wild-type (WT) and T cell-deficient mice. We observed that adaptive immune-deficient mice developed all aspects of DED comparably to WT mice except for the absence of functional and morphological corneal nerve changes, nerve damage-associated transcriptomic signature in the trigeminal ganglia, and sustained tear cytokine levels. Adoptive transfer of CD4 + T cells from WT DED mice to T cell-deficient mice reproduced corneal nerve damage but not epitheliopathy. Conversely, T cell-deficient mice reconstituted solely with naïve CD4 + T cells developed corneal nerve impairment and epitheliopathy upon DED induction, thus replicating the WT DED phenotype. Collectively, our data show that while corneal neuropathy is driven by CD4 + T cells in DED, corneal epithelial damage develops independently of the adaptive immune response. These findings have implications for T cell-targeting therapies currently in use for DED.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the processes that link genotype to phenotype is a central challenge in biology. Despite progress in discovering genes associated with ecologically relevant traits, a poor understanding of the processes and functions via which molecules mediate evolutionary differences leaves us critically far from linking proximate and ultimate causes of evolution. This knowledge gap is particularly large in multifaceted phenotypes of ecological relevance such as life histories where multiple traits covary and influence fitness. In Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ), variation in a key life-history trait, maturation age, is largely linked to the transcription cofactor vestigial-like 3 ( vgll3 ). Here, we show that despite this simple genetic architecture, vgll3 genotype influences maturation age through a complex regulatory mechanism whereby it controls the expression of diverse pubertal signaling pathways. Using a multiomic approach in salmon testes, we show that the vgll3 genotype conferring early maturity up-regulates key genes controlling androgen production, cellular energy and adiposity, and TGF-β signaling, thereby increasing the likelihood of earlier pubertal initiation. By mapping VGLL3 regulatory elements we further show its interaction with distinct transcription factors in a genotype-dependent manner, thus coordinating differential activation of regulatory pathways. This study reveals the proximate mechanisms through which a genetically simple association leads to functionally complex molecular differences in a spectrum of cellular traits, thus explaining the molecular basis of pleiotropy in a large-effect gene. Our results indicate that evolution in correlated phenotypes, as exemplified by alternative life history strategies, can be dictated by the function of major life-history genes.",

          "abstract": "We ask the question of how angular momentum is conserved in electroweak interaction processes. To introduce the problem with a minimum of mathematics, we first raise the same issue in elastic scattering of a circularly polarized photon by an atom, where the scattered photon has a different spin direction than the original photon, and note its presence in scattering of a fully relativistic spin-1/2 particle by a central potential. We then consider inverse beta decay in which an electron is emitted following the capture of a neutrino on a nucleus. While both the incident neutrino and final electron spins are antiparallel to their momenta, the final spin is in a different direction than that of the neutrino—an apparent change of angular momentum. However, prior to measurement of the final particle, in all these cases angular momentum is indeed conserved. The apparent nonconservation of angular momentum arises in the quantum measurement process in which the measuring apparatus does not have an initially well-defined angular momentum, but is localized in the outside world. We generalize the discussion to massive neutrinos and electrons, and examine nuclear beta decay and electron-positron annihilation processes through the same lens, enabling physically transparent derivations of angular and helicity distributions in these reactions.",

          "abstract": "Ethylene is widely recognized as a positive regulator of leaf senescence. However, how plants coordinate the biosynthesis of ethylene to meet the requirements of senescence progression has not been determined. The rate-limiting enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway is ACC synthase. AtACS7 was previously considered one of the major contributors to the synthesis of “senescence ethylene” in Arabidopsis . However, the “brake signal” that fine-tunes the expression of AtACS7 to ensure optimal ethylene production during leaf development has yet to be identified. In the present study, the RING-H2 zinc-finger protein RIE1 was found to specifically interact with and ubiquitinate AtACS7, among all functional ACSs in Arabidopsis , to promote its degradation. Overexpression of RIE1 markedly decreased ethylene biosynthesis and delayed leaf senescence, whereas loss of function of RIE1 significantly increased ethylene emission and accelerated leaf senescence. The ethylene-related phenotypes of RIE1 overexpressing or knockout mutants were effectively rescued by the ethylene precursor ACC or the competitive inhibitor of ACS, respectively. In particular, AtACS7-induced precocious leaf senescence was strongly enhanced by the loss of RIE1 but was significantly attenuated by the overexpression of RIE1 . The specific regions of interaction between AtACS7 and RIE1, as well as the major ubiquitination sites of AtACS7, were further investigated. All results demonstrated that RIE1 functions as an important modulator of ethylene biosynthesis during leaf development by specifically targeting AtACS7 for degradation, thereby enabling plants to produce the optimal levels of ethylene needed.",

We propose a unique method to enhance the immunoregulatory functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through an artificially controllable in vivo inflammatory microenvironment generated by biomaterials loaded with BMP-2 that induce bone development. MSCs activated through this method effectively induce M1 macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype, promote differentiation of naïve T cells into regulatory T cells, and inhibit the proliferation of activated T cells via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion. This in vivo licensing not only preserves the immunogenicity of MSCs but also alters DNA methylation patterns, enabling MSCs to exhibit immunoregulatory effects with epigenetic memory. Validation in a mouse colitis model demonstrated their therapeutic efficacy and long-term viability. Furthermore, we found that the material composition influences the inflammatory response during development, with polysaccharide-based biomaterials proving advantageous over protein-based materials in establishing an inflammatory niche conducive to MSC activity. These findings underscore the potential of tissue engineering to create in vivo environments that license MSCs, offering a strategic avenue to enhance MSC-based therapies for addressing significant immune disorders.",

The mechanisms by which agonists activate the G protein are unclear for many GPCR families, including the bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). We ascertained TAS2R5 properties by live cell-based functional assays, direct binding affinity measurements using optical resonators, and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on three agonists that exhibit a wide range of signal transduction in cells despite comparable ligand–receptor binding energies derived from direct experiment and computation. Metadynamics simulations revealed that the critical barrier to activation is ligand-induced opening of the G protein between the α-helical (AH) and Ras-like domains of Gα subunit from a precoupled TAS2R5-G protein state to the fully activated state. A moderate agonist opens the AH-Ras cleft from 22 Å to 31 Å with an energy gain of −4.8 kcal mol −1 , making GDP water-exposed for signaling. A high-potency agonist had an energy gain of −11.1 kcal mol −1 . The low-potency agonist is also exothermic for Gα opening, but with an energy gain of only −1.4 kcal mol −1 . This demonstrates that TAS2R5 agonist-bound functional potencies are derived from energy gains in the transition from a precoupled complex at the level of Gα opening. Our experimental and computational study provides insights into the activation mechanism of signal transduction that provide a basis for rational design of new drugs.",

          "abstract": "RNA splicing enables the functional adaptation of cells to changing contexts. Impaired splicing has been associated with diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and cellular responses remain poorly understood. In this work, we report that deficiency of ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39) in human cell lines, zebrafish larvae, and mice led to impaired spliceosome assembly and a cytotoxic splicing profile characterized by the use of cryptic 5′ splice sites. Disruptive cryptic variants evaded messenger RNA (mRNA) surveillance pathways and were translated into misfolded proteins, which caused proteotoxic aggregates, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and, ultimately, cell death. The detrimental consequence of splicing-induced proteotoxicity could be mitigated by up-regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system and selective autophagy. Our findings provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of spliceosome-associated diseases.",

Capturing CO 2 at temperatures closer to those of many industrial exhaust streams (&gt;200°C) is of interest, although metal oxide absorbents that operate at these temperatures typically exhibit sluggish CO 2 absorption kinetics and instability to cycling. Here, we report a porous metal–organic framework featuring terminal zinc hydride sites that reversibly bind CO 2 at temperatures above 200°C—conditions that are unprecedented for intrinsically porous materials. Gas adsorption, structural, spectroscopic, and computational analyses elucidate the rapid, reversible nature of this transformation. Extended cycling and breakthrough analyses reveal that the material is capable of deep carbon capture at low CO 2 concentrations and high temperatures relevant to postcombustion capture.",

In this Review, we highlight innovative chemical and genetic approaches that are enabling the dissection of microbiota mechanisms and providing causation in health and disease. Although specific microbiota molecules and mechanisms have begun to emerge, new approaches are still needed to go beyond phenotypic associations and translate microbiota discoveries into actionable targets and therapeutic leads to prevent and treat diseases.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic requirements vary during development, and our understanding of how metabolic activity influences cell specialization is incomplete. Here, we describe a switch from glutamine catabolism to synthesis required for erythroid cell maturation. Glutamine synthetase (GS), one of the oldest functioning genes in evolution, is activated during erythroid maturation to detoxify ammonium generated from heme biosynthesis, which is up-regulated to support hemoglobin production. Loss of GS in mouse erythroid precursors caused ammonium accumulation and oxidative stress, impairing erythroid maturation and recovery from anemia. In β-thalassemia, GS activity is inhibited by protein oxidation, leading to glutamate and ammonium accumulation, whereas enhancing GS activity alleviates the metabolic and pathological defects. Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved metabolic adaptation that could potentially be leveraged to treat common red blood cell disorders.",

We present an extreme gradient–boosting model for predicting the occurrence of PFAS in groundwater at the depths of drinking water supply for the conterminous United States. Our model results indicate that 71 million to 95 million people in the conterminous United States potentially rely on groundwater with detectable concentrations of PFAS for their drinking water supplies before any treatment.",

Ribozyme cleavage generates distinct 2′,3′-phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl termini that resemble substrates for recently characterized RNA repair pathways in cells. We report that ribozyme cleavage of two separate mRNAs activated their scarless trans-ligation and translation into full-length protein in eukaryotic cells, a process that we named StitchR (for Stitch RNA). Optimization of StitchR activity in mammalian cells resulted in a ~900-fold increase in protein expression that approached levels observed for genes expressed from single vectors. We demonstrate that StitchR can be harnessed for effective dual adeno-associated virus gene therapies to correct muscular dystrophies by restoring large functional muscle proteins to endogenous levels in vivo.",

The measured column density of 1-cyanopyrene is ∼ 1 .52×10 12 cm −2 , from which we estimate that pyrene contains up to 0.1% of the carbon in TMC-1. This abundance indicates that interstellar PAH chemistry favors the production of pyrene. We suggest that some of the carbon supplied to young planetary systems is carried by PAHs that originate in cold molecular clouds.",

Large tree islands and higher initial planted diversity catalyzed diversity recovery, particularly functional diversity at the landscape level. At the local scale, results demonstrated that greater initial planting diversity begets greater diversity of native recruits, overcoming limitations of natural recruitment in highly modified landscapes. Establishing large and diverse tree islands is crucial for safeguarding rare, endemic, and forest-associated species in oil palm landscapes.",

The mechanism of Pi efflux, activated by inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs), has remained unclear. This study presents cryo–electron microscopy structures of XPR1 in multiple conformations, revealing a transmembrane pathway for Pi export and a dual-binding activation pattern for PP-IPs. A canonical binding site is located at the dimeric interface of Syg1/Pho81/XPR1 (SPX) domains, and a second site, biased toward PP-IPs, is found between the transmembrane and SPX domains. By integrating structural studies with electrophysiological analyses, we characterized XPR1 as an inositol phosphates (IPs)/PP-IPs–activated phosphate channel. The interplay among its transmembrane domains, SPX domains, and IPs/PP-IPs orchestrates the conformational transition between its closed and open states.",

We use two paleoecological records from the Bass Strait islands to identify the initiation of anthropogenic landscape transformation associated with ancestral Palawa/Pakana land use.

A new generation of impact-based early warning systems, using epidemiological models to transform weather forecasts into health forecasts for targeted population subgroups, is an essential adaptation strategy to increase resilience against climate change. Here, we assessed the skill of an operational continental heat-cold-health forecasting system. We used state-of-the-art temperature-lag-mortality epidemiological models to transform bias-corrected ensemble weather forecasts into daily temperature-related mortality forecasts. We found that temperature forecasts can be used to issue skillful forecasts of temperature-related mortality. However, the forecast skill varied by season and location, and it was different for temperature and temperature-related mortality due to the use of epidemiological models. Overall, our study demonstrates and quantifies the forecast skill horizon of heat-cold-health forecasting systems, which is a necessary step toward generating trust among public health authorities and end users.",

          "abstract": "Bioarchaeology uses human skeletal remains to reconstruct varied experiences of individuals and populations in the past, including patterns of health across time periods and cultural contexts. In the past three decades, bioarchaeological studies have highlighted the concept of “frailty,” operationalizing it as increased risk of mortality or cumulative phenotypes. Using data from medieval London cemeteries, we integrate these two approaches to frailty in past populations. First, we estimate the risks of mortality and survivorship (hazard and survival analyses) associated with 10 biomarkers and use these results to construct population-specific frailty and resilience indices. Then, we apply the indices to adult individuals to explore frailty and resilience differentials between males and females in medieval London. Findings suggest that the male-female morbidity-mortality paradox observed in modern populations may not have existed in this context, which may be explained by preferential cultural buffering of men in this patriarchal, urban setting.",

We studied the naturally arising antibiotic-resistant L22* ribosome variant of Bacillus subtilis and identified a Mg 2+ -dependent physiological cost. Coculture competition experiments show that Mg 2+ limitation hinders the growth of the L22* variant more than the wild type (WT), even under antibiotic pressure. This growth disadvantage of L22* cells is not due to lower ribosome abundance but rather due to reduced intracellular Mg 2+ levels. Coarse-grained elastic-network modeling of ribosome conformational dynamics suggests that L22* ribosomes associate more tightly with Mg 2+ when compared to WT. We combined the structural modeling and experimental measurements in a steady-state model to predict cellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) levels, which also depend on Mg 2+ . Experiments confirmed a predicted ATP drop in L22* cells under Mg 2+ limitation, while WT cells were less affected. Intracellular competition for a finite Mg 2+ pool can thus suppress the establishment of an antibiotic-resistant ribosome variant.",

Upon interaction with CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells, CD40 delivers costimulatory signals alongside B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling to regulate affinity maturation and antibody class switch. Mutations affecting CD40-CD40L interactions cause abnormal antibody responses in immunodeficiencies known as X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (X-HIgM). Here, we study the CD40-mediated mechanotransduction in B cells, which likely occurs during their physical contacts with T cells. We found that CD40 forms catch bond with CD40L that lasts longer at larger forces, both B and T cells exert tension on CD40-CD40L bonds, and force enhances CD40 signaling and antibody class switch. X-HIgM CD40L mutations impair catch bond formation, suppress endogenous tension, and reduce force-enhanced CD40 signaling, leading to deficiencies in antibody class switch.

Köhler’s theory explains initial droplet growth but struggles with large particle groups. Here, we present a stochastic, analytical framework building on Köhler’s theory to account for (monodisperse) aerosols and cloud droplet interaction through competitive growth in a limited water vapor field. These interactions are modeled by sink terms, while fluctuations in supersaturation affecting droplet growth are modeled by nonlinear white noise terms. Our results identify hysteresis mechanisms in the droplet activation and deactivation processes.

We report magneto-optical (MO) bound states in the continuum (BICs) with a symmetry-preserved planar photonic crystal. We achieve intrinsic C points at Γ point that are robust against variation in both structural geometry and external magnetic field. MO coupling between two modes induces Zeeman splitting, leading to MO BICs and quasi-BICs with circular eigenstates for high- Q chiral responses. Furthermore, switchable C point handedness and circular dichroism are enabled by reversing the magnetic field. These findings unveil BICs and quasi-BICs with circular eigenstates and on-demand control of C points, paving the way for advanced chiral wave manipulation with enhanced light-matter interaction.",

This work investigates past and future changes in North Atlantic TC activity, focusing on interannual variability and evaluating the contributions from anthropogenic forcing. We show that interannual variability of Atlantic TC activity has already increased, evidenced by an increase in the occurrence of both extremely active and inactive TC seasons. TC-resolving general circulation models project a 36% increase in the variance of North Atlantic TC activity, measured by accumulated cyclone energy, by the middle of the 21st century. These changes are the result of increased variability in vertical wind shear and atmospheric stability, in response to enhanced Pacific-to-Atlantic interbasin sea surface temperature variations. Robust anthropogenic-forced intensification in the variability of Atlantic TC activity will continue in the future, with important implications for emergency planning and societal preparedness.",

Crucial is the molecular dynamics of the supramolecular polymers: They dictate the interaction strength with the stress-stiffening polymer and the subsequent dynamic mechanical properties of the mixed networks.

We determine that the carotenoid lutein underlies the yellow phenotype and describe microstructural feather features likely to enhance color appearance. These same features reduce predicted water shedding capacity of feathers, a potential liability in the tropics. Through genome-scale DNA sequencing of hybrids and each species in the genus, we identify BCO2 as the major gene responsible for the color polymorphism. The BCO2 gene tree and genome-wide allele frequency patterns suggest that carotenoid-pigmented collars initially arose in a third species and reached the hybrid zone through historical gene flow. Complex interplay between sexual selection and hybridization has thus shaped phenotypes of these species, where conspicuous sexual traits are key to male reproductive success.",

Here, we overcome a high degree of continuous conformational heterogeneity to determine the 2.8-Å cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the complete human TSC in complex with the lysosomal recruitment factor WD repeat domain phosphoinositide–interacting protein 3 (WIPI3). We discover a previously undetected amino-terminal TSC1 HEAT repeat dimer that clamps onto a single TSC wing and forms a phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)–binding pocket, which specifically binds monophosphorylated PIPs. These structural advances provide a model by which WIPI3 and PIP-signaling networks coordinate to recruit TSC to the lysosomal membrane to inhibit mTORC1. The high-resolution TSC structure reveals previously unrecognized mutational hotspots and uncovers crucial insights into the mechanisms of TSC dysregulation in disease.",

Because experimental and computational studies identify undercoordinated Ni step sites as most active toward CH 4 formation, we eliminate Ni step sites by atomically dispersing Ni into networked, nanoparticulate CeO 2 aerogels. The mesoporous catalyst with 2.5 atomic % Ni in CeO 2 is highly active for WGS, converting near-equilibrium levels of CO at 350°C, while no CH 4 is detected at the limit of detection (&lt;2 parts per million). In contrast, supporting low weight percentages of Ni clusters or nanoparticles on CeO 2 aerogels leads to methanation.

The proposed adhesion protocol involves controlling soft-state adhesion, maintaining a large contact area, and enhancing the elastic modulus, and the mechanical structure enhances the effectiveness of this protocol.

          "abstract": "A dynamic equilibrium between dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) is essential for striatal circuitry and motor function, as imbalances are associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Conventional theories posit that cholinergic signaling is pathologically elevated in PD as a result of increased ACh release, which contributes to motor deficits. However, using approaches to measure receptor-mediated signaling, we found that, rather than the predicted enhancement, the strength of cholinergic transmission at muscarinic M4 receptor synapses on direct pathway medium spiny neurons was decreased in dopamine-depleted mice. This adaptation was due to a reduced postsynaptic M4 receptor function, resulting from down-regulated receptors and downstream signaling. Restoring M4 transmission unexpectedly led to a partial alleviation of motor deficits and LID dyskinetic behavior, revealing an unexpected prokinetic effect in addition to the canonical antikinetic role of M4 receptors. These findings indicate that decreased M4 function differentially contributes to parkinsonian and LID pathophysiology, representing a promising target for therapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "Geological storage and mineralization of CO 2 in mafic/ultramafic reservoirs faces challenges including limited effective porosity, permeability, and rock reactivity; difficulties in using seawater for CO 2 capture; and uncontrolled carbonation. This study introduces a CO 2 capture, storage, and mineralization approach with the utilization of biobased biodegradable chelating agents and seawater. An acidic chelating agent solution is used to increase effective porosity and permeability through enhanced mineral dissolution. For instance, applying an acidic N , N -Bis(carboxymethyl)- L -glutamate solution to a porous basalt increased effective porosity by 16% and permeability by 26-fold in 120 hours. Subsequently, alkaline chelating agent–containing seawater improves CO 2 capture and storage by inhibiting mineralization, thus maintaining injectivity while providing ions for mineralization and further expanding storage space. Last, controlled mineralization is achieved by adjusting chelating agent biodegradation. Promising CO 2 storage and mineralization capacities two orders higher than current techniques, this approach reduces required reservoir volume while enhancing efficiency.",

Here, we presented a spatiotemporal m 6 A imaging system (SMIS) that can monitor the m 6 A modification and the translation of mRNAs with high specificity and sensitivity in a single live cell. SMIS showed that m 6 A-modified reporter mRNAs dynamically enriched into SGs under arsenite stress and gradually partitioned into the cytosol as SG disassembled. SMIS revealed that knockdown of YTHDF2 contributed to SG disassembly, resulting in the fast redistribution of mRNAs from SGs and rapid recovery of stalled translation. The mechanism is that YTHDF2 can regulate SG stability through the interaction with G3BP1 in m 6 A-modified RNA-dependent manner. Our results suggest a mechanism for the interplay between m 6 A modification and SG through YTHDF2 regulation.",

          "abstract": "Morphological features of organismal body plans are often highly conserved within large taxa. For example, segmentation is a shared and defining feature of all insects. Screens in Drosophila identified genes responsible for the development of body segments, including the “pair-rule” genes (PRGs), which subdivide embryos into double-segment units in a previously unexpected pre-patterning step. Here we show that the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus also uses a pair rule for embryo subdivision but Oncopeltus employs different genes for this process. We identified the gene Blimp1 as an Oncopeltus PRG based on its expression pattern, tested its function with RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9, and generated the first PR mutant in this species. Although it does not have PR function in Drosophila , like Drosophila PRGs, Blimp1 encodes a transcription factor required for embryonic viability. Thus, pair-rule subdivision of the insect body plan is more highly conserved than the factors mediating this process, suggesting a developmental constraint on this pre-patterning step.",

Here, we describe how pseudokinase serine threonine kinase 40 (STK40) facilitates T H 1/T H 17 differentiation under pathological conditions. STK40 in T cells is dispensable for immune homeostasis in resting mice. However, mice with T cell–specific deletion of STK40 exhibit attenuated symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and colitis, accompanied by diminished T H 1 and T H 17 cell differentiation. Mechanistically, STK40 facilitates K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of FOXO1/4 through promoting their interaction with E3 ligase COP1. Inhibition of FOXO4 or FOXO1, respectively, restores differentiation potential of STK40-deficient T H 1/T H 17 cells.

While considerable advancements in coherent imaging through severe multiple scattering have been recently introduced by reflection matrix processing, approaches that tackle scattering in incoherent fluorescence imaging have been limited to sparse targets, require high-resolution control of the illumination or detection wavefronts, or require a very large number of measurements. Here, we present an approach that allows the adaptation of well-established reflection matrix techniques to scattering compensation in incoherent fluorescence imaging. We experimentally demonstrate that a small number of conventional wide-field fluorescence microscope images acquired under unknown random illuminations can effectively be used to construct a virtual fluorescence-based reflection matrix. Processing this matrix by an adapted matrix-based scattering compensation algorithm allows reconstructing megapixel-scale images from &lt;150 acquired frames, without any spatial light modulators or computationally intensive processing.",

Using a state-of-the-art global climate model, we conduct freshwater hosing experiments to reexamine AMOC sensitivity and its climate impacts. The Irminger basin emerges as the most effective region for additional freshwater fluxes, causing the greatest AMOC weakening. While global temperature and precipitation responses are relatively homogeneous, subcontinental responses—especially in the northern mid-latitudes—are heterogeneous. At high latitudes, sea ice responses to freshwater fluxes and associated ice-albedo feedbacks determine temperature changes. In tropical and extratropical regions, temperature dynamics are shaped by atmospheric circulation and oceanic heat transport. Precipitation shows seasonal and regional variability due to altered surface turbulent heat flux and the southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The widespread heterogeneity in climate extremes underscores the need to monitor freshwater release regions linked to AMOC slowdown. These findings hold vital implications for understanding paleoclimate and future AMOC impacts.",

This antagonism is contact-dependent and requires a functional CIS, which is encoded by a gene cluster that is associated with toxin-immunity pairs. Cryo–focused ion beam milling and imaging by cryo–electron tomography revealed that these CISs are bound to the cytoplasmic membrane, resembling the bacterial type six secretion systems (T6SSs).

This “mechano-gradient” is used for the cell competition–driven correction of noisy morphogen gradients. Naturally and artificially generated unfit cells, producing noisy Wnt/β-catenin gradients, induce local deformation of the mechano-gradients that activate mechanosensitive calcium channels in the neighboring fit cells, which then secrete annexin A1a to kill unfit cells.

Here, we have exploited engineered stiff viscoelastic protein hydrogels to show that, contrary to current models of cell-ECM interaction, substrate viscous energy dissipation attenuates mechanosensing even when cells are exposed to higher effective rigidity. This unexpected behavior is however readily captured by a pull-and-hold model of molecular clutch–based cell mechanosensing, which also recapitulates opposite cellular response at low rigidities. Consistent with predictions of the pull-and-hold model, we find that myosin inhibition can boost mechanosensing on cells cultured on dissipative matrices.

Using metabolic glycan engineering click bioorthogonal chemistry, PD-L1 expressed on tumor cell membranes was labeled with highly active azide groups. This enables covalently binding of the clickable inhibitor with PD-L1 and subsequent PD-L1 degradation. A pH-activatable nanoparticle responding to extracellular acidic pH of tumor was subsequently used to deliver the clickable PD-L1 inhibitor into extracellular tumor microenvironment for depleting PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cell and macrophage membranes in vivo. We further demonstrated that a combination of the clickable PD-L1 inhibitor with radiotherapy (RT) eradicated the established tumor by inhibiting RT–up-regulated PD-L1 in the tumor tissue.

B cell–specific deletion of BCAP in mice leads to decreases in antigen-specific responses through defects in BCR-antigen endocytosis. BCAP is necessary to orchestrate actin reorganization around the antigen for efficient endocytosis through BCR and intracellular processing of antigens.

Nerve terminals are sites of metabolic vulnerability, and we show that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is a critical step in oxidative ATP production in hippocampal terminals. We find that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is post-translationally modified by lysine acetylation, which, in turn, modulates mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. Our data reveal that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier regulates distinct steps in neurotransmission, namely, the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic vesicle release and the efficiency of vesicle retrieval—functions that have profound implications for synaptic plasticity.

Here, we present a tip-induced nanospectroscopic electric pulse modulator to dynamically control nanoscale electron density, thereby facilitating precise measurement of nano-optoelectronic behaviors within a MoS 2 monolayer. The tip-induced electric pulse enables nanoscale modulation of electron distribution as a function of electric pulse width. We simultaneously investigate spatially altering photoluminescence quantum yield at the nanoscale region. We model the extent of electron depletion region, confirming a minimum doping region with a radius of ∼265 nanometers for a 30-nanosecond pulse width. Our approach paves the way for engineering local electron density and in situ nano-optical characterization in two-dimensional materials, enabling an in-depth understanding of doping-dependent nano-optoelectronic phenomena.",

Our findings reveal that large stacking fault energy leads to a chiral in-plane vortex pattern that was recently observed in experiments. We also found nonzero out-of-plane local dipole moments, indicating that the strong interlayer interaction might offer a promising strategy to stabilize ferroelectric order in the two-dimensional limit. The vortex pattern in the twisted BaTiO 3 bilayer supports localized electronic states with quasi-flat bands, associated with the interlayer hybridization of oxygen p z orbitals. We found that the associated bandwidth reaches a minimum at ∼19 ∘ twisting, configuring the largest magic angle in moiré systems reported so far. Further, the moiré vortex pattern bears a notable resemblance to two interpenetrating Lieb lattices and the corresponding tight-binding model provides a comprehensive description of the evolution the moiré bands with twist angle and reveals the topological nature.",

Infection of newborn mice with murine (M)CMV is an established model of neuropathology caused by congenital CMV infection, with recent work suggesting that brain pathology may be driven by immune responses. In the eye, however, CMV retinitis is thought to result from virus-driven necrosis in the absence of T cell responses. We found that MCMV infection of newborn mice recapitulates human eye disease after congenital CMV infection, including focal chorioretinitis, inflamed vasculature, and disrupted blood-retinal barriers. Moreover, infection drove extensive T cell infiltration of the retina and marked gliosis. Blocking immune responses generally, or via targeting the chemokine receptor CXCR3, did not exacerbate retinal disease but instead prevented pathology despite retinal MCMV infection. Thus, our data establish this model for studies of congenital retinal disease and show that the immune system drives pathology in the neonatal eye after MCMV infection.",

We propose a MoZnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) incorporating AEM-promoter Mo and LOM-active Zn to achieve dual activation and stabilization for efficient and durable OER. Density functional theory and chemical probe experiments confirmed dual-mechanism activation, with representative Co-Co † -Mo sites facilitating AEM and Zn-O † -Ni sites enhancing LOM, resulting in an ultralow OER overpotential (η 10 = 221 mV). The multielement interaction, high-entropy structure, and carbon network notably enhance structural stability for durable catalysis (&gt;1500 hours at 100 mA cm −2 ).

In this study, we propose a practical scheme to dynamically control local x-ray reflectivity of a perfect silicon crystal by a femtosecond optical laser and demonstrate a programmable spatial x-ray modulator. Our modulator aims for spatial manipulation of the x-ray amplitude and is shown to produce arbitrary grayscale patterns with spatial frequencies up to 25 per millimeter.

The 17R-RvD2 was produced by activated human M2-like macrophages, M1-like macrophages, and human peripheral blood monocytes. 17R-RvD2 displayed potent proresolving functions (picomolar to nanomolar). Topical application of 17R-RvD2 on mouse ear skin reduced neutrophilic infiltration (~50%). 17R-RvD2 increased M2 markers CD206 and CD163 on human monocyte–derived macrophages and enhanced efferocytosis of senescent red blood cells by M2-like macrophages (EC 50 ~ 2.6 × 10 −14 M). In addition, 17R-RvD2 activated the RvD2 receptor and was equipotent to its epimer RvD2. 17R-RvD2 also significantly increased phagocytosis of Escherichia coli by human neutrophils.

Additionally, genetic overlapping results with behavioral and disease-related phenotypes indicated shared biological mechanism between maternal education modified neurodevelopment and related behavioral traits.

It is quantitatively revealed that small-size sodium islands appear after several cycles, and with the cycles increasing, large-size dendrites in tens of micrometers gradually form until a critical sodium dendrite volume arrives where a short circuit or severe performance deterioration occurs. Furthermore, by regulating the Eu 3+ doping ratio, a record-high sodium plating/stripping cycling stability for more than 1 year (487.5 days) is achieved at 25°C.

Epitaxial HfN thick films exhibit a low-loss and high-quality Drude-like plasmon resonance in the visible spectral range. However, as the film thickness is reduced to nanoscale dimensions, Coulomb interaction among electrons increases because of electron confinement, leading to the spatial dispersion of plasma frequency. With a further decrease in thickness, electrons lose their ability to shield the incident electric field, turning the medium into a dielectric. The observed metal-insulator transition might carry some signatures of Wigner crystallization and indicates that such transdimensional, between 2D and 3D, films can serve as a promising playground to study strongly correlated electron systems.",

We show the regulation of vacuolar K + /H + exchange by cytoplasmic pH and the calmodulin-like protein CML18 in Arabidopsis. The crystal structure and physicochemical properties of CML18 indicate that this protein senses pH shifts. Interaction of CML18 with tonoplast exchangers NHX1 and NHX2 was favored at acidic pH, a physiological condition elicited by K + starvation in Arabidopsis roots, whereas excess K + produced cytoplasmic alkalinization and CML18 dissociation.

Starvation of juvenile males disrupts serotonin-dependent activation of the CREB transcription factor in a nociceptive sensory neuron, PHB. CREB acts through a cascade of transcription factors to control expression of an atypical cadherin protein, FMI-1/Flamingo/CELSR. During postembryonic development, FMI-1 promotes and maintains synaptic connectivity of PHB to a command interneuron, AVA, in both sexes, but a serotonin-dependent transcriptional regulatory cassette antagonizes FMI-1 expression in males, thereby establishing sexually dimorphic connectivity between PHB and AVA. A critical regulatory node is the CREB-target LIN-29, a Zn finger transcription factor that integrates four layers of information: sexual specificity, past experience, time and cell-type specificity.

We present revised fossil calibrations and use them in molecular clock analyses estimating the timescale of metazoan evolutionary history. Integrating across uncertainties including phylogenetic relationships, clock model, and calibration strategy, we estimate Metazoa to have originated in the early Ediacaran, Eumetazoa in the middle Ediacaran, and Bilateria in the upper Ediacaran, with many crown-phyla originating across the Ediacaran-Cambrian interval or elsewise fully within the Cambrian.

Here, we demonstrate that chiral second-harmonic generation (SHG) can be electrically induced and switched in an achiral biaxial ferroelectric 2D RPP. We observe reversible and continuous electrical switching of SHG circular dichroism and large nonlinear chiroptical activity. Polarization-resolved SHG imaging reveals that electrical poling induces the ferroelectric multidomain structure arising from the biaxial nature of the material, and the planar chirality appears.

Twelve CMIP6 models with the most realistic atmospheric climatologies over the North Atlantic and Europe agree well with reanalyses on relationships between SIC and Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation. CMIP6 model data indicate that ESAC SIC influences the SNAO with a lead time of several weeks. However, AMIP simulations do not reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation when observed sea ice is prescribed. Rossby wave analyses do though support observed ESAC SIC influences on the SNAO.

          "abstract": "The coastal circulation around Southern Greenland transports fresh, buoyant water masses from the Arctic and Greenland Ice Sheet near regions of convection, sinking, and deep-water formation in the Irminger and Labrador Seas. Here, we track the pathways and fate of these fresh water masses by initializing synthetic particles in the East Greenland Coastal Current on the Southeast Greenland shelf and running them through altimetry-derived surface currents from 1993 to 2021. We report that the majority of waters (83%) remain on the shelf around the southern tip of Greenland. Variability in the shelf-basin exchange of the remaining particles closely follows the number of tip jet wind events on seasonal and interannual timescales. The probability of a particle exiting the shelf increases almost fivefold during a tip jet event. These results indicate that the number of tip jets is a close proxy of the shelf-basin exchange around Southern Greenland.",

Targeting TET2 in CAR T cells provides therapeutic benefit; however, TET2’s role in exhausted T cell (T EX ) development is unclear. In chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, TET2 drove conversion from stem cell–like T EX progenitors toward terminally differentiated and effector (T EFF )–like T EX . TET2 also enforced a terminally differentiated state in the early bifurcation between T EFF and T EX , indicating broad roles for TET2 in acquisition of effector biology. To exploit the therapeutic potential of TET2, we developed clinically actionable TET2- targeted CAR T cells by disrupting TET2 via knock-in of a safety switch alongside CAR knock-in at the TRAC locus. TET2 -targeted CAR T cells exhibited restrained terminal exhaustion in vitro and enhanced antitumor responses in vivo. Thus, TET2 regulates fate transitions in T EX differentiation and can be targeted with a safety mechanism in CAR T cells for improved tumor control.",

We show that the toxSAS FaRel2 inspects the tRNA acceptor stem to specifically select tRNA Gly and tRNA Thr . The first, second, fourth, and fifth base pairs of the stem act as the specificity determinants. We show that the toxSASs PhRel2 and CapRel SJ46 differ in tRNA specificity from FaRel2 and rationalize this through structural modeling: While the universal 3′-CCA end slots into a highly conserved CCA recognition groove, the acceptor stem recognition region is variable across toxSAS diversity. As phages use tRNA isoacceptors to overcome tRNA-targeting defenses, we hypothesize that highly evolvable modular tRNA recognition allows for the escape of viral countermeasures through tRNA substrate specificity switching.",

Using reanalysis datasets and climate simulations, here, we show that changes in the relative amount of scattering and absorbing aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) high latitudes, manifested as long-term decreasing trends in aerosol single-scattering albedo (SSA), have played an important role in driving the widening and weakening trends of the NH Hadley circulation (HC) since the early 1980s. Decreasing SSA in the NH middle and high latitudes can notably warm the troposphere there, thus reducing the equator-to-pole temperature gradient, increasing static stability in mid-latitude regions, and leading to the widening and weakening trends of NH HC. Further analysis of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) aerosol forcing–only simulations also supports the importance of SSA trends in perturbing NH HC through the above mechanism.",

They have been used in sensor technology and optical tweezers, but controlling micron-scale particles with optical RR tweezers is challenging due to insufficient force, short working distances, and photodamage. To overcome these obstacles, an acoustofluidic RR-based tweezing method is developed to manipulate micro-sized particles that can enhance particle trapping through the resonance interaction of acoustic waves with high Q factor (&gt;3000), more than 20 times greater than traditional acoustic transducers. Particles can be precisely manipulated within the RR by adjusting the signal phase, with trapping amplified by enlarging the connected waveguide. Rapid particle mixing is achieved when particles are placed between the waveguide and RR. The signal path is strengthened by strategically positioning the RR in a two-dimensional plane. Acoustofluidic RR tweezers have immense potential for advancing applications in biosensing, mechanobiology, lab-on-a-chip, and cell-cell communication research.",

A key question is whether the disease is caused by gain-of-function effects on INF2 or loss of function (haploinsufficiency). Despite established roles in multiple cellular processes, neither INF2 knockout mice nor mice with a disease-associated point mutation display an evident kidney or neurologic phenotype. Here, we compared responses to puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)–induced kidney injury between INF2 R218Q and INF2 knockout mice. R218Q INF2 mice are susceptible to glomerular disease, in contrast to INF2 knockout mice. Colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation analyses, and cellular actin measurements showed that INF2 R218Q confers a gain-of-function effect on the actin cytoskeleton. RNA expression analysis showed that adhesion and mitochondria-related pathways were enriched in the PAN-treated R218Q mice. Both podocytes from INF2 R218Q mice and human kidney organoids with an INF2 mutation (S186P) recapitulate adhesion and mitochondrial phenotypes. Thus, gain-of-function mechanisms drive INF2-related FSGS and explain this disease’s autosomal dominant inheritance.",

Unlike conventional electromechanical sensors, NIR sensors precisely capture vibrational frequencies propagated from the actuators without needing ultraclose contact, enhancing wearing comfort. Demonstrated examples include ANIRPs for comprehensively moduli mapping of artificial tissues with varied mechanical properties emulating tumorous fibrosis. On-body validation of the ANIRP across skin locations confirms its practical utility for clinical monitoring of epidermal mechanics, promising considerable advancements in real-time, noninvasive skin diagnostics and continuous health monitoring.",

Here, we build DNA nanopores with programmable diameters and nup arrangements to model the constricted and dilated NPCs. We find that Nup62 proteins form a dynamic cross-channel barrier impermeable to hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsids when grafted inside 60-nm-wide nanopores but not in 79-nm pores, where Nup62 cluster locally. Furthermore, importin-β1 substantially changes the dynamics of Nup62 assemblies and facilitates the passage of HBV capsids through the 60-nm NPC mimics containing Nup62 and Nup153. Our study shows that transport channel width is critical to the permeability of nup barriers and underscores NTRs’ role in dynamically remodeling nup assemblies and mediating the nuclear entry of viruses.",

Understanding viral adaptions in humans is difficult in organs such as the heart, where primary infected material is not routinely collected. In search of asymptomatic infections with accompanying host adaptions, we mined for cardio-pathogenic viruses in the unaligned reads of nearly 1000 human hearts profiled by RNA sequencing. Among virus-positive cases (~20%), we identified three robust adaptions in the host transcriptome related to inflammatory nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling and posttranscriptional regulation by the p38-MK2 pathway. The adaptions are not determined by the infecting virus, and they recur in infections of human or animal hearts and cultured cardiomyocytes. Adaptions switch states when NF-κB or p38-MK2 is perturbed in cells engineered for chronic infection by the cardio-pathogenic virus, coxsackievirus B3. Stratifying viral responses into reversible adaptions adds a targetable systems-level simplification for infections of the heart and perhaps other organs.",

The widespread areas of application could even be increased if resolution was improved, which the famous Abbe diffraction limit now restrains. Super-resolution techniques can break the diffraction limit but most rely on fluorescent labeling. This makes them incompatible with (sub)femtosecond temporal resolution and applications that demand the absence of labeling. Here, we introduce harmonic deactivation microscopy (HADES) for breaking the diffraction limit in nonfluorescent samples. By controlling the harmonic generation process on the quantum level with a second donut-shaped pulse, we confine the third-harmonic generation to three times below the original focus size of a scanning microscope. We demonstrate that resolution improvement by deactivation is more efficient for higher harmonic orders and only limited by the maximum applicable deactivation-pulse fluence.
