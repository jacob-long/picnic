          "abstract": "Honeybees are important crop pollinators, but they increasingly face pollen starvation as a result of agricultural intensification and climate change 1 . Frequent flowering dearth periods and high-density rearing conditions weaken colonies, which often leads to their demise 2 . Beekeepers provide colonies with pollen substitutes, but these feeds do not sustain brood production because they lack essential sterols found in pollen 3,4 . Here we describe a technological advance in honeybee nutrition with wide-reaching impacts on global food security. We first measured the quantity and proportion of sterols present in honeybee tissues. Using this information, we genetically engineered a strain of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce a mixture of essential sterols for bees and incorporated this yeast strain into an otherwise nutritionally complete diet. Colonies exclusively fed with this diet reared brood for significantly longer than those fed diets without suitable sterols. The use of this method to incorporate sterol supplements into pollen substitutes will enable honeybee colonies to produce brood in the absence of floral pollen. Optimized diets created using this yeast strain could also reduce competition between bee species for access to natural floral resources and stem the decline in wild bee populations.",

          "abstract": "Nuclear fusion research for energy applications aims to create conditions that release more energy than required to initiate the fusion process1. To generate meaningful amounts of energy, fuels such as deuterium need to be spatially confined to increase the collision probability of particles2,3,4. We therefore set out to investigate whether electrochemically loading a metal lattice with deuterium fuel could increase the probability of nuclear fusion events. Here we report a benchtop fusion reactor that enabled us to bombard a palladium metal target with deuterium ions. These deuterium ions undergo deuterium–deuterium fusion reactions within the palladium metal. We showed that the in situ electrochemical loading of deuterium into the palladium target resulted in a 15(2)% increase in deuterium–deuterium fusion rates. This experiment shows how the electrochemical loading of a metal target at the electronvolt energy scale can affect nuclear reactions at the megaelectronvolt energy scale.",

          "abstract": "Doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors1,2. To describe the competition between tunnelling t of hole dopants and AFM spin interactions J, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic t–J model3 and the direct analogue quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought4,5. Here we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) tunnellings t′ (refs. 6,7,8,9,10) and hard-core bosonic holes11 using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We use coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes12, to implement a tunable bosonic t–J–V model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for |t/J| ≪ 1 and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnellings t′ and perturbative pair tunnelling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of t. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models13 to a larger class of t–J and spin-1 models14,15.",

          "abstract": "Perineural invasion (PNI) is a well-established factor of poor prognosis in multiple cancer types1, yet its mechanism remains unclear. Here we provide clinical and mechanistic insights into the role of PNI and cancer-induced nerve injury (CINI) in resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study demonstrates that PNI and CINI of tumour-associated nerves are associated with poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy among patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and gastric cancer. Electron microscopy and electrical conduction analyses reveal that cancer cells degrade the nerve fibre myelin sheets. The injured neurons respond by autonomously initiating IL-6- and type I interferon-mediated inflammation to promote nerve healing and regeneration. As the tumour grows, the CINI burden increases, and its associated inflammation becomes chronic and skews the general immune tone within the tumour microenvironment into a suppressive and exhaustive state. The CINI-driven anti-PD-1 resistance can be reversed by targeting multiple steps in the CINI signalling process: denervating the tumour, conditional knockout of the transcription factor mediating the injury signal within neurons (Atf3), knockout of interferon-α receptor signalling (Ifnar1−/−) or by combining anti-PD-1 and anti-IL-6-receptor blockade. Our findings demonstrate the direct immunoregulatory roles of CINI and its therapeutic potential.",

          "abstract": "Polyamines are regulatory metabolites with key roles in transcription, translation, cell signalling and autophagy 1 . They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders, including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration, and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels 2 . Polyamines have been linked to pain, showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models 3 . However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. Here, undertaking a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK Biobank (UKB), we found a significant association between pain intensity and variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system, Slc45a4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron subtypes within the dorsal root ganglion, including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, and the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals a regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat- and algogen-induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of C-polymodal nociceptors. Our findings therefore establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol-use disorder and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are major causes of death and liver transplantation1. The gut–liver axis has a crucial yet poorly understood role in ALD pathogenesis, which depends on microbial translocation. Intestinal goblet cells (GCs) educate the immune system by forming GC-associated antigen passages (GAPs) on activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 (mAChR4, also known as M4), enabling sampling of luminal antigens by lamina propria antigen-presenting cells. Here we show that chronic alcohol use in humans and mice downregulates small intestinal mAChR4 and reduces GAP formation, disrupting antimicrobial immunity. This is reversed on activation of intestinal IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST, also known as glycoprotein 130; gp130), which restores mAChR4 expression and GAP formation, enabling induction of downstream type-3 innate lymphoid cell-derived IL-22 and antimicrobial REG3 proteins. This blunts translocation of enteric bacteria to the liver, thereby conferring ALD resistance. GAP induction by GC-specific mAChR4 activation was essential and sufficient for prevention of ethanol-induced steatohepatitis. These results lay the foundation for a therapeutic approach using mAChR4 or IL6ST agonists to promote GAP formation and prevent ALD by inhibiting microbial translocation.",

          "abstract": "The electronic quality of two-dimensional systems is crucial when exploring quantum transport phenomena. In semiconductor heterostructures, decades of optimization have yielded record-quality two-dimensional gases with transport and quantum mobilities reaching close to 10 8 and 10 6 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , respectively 1–10 . Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving, it remains comparatively lower 11–17 . Here we report a transformative improvement in the electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its immediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 10 7 cm −2 and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum mobilities reach 10 7 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , surpassing those in the highest-quality semiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport mobilities match their record 9,10 . This quality enables Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaux below 5 mT. Although proximity screening predictably suppresses electron–electron interactions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their energy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3–5 compared with unscreened devices, demonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm remain robust. Our results offer a reliable route to improving electronic quality in graphene and other two-dimensional systems, which should facilitate the exploration of new physics previously obscured by disorder.",

          "abstract": "Tight control of intracellular Ca 2+ levels is fundamental as they are used to control numerous signal transduction pathways 1 . Plasma membrane Ca 2+ -ATPases (PMCAs) have a crucial role in this process by extruding Ca 2+ against a steep concentration gradient from the cytosol to the extracellular space 2 . Although new details of PMCA biology are constantly being uncovered, the structural basis of the most distinguishing features of these pumps, namely, transport rates in the kilohertz range and regulation of activity by the plasma membrane phospholipid PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , has so far remained elusive. Here we present the structures of mouse PMCA2 in the presence and absence of its accessory subunit neuroplastin in eight different stages of its transport cycle. Combined with whole-cell recordings that accurately track PMCA-mediated Ca 2+ extrusion in intact cells, these structures enable us to establish the first comprehensive transport model for a PMCA, reveal the role of disease-causing mutations and uncover the structural underpinnings of regulatory PMCA–phospholipid interaction. The transport cycle-dependent dynamics of PtdIns(4,5)P 2 are fundamental for its role as a ‘latch’ promoting the fast release of Ca 2+ and opening a passageway for counter-ions. These actions are required for maintaining the ultra-fast transport cycle. Moreover, we identify the PtdIns(4,5)P 2 -binding site as an unanticipated target for drug-mediated manipulation of intracellular Ca 2+ levels. Our work provides detailed structural insights into the uniquely fast operation of native PMCA-type Ca 2+ pumps and its control by membrane lipids and drugs.",

          "abstract": "Small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) contain near-universal loss-of-function mutations in RB1 and TP53, compromising the G1–S checkpoint and leading to dysregulated E2F activity1. Other cancers similarly disrupt the G1–S checkpoint through loss of CDKN2A or amplification of cyclin D or cyclin E, also resulting in excessive E2F activity2,3. Although E2F activation is essential for cell cycle progression, hyperactivation promotes apoptosis4,5,6,7,8,9, presenting a therapeutic vulnerability. Cyclin proteins use a conserved hydrophobic patch to bind to substrates bearing short linear RxL motifs10,11,12,13. Cyclin A represses E2F through an RxL-dependent interaction10,14, which, when disrupted, hyperactivates E2F15. However, this substrate interface has remained difficult to target. Here we developed cell-permeable, orally bioavailable macrocyclic peptides that inhibit RxL-mediated interactions of cyclins with their substrates. Dual inhibitors of cyclin A and cyclin B RxL motifs (cyclin A/Bi) selectively kill SCLC cells and other cancer cells with high E2F activity. Genetic screens revealed that cyclin A/Bi induces apoptosis through cyclin B- and CDK2-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint activation. Mechanistically, cyclin A/Bi hyperactivates E2F and cyclin B by blocking cyclin A–E2F and cyclin B–MYT1 RxL interactions. Notably, cyclin A/Bi promoted the formation of neomorphic cyclin B–CDK2 complexes, which drive spindle assembly checkpoint activation and mitotic cell death. Finally, orally administered cyclin A/Bi showed robust anti-tumour activity in chemotherapy-resistant SCLC patient-derived xenografts. These findings reveal gain-of-function mechanisms through which cyclin A/Bi triggers apoptosis and support their development for E2F-driven cancers.",

They play essential parts in molecular dynamics simulations, which can act as a computational microscope for chemical processes 4 .

Here we introduce an experimental method that assigns partial charges based on crystal structure determination through electron diffraction, applicable to any crystalline compound. Seamlessly integrated into standard electron crystallography workflows, this approach requires no specialized software or advanced expertise. Furthermore, it is not limited to specific classes of compounds. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by its application to a wide array of compounds, including the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, the amino acids histidine and tyrosine, and the inorganic zeolite ZSM-5.

Current N2O sources outpace N2O sinks, emphasizing the need for comprehensive understanding of processes that consume N2O. Microbes that express the enzyme N2O reductase (N2OR) convert N2O to climate change-neutral dinitrogen (N2). Known N2ORs belong to the canonical clade I and clade II NosZ reductases and are considered key enzymes for N2O reduction2,3,4. Here we report a previously unrecognized protein family with a role in N2O reduction, clade III lactonase-type N2OR (L-N2OR), which diverges in sequence from canonical NosZ but conserves three-dimensional protein structural features. Integrated physiological, metagenomic, proteomic and structural modelling studies demonstrate that L-N2ORs catalyse N2O reduction. L-N2OR genes occur in several phyla, predominantly in uncultured taxa with broad geographic distribution. Our findings expand the known diversity of N2ORs and implicate previously unrecognized taxa (for example, Nitrospinota) in N2O consumption. The expansion of N2OR diversity and the identification of a novel type of catalyst for N2O reduction advances the understanding of N2O sinks, has implications for greenhouse gas emission and climate change modelling, and expands opportunities for innovative biotechnologies aimed at curbing N2O emissions5,6.",

Here we identify and characterize the N-acyl-cyclolysine (ACL) system—a cell-density-dependent chemical signalling system specific to and widespread in the phylum Bacteroidota (formerly Bacteroidetes)—and show that it regulates the expression of co-localized operons encoding diverse secreted molecules. Using genetic and biochemical analyses, combined with structural studies of a key biosynthetic enzyme, AclA, we elucidate the molecular structure of various ACLs and their complete biosynthetic pathway involving l-lysine acylation and ATP-dependent cyclization. Furthermore, we find that secreted ACLs are sensed by a dedicated transcription factor, AclR, resulting in the expression of associated operons and the autoinduction of ACL biosynthesis. Moreover, we show that different Bacteroidota strains produce structurally diverse ACLs and encode transcription factors with varying ligand specificities. Finally, we find that the acl circuit is widely distributed and transcribed in human gut and oral microbiome samples, with clear evidence for an active role in regulating associated operons under host colonization conditions. Understanding the function of the ACL system in different contexts has the potential to reveal details about the biology, ecology and chemistry of the Bacteroidota and how members of this phylum interact with their environments and hosts.",

          "abstract": "Living cells depend on an intricate network of chemical reactions catalysed by enzymes, which sometimes make mistakes that lead to their inactivation. Here we report a metabolite-based mechanism for preserving enzyme function in an unfavourable environment. We found that the enzyme TGDS produces UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose, a mimic of the reaction intermediate of the enzyme UXS1, which regenerates the essential cofactor NAD + within the catalytic pocket of UXS1 by completing its catalytic cycle. Thus, the production of an ‘enzyme-rescue metabolite’ by TGDS represents a mechanism for maintaining the activity of an enzyme in a subcellular compartment where NAD + is scarce. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that the inability to produce sufficient amounts of this enzyme-rescue metabolite leads to the inactivation of UXS1, impairing the synthesis of specific glycans that are crucial for skeletal development. This provides an explanation for the development of the hereditary skeletal disorder Catel–Manzke syndrome in individuals with TGDS deficiency. Defects in similar protective layers might contribute to metabolic changes in other diseases that cannot be explained with common concepts in metabolic biochemistry.",

          "abstract": "Human-caused climate change worsens with every increment of additional warming, although some impacts can develop abruptly. The potential for abrupt changes is far less understood in the Antarctic compared with the Arctic, but evidence is emerging for rapid, interacting and sometimes self-perpetuating changes in the Antarctic environment. A regime shift has reduced Antarctic sea-ice extent far below its natural variability of past centuries, and in some respects is more abrupt, non-linear and potentially irreversible than Arctic sea-ice loss. A marked slowdown in Antarctic Overturning Circulation is expected to intensify this century and may be faster than the anticipated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation slowdown. The tipping point for unstoppable ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be exceeded even under best-case CO2 emission reduction pathways, potentially initiating global tipping cascades. Regime shifts are occurring in Antarctic and Southern Ocean biological systems through habitat transformation or exceedance of physiological thresholds, and compounding breeding failures are increasing extinction risk. Amplifying feedbacks are common between these abrupt changes in the Antarctic environment, and stabilizing Earth’s climate with minimal overshoot of 1.5 °C will be imperative alongside global adaptation measures to minimise and prepare for the far-reaching impacts of Antarctic and Southern Ocean abrupt changes.",

However, the mechanisms that regulate the stability of somatic cell fates remain unclear. Here, we use the somatic plasticity of thymic epithelial cells, which facilitates the selection of a self-discriminating T cell repertoire3, as a physiological model system to show that fluctuations in background chromatin accessibility in nucleosome-dense regions are amplified during thymic epithelial maturation for the ectopic expression of genes restricted to other specialized cell types. This chromatin destabilization was not dependent on AIRE-induced transcription but was preceded by repression of the tumour suppressor p53. Augmenting p53 activity indirectly stabilized chromatin, inhibited ectopic transcription, limited cellular plasticity and caused multi-organ autoimmunity. Genomic regions with heightened chromatin accessibility noise were selectively enriched for nucleosome-destabilizing polymeric AT tracts and were associated with elevated baseline DNA damage and transcriptional initiation. Taken together, our findings define molecular levers that modulate cell fate integrity and are used by thymic epithelial cells for immunological tolerance.",

          "abstract": "Stars are initially powered by the fusion of hydrogen to helium. These ashes serve as fuel in a series of stages1,2,3, transforming massive stars into a structure of shells. These are composed of natal hydrogen on the outside and consecutively heavier compositions inside, predicted to be dominated by He, C/O, O/Ne/Mg and O/Si/S (refs. 4,5). Silicon and sulfur are fused into iron, leading to the collapse of the core and either a supernova explosion or the formation of a black hole6,7,8,9. Stripped stars, in which the outer hydrogen layer has been removed and the internal He-rich or even the C/O layer below it is exposed10, provide evidence for this shell structure and the cosmic element production mechanism it reflects. The supernova types that arise from stripped stars embedded in shells of circumstellar material (CSM) confirm this scenario11,12,13,14,15. However, direct evidence for the most interior shells, which are responsible for producing elements heavier than oxygen, is lacking. Here we report the discovery of the supernova (SN) 2021yfj resulting from a star stripped to its O/Si/S-rich layer. We directly observe a thick, massive Si/S-rich shell, expelled by the progenitor shortly before the supernova explosion. Exposing such an inner stellar layer is theoretically challenging and probably requires a rarely observed mass-loss mechanism. This rare supernova event reveals advanced stages of stellar evolution, forming heavier elements, including silicon, sulfur and argon, than those detected on the surface of any known class of massive stars.",

          "abstract": "Animals require undisturbed periods of rest during which they undergo recuperative processes1. However, it is unclear how brain states arise that are able to dissociate an animal from its external world, enabling quiescent behaviours, while retaining vigilance to salient sensory cues2. Here we describe a neural mechanism in Drosophila that creates neural filters that engender a brain state that enables quiescent behaviour by generating coherent slow-wave activity (SWA)3 between sleep-need4 (R5)- and locomotion-promoting neural networks5. The coherence of SWA is subject to circadian and homeostatic control and can be modulated by sensory experience. Mimicry of coherent SWA reveals that R5 oscillations reduce responsiveness to visual stimuli by rhythmically associating neural activity of locomotion-promoting cells, effectively overruling their output. These networks can regulate behavioural responsiveness by providing antagonistic inputs to downstream head-direction cells6,7. Thus, coherent oscillations provide the mechanistic basis for a neural filter by temporally associating opposing signals, resulting in reduced functional connectivity between locomotion-gating and navigational networks. We propose that the temporal pattern of SWA provides the structure to create a ‘breakable’ filter, permitting the animal to enter a quiescent state, while providing the architecture for strong or salient stimuli to ‘break’ the neural interaction, consequently allowing the animal to react.",

          "abstract": "B-1 cells are innate-like immune cells abundant in serosal cavities with antibodies enriched in bacterial recognition, yet their existence in humans has been controversial 1–3 . The CD5 + B-1a subset expresses anti-inflammatory molecules including IL-10, PDL1 and CTLA4 and can be immunoregulatory 4–6 . Unlike conventional B cells that are continuously replenished, B-1a cells are produced early in life and maintained through self-renewal 7 . Here we show that the transcription factors TCF1 and LEF1 are critical regulators of B-1a cells. LEF1 expression is highest in fetal and bone marrow B-1 progenitors, whereas the levels of TCF1 are higher in splenic and peritoneal B-1 cells than in B-1 progenitors. TCF1–LEF1 double deficient mice have reduced B-1a cells and defective B-1a cell maintenance. These transcription factors promote MYC-dependent metabolic pathways and induce a stem-like population upon activation, partly via IL-10 production. In the absence of TCF1 and LEF1, B-1 cells proliferate excessively and acquire an exhausted phenotype with reduced IL-10 and PDL1 expression. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of B-1 cells lacking TCF1 and LEF1 fails to suppress brain inflammation. These transcription factors are also expressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B cells and in a B-1-like population that is abundant in pleural fluid and circulation of some patients with pleural infection. Our findings define a TCF1–LEF1-driven transcriptional program that integrates stemness and regulatory function in B-1a cells.",

          "abstract": "Conditional deletion of Caspase-8 in epidermal keratinocytes (Casp8E-KO) causes necroptosis-driven lethal dermatitis1-7. Here, we discover that Casp8 loss leads to accumulation of cytosolic DNA responsible for the activation of a cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon (IFN) gene (STING)-mediated transcriptional program. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicate that STING upregulates both Z-DNA binding protein-1 (ZBP1), and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Combined Casp8-deficiency- and STING-activation-driven accumulation of Z-nuclei acids, activates ZBP1 and triggers formation of a ZBP1–RIPK1–RIPK3 complex independently of FADD-RIPK1-RIPK3 complex enabling necroptosis execution. Genetically, we reveal a functional overlap between STING and ZBP1 as drivers of lethal dermatitis independently of TNFR1, uncovering a novel aetiology of necroptotic inflammation. Since gain-of-function mutations in human STING cause STING-Associated Vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI), we assessed the role of STING-induced necroptosis in SAVI’s aetiology. Chronic activation of STING in patients orchestrates a necroptotic transcriptional program which is confirmed in the N153S-SAVI preclinical mouse model where immune cell–driven pathology and lethality are remarkably rescued by RIPK3 co-deletion. These findings establish STING-driven ZBP1-mediated necroptosis as a central pathogenic mechanism in both Casp8-deficient inflammation and SAVI and suggest that targeting the ZBP1-RIPK3-MLKL axis holds therapeutic potential for interferonopathies characterised by excessive necroptosis.",

How lipid species are selectively sorted between organelles to maintain specific membrane identities is largely unclear, owing to the difficulty of imaging lipid transport in cells 3 . Here we measured the retrograde transport and metabolism of individual lipid species in mammalian cells using time-resolved fluorescence imaging of bifunctional lipid probes in combination with ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry and mathematical modelling. Quantification of lipid flux between organelles revealed that directional, non-vesicular lipid transport is responsible for fast, species-selective lipid sorting, in contrast to the slow, unspecific vesicular membrane trafficking. Using genetic perturbations, we found that coupling between energy-dependent lipid flipping and non-vesicular transport is a mechanism for directional lipid transport. Comparison of metabolic conversion and transport rates showed that non-vesicular transport dominates the organelle distribution of lipids, while species-specific phospholipid metabolism controls neutral lipid accumulation. Our results provide the first quantitative map of retrograde lipid flux in cells 4 . We anticipate that our pipeline for mapping of lipid flux through physical and chemical space in cells will boost our understanding of lipids in cell biology and disease.",

Mechanistically, axonal injury promotes gliomagenesis by triggering Wallerian degeneration, a targetable active programme of axonal death 3 , which we show increases neuroinflammation and tumour proliferation. Inactivation of SARM1, the key enzyme activated in response to injury that mediates Wallerian degeneration 4 , was sufficient to break this tumour-promoting feedforward loop, leading to the development of less advanced terminal tumours and prolonged survival in mice. Thus, targeting the tumour-induced injury microenvironment may supress progression from latent to advanced disease, thereby providing a potential strategy for GBM interception and control.",

Although carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) are widely used reductants, the mechanisms by which they work are often presumed to be similar, both involving lattice oxygen removal6,7,8,9. However, because of growing interest in replacing CO with H2 to lower CO2 emissions, distinguishing gas-specific reduction pathways is critical. Yet, capturing these atomic-scale processes under reactive gas and high-temperature conditions remains challenging. Here we use environmental transmission electron microscopy, which is capable of real-time, atomic-resolution imaging of gas–solid redox reactions10,11,12,13,14,15,16, to directly visualize the gas-dependent oxide reduction dynamics in NiO. We show that CO drives surface nucleation and the growth of metallic Ni islands, leading to self-limiting surface metallization. Conversely, H2 activates a coupled surface-to-bulk transformation, where protons from dissociated H2 infiltrate the oxide lattice to promote the inward migration of surface-generated oxygen vacancies and enabling bulk metallization. By contrast, oxygen vacancies formed by CO remain confined near the surface, where they rapidly form a metallic Ni layer that inhibits further reduction. These results reveal distinct atomistic pathways for CO and H2 and provide insights that may guide metallurgical processes and catalyst design.",

Amino acids activate mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases, which are regulated by GATOR, a supercomplex consisting of GATOR1, KICSTOR and the nutrient-sensing hub GATOR2 (refs. 6,7,8,9). GATOR2 forms an octagonal cage, with its distinct WD40 domain β-propellers interacting with GATOR1 and the leucine sensors Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 (SESN1 and SESN2) and the arginine sensor CASTOR1 (ref. 10). The mechanisms through which these sensors regulate GATOR2 and how they detach from it upon binding their cognate amino acids remain unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of a stabilized GATOR2 bound to either Sestrin2 or CASTOR1. The sensors occupy distinct and non-overlapping binding sites, disruption of which selectively impairs the ability of mTORC1 to sense individual amino acids. We also resolved the apo (leucine-free) structure of Sestrin2 and characterized the amino acid-induced structural rearrangements within Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 that trigger their dissociation from GATOR2. Binding of either sensor restricts the dynamic WDR24 β-propeller of GATOR2, a domain essential for nutrient-dependent mTORC1 activation. These findings reveal the allosteric mechanisms that convey amino acid sufficiency to GATOR2 and the ensuing structural changes that lead to mTORC1 activation.",

          "abstract": "Forget all the nonsense you heard about time travel. You can’t go back and kill your grandfather. The past has already happened. Everything is linked, each event underpins the next, everything is determined; you can’t do anything to break those links. Try, and you enter a forbidden state. Your body won’t obey your will.\n\nAttempting to hurt locals usually puts you in a forbidden state but not always. I guess some people just have no role in history. Doesn’t work both ways, though. Chrononauts aren’t part of the past. Locals can kill us without affecting anything. The people I’m observing are tolerant of strangers and travellers, rarely killing them out of hand the way some communities do, but there are exceptions. So, I’m well disguised.\n\nMy camera and recording gear are invisible even to a close examination. My poorly tanned leather clothing reeks so badly I was thrown off public transport on my way to get to the transmission station and had to ride in a taxi with the windows open, paying double fare, to get to my slot in time. After I applied a last-minute dash of odorant, the technicians at the transmission station were breathing through cupped hands. At least it stopped them bitching about payment. They don’t like us travelling on credit. If we get killed, they might not get paid.\n\nI’m stiff and cold from a night on the ground under a thin blanket, but looking forward to my third and final day down Arrow. I’ve got easily enough video to fill my contract for a half-hour feature, which means I can pay off the transmission cost and cover my rent for another two months. With a bit more material, I can make a freelance piece and market it independently, showcasing my skills and giving me a chance to get off the Arrow and into production.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nI drape my shoulder bag and set off for the morning market, a collection of flat boulders and improvised tables on the edge of a cluster of low, single-room huts made of bush wood and clay. Even after two days down Arrow, the smells of rancid fat and rotten food in the market are overwhelming. A nearby open latrine adds to the mix.\n\nThe footing is treacherous. There are holes and mounds of earth everywhere. Why haven’t the locals eaten these burrowing rodents? Superstition? Religion? I take establishing shots showing the burrows’ proximity to structures and close-ups of the holes. Academics pay for this sort of stuff, especially if it disproves someone else’s long-held theory.\n\nInto the market, and I pan the hidden camera to take in filthy dry-stone walls and clouds of flies swarming around raw meat. I’ve been living on food bars and water surreptitiously micro filtered in what looks like a leather water pouch.\n\nA rat scampers by. Someone throws a rock at it. All good stuff. The yuck factor sells.\n\nI turn the corner and come face-to-face with a couple. The woman steps behind the man, as is the custom, and gawks at me. The man could be my down-on-his-luck twin. His worn leather is greasy, his arms thin, his cheeks sunken and hollow but his skin is the same light brown as mine. The face framed in roughly chopped hair is mine, too. It’s like looking into a mirror but we are thousands of years down Arrow from mirrors.\n\nIt’s pure cinematic gold. This could make a cameo. But how will I talk to him? In my role as a traveller, I know just enough basic pidgin to get by. An interview is beyond me.\n\n“Greetings,” I say and extend both hands at waist height and open in the ‘no weapons’ gesture. He stares at my face without even glancing at my hands. He looks as shocked as if I were lunging at him and takes a step backwards. One foot goes into a burrow, the other comes down on a loose round stone and he goes over backwards, arms flailing, incredulous eyes still locked on my face. His head hits a protruding rock with a sound like a pumpkin dropped on concrete.\n\nHis body convulses for seconds then goes still. He stops breathing.\n\nSo much for my cameo. People are rushing in from all sides, encircling me. Time to leave. The woman glances down at the corpse then steps forward and speaks softly. I pick out the words ‘mine’ and ‘you’. Does she want me to be his replacement? No, thank you. I go to press the button for emergency recall. They’ll see me vanish, of course, but that story will merge with all their other stories of ghosts and miracles. Nothing will resonate down history to the future. It’s been done dozens of times.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr wants a study about vaccines retracted.Credit: Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Sipa US via Alamy\n\nUS health secretary and vaccine sceptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr has called for the retraction of a Danish study that found no link between aluminium in vaccines and chronic diseases in children — a rare move for a US public official. Aluminium has been used for almost a century to enhance the immune system’s response to some vaccines. But some people claim the ingredient is linked to rising rates of childhood disorders such as autism.\n\nPublic-health officials in Kennedy’s position rarely request that studies be retracted, says Ivan Oransky, a specialist in academic publishing and co-founder of the media organization Retraction Watch. Through this request, “Secretary Kennedy has demonstrated that he wants the scientific literature to bend to his will”, says Oransky.\n\nThe study1 in question, published in Annals of Internal Medicine in July, is one of the largest of its kind, looking at 1.2 million children born over more than two decades in Denmark. The authors reported that no significant risk of developing autoimmune, allergic or neurodevelopmental disorders was associated with exposure to aluminium compounds in vaccines.\n\nIn an opinion piece published on TrialSite News on 1 August, Kennedy called into question the study’s methodology, analysis and results. Since his appointment as head of the US Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has bypassed normal scientific review processes to change vaccine recommendations and terminated grants for projects on mRNA vaccines.\n\nAnnals of Internal Medicine says it stands by the study and has no plans to retract it. Christine Laine, editor in chief for the journal, wrote in a comment on the study’s web page on 11 August that “retraction is warranted only when serious errors invalidate findings or there is documented scientific misconduct, neither of which occurred here”.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy’s article spoke for itself, and that the department did not have any further comment in response to Nature’s questions about Kennedy's request for a retraction.\n\nWidely used\n\nAluminium, in the form of salts, such as potassium aluminium sulfate, have been administered in vaccines — for diseases ranging from whooping cough to pneumonia — to millions of people worldwide, and the vaccines have been widely studied for safety issues2,3. Gary Grohmann, an independent virologist in Canberra, says there is no evidence of significant side effects caused by the small amount of aluminium in vaccines.\n\nBut in 2011, a study4 published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry claimed to show a causal relationship between rising autism diagnoses in children and increased exposure to aluminium-containing vaccines. In 2012, the World Health Organization’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said the study and another by the same authors were “seriously flawed” because they used inappropriate study designs, incorrect assumptions and questionable data.\n\nSince then, Grohmann says, the claim that aluminium in vaccines causes autism has been debunked “again and again”. “If there was a mechanism of action where a particular vaccine caused autism, we’d see it in 80, 90, 100% of people receiving the vaccine, and we don’t,” he says. Any association between autism and vaccines is probably a coincidence of timing, he says. “In other words, vaccines might be given at the age of two, and autism genetically might also kick in at the age of two,” he adds.\n\nAllen Cheng, an epidemiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, says the Danish study adds to the evidence that vaccines containing aluminium are safe.\n\nKennedy’s concerns\n\nAmong Kennedy’s criticisms of the Danish study are that the analysis excluded children who had died before the age of two. According to Kennedy, this means that the children “most likely to reveal injuries” associated with aluminum exposure were excluded.\n\nKennedy also criticized the fact that the authors did not compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children to determine whether any aluminium exposure causes harm, even though they had some data on unvaccinated children.\n\nOther critiques posted on the journal website overlapped with Kennedy’s criticisms, says Anders Hviid, the senior author and an epidemiologist at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark’s public-health agency. Hviid says he and his colleagues addressed the critiques “one by one”. He also published a rebuttal of Kennedy’s article on TrialSite News on 3 August.",

          "title": "Peer reviewers more likely to approve articles that cite their own work",
          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Reviewers are more likely to approve a manuscript if their own work is cited in subsequent versions than are reviewers who are not cited, according to an analysis of 18,400 articles from four open-access publications. The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed, was posted online as a preprint earlier this month1.\n\nThe study was inspired by anecdotes from authors who cited articles only because reviewers asked them to, says study author Adrian Barnett, who researches peer review and meta-research at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. Sometimes, these requests are fine, he says. But if reviewers ask for too many citations or the reason to cite their work is not justified, the peer-review process can become transactional, says Barnett. Citations increase a researcher’s h-index, a metric reflecting the impact of their publications.\n\nThese are the most-cited research papers of all time\n\nMaking unnecessary or unjustified requests for citations, sometimes called coercive citation, is generally considered poor practice. Balazs Aczel, a psychologist who studies metascience at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, says that the latest work isn’t the first to investigate reviewers asking for citations, but that the number of peer reviews included and level of analysis is novel. A barrier to studying the practice is a lack of data sharing from publishers, he says.\n\nApprovals, rejections and reservations\n\nThe preprint considered articles from four publishing platforms — F1000Research, Wellcome Open Research, Gates Open Research and Open Research Europe — that make all versions of their articles, as well as reviewer comments, publicly available. The publishers ask reviewers to approve articles, reject them or approve them with reservations. Reviewers are also asked to explain why when they ask authors to cite their own work. Of 37,000 reviews — at least two people reviewed each article — 54% of reviewers approved articles with no changes and rejected 8%. Almost 5,000 reviewed articles cited a reviewer and roughly 2,300 reviews requested a citation from a reviewer.\n\nThe analysis found that reviewers who were cited were more likely to approve the article after the first review than were reviewers who were not cited.\n\nBut reviewers who suggested that their own research be cited were about half as likely to approve the article than reject it or express reservations. In more than 400 reviews in which the reviewer was not cited in version 1 of the article and requested a citation in their review, 92% of reviewers who were cited in version 2 recommended approval compared with 76% for reviewers who were not cited.\n\nWhen a reviewer rejects a paper, they and the authors know that the reviewer is probably going to evaluate any revised versions of the article, says Barnett, so authors might opt for the path of least resistance and include the citation to get their paper accepted.\n\nReviewer comments\n\nBarnett also analysed 2,700 reviewer comments and identified the 100 most frequently used words. He found that reviewers who requested citation were more likely to use words such as ‘need’ or ‘please’ in their comments when they rejected an article, which he says suggests that coercive language was used.\n\nJan Feld, a metascience researcher at the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, is not convinced that such language is a sign of coercion. “That seems like a bit of a stretch,” he says. There are other explanations for reviewers rejecting an article than the author refusing to cite their work. He doesn’t doubt that reviewers request citations that are not warranted, but they can recommend citations, including of their own work, to address issues they’ve identified. But even after those recommendations, “if the paper has not improved or I still have concerns, I cannot recommend publication”, he adds.",

          "title": "What counts as plagiarism? AI-generated papers pose new risks",
          "authors": " Ananya",
          "abstract": "This January, Byeongjun Park, a researcher in artificial intelligence (AI), received a surprising e-mail. Two researchers from India told him that an AI-generated manuscript had used methods from one of his papers, without credit.\n\nPark looked up the manuscript. It wasn’t formally published, but had been posted online (see go.nature.com/45pdgqb) as one of a number of papers generated by a tool called The AI Scientist — announced in 2024 by researchers at Sakana AI, a company in Tokyo1.\n\nThe AI Scientist is an example of fully automated research in computer science. The tool uses a large language model (LLM) to generate ideas, writes and runs the code by itself, and then writes up the results as a research paper — clearly marked as AI-generated. It’s the start of an effort to have AI systems make their own research discoveries, says the team behind it.\n\nThe AI-generated work wasn’t copying his paper directly, Park saw. It proposed a new architecture for diffusion models, the sorts of model behind image-generating tools. Park’s paper dealt with improving how those models are trained2. But to his eyes, the two did share similar methods. “I was surprised by how closely the core methodology resembled that of my paper,” says Park, who works at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea.\n\nResearchers built an ‘AI Scientist’ — what can it do?\n\nThe researchers who e-mailed Park, Tarun Gupta and Danish Pruthi, are computer scientists at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru. They say that the issue is bigger than just his paper.\n\nIn February, Gupta and Pruthi reported3 that they’d found multiple examples of AI-generated manuscripts that, according to external experts they consulted, used others’ ideas without attribution, although without directly copying words and sentences.\n\nGupta and Pruthi say that this amounts to the software tools plagiarizing other ideas — albeit with no ill intention on the part of their creators. “A significant portion of LLM-generated research ideas appear novel on the surface but are actually skillfully plagiarized in ways that make their originality difficult to verify,” they write.\n\nIn July, their work won an ‘outstanding paper’ award at the Association for Computational Linguistics conference in Vienna.\n\nBut some of their findings are disputed. The team behind The AI Scientist told Nature that it strongly disagrees with Gupta and Pruthi’s findings, and doesn’t accept that any plagiarism occurred in The AI Scientist case studies that the paper examines. In Park’s specific case, one independent specialist told Nature that he thought the AI manuscript’s methods didn’t overlap enough with Park’s paper to be termed plagiarism. Park himself also demurred at using ‘plagiarism’ to describe what he saw as a strong methodological overlap.\n\nBeyond the specific debate about The AI Scientist lies a broader concern. So many papers are published each year — especially in computer science — that researchers already struggle to keep track of whether their ideas are really innovative, says Joeran Beel, a specialist in machine-learning and information science at the University of Siegen, Germany.\n\nAnd if more LLM-based tools are used to generate ideas, this could deepen the erosion of intellectual credit in science. Because LLMs work in part by remixing and interpolating the text they’re trained on, it would be natural for them to borrow from earlier work, says Parshin Shojaee, a computer scientist at the Virginia Tech Research Center — Arlington.\n\nThe issue of ‘idea plagiarism’, although little discussed, is already a problem with human-authored papers, says Debora Weber-Wulff, a plagiarism researcher at the University of Applied Sciences, Berlin, and she expects that it will get worse with work created by AI. But, unlike the more familiar forms of plagiarism — involving copied or subtly rewritten sentences — it’s hard to prove the reuse of ideas, she says.\n\nThat makes it difficult to see how to automate the task of checking for true novelty or originality, to match the pace at which AIs are going to be able to synthesize manuscripts.\n\n“There’s no one way to prove idea plagiarism,” Weber-Wulff says.\n\nOverlapping methods\n\nBad actors can, of course, already use AI to deliberately plagiarize others or rewrite others’ work to pass it off as their own (see Nature https://doi.org/gt5rjz; 2025). But Gupta and Pruthi wondered if well-intentioned AI approaches might be using others’ methods or ideas too.\n\nGupta and Pruthi were first alerted to the issue when they read a 2024 study led by Chenglei Si, a computer scientist at Stanford University in California4. Si’s team asked both people and LLMs to generate “novel research ideas” on topics in computer science. Although Si’s protocol included a novelty check and asked human reviewers to assess the ideas, Gupta and Pruthi argue that some of the AI-generated ideas produced by the protocol nevertheless lifted from existing works — and so weren’t ‘novel’ at all.\n\nThey picked out one of the AI-generated ideas in Si’s paper, which they say borrowed from a paper first posted as a preprint5 in 2023. Si tells Nature that he agrees that the ‘high-level’ idea was similar to material in the preprint, but that “whether the low-level implementation differences count as novelty is probably a subjective judgement”. Shubhendu Trivedi, a machine-learning researcher who co-authored that 2023 preprint, and was until recently at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that “the LLM-generated paper was basically very similar to our paper, despite some superficial-level differences”.\n\nAI is complicating plagiarism. How should scientists respond?\n\nGupta and Pruthi further tested their concern by taking the four AI-generated research proposals publicly released by Si’s team and the ten AI manuscripts released by Sakana AI, and generated 36 fresh proposals themselves, using Si’s methodology. They then asked 13 specialists to try to find overlaps in methods between the AI-made works and existing papers, using a 5-point scale, on which 5 corresponded to a ‘one-to-one mapping in methods’ and 4 to ‘mix-and-match from two-to-three prior works’; 3 and 2 represented more-modest overlaps and 1 indicated no overlap. “It’s essentially about copying of the idea or crux of the paper,” says Gupta.\n\nThe researchers also asked the authors of original papers identified by the specialists to give their own views on the overlaps.\n\nIncluding this step, Gupta and Pruthi report that 12 papers in their sample of AI-generated works reached levels 4 and 5, implying, they said, a plagiarism proportion of 24%; the figure rises to 18 (36%) if cases in which the original authors didn’t reply are included. Some were from Sakana’s and Si’s work, although Gupta and Pruthi discuss in detail only the examples reported in this story.\n\nThey also said they’d found a similar kind of overlap in an AI-generated manuscript (see go.nature.com/4oym4ru) that, Sakana announced this March, had passed through a stage of peer review for a workshop at a prestigious machine-learning conference, the International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\nAt the time, the firm said that this was the first fully-AI-generated paper to pass human peer review. It also explained that it had agreed with workshop organizers to trial putting AI-generated papers into peer review and to withdraw them if they were accepted, because the community hadn’t yet decided whether AI-generated papers should be published in conference proceedings. (The workshop organizers declined Nature’s request for comment.)\n\nGupta and Pruthi say that this paper borrowed its core contribution from a 2015 work6, without citing it. Their report quotes the authors of that paper, computer scientists David Krueger and Roland Memisevic, as saying that the Sakana work is “definitively not novel”, and identifying a second uncited manuscript7 that the paper borrowed from.\n\nAnother computer scientist, Radu Ionescu at the University of Bucharest, told Nature he rated the similarity between the AI-generated work and Krueger and Memisevic’s paper as a 5.\n\nKrueger, who is at the University of Montreal in Canada, told Nature that the related works should have been cited, but that he “wouldn’t be surprised to see human researchers reinvent this and miss previous work” too. “I think this AI system and others are not capable of achieving academic standards for referencing related work,” he said, adding that the AI paper was “extremely low quality overall”. But he wasn’t sure whether the word plagiarism should be applied, because he feels that term implies that the person (or AI tool) reusing methods was aware of earlier work, but chose not to cite it.\n\nPushback\n\nThe team behind The AI Scientist, which includes researchers at the University of Oxford, UK, and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, pushed back strongly against Gupta and Pruthi’s work when asked by Nature. “The plagiarism claims are false,” the team wrote in an e-mailed point-by-point critique, adding that they were “unfounded, inaccurate, extreme, and should be ignored”.\n\nOn two AI Scientist manuscripts discussed in Gupta and Pruthi’s paper, for instance, the team says that these works have different hypotheses from those in the earlier papers and apply them to different domains, even if some elements of the methods are related.\n\nIs it OK for AI to write science papers? Nature survey shows researchers are split\n\nThe references found by the specialists for Gupta and Pruthi’s analysis are work that the AI-generated papers could have cited, but nothing more, the AI Scientist team says, adding: “What they should have reported is some related work that went uncited (a daily occurrence by human authors).” The team says it would be “appropriate” to have cited Park’s paper. In the case of Krueger’s paper and the second uncited manuscript, the AI Scientist team says, “these two papers are related, so, while it is an everyday occurrence by humans not to include works like this, it would have been good for The AI Scientist to cite them”.\n\nBen Hoover, a machine-learning researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who specializes in diffusion models, told Nature that he’d score the overlap with Park’s paper as a ‘3’ on Gupta’s scale. He said the AI-generated paper is of much lower quality and less thorough than Park’s work, and should have cited it, but “I would not go so far as to say plagiarism.” Gupta and Pruthi’s analysis relies on ‘superficial similarities’ between generic statements in the AI-generated work that, when read in detail, don’t meaningfully map to Park’s paper, he adds. Ionescu told Nature he would give the AI-generated paper a rating of 2 or 3.\n\nPark judges the overlap with his paper to be much stronger than Hoover’s and Ionescu’s ratings. He says he would give it a score of 5 on Gupta’s scale, and adds that it “reflects a strong methodological resemblance that I consider noteworthy.” Even so, this does not necessarily align with what he sees as the legal or ethical definition of plagiarism, he told Nature.\n\nWhat counts as plagiarism\n\nPart of the disagreement could stem from different operational understandings of what ‘plagiarism’ means, especially when it comes to overlap in ideas or methods. Researchers who study plagiarism hold different views on the term from those of some of the computer scientists in the current debate, says Weber-Wulff.\n\n“Plagiarism is a word we should and do reserve for extreme cases of intentional fraudulent cheating,” the AI Scientist team wrote, adding that Gupta and Pruthi “are wildly out of line with established conventions regarding what counts as plagiarism in academia”. But Weber-Wulff disagrees: she says that intent shouldn’t be a factor. “The machine has no intent,” she says. “We don’t have a good mechanism for explaining why the system is saying something and where it got it from, because these systems are not built to give references.”\n\nWeber-Wulff’s own favoured definition of plagiarism is that it occurs when a manuscript “uses words, ideas, or work products attributable to another identifiable person or source without properly attributing the work to the source from which it was obtained in a situation in which there is a legitimate expectation of original authorship”. That definition was produced by Teddi Fishman, the former director of a US non-profit consortium of universities called the International Center for Academic Integrity.",

          "abstract": "The US Supreme Court has ruled that the administration of President Donald Trump can go ahead with cuts to active research grants.Credit: Perry Spring/iStock via Getty\n\nThe US Supreme Court has derailed researchers’ efforts to reinstate almost $2 billion in research grants issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The court’s decision on Thursday represents a remarkable reversal, allowing the administration of US President Donald Trump to proceed with science cuts it began in late February.\n\n‘We were ready for this’: meet the scientists suing the Trump administration to reinstate terminated grants\n\nIn a divided decision, the high court held that lawsuits filed by researchers to reinstate grants should have been reviewed by a court specializing in contracts, rather than the district court they were filed in. But the Supreme Court narrowly ruled that the district court could review the NIH’s guidelines used to make the grant terminations and left in place the lower court’s order that the guidelines are illegal and should not be used. The lower court said in June that the grant cuts made by the Trump administration in relation to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) amounted to racial discrimination.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court ruled partially in the researchers’ favour, some scientists say the decision amounts to a de-facto win by the Trump administration, because the time and cost of challenging their terminations in a different court will be prohibitive. And it could spell doom for other legal efforts, such as one by a group of University of California researchers, to reinstate their funding from other agencies such as the US National Science Foundation.\n\n“In a scientific sense, this is a total loss,” says Jenna Norton, a programme officer at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the NIH. “The trust and certainty that is so critical to successfully conduct research has been completely obliterated by this ruling.”\n\n“What the court made clear yesterday is, if your grants get cut, you’re not going to be able to get any effective remedy for it,” says Samuel Bagenstos, who until December was the top lawyer for the NIH’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nNeither the NIH nor the researchers who led the lawsuit against the agency responded to Nature’s queries about the ruling.\n\nLegal challenges\n\nEarly this year, the NIH began terminating thousands of research grants related to a plethora of topics disfavoured by the Trump administration, including DEI, HIV/AIDS and COVID-19. An analysis by Nature found that the cuts have razed entire fields of study, such as investigations into the health of transgender people. This loss of billions of dollars of funding has led dozens of research institutions, such as Stanford University in California, to lay off staff members.\n\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\n\nSeveral US states, researchers and organizations that represent scientists filed lawsuits challenging the NIH’s cuts in early April, arguing that the terminations were illegal because the agency — the largest funder of biomedical research in the world — did not follow proper procedures and did not give adequate reasoning for cancelling the grants.\n\nIn June, judge William Young of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston ruled that the NIH guidelines used to terminate the grants and about 800 of the terminations, including those related to DEI, were illegal. “I’ve been on the bench for 40 years — I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this,” Young said at a hearing announcing his decision.\n\nThe next month, a three-judge appeals-court panel unanimously denied the Trump administration’s request to halt Young’s ruling, noting that the cuts would delay lifesaving research by years, if not decades. The government then filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court.\n\nA court divided\n\nThe case divided the Supreme Court’s nine justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump, leading to an unusually fractious 36-page emergency ruling.",

          "abstract": "Dan Seaton working on an experiment to observe the solar corona during the solar eclipse of 14 October 2023, on top of Loveland Pass in Colorado.Credit: Daniel Zietlow, NSF NCAR\n\nIn the summer of 1999, I was a 19-year-old with an interest in astronomy, but no real idea of what I wanted to do with my life — then I saw my first total solar eclipse. I travelled with a group of other undergraduates and professional researchers to Râmnicu Vâlcea, a small city in southern Romania, as part of a research programme funded partly by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), where I watched the skies grow dark, saw a solar corona light up behind the Moon and listened to the ticking of our equipment tracking the Sun for the 140 seconds of darkness.\n\nMy school was part of a consortium of eight small colleges in the northeastern United States — most with only one or two astronomy professors — that had banded together to provide summer research opportunities for their students. Funded originally by the W. M. Keck Foundation, and recently by the NSF, the small initiative, called the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium, has supported 350 students such as myself over 35 years.\n\nThis experience made me realize that I could actually pursue a career in astronomy research, altering the course of my life fundamentally. After I graduated, the time I gained calibrating and analysing solar observations was enough to land me a job at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, supporting the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer mission. This led to me doing a PhD on the processes that convert magnetic energy in the corona to heat and radiation during solar flares.\n\nI now study the dynamics of the corona that produce both explosive flares and comparatively gentle outflows that become solar wind. I led a project using an extreme-ultraviolet solar telescope for the European Space Agency, helped to build the first data products from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Solar Ultraviolet Imager and have pioneered methods to observe the previously obscure middle corona, where the transition from the magnetically dominated solar atmosphere to the pressure-dominated solar wind and heliosphere begins.\n\nSince 1987, thousands of students across the United States have shared similar experiences to mine, thanks to the NSF’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programme. REU provides grants of around US$100,000–155,000 to universities and other institutions to embed students in laboratories and research facilities, giving them an introduction to professional scientific research.\n\nNow, this programme, which costs around $80 million a year, is under threat of being eliminated under the proposed federal budget, as the administration of US President Donald Trump plans sweeping cuts to science funding and major changes in the NSF’s mandate.\n\nResearchers on the 1999 Râmnicu Vâlcea expedition that Dan Seaton partook in.Credit: Williams College Eclipse Expedition 1999\n\nUndergraduate research programmes are powerful incubators for nascent talent, especially for students who might not otherwise get to engage in authentic research at their home university. Many support community-college students with no access to research at all and students from small universities that lack either the resources to provide research or the breadth to match students’ interest. REU students are mentored by professional scientists, who gain as much as the students do. Students bring ingenuity and enthusiasm to the labs and research groups they join, and many go on to become trusted colleagues and close collaborators.\n\nIn February 2025, the US administration directed the NSF to begin withholding funding. REU sites across the country have had to cancel this year owing to uncertainty about upcoming funding. Several have had their already granted funding rescinded and have had to inform accepted students that they will need to make other summer plans. In the proposed NSF budget for the 2026 financial year, REU programmes are zeroed out completely.\n\nThe United States has been a global leader in science and technology for nearly a century, a position that has fostered great economic and societal benefits. And although the threats to US scientific enterprise across the board are myriad, few single investments pay the dividends that the REU programme does. Although it represents less than 1% of the total NSF budget — which itself is less than 0.15% of total federal spending — it is a proven pathway for developing the scientific talent that powers the United States’ worldwide supremacy in science.",

          "title": "Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise",
          "authors": "Amy Luers",
          "abstract": "In 2024, the global average annual temperature exceeded 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. Greenhouse-gas emissions are rising, and the window to reach net zero by 2050 is closing fast.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) systems can play a crucial part by improving energy and resource-use efficiency, accelerating innovation and expanding people’s capacity to act. But without swift, deliberate effort, this opportunity could slip away.\n\nRealizing net zero — balancing the amount of carbon emissions emitted with the amount removed — by mid-century will require rapid, large-scale transformations. Electricity generation must nearly double by 2050 as transport, heating systems and industries shift from fossil fuels to electric power. Renewable-energy capacity must triple by the end of this decade to meet the rising demand without simultaneously increasing emissions1.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nSteel, cement, chemical and other industries — which are responsible for almost one-third of global carbon-dioxide emissions — must shift to near-zero emissions, even though affordable, scalable alternatives are limited1. Carbon removal must increase rapidly. Highly durable removal methods such as enhanced rock weathering — which can store CO2 for centuries to millennia — must scale up by a thousandfold by 2050, removing gigatonnes of CO2 annually to help neutralize the hardest-to-abate emissions2. Progress is constrained by three barriers: system complexity, slow innovation and workforce gaps. For example, electricity grids can become harder to manage as reliance on variable, decentralized renewable sources rises. Clean technology can also take years to develop and scale up, and skilled workers are in short supply.\n\nAI is not a silver bullet — but without it, these problems are unlikely to be solved fast enough. Much attention has focused on AI’s high energy consumption and water use. These operational impacts can strain local power grids or exacerbate water stress, and must be actively addressed. But they are not major drivers of global climate change. Framing them as such distracts focus from AI’s transformative climate-mitigation potential and from its biggest influence on the climate, which will depend on how it is used.\n\nHere, I put AI’s operational footprint in the context of its broader climate impact and outline five areas of action that are needed to realize the technology’s potential to achieve deep decarbonization.\n\nAI’s climate ledger\n\nAI’s demand for electricity is rapidly increasing. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that global electricity use by data centres could more than double by 2030, reaching about 3% of global electricity consumption, with AI-dedicated servers driving nearly half of the growth3. In the United States, data centres consume about 4.4% of electricity and could reach 6.7–12% by 2028, depending on AI deployment and efficiency4.\n\nMeeting this surge entirely with carbon-free power is challenging. In the past, data-centre developers only prioritized cost and infrastructure. Now, many also consider grid capacity and carbon emissions. But transmission bottlenecks and permit delays are slowing carbon-free electricity growth, making it hard to keep up with AI-driven demand.\n\nLight bulbs have energy ratings — so why can’t AI chatbots?\n\nSome regions are turning to natural gas to meet rising demand. In central Ohio, regulators approved the development of new gas plants for incoming data centres. In northern Virginia, analysts estimated 10–15 gigawatts of natural-gas capacity could be needed to meet data-centre demand (see go.nature.com/45zdgna).\n\nBut, from a global perspective, AI’s operational footprint remains modest. Data centres use about 1.5% of global electricity and contribute roughly 0.5% of total CO2 emissions3. Water use for data-centre cooling and electricity supply is about 560 million cubic metres annually, less than 0.08% of global freshwater consumption3,5. By 2030, data-centre water consumption is expected to more than double3. Although that is a modest amount on a global scale, data-centre resource demand can add stress to local grid and water systems.\n\nA widely cited claim — the chatbot ChatGPT needs to ‘drink’ a 500-millilitre bottle of water for a simple conversation — sounds alarming but is misleading. Analysis shows that 87% of that water is used to cool power plants6. This highlights a little-known fact: electricity generation still uses mainly fossil fuels and is extremely water intensive. Every time you turn on a light, water is consumed.\n\nChatGPT’s 2.5 billion daily queries consume about 0.5% of the amount of electricity used each day by people watching television in the United States. The chatbot’s estimated daily water consumption — about 3,700 m3 — is negligible relative to the 690,000 m3 used for powering US televisions, and the roughly 43,000,000 m3 of water lost daily in the United States owing to leaky pipes (see Supplementary Information).\n\nA system that uses AI technology and more than 1,000 cameras detects wildfires in California.Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty\n\nAI’s biggest climate consequences will come from how it is used. It could increase emissions by boosting fossil-fuel extraction. Without adequate governance safeguards, AI systems could also undermine climate progress by deepening inequalities and eroding trust7.\n\nBut the technology can also serve as a pivotal tool to cut emissions by overcoming barriers of complexity, speed and scale. For example, AI-enabled dynamic line ratings (a technology used to monitor the real-time capacity of overhead power transmission lines) use real-time data — such as temperature, wind speed and other weather conditions — to continually adjust the safe operating capacity of power lines. This can increase transmission capacity by up to 40%, allowing more power from wind and solar technologies to flow through existing grids and reducing the need for costly and time-consuming building of new infrastructure (see go.nature.com/428hqx7).\n\nWhy coalitions of wealthy nations should fund others to decarbonize\n\nAI is also accelerating the search for low-carbon materials, including alternatives to cement. Cement production is one of the largest single industrial sources of CO2 emissions, mainly because of clinker — the key binding agent — the production of which releases large amounts of CO2 during limestone processing. Cutting these emissions requires replacing clinker with other materials that match its strength and durability. With conventional trial-and-error methods, this could take decades.\n\nIn May, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge showed that AI could be used to speed up this process drastically. Their system scanned 88,000 scientific papers and analysed data on one million rock samples, rapidly narrowing down the field to 19 promising clinker substitutes — a task that Soroush Mahjoubi, the lead author and a civil engineer at MIT, said would have taken “many lifetimes” using conventional laboratory methods8. However, discovery is only the first step. Bringing such materials to market still involves rigorous performance testing, navigating regulatory approval and persuading a typically conservative construction industry to adopt new products at scale.\n\nThe IEA estimates that by 2035, widespread AI deployment in the energy sector could cut annual CO2 emissions by 1.4 gigatonnes — more than twice the amount projected from data-centre emissions (see ‘AI emissions trade-off’). These savings would come from smarter control and forecasting of demand, system conditions and emissions sources3. Economist Nicholas Stern and his colleagues at the London School of Economics and Political Science estimated even greater potential: 3.2–5.4 gigatonnes of annual reductions by 2035 across electricity, transport and food sectors9.\n\nSources: Energy, Ref.3.; Electricity, food and transport, Ref.9.\n\nAI alone will not deliver net zero, but it is a powerful tool for accelerating deep, sustained decarbonization. Realizing its full potential requires doing the following.\n\nFive actions\n\nInvest in AI for the climate. In 2024, AI climate-technology raised US$6 billion, with most directed towards commercially attractive sectors such as autonomous vehicles and optimization in energy, homes and agriculture10. Crucial areas such as grid integration, materials discovery and carbon removal remain underfunded, despite AI’s potential to accelerate progress3.",

          "abstract": "We are living through a global freshwater crisis: in 2014, humanity used five times as much water as it did in 1914 and supplies are dwindling fast in many countries (see go.nature.com/4mg4dnt).\n\nWater contamination only makes the problem worse. In the past two years alone, swathes of the United States, Europe and Africa have been hit by a combination of catastrophic floods and severe droughts, both of which worsen water quality. Floods wash chemicals and pathogens into rivers and lakes, and droughts concentrate these contaminants, making bathing waters unsafe to swim in and necessitating intensive treatment of drinking water.\n\nCitizen scientists can be chemists: give them a chance\n\nAs director of science and policy at Earthwatch Europe, a non-profit environmental organization, I’ve witnessed at first hand how difficult it is to reliably monitor water quality and measure progress towards universal access to safe water and sanitation (Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6).\n\nAs a scientist, my approach for addressing any challenge is to research it. I gather and analyse data, and try to understand the problem and design solutions. But the global freshwater crisis feels overwhelming: how can we monitor freshwater bodies globally and identify pollution hotspots so that we can hold polluters accountable?\n\nThe answer, I think, is citizen science — the public’s active involvement in research. By enabling communities to monitor their local waters using simple test kits, we can better understand the threats to our freshwater systems and collectively advocate for action. This two-way exchange educates and empowers individuals and simultaneously generates data on a scale scientists can’t achieve alone.\n\nCitizen scientists have already demonstrated their ability to provide extensive, accurate and timely information on water quality at a national level. In the United Kingdom, Earthwatch Europe’s Great UK WaterBlitz events — four-day campaigns in which volunteers assess nitrate and phosphate nutrient pollution in their local rivers, lakes and ponds — have mobilized thousands of people. In one weekend in April 2025, nearly 8,000 citizen scientists collected 4,000 surveys. Given that the UK Environment Agency seeks to increase the number of water-industry inspections from 10,000 in 2025–26 to 11,500 in 2026–27, it’s easy to see how reliable data from citizen scientists could be used to help uncover regulatory non-compliance, improve the performance of water companies and identify pollution sources.\n\nData on SDGs are riddled with gaps. Citizens can help\n\nIn Sierra Leone, Earthwatch Europe and the United Nations Environment Programme’s GEMS/Water initiative — through the World Water Quality Alliance — has equipped citizen scientists with the tools needed to collect data on the proportion of rivers and lakes with good water quality. By integrating citizen-science data into official monitoring efforts, Sierra Leone’s National Water Resources Management Agency has almost doubled the number of water bodies it can assess (see go.nature.com/3v2f6cd), contributing to SDG indicator 6.3.2.",

          "abstract": "Tools that turn speech into text not only save time, Zhicheng Lin finds, but also allow him to multitask and to participate fully in meetings.Credit: Zhicheng Lin\n\nFor most academics, the sound of typing is the sound of progress. But it’s also the sound of a bottleneck — a slow, physically taxing process that stands between our ideas and the page. We accept this as a necessary part of the job, but should we?\n\nLast year, persistent wrist pain from hours spent hunched over a keyboard forced me to question that necessity. The solution, I found, was to reclaim my voice. Modern dictation tools powered by artificial intelligence (AI) allowed me to compose text at a conversational speed, easily outpacing even the most proficient typists (who achieve a maximum of around 80 words per minute) with my natural speaking cadence of 130 words per minute or more. The ergonomic benefits were immediate.\n\nAlthough voice-to-text software now boasts remarkable accuracy, these tools remain largely untapped in academic workflows. They are often perceived as accessibility aids or tools for quick voice memos rather than instruments for scholarly production. This is a missed opportunity. A strategic voice-based workflow can transform how we capture ideas, draft manuscripts and engage with research.\n\nTranscription\n\nAcademic work thrives on fleeting insights. Ideas emerge on walks between buildings, in the shower and in the middle of the night. They surface during interviews with research participants, emerge from seminar discussions and crystallize during informal conversations with colleagues. Conventional note-taking forces us to choose between participating fully in the moment and scrambling to jot down what’s happening. Transcription eliminates this compromise.\n\nTranscription converts existing audio recordings into text: the audio exists first, the text follows. Recording a meeting allows you to engage completely, avoiding the distraction of manual note-taking. The resulting transcript becomes a searchable archive of decisions, insights and action points. For researchers conducting interviews, automated transcription transforms hours of playback and typing into minutes of review and annotation.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, transcription makes it easy to capture ideas when it would be difficult to write them down. Mulling over a research problem while walking to campus? Recording thoughts on your phone takes seconds. Lying in bed when a solution to a methodological challenge suddenly becomes clear? Voice memos preserve the insight without requiring you to reach for paper or a laptop.\n\nThere are psychological benefits, too. Speaking our thoughts aloud allows us to bypass the internal editor that often stalls written expression. A blank page can be intimidating, but a voice recorder simply listens.\n\nDictation\n\nDictation, by contrast, produces text as you speak. In this instance, speech replaces the keyboard. Dictation is compositional rather than retrospective, demanding focused attention, but at the speed of thought rather than of fingers. For first drafts, e-mail responses or reviewer comments, this acceleration compounds quickly.\n\nBut viewing it simply as a means of increasing speed undersells dictation’s value. Physical relief from keyboard work addresses an occupational hazard. Academic careers span decades; repetitive strain injuries accumulate silently until they become debilitating. Dictation offers not just efficiency, but also sustainability.\n\nMoreover, the technology enables us to truly multitask. Dictating while walking transforms commutes into writing sessions. Simple physical activities — folding laundry, organizing shelves or taking light exercise — can accompany composition without compromising either task. This reclaims otherwise dead time for productive work.\n\nBuilding your voice workflow\n\nEffective voice integration requires the matching of tools to tasks and the development of new routines around both transcription and dictation. Start with low-stakes applications to build comfort before tackling important work.\n\nFor basic recording, you might already have all you need. Apple’s Voice Memos, for example, can handle most academic recording needs adequately.\n\nFor sensitive material requiring offline processing, MacWhisper transcribes entirely on your device — a capability crucial for sensitive interviews and confidential discussions. The software can also handle batch processing and accepts various audio formats, and offers a one-time licence purchase rather than a recurring fee. (SpeechPulse is another option, for both Mac and PC users.)\n\nIf cloud-based options appeal, Google AI Studio provides free transcription through multimodal large language models (LLMs) such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, although it does also use your data for training purposes. ChatGPT record mode (currently available for paid subscribers on macOS) records, transcribes and automatically generates structured summaries in an editable workspace. Users can also request the original transcript or edit it by giving the AI conversational commands, or prompts. Otter and Granola excel at meeting transcription with automatic speaker identification and summary generation, and ElevenLabs’ Scribe provides high-accuracy transcription.\n\nOn the dictation front, computers and phones include basic features, but specialized tools often perform better. For maximum accuracy, I prefer Aqua Voice (for which free, paid and group tiers are available). Its Deep Context feature uses on-screen context — such as the active application and visible text — to improve recognition of domain-specific terms and to apply context-appropriate formatting. It also supports a dictionary of custom words.\n\nFor cross-platform work, consider Wispr Flow, which is available for macOS, Windows and iPhone, and has both free and paid tiers. Users of Apple devices might also consider MacWhisper, SuperWhisper or Spokenly, which offer both local and cloud-based processing.\n\nPractical implementation",

Inspired by scientific methodology, she designed a test and trial phase: writing 100 articles on a wide range of topics in 100 days for her personal website.\n\nDuring career exploration, small, intentional experiments, such as this one, can turn uncertainty into insight and shrink the psychological distance between the current situation and what comes next.\n\nCharting a new course\n\nBecause English wasn’t her first language, A.-L.L.C. had significant doubts about whether she could translate complex research into engaging content. But over those 100 days, she discovered unexpected benefits: the joy of feedback from readers and developing skills she hadn’t anticipated, such as visual storytelling and building a dedicated following and community. Most importantly, the experiment shifted her perspective. She realized that her career path didn’t have to be an either–or choice between researcher and science communicator. In fact, the synergy between the roles made her stronger in both.\n\nAnne-Laure Le CunffCredit: Vanity Studios\n\nSimilarly, after 17 years on an academic path with the goal of becoming a professor in neuroscience, M.B., then based at the University of Magdeburg, Germany, found himself increasingly curious about start-ups and how research could be applied to build technological solutions. But instead of leaving research for something unfamiliar, he began exploring his interest while still in academia, treating his exploration of the start-up world as an experiment.\n\nIn 2019, he started a new project: every Friday for six weeks, he reached out to a neuroscience-focused start-up to arrange informal coffee chats. One that stood out was MedEngine, a Berlin-based company developing Flytta, a tool for passively tracking motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. The firm’s work overlapped with his own research, and they began exploring ways to collaborate. Later that year, MedEngine provided input on a successful grant application that M.B. led, one aspect of which was using Flytta for the early detection of Parkinson’s disease. The experience helped him to establish his first connections with the start-up world while remaining rooted in academic research.\n\nThen, in 2020, M.B. began a new experiment — working five hours a week as a scientific editor at the health-tech start-up neotiv in Magdeburg, Germany, gaining experience translating research findings to create an app for the early detection of memory problems related to Alzheimer’s disease. That first step led him to co-found his own start-up, Alois — a digital companion that sets reminders and stores memories as voice notes to help people with early-stage dementia to maintain their independence. After meeting his co-founders at a hackathon, they began working on the idea. They soon after joined an incubator programme while M.B. was still in academia.\n\nThe start-up didn’t work out, but the experience was invaluable. It highlighted the differences between business and academia: decisions had to be made quickly and with limited information; collective teamwork took precedence over individual expertise; and, most significantly, the focus was on solving a real problem, not just advancing knowledge.\n\nHow to run an experiment\n\nThe goal of a career experiment isn’t to land your next job — it’s to learn. Experiments can lead you down curiosity-driven rabbit holes and open up unexpected paths. Just like in research, some will confirm your hypothesis, and others will disprove it. In fact, a ‘failed’ career experiment can be just as clarifying as a successful one by helping you to rule things out.\n\nMatthew Betts\n\nFor both of us, this experimental approach has led us to varied and interesting roles. A.-L.L.C.’s career experiment became the foundation for the Ness Labs newsletter, which today has more than 100,000 subscribers, and led to her book, Tiny Experiments, published this year. She has remained in academia, working as a neuroscience researcher at King’s College London. M.B. now runs MJB Consulting in Berlin, his own health-tech consultancy, and leads guided workshops for PhD students and postdocs on curiosity-driven career experimentation.\n\nHere are five tips for crafting a career experiment:\n\nChoose your hypothesis. Decide what question you’re asking, and how you can frame it to create a clear test. For example: “Do I enjoy translating research for industry?”, “Am I energized by mentoring and teaching?” or “Does consulting work align with my skill set?”",

          "authors": "Shinichi Kuriyama",
          "abstract": "On 30 July, one of the biggest earthquakes ever recorded struck eastern Russia, triggering tsunami alerts across Japan and the Pacific. It is a timely reminder that Japan faces such seismic threats every day.\n\nJapan has one of the world’s best earthquake and tsunami preparedness systems, including advanced technologies for earthquake-proofing buildings and an early-warning system. But as head of the International Research Institute of Disaster Science at Tohoku University, I can still see room for improvement.\n\nEven in Japan, people don’t necessarily follow all the steps they should to protect themselves. These include reinforcing buildings against earthquakes, implementing measures to prevent furniture from falling over, installing earthquake-sensitive electrical circuit breakers, and evacuating quickly. Burning, crushing and drowning were the main causes of death in Japan’s last three major earthquakes, in 1923, 1995 and 2011.\n\nYet only 90% of Japan’s housing stock is earthquake resistant — short of the government’s target of almost 100% by 2025 — with large disparities between municipalities. Measures for preventing furniture from toppling, such as attaching heavy shelves to walls, have been taken by less than 40% of the population, and just 5% have installed earthquake-sensitive circuit breakers. In Kochi Prefecture, a region especially prone to earthquakes (the Nankai Trough subduction zone lies just off its coast), only 68% of people say they would evacuate immediately after shaking stopped.\n\nMany disaster risk-reduction measures aim to change people’s behaviour by raising individuals’ awarenesses of the risks. These actions need to be made more effective — which could be done by following the approach taken by public-health professionals to communicating risks. With my background in medical science, I have seen how successful such approaches have been for public health.\n\nFor example, people know they should stop smoking and reduce salt intake to stay healthy, thanks to decades of campaigns. Since 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) has championed the concept of ‘health promotion’ to encourage everyone in society to take control of their health and take steps to improve it.\n\nA similar approach is needed to reduce the number of deaths and injuries sustained in natural disasters. At my institute, we call such methods ‘bosai’ communication science, after the Japanese term for disaster prevention.\n\nGoals must be set, indicators established and measures to achieve them clearly defined. People need to confront their fears of natural disasters and be shown steps they can take to lessen the effects. Risk-reduction advisers can show realistic images and testimonies of earthquake and tsunami damage, direct people to services for making buildings earthquake-resistant and explain how to perform evacuation drills. Gift certificates or points can be awarded for participating in drills. Disaster preparedness needs to become a social norm.\n\nTo implement these measures, platforms need to be established through which disaster-management and health officials can collaborate. The success of these efforts can be judged by indicators such as seismic retrofitting rates and evacuation-drill participation rates, as well as reductions in the number of deaths caused by disasters.\n\nTo roll out such a system globally, further collaboration between the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the WHO will be necessary. The UNDRR is the lead agency promoting the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030.\n\nThree steps would move a global public-health approach to disaster risks forwards.\n\nFirst, disaster risk-reduction personnel and health-care professionals should meet regularly to exchange information. I would be happy to help build the required network.",

          "abstract": "Mary Hagedorn, who studies cryopreservation of corals, wants to put a biobank on the Moon.Credit: Marco Garcia\nWorking scientist profiles\n\nThis article is part of an occasional series in which Nature profiles scientists with unusual career histories or outside interests.\n\nMary Hagedorn has spent decades studying coral reproduction as part of an effort to save reefs from being destroyed by rapidly warming oceans. To collect precious fragments of new coral life, she must carefully synchronize her activities to the Moon’s phases.\n\nCorals breed at or near a full moon, releasing a blizzard of sperm and eggs into shimmering waters, but the unpredictability of which full moon corals choose makes fieldwork a gamble. On one trip “we dove for 60 nights straight” before capturing the magic moment, Hagedorn says.\n\nThe patience and persistence required to collect coral sperm, cryopreserve it, transport it to the laboratory for rearing coral larvae and then releasing them into the ocean could serve her well for another planned mission: a literal moonshot to preserve threatened organisms.\n\nWorking Scientist career profiles\n\nHagedorn, a research scientist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Kāne‘ohe, Hawaii, is part of an interdisciplinary team proposing to build a frozen repository in a permanently shadowed polar area on the far side of the Moon. Initially, the effort would focus on cryopreserving a veritable Noah’s ark of Earth’s animal life. It would start by banking tissue samples from endangered and threatened animals, as well as from priority species. These would include pollinators and ecosystem engineers such as beavers, that, through dam-building, create whole systems of aquatic environments for other organisms. Hagedorn and ten collaborators published the lunar biorepository idea in 2024 in the journal BioScience as a backup plan for biodiversity — a way to introduce life back to Earth, or to other planets, in the event of catastrophic loss (M. Hagedorn et al. BioScience 74, 561–566; 2024).\n\nShe likens the planned repository to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Arctic Norway, which stores seeds of genetic importance for food, agriculture and biodiversity in a rocky cavern deep under an icy mountain held at −18 °C. It’s an ambitious idea that faces many challenges, including a political climate in which science in the United States and beyond is being undermined and underfunded, especially when related to the impacts of climate change. Nevertheless, the lunar biorepository idea is gaining traction and being given serious consideration.\n\n“We wanted something that could act like Svalbard,” but there’s no place on Earth that is naturally cold enough, says Hagedorn. Even Svalbard needs refrigeration to keep its samples frozen. In 2016, extraordinarily warm winter temperatures sent a flood of melt water into the vault’s entrance. It was a wake-up call for a facility thought to be a fail-safe because it is surrounded by permafrost.\n\nThinking big, and extraterrestrially, Hagedorn reasoned that the lunar south pole is spared the vagaries of climate and temperature (see ‘Quick-fire Q&A’). Being stored under the Moon’s surface, also protects the samples from another damaging factor: radiation. Another advantage is the Moon’s lack (so far) of war, violence, natural disasters, overpopulation and resource depletion. Samples could be stored and retrieved using robots similar to the Mars rovers.\n\nAddressing criticism that retrieving samples could be challenging, Hagedorn responds that, barring an apocalypse, “we will be travelling into space regularly in the future”.\n\nQuick-fire Q&A\nIf you could do a site visit for a biorepository on the Moon, would you go?\n\nIn a heartbeat. I would love to go into space. I actually applied to be an astronaut with NASA, but my eyesight was not good enough.\n\nEvery author on our 2024 BioScience paper proposing the biorepository is like me — they’re frustrated astronauts, sci-fi buffs or both.\n\nHow did your biorepository team come together?\n\nAround 2015, I was giving a talk in London about biorepositories in general. I said, “you know, one of the best places we could probably have a biorepository is on the Moon”.\n\nThen, I brought this concept up at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, and the response of my colleagues there was, “this is really stupid — don’t do this”. So I didn’t pursue it, for about four years. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, I had some time, and I decided to get a group together, meeting on Zoom. It just grew from there.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge to getting this project off the ground?\n\nMoney. This project is going to cover so many different areas, from space engineering to ethics, and there are going to be a lot of scientific changes and breakthroughs.\n\nIt’s all new territory; I think that is going to be very exciting. We just have to be patient and try to get some small grants to keep us going. There will be a way.\n\nComposite image of the lunar south pole.Credit: Stocktrek Images/Getty\nLocation, location, location\n\nOne favoured site for a lunar bio-repository lies in a crater some 6 kilometres deep, “way deeper than the Grand Canyon” in Arizona, Hagedorn says. In this permanently shadowed space, the temperature is stable — at or below −196 °C.\n\nProtecting Earth’s life must be a top priority in the rush to stake out lunar sites for industry and research, argue Hagedorn and her co-authors, whose expertise encompasses cryobiology, medicine, engineering, atmospheric research, coral and fish biology, and law and policy. They issued an open call for others to collaborate on this ambitious, decades-long programme.\n\nThe process would start by banking skin samples that contain fibroblast cells. Those fibroblasts are isolated from a cell-culture process, and then cryopreserved. They can later be thawed and transformed into sperm and egg cells from the specific species. Eventually, whole organisms could be reintroduced into their natural habitat.\n\nA sit in the sauna can save endangered frogs\n\nAs proof of concept, the team will test one species on the International Space Station. The researchers plan to cryopreserve pelvic fins from a coral-reef dwelling fish aptly named the starry goby (Asterropteryx semipunctata), and test them in space for sensitivity to radiation and microgravity. They will also refine the optimal storage materials for cryopreserved cells and study how frozen storage in space affects DNA and the ability to derive and culture cells from thawed fin samples.\n\nOnce the team works out the kinks for starry gobies, it wants to expand to other species. There are plans to collaborate with continental-scale sampling already being undertaken by entities such as the National Ecological Observatory Network, which is funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and collects 100,000 biological samples annually from freshwater and terrestrial habitats.\n\nCryobiology, corals and lunar missions were not always Hagedorn’s focus. After earning a PhD in marine biology at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, in 1983, Hagedorn next studied the physiology of electric fishes and a cichlid fish (Astatotilapia burtoni) as a postdoctoral fellow. That research abruptly ended after a boating accident in the Peruvian Amazon claimed the lives of two colleagues. Hagedorn could not bring herself to go back, but realized she wanted to work on the impacts of warming oceans, which led her to bleached and dying coral — the ocean’s canary in the coal mine.\n\nAn article by Canadian molecular physiologist Ken Storey, on the ability of tree frogs to freeze solid in winter and thaw again in spring (K. B. Storey and J. M. Storey Sci. Am. 263, 92–97; 1990), sparked the idea of using cryobiology for ocean conservation work. “Nothing had been done at the time with cryo-preservation of corals,” says Hagedorn. She received a mid-career fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC in 1996 to start work on fish-embryo cryopreservation. In 2004, she transferred her lab group to Hawaii, expanding the scope of her work to include developing techniques for coral cryopreservation.\n\nThe lunar biobank could start with tissue samples from corals and other endangered species.Credit: Andrew Heyward, AIMS\n\nMehmet Toner, a biomedical engineer at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who has known Hagedorn for more than 30 years, says: “I don’t think there’s anyone else in the world who knows coral biology and cryobiology like her.”\n\nToner, Hagedorn and their colleagues are funded by the NSF as part of the ATP-Bio programme, which brings together partners from industry, academia, the non-profit sector and government to investigate how to cryo-preserve and store samples ranging from cells to whole organisms.\n\nToner’s cryobiology research includes work to understand how to freeze and thaw cells without damaging them. “When I learned about the southern lunar pole being in cryogenic temperatures, it sparked my interest,” says Toner, a co-author of the lunar biorepository proposal.\n\nMoonstruck collaborators\n\nThe cryobiology involved in preserving life across a spectrum of biodiversity is extremely complex, he explains. “You’re taking a living thing to −196 °C and bringing it back” to the temperature of its habitat, alive. “I call that a miracle.” At the same time, he notes that cryobiology techniques have advanced significantly in the past 20–30 years. “It’s much more predictable and doable now,” he says.\n\nToner notes that their team is not the only one vying for lunar real estate. “That part of the Moon is becoming very popular,” with scientists also proposing polar craters as sites for mines, telescopes and temporary human habitation. Indeed, NASA’s Artemis programme, which aims to land humans on the Moon again, is encouraging the exploration of lunar resources.\n\nJohn Bischof, a bioengineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and the director of ATP-Bio, notes Hagedorn’s talent for identifying scientists to join their team. “She’ll bring you into the collaboration, show you exactly where you can make the contribution, and explain why it’s so important. So, even before you do anything, you’re just so pumped up,” he says, describing her as enthusiastic and empathetic. “It’s fun to be around somebody like Mary,” says Bischof, describing her as “untethered in a good way”.\n\nThis company claimed to ‘de-extinct’ dire wolves. Then the fighting started\n\nClaire Lager, Hagedorn’s lab manager since 2016, and once her graduate student, notes that “somebody who wants to put things on the Moon has to be optimistic, enthusiastic and very, very charismatic”, and that Hagedorn ticks all the boxes.",

          "authors": "Lucas Woodley, Chung Yi See, Ashley Nunes",
          "abstract": "Around the world, countries are pushing to electrify transport, which accounts for around 20% of global emissions each year. Electrifying half of the world’s light-duty vehicles could save 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually, equivalent to the emissions of Russia1. Doing so would also improve air quality, reducing the rate of asthma attacks, infant mortality and acute bronchitis (see go.nature.com/4onyqhh).\n\nBut electric vehicles (EVs) remain unaffordable for most people. Many consumers cite the price of EVs as a barrier to ownership (see go.nature.com/45ffjgj).\n\nEV prices need to fall if they are to be adopted widely enough to curb global emissions. In the European Union, for example, electric cars currently make up just over 1% of the fleet. That figure needs to climb to 20% by 2030 and 43% by 2035 to deliver on the EU’s emissions-reduction targets (see go.nature.com/4ftfnmf).\n\nWe need to prepare our transport systems for heatwaves — here’s how\n\nMany governments are increasingly adopting measures to do this. Supply-side policies, which target manufacturers, include tightening emissions standards for petrol and diesel vehicles to make EVs more appealing (a move proposed by the United States in 2023, see go.nature.com/4mj1tq6) and banning the sale of combustion-engine vehicles altogether (as proposed by the EU).\n\nDemand-side policies, targeted at consumers, include exempting EVs from purchase taxes (as Norway implemented in the 1990s) and offering generous incentives for electric-car buyers (enacted by Australia, Canada, the United States and others). Such policies are coming under scrutiny, however, for their high financial cost. For example, under the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act, taxpayers incur a cost of US$23,000–32,000 per extra EV sold because of the policy2.\n\nAll these measures presume that increased demand will stimulate supply, and lead to a virtuous circle in which producers gain technological learning, driving down production costs and therefore EV prices until EVs dominate the market.\n\nInvestigating whether this is happening in the United States, we observe that, despite rapid declines in the cost of batteries — the most expensive component of an EV — overall, EV prices have remained stubbornly high. This reality necessitates rethinking policies that see battery costs as the primary impediment to widespread EV adoption. Instead, the identification of other contributors to EV prices is warranted, as are policies that help to lower these prices.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nThe main reason often given for why EVs are more expensive than fossil-fuel-powered cars is the cost of the large battery needed to power them, which itself can weigh half a tonne3. Batteries are made using expensive ‘critical minerals’, such as lithium (which costs $15,000 per tonne) and cobalt ($30,000 per tonne). By comparison, steel, the main cost factor for combustion-engine cars, sells for roughly $1,000 per tonne.\n\nHowever, over the past few decades, global battery prices have fallen drastically. In 2011, the inflation-adjusted price of an average EV battery was more than $1,000 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). By 2023, that figure had dropped to $139 per kWh. This precipitous decline reflects advancements in battery technology and improvements in battery-cell production, all of which have driven down per-unit production costs.\n\nLower production costs for firms should mean lower purchasing prices for consumers. However, pricing data from one key market, the United States, over the past few decades suggests otherwise (see ‘US electric-vehicle capacities and costs’). Instead of falling, average EV prices have risen by more than 50%: from $43,872 in 2011, to $71,501 in 2023, although prices fluctuate from year to year.\n\nSources: Pack-level battery cost: BloombergNEF; Automotive: Cox Automotive, Edmunds, US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThat’s happened even as the number of sales has increased: between 2011 and 2023, EV sales grew at an average annual rate of 47%. Thus, in the United States, there’s no evidence that cost reductions — realized through battery price falls or production scale-up and technological learning — have been passed down from manufacturers to consumers.\n\nBusiness and policy environments elsewhere have led to cheaper EVs coming onto the market, notably in China, thanks to government subsidies, lower production costs and fierce competition. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, for example, costs $4,700, more than five times cheaper than the cheapest US EV. But it comes with a much smaller battery — just 9.2 kWh compared with the US average of 83.4 kWh. Similarly, in Europe, the Chinese-made Dacia Spring is available for roughly $23,000 with a 27-kWh battery.\n\nNo easy answers\n\nLarger battery size is one explanation for why US EV prices are higher4. Bigger batteries allow the car to be driven further, and consumers value greater range5. But larger batteries increase costs, because they require more critical minerals.\n\nHowever, battery costs alone don’t account for the price differential seen in the US market. Between 2011 and 2023, average battery capacity increased by about 11% annually, while per-kilowatt-hour battery cost declined by 15% annually (see ‘US electric-vehicle capacities and costs’). In other words, the rate of battery-cost declines outpaced efforts by EV manufacturers to increase battery size.\n\nMoreover, battery costs have accounted for a decreasing share of EV prices over time. Whereas in 2011, the battery accounted for, on average, 58% of an EV’s price, by 2017, that had fallen to 21%. In 2023, battery costs accounted for just 16% of an EV’s price.\n\nAerial view of a lithium mine at Silver Peak, Nevada. Electric-vehicle batteries rely on lithium and other ‘critical minerals’. Credit: Getty\n\nHigh EV prices could reflect manufacturers’ understanding of their consumer base. EVs are often seen as luxury cars for the rich, so manufacturers can charge more, knowing that those customers are not bothered by the price. However, price gouging is an unlikely culprit for high EV prices. EVs largely remain a loss-making venture. In 2023, Ford Motor lost $4.7 billion on sales of 116,000 ‘Model e’ cars, or an average of $40,525 per vehicle (see go.nature.com/4lcqjkj).\n\nGeopolitical and supply-chain factors are also insufficient to explain the trend. In 2022, for example, Jiten Behl, chief growth officer of Rivian — a US electric-truck maker — blamed rising prices on “inflationary pressure, increasing component costs and unprecedented supply-chain shortages and delays for parts (including semiconductor chips)” (see go.nature.com/40unqt8). Although such extra expenses might explain price increases for a single year, they do not explain EV price rises over decades.\n\nPolicy implications",

Credit: Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nMajor dengue outbreaks in the Americas tend to occur about five months after an El Niño event — the periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean that can disrupt global weather — a study1 has found. Meanwhile, local outbreaks tend to happen about three months after summer temperatures peak and roughly one month after peak rainfall.\n\nThe study, published today in Science Translational Medicine, paints a clearer picture of the relationship between the mosquito-borne disease and climatic conditions in the Americas, a region that saw a record-breaking 13 million cases in 2024.\n\nDengue is caused by four closely related viruses and spread by the Aedes species mosquitoes. There is no specific treatment, and the disease can lead to fever, bone pain and even death.\n\nThe research relied on roughly three decades of surveillance data from 14 countries. Cases in the region tended to rise and fall in sync, on average six months apart, even in places as far as 10,000 kilometres apart.\n\nThe findings are “useful to anticipate when a region might expect to see an epidemic, which can help inform planning and preparedness”, says Talia Quandelacy, a co-author and an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora. She notes that, although the link between dengue and climate is well known, what stands out in the findings is how this association plays out across the entire continent, “especially given that it’s such a climatically diverse region”.\n\nToasty mosquitoes",

Then they frogmarch the captured amphibians into a small greenhouse made from nothing more than a stack of masonry bricks for a “luxury treatment” sauna — which might ultimately save their lives, he explains.\n\nFor many, the idea of a ‘frog sauna’ might sound bizarre. But when Waddle’s team published a study (A. W. Waddle et al. Nature 631, 344–349; 2024) showing that a simple sit in a warm enclosure could treat the deadly chytrid fungal infection plaguing the green and golden bell frog, it made waves — and resulted in him winning the 2025 Future for Nature award. Now, as a postdoctoral researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, he’s collaborating with partners, training local communities and helping Australia to save its declining population of these glossy green-and-golden-streaked frogs that fit in your palm and croak with a muffled, motorcycle-like revving sound.\n\nChytrid fungus infections are a huge threat to the global frog population and have contributed to declines in more than 500 frog species and the extinction of more than 90 others.\n\nThe good news is that infections can be cleared easily in some frogs under the right conditions, because the fungus is sensitive to heat. “Around 28 °C is enough to really limit chytrid growth,” Waddle says. And the sauna treatment can pay off really fast: a few hours a day for a week or less is all that’s needed. Saving one female frog can markedly change the trajectory of a population, because a single adult can produce thousands of offspring in one season.\n\nWaddle stacks bricks inside a mini greenhouse, where they function as saunas for frogs.Credit: Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty\n\nHow the treatment came about was serendipitous. In 2013, researchers studying tree frogs in Queensland, Australia, noticed a pattern: in areas where chytrid fungus had spread, frog populations survived near large granite boulders and crevices, but disappeared from shaded, forested areas. The researchers hypothesized that the boulders acted as natural refuges that absorbed heat during the day and slowly released it at night. The process created warmer microhabitats that protected the frogs from the fungus.\n\nHowever, not all habitats had these heating boulders. So Waddle and his colleagues wanted to finally “test this idea that people had been hemming and hawing about forever”, but that no one had tested by experiment.\n\nTrying a new approach meant there was no standard blueprint. Waddle and his team had to test and adjust various sauna designs as they went. Their simple set-up consists of a small garden-greenhouse frame wrapped with translucent plastic and placed over a stack of masonry bricks, each with a series of openings for frog entry and exit. Their experiments found that the frogs readily find and enter saunas on their own.\n\nSo far, the researchers have placed about 70 frog saunas in three sites in greater Sydney and plan to use three more sites there in the next Southern Hemisphere winter, in 2026. They have also created how-to guides, educational videos and workshops to teach community members how to build the saunas (see ‘Quick-fire Q&A’). Several greenhouse suppliers have even listed the set-up on their websites as useful for creating frog saunas, as well as for growing plants.\n\nQuick-fire Q&A\nAnthony Waddle with an amphibian friend.Credit: Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty\nHow do you capture the frogs for the treatment?\n\nCapturing frogs is the fun part. You just go out at night with head torches and pick them up. We capture them by hand and bring them into a temperature- and environment-controlled facility. We either give them antifungal baths or increase their temperature for treatment, and then eventually release them. My students and I like capturing frogs the most, but it’s also the start of a lot of work, because the frogs are usually quite ill and need close attention.\n\nWhat has been the main challenge of this project?\n\nIt’s mostly been about getting people on board with solution-driven research. I’ve worked on chytrid fungal infections for nearly 12 years — starting with an undergraduate project, then a master’s on chytrid and vaccines, a PhD focused on ‘vaccination’ in frog saunas, and now a postdoctoral position investigating synthetic-biology solutions for chytrid resistance.\n\nWe’re in a position to make a big impact, even with a small team. But sometimes it’s been hard to get the exposure and support we need to grow and to secure major funding — especially when we don’t have the CVs of more-senior researchers to back us up.\n\nWhen someone develops a patent, or something for use during their PhD, it’s the responsibility of that person to make sure that the technology is used. So, I’m adopting an unconventional entrepreneurial spirit, doing citizen-science work, trying to secure partnerships with industry and going out to places where people don’t think to look for funding or support, to drive my research forwards. It’s been the secret to my success.\n\nWhat’s a surprising question that you are asked about your job?\n\nPeople often ask us to justify why we do our work or explain its broader benefit to society. I often retort with: “No one asks an accountant, or someone making money from money, what their greater purpose is.” Yet, someone like me working to conserve frogs is treated as if that’s not a real job. I’m not tired of justifying that what I do is important, because we are saving species from the face of extinction. But I do enjoy making people laugh with that joke, because it’s true.\n\nThe saunas are a low-cost garden habitat for the endangered frogs that live throughout southeastern Australia. Waddle has worked with other frog conservationists, encouraging local people to use apps such as FrogID. This lets users make audio recordings of frog calls and upload them to an online database, togeher with GPS data. Experts then identify the frogs and notify the users.\n\nJodi Rowley, a herpetologist at the Australian Museum Research Institute in Sydney and lead scientist for FrogID, says that tens of thousands of people across Australia use the app, and have put more than 1.3 million frog records on the map. The app has contributed to the discovery of 13 frog species and is actively used by communities to monitor local frog populations. Now, regular FrogID users can get frog-sauna information and updates. “We are hoping that communities are using the app to record their local frogs and potentially determine whether the frogs do better after the installation of frog saunas,” Rowley adds.\n\nBeyond black and white: an ecologist applies racial-justice principles to predators and their ecosystems",

In fact, they had just lost a ten-year legal battle.\n\nIn 2015, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a mountain guide from the alpine town of Huaraz in Peru, sued German multinational energy giant RWE for its contribution to global warming, which threatened Lliuya’s home with flooding from a nearby glacial lake. The case had numerous setbacks over the ensuing decade, but the final blow came on 28 May. The court dismissed the latest appeal, saying the likelihood of a flooding event reaching Lliuya’s home and causing serious damage was too low to justify legal intervention.\n\nYet, outside the courtroom on that fateful day, Lliuya’s lawyer Roda Verheyen declared jubilantly to waiting reporters, “I’m so happy”. The reason for her celebration was that the court decision created a bombshell precedent: major greenhouse-gas emitters could be held liable for costs of damage in the future, on the basis of their proportional contribution to global emissions. “This ruling shows that the big polluters driving the climate can finally be held legally responsible for the harm they have caused,” Lliuya said in a statement.\n\nNature Spotlight: Climate change\n\nNoah Walker-Crawford, a social anthropologist at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment in London, who was initially involved in the Lliuya v. RWE case, says that those involved never thought it would get as far as it did, especially on scientific grounds. “When we started the case, the science wasn’t that far along yet, so on attribution we only had broad insight,” he says.\n\nIn 2015, climate-attribution science was still in its infancy. The field investigates the extent to which human-induced climate change alters the likelihood or intensity of a particular climate-related event. For example, a flood triggered by a melting glacier, a heatwave that kills thousands of people, sea-level rise that destroys coastal properties or a forest fire that razes a town. Ultimately, it also provides a way to apportion blame for discrete climate events to individual entities, such as a company or government.\n\nAs the Lliuya v. RWE case progressed, so too did the attribution science. “The case ended up taking so long that the science caught up,” Walker-Crawford says. In particular, a study1 published in 2021 found that the melting and retreat of the Palcaraju glacier and the increased risk of a glacial lake outburst flooding nearby Huaraz — Lliuya’s home — was “entirely attributable” to human-induced global warming.\n\nThat flipped both the science and the law. Many of those working in attribution science and applying it in the courtroom see the Lliuya v. RWE decision as a landmark one that gives the field legal weight, opening the door for the science to have its day in court.\n\nCause and effect\n\nAugust 2003 was the hottest European summer in around 500 years. Heatwaves broke temperature records across the continent, rivers dried up, forest fires raged, glaciers melted and an estimated 20,000 people died from heat-related illness.\n\nOne year later, a study concluded with extremely high confidence that human-induced climate change had at least doubled the risk of such an extreme heatwave occurring2. The paper is considered the first peer-reviewed, published climate-attribution study of an extreme weather event.\n\nLawyer Roda Verheyen (centre) was happy with the decision in the Lliuya v. RWE lawsuit.Credit: Christopher Neundorf/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n“The overarching question we always try to answer is whether and to what extent human-induced climate change altered the likelihood and intensity of the event,” says Friederike Otto, a physicist at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in London.\n\nQuantifying how much of the blame for extreme weather events and the damage caused can be attributed to human-generated greenhouse-gas emissions is complex. It starts with modelling what the climate would be like without the estimated 50% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide that has occurred since pre-industrial times (see go.nature.com/3jeqwae), then comparing the difference with data from current climate models.\n\nClimate models are therefore at the core of attribution science. These are computational simulations of Earth’s climate, applying mathematical equations that represent the laws of physics — the conservation of mass, energy and momentum — to real climate data. Models allow scientists to study the complex processes and interactions that shape climate and weather at various points in time and space, and the effects of changes, such as increasing atmospheric CO2.\n\nIn climate models, one particular equation is key: the Navier–Stokes equation, which describes the forces acting on a fluid particle. “So you have the Coriolis force, you have gravity, you have friction, and that equation is the basis of every single climate model,” Otto says.\n\nBut no two climate models are alike. “At the core they’re all the same, but they might have a different spatial resolution,” says Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the Australian National University in Canberra. That resolution can make a world of difference, especially when it comes to small-scale meteorological processes. We can’t resolve clouds, for example, unless we’re using climate models that are less than four cubic kilometres in resolution, Perkins-Kirkpatrick says. “The finer the resolution, the better we can represent those processes, which are important.”\n\nClimate models are technically global but each one is refined in its own way to most accurately represent a particular region or climate process, Otto says. “The UK Met Office one, for example, they adjust the parameters so that the model does give a very good representation of the climate in the UK, and that is usually to the detriment of somewhere else in the world,” she says. For example, until a few years ago, the climate model used for the United Kingdom didn’t describe the monsoon over India. “The models are getting better, and they are not quite so shocking any more, these trade-offs,” Otto says, although low- and middle-income countries are still under-represented in climate models3.\n\nClimate of change\n\nClimate models have improved with more data and more computing power, and the methods have also evolved over time. But Otto says the biggest advance that has happened during her career has been in policy, not technology.\n\nWhen she started as a researcher, most climate-modelling centres made it difficult for external researchers to use their climate-model data. But that soon changed when climate models and data were made centrally available, and “you suddenly had all the climate models in the world at your disposal”, she says. “When we started, we used one or two models that we could get, but now we sometimes use up to 70 different models, and that makes a huge difference.”\n\nIn 2023, wildfires spread rapidly through the village of Kraps near Fier, Albania. Credit: Adnan Beci/AFP via Getty\n\nInequity also affects the accuracy of climate models, because they rely on weather data — both historical and contemporary — and some regions are better resourced with meteorological infrastructure than are others, says Delta Merner, an environmental scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Baltimore, Maryland. “There also are methodological gaps, particularly in under-resourced regions, where there’s not high-quality baseline data,” she says. “Without that baseline data, you’re not able to do the attribution science, or you’re not able to do it at the scale that the legal questions might require.”\n\nMerner is currently working on a research project using machine learning to create synthetic data sets for under-resourced regions that lack consistent historical data, which could then aid the application of attribution science in those areas.\n\nAttributing accountability\n\nSince its emergence, climate-attribution science has broadened and diversified into multiple subfields.\n\nThe oldest of those is trend attribution, which looks for the signal of human influence over long-term climate trends, such as the link between rising global average surface temperatures and increasing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations. Event attribution analyses whether climate change made a particular extreme event — a flood, storm or heatwave, for example — more likely to happen or more intense.\n\nClimate models vary in their ability to model various extreme events, which can make it easier or harder to detect evidence of human-induced global warming. “Temperatures are easy,” says retired atmospheric scientist David Karoly at the University of Melbourne, Australia. “Particularly increases in extreme temperatures and the frequency of extreme temperatures; there’s been so much attribution of that that it’s actually quite difficult to get a paper published on that now.” Other extreme events such as storms, cyclones and fire weather are more challenging, either because those processes are not as well-represented in regional-scale climate models or because there are so many variables involved.\n\nSource attribution aims to pin the responsibility for an impact to a source, such as a major emitter or nation. Lliuya chose to sue RWE because, at the time of the case, the company was Europe’s single largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and estimated to have contributed 0.47% of global industrial greenhouse-gas emissions since the start of the industrial age (see go.nature.com/3jb9apw). Although 0.47% seems like a small fraction, it’s highly significant — something that the court decision also recognized, Walker-Crawford says.\n\nThe frequency of wildfires in Greece is increasing.

          "authors": "Gareth Thompson",
          "abstract": "A Year with Gilbert White: The First Great Nature Writer Jenny Uglow Faber & Faber (2025)\n\nThe first person to identify harvest mice (Micromys minutus), Gilbert White was an eighteenth-century English curate and naturalist who has been called the ‘father of ecology’. Yet records from his student days show that he was not so much a quiet country gentleman as a lad about town, losing money at cards and buying fancy waistcoats. In her grandly illustrated book A Year with Gilbert White, historian Jenny Uglow looks between these extremes to investigate who White really was.\n\nShe depicts a self-taught biologist who not only enjoyed wining and dining, but also took natural history out of stuffy dissecting rooms and into the wild. Spurning the dry descriptions of wildlife commonly used at the time, White’s only book, The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789), brought colourful character to its scientific records of plants and animals. In doing so, it transformed the art of nature writing.\n\nSwarming bees and greedy sheep\n\nBorn in 1720, White was educated at the University of Oxford, UK, before settling at The Wakes — his family home in Selborne, UK — in around 1757. Then, from 1768, he worked for 25 years on his Naturalist’s Journal, a columnar diary in which each page covered a week of observations on fruit and vegetable experiments, local creatures and weather conditions.\n\nWhite’s daily entries in Selborne were often haiku-like in their simplicity. He described “vast rocklike, distant clouds” or simply stated “Bees swarm much. Sheep are shorn.”\n\nGilbert White added entries to his Naturalist’s Journal every day for 25 years. Credit: Culture Club/Getty\n\nUglow’s book examines one year of journal entries, from 1781. She chose this year for two reasons: it was the mid-point in White’s writing of his book, and a year after Timothy the tortoise arrived, a pet inherited by White that was later found to be female. Timothy often featured in the journal entries, being suspected of amorous longings whenever it wandered off.\n\nUglow compares White’s year in nature with personal sightings at her own home in the Lake District, UK. In January, centuries and miles apart, White logs the chatter of nuthatches (Sitta spp.) while Uglow searches for eelworms (nematodes). Originally, Uglow thought of toadflax (Linaria spp.) as a weed, but White’s delight in its loveliness makes her reconsider. They share a gardener’s irritation with field mice. They each find beauty in autumnal beeches (Fagus spp.). Tulips in both of their gardens are destroyed — White’s by rain, Uglow’s by greedy sheep about whom she jibes, “They have left the daffodils, in disdain”.\n\nShould we treat rivers as living things?\n\nSelborne was not a safe haven for animals, it was a working community. For low-paid labourers, it was a case of human rights over nature’s rites. Birds were routinely shot if they were harmful to crops or livestock. “The air crackles with fear and rage,” writes Uglow, as she relays White’s account of a farmer and his hens tormenting a captured hawk to death.\n\nUglow also traces the publication of White’s book from its germination to its blossoming. It has remained in print since 1789 and came about when White realized the literary potential of the letters he’d written to fellow naturalists Daines Barrington and Thomas Pennant. For publication, he revised these old letters and added entries from his journals to give an intricate view of Selborne’s natural world. The work inspired a youthful Charles Darwin, who went on a pilgrimage to Selborne in 1857.\n\nBut perhaps White’s greatest legacy lies in the chronicling of avian sights and sounds. He kept lists of which birds sang until midsummer and which all year round. Detecting the nocturnal stone-curlew’s cry, he surmised that night-time fliers sent noisy signals to keep their flocks together after dark. Birdsong so obsessed White that he identified three different species of leaf warbler (the chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix) and willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus)) by their tunes.\n\nBirds from Gilbert White’s journals feature in a stained-glass window in a Selborne church.Credit: RDImages/Epics/Getty",

          "title": "People are having fewer babies: Is it really the end of the world?",
          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "In 1970, a woman in Mexico might have expected to have seven children, on average. By 2014, that figure had fallen to around two. As of 2023, it was just 1.6. That means that the population is no longer making enough babies to maintain itself.\n\nMexico is not alone: countries around the world are witnessing falling fertility rates1. Exceptions are few. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle estimates that, by 2050, more than three-quarters of countries will be in a comparable situation.\n\n“There has been an absolutely incredible drop in fertility — much faster than anyone had anticipated,” says Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “And it is happening in a lot of countries you would have never guessed.”\n\nHow to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes\n\nThe numbers are clear. What’s uncertain is how problematic this global ‘baby bust’ will be, and how nations should respond. In economies that have been built around the prospect of steady population growth, the concern is over future slumps in innovation and productivity, as well as having too few working-age citizens to support a growing number of older people. Researchers warn of ripple effects, from weakened military power and less political influence for countries with lower fertility rates, to fewer investments in green technology. It is imperative that countries address population decline and its impacts now, says Austin Schumacher, a health metrics researcher at the IHME.\n\nMany countries have been trying to take action, and the data suggest that some strategies are helpful — if politically fraught. But to scientists familiar with the data, even the most effective efforts are unlikely to bring a full rebound in fertility rates. That’s why many researchers are recommending a shift in focus from reversal to resilience. They see room for optimism. Even if countries can only slow the decline, that should buy them time to prepare for future demographic shifts. Ultimately, scientists say, fertility rates that are low, but not too low, could have some benefits.\n\n“We’re not not making babies,” says Barbara Katz Rothman, a sociologist at the City University of New York. “The human race is not folding in on itself.”\n\nWhat the data say\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the world’s total fertility rate — generally defined as the average number of children a woman would have during her reproductive years — was five. (Nature recognizes that transgender men and non-binary people might become pregnant. We use ‘woman’ and ‘women’ in this story to reflect language used in the field.) Some dubbed this mid-twentieth surge the baby boom. Ecologist Paul Ehrlich and conservation biologist Anne Ehrlich saw it differently, warning in their 1968 book The Population Bomb that overpopulation would lead to famine and environmental devastation. But they failed to anticipate advances in agricultural and health technology that would enable the population to double to eight billion in a little more than five decades.\n\nHumanity’s impact on the environment has intensified, owing to that growth and to increased consumption in many parts of the world. But concerns about overpopulation have flipped. Population growth has been slowing down over the past 50 years, and the average total fertility rate stands at 2.2. In about half of countries, it has fallen below 2.1, the threshold generally needed to maintain a steady population (see ‘Declining fertility’). Small changes in these numbers can have strong effects. A fertility rate of 1.7 could reduce a population to half its original size several generations sooner than a rate of 1.9, for example.\n\nSource: Our World in Data (https://go.nature.com/45RWYFJ)\n\nThe case of South Korea is under close scrutiny. Its fertility rate fell from 4.5 in 1970 to 0.75 in 2024, and its population peaked at just under 52 million in 2020. That figure is now declining at a pace that is expected to accelerate.\n\nForecasts for the world vary. The United Nations and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria, project gentler declines than the IHME does (see, for example, go.nature.com/4mtkj8b). But demographers generally expect that the global population will peak in the next 30 to 60 years and then contract. If it does, that will be the first such decline since the Black Death in the 1300s.\n\nAccording to the UN, China’s population might already have peaked in around 2022, at 1.4 billion. India’s could do the same in the early 2060s, topping out at 1.7 billion people. And, assuming the most likely immigration scenario, the US Census Bureau predicts that the US population will peak in 2080 at around 370 million. Meanwhile, many of the steepest near-term crashes are anticipated in middle-income countries: Cuba is expected to lose more than 15% of its population by 2050.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is the notable exception. By 2100, more than half of the world’s babies are likely to be born there1, despite it having some of the world’s lowest incomes, weakest health-care systems and most fragile food and water supplies. Nigeria’s fertility rate remains above four, and its population is projected to grow by another 76% by 2050, which will make it the world’s third-most-populous country.\n\nStill, fertility-rate trends are hard to predict. Data gaps persist, and many models rely on the expectation that rates will rebound as they’ve done before. And as the Ehrlichs’ failed forecasts show, the past isn’t always indicative of the future. “We are groping in the dark,” says demographer Anne Goujon, programme director for population and just societies at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.\n\nWhat’s driving the decline?\n\nThe factors behind fertility collapse are numerous. They range from expanded access to contraception and education, to shifting norms around relationships and parenting. Debate continues over which factors matter most, and how they vary across regions.\n\nSome drivers reflect positive societal changes. In the United States, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that fertility has declined in part because of fewer unplanned pregnancies and teenage births. A long-term drop in domestic violence might also have contributed. Research in 2018 by Jennifer Barber, a sociologist now at Indiana University in Bloomington, and her colleagues showed that women in violent relationships have children at around twice the rate as do those in non-violent ones2.\n\n154 million lives and counting: 5 charts reveal the power of vaccines\n\nGlobally, access to contraception has helped to decouple sex from reproduction. In Iran, a national family-planning campaign that started in the 1980s contributed to the largest and fastest fall in fertility rates ever recorded: from nearly seven to under two in less than two decades3. The country reversed course around 2006, and is once again promoting policies to increase fertility rates.\n\nYoung people in wealthy countries are also forming fewer partnerships and having less sex. Alice Evans, a sociologist at King’s College London, has suggested that online entertainment is outcompeting real-world interactions and eroding social confidence. As women worldwide have gained education and career opportunities, many have grown more selective. Women want independence, while many men expect a “servant at home”, says Fernández-Villaverde. “Women are asking, ‘Why would I marry this person?’ A lot of men are undateable. Truly undateable.”\n\nThis disconnect fuels trends such as South Korea’s Four Nos feminist movement — in which many young women are rejecting dating, marriage, sex and childbirth — and a similar ‘boy sober’ movement among US women.\n\nMexico is one of several countries that has a fertility rate below replacement level.Credit: Bernd Vogel/Getty\n\nMany young people are also pursuing more education so as to gain jobs that might come with high stress and little stability early on. As a result, even people who pair up might postpone having children or have trouble conceiving because they are older. Those who do have kids face pressure to prepare them for the same high-stakes race for university and career, says Matthias Doepke, an economist at the London School of Economics and Political Science. “It’s not like we have withdrawn from parenting. It’s just that we concentrate all this investment, all these hours, on fewer children.”\n\nRising costs create further pressures. A UN survey of more than 14,000 people in 14 countries found that 39% cited financial limitations as a reason not to have children (see www.unfpa.org/swp2025). In US cities, births have fallen most sharply where housing prices have risen most rapidly (see go.nature.com/4tqqzsg).\n\nUltra-low fertility rates tend to emerge where these pressures converge, says Doepke. In South Korea, he says, housing is expensive, the parenting culture is intense and the working culture rewards long hours.\n\nOther contributors include declining sperm counts, potentially linked to environmental toxins. Many prospective parents also have growing anxiety about political and environmental instability, as highlighted in the UN survey. It’s not clear which of these many factors are most important in individual countries. But ultimately, low fertility rates “reflect broken systems and broken institutions that prevent people from having the number of children they want”, says Stuart Gietel-Basten, a sociologist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “That is the real crisis.”\n\nCountering the crash\n\nThe fallout will play out differently around the world. Middle-income countries, such as Cuba, Colombia and Turkey, could be the hardest hit, with falling fertility compounded by rising emigration to wealthier nations.\n\nUrban–rural divides will also deepen. As young people leave small towns, infrastructure such as schools, supermarkets and hospitals shuts down — prompting more to move away. Often, it’s older people who remain.\n\nGlobally, ageing is the core issue with population decline. In countries that have shrinking fertility rates, the proportion of people aged 65 or older is projected to nearly double, from 17% to 31% in the next 25 years (see go.nature.com/4fspvh5). As life expectancy rises, the demand for physical and fiscal support grows, yet there is a lag in supply. For the majority of countries hoping to break the fertility fall, tools exist. These include financial incentives, such as US President Donald Trump’s proposal to give each newborn baby US$1,000 in an investment fund.",

          "authors": "Saima Sidik",
          "abstract": "Microplastics can degrade in the environment to form plastic dust.Credit: pcess609/Getty\n\nResearcher Karin Kvale first became interested in plastic pollution when she was living in Kiel, Germany, where her young children spent part of their school days on Falckenstein beach. “Every day they would come back with their pockets full of plastic fragments,” she says.\n\nThat was about five years ago, and, as an Earth-systems modeller, Kvale was intrigued by the idea that shards of degrading plastic might have become prevalent enough in nature to begin altering Earth systems. At the time, this concept was understudied, particularly in the oceans, on which Kvale focused her efforts.\n\nNature Spotlight: Climate change\n\nIn 2021, Kvale relocated to New Zealand and launched a consultancy called Aotearoa Blue Ocean Research, in Lower Hutt. She is now part of a community of scientists who study the plastic cycle — how plastic enters Earth systems, moves through the environment and affects its surroundings.\n\nAs fossil-fuel derivatives, plastics are made of refined carbon. By 2015, about 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste had been generated, with around 79% of this accumulating in landfills or the natural environment, where it breaks into ever smaller pieces1. Each year, plastic production increases exponentially: the total weight of carbon in plastic has surpassed the mass of all animals combined, and is likely to equal the mass of all bacteria by 2095 (see ‘Litter legacy’)2.\n\nSource: Adapted from Fig. 3 of ref. 2\n\nBy some estimates, plastic production contributes at least 4% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. However, once plastic enters the environment, it’s less well known how it affects Earth’s carbon cycle — the process that moves carbon between living organisms and the soil, oceans and atmosphere. As plastic degrades, it seeps into these environments, where studies suggest it interferes with crucial systems that regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide and stabilize global temperatures3–5. After environmental exposure, plastic can break down into dust, which extends its reach, according to environmental biogeochemist Janice Brahney at Utah State University in Logan. “Once in the atmosphere, it can get anywhere,” she says.\n\nIn circulation\n\nEach year, the world’s oceans pull around 10 billion tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere down towards the sea floor, through a process called the biological carbon pump6. The pump is facilitated, in part, by phytoplankton — tiny photosynthetic organisms that build their bodies out of atmospheric CO2 dissolved in the sea’s surface. When phytoplankton die, their bodies drift to the bottom of the ocean as a blizzard of organic particles that researchers call marine snow. Once this carbon is buried in sediment on the sea floor, it is stored away and no longer contributes to atmospheric warming.\n\nMoored fishing boats in Madura island, Indonesia, near a beach full of plastic waste.Credit: Suryanto Putramudji/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nThe past five years have seen a flurry of papers investigating how ocean plastic might slow down this biological carbon pump. Phytoplankton have been shown to stick to buoyant waste plastic, which reduces the speed at which marine snow sinks7. At the same time, the carbon found in plastic provides a food source for marine bacteria. As these bacteria feed on plastic and proliferate, they use up key nutrients from the ocean that are then unavailable to phytoplankton. This could reduce phytoplankton populations and limit the fall of marine snow. However, the question remains: can plastic weaken the biological carbon pump enough to reduce the amount of carbon that is stored and make a difference to global warming?\n\nKvale thinks the answer is ‘no’. The biological carbon pump is not a one-way street, she explains. Rather, ocean circulation brings some of the carbon back up to surface waters, where it can re-enter the atmosphere. As the climate warms, this ocean circulation is expected to weaken, meaning that less carbon will be carried back to the surface. But by Kvale’s calculations8, weakening circulation actually makes the carbon pump much more effective, outweighing any decrease in effectiveness caused by plastic. Over the next 100 years, “plastic pollution is really going to have a minor or negligible influence on how carbon is stored in the ocean”, she says.\n\nBut that assessment depends on how much the circulation changes. According to biogeochemist Aron Stubbins at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, “ocean circulation is really hard to predict”. Storms are expected to increase with climate change, so this could also compensate for weakening circulation, he points out — because stormy surface waters can force biological material downwards.\n\nStubbins says that, by his estimates, plastic could slow down the biological carbon pump by up to 25% by the end of the century, in the absence of other large changes. This, he says, “is why we got concerned and wrote a proposal to say we should figure out if this is real”. He is now gearing up to test how ocean plastic affects dissolved carbon and the biological carbon pump, having received a grant in April to apply climate models to real-world observations of plastic concentrations in the ocean. “It’s one of those proposals you get funded and you hope you’re wrong,” he says.\n\nHydrologist and geomorphologist Anne Jefferson collects beach sand that she will analyse for microplastics.Credit: Maddie Cross\n\nThere’s good evidence that plastic slows down the sinking of marine snow, says environmental scientist Xia (Alice) Zhu at the Memorial University of Newfoundland in St John’s, Canada, who has co-authored a systematic review on how the plastic cycle affects climate change9. But sorting out how slower marine snow will affect carbon storage in different oceans, and whether circulation patterns will play a part, requires more work. “We need more research into this before we write [plastic] off as insignificant,” she says.\n\nGlobal spread\n\nAlthough the impact of plastic on the oceans is still up for debate, plastic is having tangible effects on land, where it forms dust on the ground and in the air. Collectively, about 1,000 tonnes of plastic fall each year from the atmosphere onto lands in the western United States that are protected and relatively uninhabited, such as the Grand Canyon. That is equivalent to between 120 million and 300 million plastic water bottles, Brahney and her colleagues estimate10.\n\nStudies suggest that all this plastic dust alters the path of sunlight on its way to and from Earth’s surface, changing the amount of energy that’s available to heat the planet2,9. But whether the net effect will be that atmospheric plastic warms or cools Earth is still under investigation. In some of the most comprehensive work on the subject so far, scientists incorporated the effects of plastic dust into a climate model and found that warming or cooling depends on how high into the atmosphere the plastic has spread4. Although that study was based on non-pigmented plastics, most real-world plastic comes in many different colours, some of which reflect sunlight and some of which absorb it, Brahney says. This makes the net effect tough to sort out, but she and her collaborators are working on it.\n\nAirborne plastic also carries other risks. It has been found in natural environments such as forests, where it is trapped by the broad surfaces of leaves. When leaves fall to the ground in the autumn, they might be delivering plastic to the soil ecosystem, turning forest floors into plastic hot spots, suggests soil chemist Collin Weber at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany.\n\nView of a beech-tree leaf under a high-resolution microscope, showing red microplastic particles (inset) on the surface.Credit: Collin Weber",

          "abstract": "Credit: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nPhysician and international-health strategist David Nabarro, whose career included posts at the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations, played a central part in tackling some of the world’s most pressing health crises — from malnutrition and malaria to Ebola and COVID-19. He died on 25 July at his home in Ferney-Voltaire, France.\n\nNabarro studied nutrition at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which shaped his multidisciplinary approach to sustainable development. It later inspired the creation of his 4SD Foundation (skills, systems and synergies for sustainable development), which focuses on nutrition and building climate-change resilience, and is based in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2018, he was co-recipient of the World Food Prize for his work against malnutrition.\n\nThe full lethal impact of massive cuts to international food aid\n\nNabarro was known for his ability to take robust research evidence and translate it into practical strategies for improving the health of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. He excelled at synthesizing complex data for senior policymakers and politicians. As the director for human development at DFID in the 1990s, he developed strong relationships with ministers from both major UK political parties: the Conservative’s Lynda Chalker and Labour’s Clare Short.\n\nOne of his most notable early achievements at the DFID was persuading Short to allocate around £50 million (US$83 million) to the WHO for the creation of Roll Back Malaria — a pioneering global partnership aimed at supporting country-led efforts to combat malaria. His time at the WHO in the early 2000s was marked by rapid advancement: he became chief of cabinet to then-director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland, working on major initiatives such as campaigns against tobacco, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.\n\nEducated at Oundle School, UK, Nabarro studied medicine at the University of Oxford, UK, and University College London, qualifying in 1973. His first medical post was meant to be under an Oxford professor who was a friend of his father, the distinguished endocrinologist John Nabarro. But on the eve of starting, David sent word that he was in Kurdistan on humanitarian work and would not return for months — an early sign of his lifelong commitment to social justice and a career that would stretch far beyond the boundaries of conventional biomedicine.\n\nHealth of people who are displaced in their own countries is a neglected global crisis\n\nAt the LSHTM, his mentor in nutrition was John Waterlow, an eminent physiologist and authority on childhood malnutrition. After completing his master’s degree in nutrition, Nabarro joined the non-governmental organization Save the Children, where he led the analysis of the Kosi Hills rural development programme in eastern Nepal. He discovered that children of migrant road-construction workers had dangerously high rates of vitamin A deficiency, and he campaigned to improve both their nutrition and working conditions.\n\nWhile working with Stuart McNab at the UN children’s charity UNICEF, he co-developed the McNab–Nabarro growth chart — a simple tool that allowed field workers to identify severely undernourished children using only weight measurements.",

          "abstract": "The brain’s map of the body in the primary somatosensory cortex remains unchanged after amputation.Credit: Zephyr/Science Photo Library\n\nA brain-imaging study of people with amputated arms has upended a long-standing belief: that the brain’s map of the body reorganizes itself to compensate for missing body parts.\n\nPrevious research1 had suggested that neurons in the brain region holding this internal map, called the primary somatosensory cortex, would grow into the neighbouring area of the cortex that previously sensed the limb.\n\nBut the latest findings, published in Nature Neuroscience on 21 August2, reveal that the primary somatosensory cortex stays remarkably constant even years after arm amputation. The study refutes foundational knowledge in the field of neuroscience that losing a limb results in a drastic reorganization of this region, the authors say.\n\n“Pretty much every neuroscientist has learnt through their textbook that the brain has the capacity for reorganization, and this is demonstrated through studies on amputees,” says study senior author Tamar Makin, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. But “textbooks can be wrong”, she adds. “We shouldn’t take anything for granted, especially when it comes to brain research.”\n\nThe discovery could lead to the development of better prosthetic devices, or improved treatments for pain in ‘phantom limbs’ — when people continue to sense the amputated limb. It could also help scientists working to restore sensation in people who have had amputations.\n\nMapping cortical plasticity\n\nStudy first author Hunter Schone, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, says that previous reports from some people with amputations had led him and his colleagues to doubt the idea that the brain’s map of the body is reorganized after amputation. These maps are responsible for processing sensory information, such as touch or temperature, at specific body regions. “They would say: ‘I can still feel the limb, I can still move individual fingers of a hand I haven’t had for decades,’” Schone says.\n\nTo investigate this contradiction, the researchers followed three people who were due to undergo amputation of one of their arms. The team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cortical representations of the body before the surgery, and then after the amputation for up to five years. It is the first study to do this.\n\nBefore their amputations, participants performed various movements, such as tapping their fingers, pursing their lips and flexing their toes while inside an fMRI scanner that measured the activity in different parts of the brain. This allowed the researchers to create a cortical ‘map’ showing which regions sensed the hand. To test the idea that neighbouring neurons redistribute in the cortex after amputation, they also made maps of the adjacent cortical area — in this case, the part that processes sensations from the lips. The participants repeated this exercise several times after their amputation, tapping “with their phantom fingers”, says Schone.\n\nFamous ‘homunculus’ brain map redrawn to include complex movements\n\nThe analysis revealed that the brain’s representation of the body was consistent after the arm was amputated. Even five years after surgery, the cortical map of the missing hand was still activated in the same way as before amputation. There was also no evidence that the cortical representation of the lips had shifted into the hand region following amputation — which is what previous studies suggested would happen.\n\nMakin says their study is “the most decisive direct evidence” that the brain’s in-built body map remains stable after the loss of a limb. “It just goes against the foundational knowledge of the field,” she says.",

This kind of AI-powered police force was new, a rapid response to the holo-cop implementation that everyone had ended up ignoring because they had no physical presence. This cop, well, he bent towards me and his breath tickled my beard. The smell was old doughnuts and burnt coffee.\n\n“If-if you fail to fail comply fail, I will-ill be forced to use alternate different exotic means.”\n\nThe cop patted a lump at his waist that did not look like a gun or a taser.

For a moment, I could hear the machinery beneath the ground working as it took my car farther and farther away from me, down to some storage garage deep beneath the surface.\n\nThe cop turned to a fresh ticket sheet and began to write. “What was your mo-mo-motivation for jaywalk birdwalk crow-perambulation?”\n\nI wanted to scream. I wanted to punch the cop right on his glitchy, pixel-stubbled chin. A car passed by, the man at the wheel carefully turning his head to look in the other direction. A small group of kids stood at the nearest corner with skateboards in their hands, not even bothering to hide their staring. Of course, kids were pretty safe — nothing to be gained by writing them up because they couldn’t pay any fines.\n\n“I wasn’t jaywalking, officer. I was driving and you pulled me over because … well, you never actually told me why you stopped me.”\n\nThe cop glitched, for a second having four arms instead of two; two heads instead of one, neither of which were looking at me. He spoke clearly, but in two different voices. “Where is your car?”\n\nFighting to stay calm, I said: “You declared it abandoned.”\n\nThe cop cohered together, his edges blurring. I resisted the temptation to reach out and run my fingers along those sawtooth borders. The holo-cops were completely insubstantial, but the AI versions could produce resistance when needed, and physical objects, too. The cop’s pen scratched in his ticket book. He spoke in a new, broken way.\n\n“Iffff you don’t haaaave a car, you cooooouldn’t beeeee driving.”\n\n“But I wasn’t jaywalking, either.”\n\nThis wasn’t the first AI cop I’d seen.

          "authors": "Nic Fleming",
          "abstract": "A mobile plant-phenotyping device screens lettuce varieties in the Netherlands.Credit: The Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Centre\n\nHumans’ collective prospects as a species don’t look great. By 2050, the global population will hit an estimated 9.7 billion, meaning there will be 1.5 billion more mouths to feed than today. Demand for animal-derived protein, with its high environmental price tag, is predicted to rise faster still. Global temperatures and atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations are still increasing, tree cover is shrinking, oceans are acidifying, agricultural land is being lost to salinization, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent.\n\nNature Spotlight: Climate change\n\nBut where some see threats, others see opportunities. In May, researchers and small businesses with a range of ideas for producing food more sustainably gathered at F&A Next, a meeting on the future of food and agriculture held at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands. From climate-smart cultivation to breakthrough protein alternatives, a wave of innovations were revealed at the event.\n\nGlobally, protein demand is projected to grow more rapidly than the population, because of rising incomes, urbanization and changing dietary preferences. Farming animals for food contributes to deforestation, biodiversity loss and around 57% of the global greenhouse-gas emissions associated with food production1. As a result, many researchers think that the only way forward is to shift to alternative protein sources.\n\nSome popular plant-based proteins come with their own environmental issues. Soya-bean production, in particular, has been linked to deforestation, biodiversity loss and increased greenhouse-gas emissions, leading researchers and entrepreneurs to investigate alternatives.\n\nGreen, green grass\n\nGrassa, a start-up company based in Wageningen, is developing grass-based protein extracts for inclusion in pet food, livestock feed and, ultimately, products for human consumption, such as burgers, snack bars and dairy-free milk. “Compared to soy, grass protein has a better amino-acid profile, comparable digestibility, a lower carbon footprint and, once scaled up, can be priced competitively,” Rieks Smook, the firm’s chief executive, told the meeting.\n\nAt Grassa, freshly cut grass is fed into an extruder, producing a liquid that is then heated and filtered to denature the proteins. These coagulate into a green paste containing half of the grass’s protein. Organic solvents remove fats and chlorophyll from this paste, and membrane filtration removes sugars and minerals, leaving a neutral-tasting, off-white powder that is around 70% protein.\n\nA bee collects pollen from the flower in a rapeseed field.Credit: Ying Tang/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nCrushed grass is also left over from the extrusion process. According to Grassa, cows that are given a 50:50 mix of this by-product and their standard feed produce milk with a similar nutritional profile to that from animals on a normal diet. However, their manure contains less nitrogen — potentially reducing the run-off of polluting nutrients into waterways.\n\nSmook says that the carbon dioxide footprint of grass protein is significantly lower than that of imported soya, according to a life-cycle assessment by the company. Starting next year, Grassa is planning a two-year demonstration project involving 50 farmers, and is aiming to open a full-scale production plant in 2028, initially producing protein for pet food. The company wants to launch a grass-protein extract for human consumption by 2029, but will need the approval of the European Food Safety Authority to market it as a food ingredient in the European Union.\n\nFermented future\n\nHumans have used fermentation to preserve and transform foods for thousands of years, but now a new generation of start-up firms is using precision fermentation to make proteins with the same functional and nutritional properties as those produced by farm animals. “To a certain extent, we consider ourselves farmers,” Stephan van Sint Fiet, chief executive of Vivici, based in Leiden, the Netherlands, told the meeting. “We use crops from the land and then we make milk proteins -- but our ‘animals’ are just a little bit smaller.”\n\nVivici uses yeast that has been genetically modified to produce β-lactoglobulin (BLG), a whey protein found in cow’s milk that is prized for its functional properties, including gelling, binding, emulsification, solubility and ability to form foams. The yeast-made BLG is an ingredient in protein drinks and snacks, and Vivici is planning to launch another product based on lactoferrin, a protein found in the milk of humans and other mammals that supports the functioning of the immune system.\n\nBut there are questions over whether it is commercially viable to produce dairy proteins through precision fermentation. One estimate of the cost of scaling up such production for large-scale commercial applications puts the price tag at US$100 million at least2, depending on the volumes involved. Vivici says it is working on ways to bring costs down and that it is confident it can reach price parity with dairy-based equivalents.\n\nIf production can be scaled up economically, fermentation-derived protein could have environmental benefits. Researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany estimate that replacing 20% of the protein consumed in the form of meat from ruminants, such as cattle and sheep, with microbial protein by 2050 could halve deforestation and related CO2 emissions, while also lowering methane emissions3.\n\nProbiotics for plants\n\nBeyond alternative sources of protein, another way to feed Earth’s growing population sustainably is to increase crop yields, leading to lower carbon emissions by reducing the need to clear forests for agriculture. This approach has merit even when cultivation is soilless, or hydroponic.\n\nThe market for ‘controlled-environment agriculture’ — which includes the production of crops in hydroponic greenhouse systems — was valued at nearly $100 billion in 2024. But, just as the microorganisms in the human gut influence health, plants have evolved to rely on bacteria and fungi in soil to thrive, using these microbes to maximize nutrient uptake and build disease resistance. This means that the crops in soilless systems develop without the support of their natural microbial partners. “There’s an enormous amount of untapped potential to improve the growth, taste and disease resistance of these crops by putting those microbes back in,” said Paul Rutten, founder and chief executive of London-based start-up Concert Bio, at F&A Next.\n\nIn 2022, Rutten, who has a PhD in plant–microbe interactions from the University of Oxford, UK, began a three-year project with growers to identify the microbiomes of crops using DNA sequencing, as well as recording their growing conditions and yields. Using a machine-learning model, he highlighted correlations between the presence of specific microbes and higher yields in conditions of varying temperature, sunlight and humidity, for example.\n\nLast November, Concert Bio launched Overture A and B, two ‘biostimulant’ bacterial products made through fermentation, on the UK market for use in soilless agriculture. Rutten says that across 14 trials, lettuce growers achieved yield increases of 9.9%, on average. Trials of several candidate probiotics for tomatoes and cucumbers are under way.\n\nBring on the bees\n\nAnother way to reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture is to address insufficient pollination. Insect pollinators are crucial for the successful production of three-quarters of crop varieties. In 2022, researchers at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, estimated that pollinator deficits reduce global yields of fruit, vegetables and nuts by 3–5%4.\n\nAgriSound, a start-up firm based in York, UK, has developed a mobile-phone-sized device that can detect low bee numbers in fields and greenhouses on the basis of the sound of their wingbeats, enabling growers to bring in more bees when needed. The technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the combinations of frequencies made by honeybees and bumblebees, and to cancel out noise (although this does not work in noisy environments, such as near major roads).\n\nThe AgriSound system uses artificial intelligence to identify the sound of honeybees’ and bumblebees’ wingbeats, and thereby determine bee numbers.Credit: Robin Wilson\n\nCasey Woodward, AgriSound’s founder, took inspiration from the acoustic systems already used to identify respiratory disease on pig farms and injurious pecking in poultry farms. Woodward told F&A Next attendees that, in trials at sites where the AgriSound system identified low bee numbers, strawberry growers increased the fruit’s weight by 8.5%, sweetness by 5% and the proportion of high-quality produce by 10% by introducing extra bees, when compared with neighbouring control locations where bee numbers were left low.\n\n“We also have evidence to show that precision pollination can extend the shelf life of strawberries by about 12 hours, which reduces waste and carbon emissions as a result,” Woodward added. The company is seeking to adapt its technology to identify other pollinators and pests.\n\nBreeding better",

          "title": "How protein-slayer drugs could beat some of the cruellest cancers",
          "authors": "Ken Garber",
          "abstract": "At three years old, Evan Lindberg was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer that develops in nerve tissue outside the brain. By that time, tumours had spread through his small body. Chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy and multiple surgeries followed. “For four years, my son never had a day off,” says Evan’s father, Gavin. “He was either in treatment or recovery. And frequently recovery was worse than the treatment.” Evan died in 2010 at the age of seven.\n\nOne of Evan’s doctors, paediatric oncologist Yael Mossé at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has long sought improved treatment options. She has worked on neuroblastoma for more than two decades, yet despite small advances, “we really have made very little progress in developing more rational or targeted therapies”, she says. That’s true in general for childhood solid tumours. Although such tumours are less common than blood cancers in children, they account for more than half of cancer-associated deaths in kids aged 0–14 years1 in the United States. These childhood cancers differ from adult ones in their biology, and thus require distinct treatments. Yet out of more than 180 cancer drugs that have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2000, fewer than a dozen have been developed specifically for children.\n\n‘Dark proteins’ hiding in our cells could hold clues to cancer and other diseases\n\nMossé is now placing her hopes on laboratory-made molecules that hijack the cell’s protein-disposal machinery. Typical drugs gum up the business end of a protein to inhibit its activity. PROTACs, short for proteolysis-targeting chimeras, eliminate the protein altogether. They do this by tethering disease-associated proteins in human cells to an enzyme that tags the protein for destruction.\n\nEnabling these fateful encounters — which biochemist Alessio Ciulli at the University of Dundee, UK, calls a protein “kiss of death” — expands the list of possible drug targets. Of the roughly 3,000 proteins known to cause cancer and other diseases, drugs approved by the FDA, for example, target fewer than 700. Most of the rest are considered ‘undruggable’, because there’s no suitable pocket in which a drug can attach and block the protein’s activity. But a PROTAC merely has to grab on; the cell’s existing machinery does the rest.\n\nAt least 30 PROTACs have entered clinical trials since 2019, when testing in humans began, mainly for cancer, but also for Parkinson’s disease, inflammatory disorders and pain. The three most advanced, for breast cancer, prostate cancer and leukaemia, are in phase III trials, the last step before market approval. Most degrade proteins that are targeted by already approved drugs.\n\nEvan Lindberg, pictured on the left with his father Gavin, died of cancer at age seven. Gavin is now a patient advocate, working with paediatric oncologist Yael Mossé (right) and others to develop treatments for childhood cancers.Credits: Wendy Lindberg, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia\n\nMossé and her colleagues are doing something different — and riskier — by going after cancer proteins that have never been drugged before. She co-leads a team that is developing PROTACs against undruggable proteins responsible for neuroblastoma and other childhood cancers, including those of the brain, liver and bone. All of the cancers form solid tumours. Mossé expects the team’s first PROTACs to enter clinical trials in the next couple of years.\n\nOther researchers are similarly aiming to degrade proteins that have long been considered untouchable, in cancer and beyond. “Showing that you can target something brand new with this technology will be a pivotal moment for the field,” says chemist Nathanael Gray at Stanford University in California, co-founder of C4 Therapeutics, a protein-degradation drug company in Watertown, Massachusetts.\n\nMore than a lab trick\n\nThe first working PROTAC was demonstrated in 2001, when Craig Crews, a chemical biologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, biochemist Raymond Deshaies, at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, and their colleagues constructed one that degraded its target protein in cell fluid from frog eggs2. At the time, most scientists viewed PROTACs as a lab trick. When Ciulli started working with them in 2009, colleagues “rolled their eyes”, he recalls. “They said, ‘PROTACs? They’ll never be drugs.’”\n\nOne early hurdle was making PROTACs small enough to penetrate cells. Another was designing them to grab onto the most abundant and efficient of the enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases. These enzymes, of which there are about 600 kinds, tag proteins for destruction by attaching chains of much smaller proteins called ubiquitins (see ‘Protein eliminated’). After a large effort, three papers in 2015 revealed potent PROTACs that almost completely eliminated target proteins in cells and mice3–5. “After those papers, there was no doubt that we could degrade proteins,” says Ciulli. “Now the whole world of targets could open up.” A co-author on one of the papers, Ciulli later helped to found Amphista Therapeutics, a protein-degradation company in Cambridge, UK.\n\nThe papers highlighted a key advantage of PROTACs. Whereas conventional drugs must take up residence on a disease-causing protein, PROTACs engage with their target briefly, send it along for destruction and move on to the next target. This catch-and-release feature means that very small doses can last for a long time. Another advantage is that PROTACs take no prisoners. Some proteins contribute to a disease in more ways than one, but by wiping out the protein entirely, a PROTAC eliminates all possible contributions.\n\nThe 2015 papers established PROTACs as a next wave of drugs. “I’ve never seen a technology that’s been more widely adopted, as quickly,” says Gray. “It’s not just little risky biotechs. All the pharma companies have advanced degrader programmes.”\n\nThis scientist treated her own cancer with viruses she grew in the lab\n\nThis all happened too late for Evan Lindberg. In 2010, his father entered him into one of Mossé’s clinical trials, testing an existing drug against a protein often corrupted in neuroblastoma. Evan’s cancer did not respond. The tumour also contained extra copies of the gene for a protein that is a notorious driver of childhood cancers, the transcription factor MYCN. MYCN turns genes on to make cells replicate during childhood development. Too much of it can transform otherwise curable cancers into aggressive killers through uncontrolled growth. But transcription factors such as MYCN are considered undruggable.\n\nAt a meeting about MYCN in 2019, Mossé realized that PROTACs could be a solution. One of the founders of the PROTAC company Nurix Therapeutics in San Francisco, California, attended the meeting, and “really motivated us to think about targeted protein degradation, and to go after MYCN, to try to really do something big”, Mossé says. Armed with a private foundation grant, she began working with Nurix. The work expanded in 2024, when a team Mossé assembled along with biochemist Martin Eilers at the University of Würzburg in Germany won a large grant from Cancer Grand Challenges, a global non-profit initiative looking to tackle childhood solid tumours.\n\nThe team, called KOODAC, for Knocking Out Oncogenic Drivers and Curing Childhood Cancers, also includes scientists in the United Kingdom, Austria and France and patient advocates on five continents. Among them are Gavin Lindberg and his wife Wendy who, after Evan died, established a charitable foundation that for the past decade has funded a research position in Mossé’s lab. The team is going after MYCN and four other protein targets. The goal is to find drugs that not only work, but are also more convenient than hospital infusions and cheap enough for purchase in low- and middle-income countries, where families often have to forgo or abandon treatment because of the cost.\n\nSlaying the childhood killers\n\nThree of the proteins the KOODAC team is targeting result from a type of genetic error that is often present in cancer. The crossing, breaking and mending of chromosomes can give rise to a new hybrid gene — a gene fusion — that has sequences from both original genes. The resulting fusion proteins are the direct cause of many leukaemias, lymphomas and childhood solid tumours. Two of these fusion proteins drive Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, devastating childhood bone and soft-tissue cancers. The third causes a rare liver cancer.\n\nAs tumour cells evolve, fusion proteins persist, making them attractive targets, says Charles Mullighan, a haematologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Mullighan and his colleagues make and test PROTACs and similar protein degraders for childhood blood cancers and brain tumours. As to whether protein degraders can cure these cancers, “there’s the potential”, says Mullighan. But he adds that one drug might not be enough. “Cancers are wily, and they can find ways around it.”\n\nIn addition to KOODAC, two other Cancer Grand Challenges teams are tackling childhood solid tumours. One team brings together researchers from nine institutions across Europe and the United States to work on protein degraders and cell therapies. The other, which includes investigators at eight institutions in the United States, the United Kingdom and France, is focused exclusively on cell therapies. Such broad academic collaborations are essential to making progress on childhood cancers, the researchers say. “For paediatric-only cancers, the market is so small it doesn’t fit the commercialization plan of a traditional pharma company,” says Catherine Bollard, co-leader of the cell-therapy team and a paediatric haematologist at Children’s National Hospital in Washington DC.\n\nThe PROTACtable universe\n\nNo PROTACs have been approved yet. The first to enter phase III trials, vepdegestrant, developed by Arvinas in New Haven, Connecticut, degrades the oestrogen receptor that most breast cancers rely on for growth. In early March, Arvinas and its partner, Pfizer, reported that the degrader was better than a standard anti-oestrogen drug at enabling trial participants whose tumours had a mutation commonly associated with breast cancer to live longer without the disease worsening (although it did not do better in an analysis that included all trial participants). “We plan to share [trial] data with global regulatory authorities to potentially support regulatory filings,” Arvinas chief medical officer Noah Berkowitz wrote in an e-mail to Nature. Two other vepdegestrant phase III trials are under way.\n\nMeanwhile, two other PROTACs have reached phase III trials. One degrades the androgen receptor that drives most metastatic prostate cancers; the other, the BTK enzyme required by chronic lymphocytic leukaemias. Drugs against these targets are already available, but advanced cancers inevitably become resistant to them.",

          "authors": "Jackson Ryan",
          "abstract": "Researchers who track publishing trends struggle to distinguish who is who among the many empty ORCID profiles.Credit: Bim/Getty\n\nJonas Müller knows all too well the drawbacks of having a common family name. In his home country of Germany, more than half a million people share his name. He also shares it with dozens of astrophysics researchers, in Germany and abroad.\n\nThat wouldn’t really be a problem if he was a carpenter, a hockey player or a nurse, but Müller is just beginning his research career, working towards a PhD at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies in Germany, where he is studying the evolution of stars. The chances that his work might be misattributed to the dozens of other ‘J. Müllers’ across his discipline are high. For that reason, he signed up for ORCID.\n\nORCID, which stands for Open Researcher and Contributor ID, was launched in 2012 as a free identification service for individuals to record their academic papers and other research activities. Researchers receive a unique 16-digit identifier that they carry with them for the entirety of their career, even if they change their name, job or institute. The platform is run by ORCID, a non-profit organization based in Bethesda, Maryland, and is funded through fees paid by member organizations. These comprise more than 1,450 stakeholders in the research ecosystem, including publishers, funders, professional associations and research organizations.\n\nSince ORCID’s launch, its lime-green logo has become a familiar sight on academic publishing websites and funding applications around the world. The service, which has some 10 million yearly active researchers — people who use it at least once a year — allows users to link publications, data sets, peer reviews, grants and other scholarly outputs in a single webpage and is integrated with many institutional repositories and publishers’ platforms.\n\nBut ORCID uptake is inconsistent between fields and career stages, and many researchers aren’t using it beyond their initial sign-up. Data from ORCID show that roughly half of active global ORCID profiles include publication data, and 69% are linked to affiliation data, such as information on employment and education. Just 35% of profiles include data on both publications and affiliations, however.\n\nStephen Porter, a higher-education researcher at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, says that although the appeal of ORCID is strong for researchers, more needs to be done to convince them to sign up in the first place, and to keep their profiles updated. “I think most scientists would agree [that ORCID] is a useful thing — but it’s very different when it comes to them actually going out and not only registering but keeping track of it.”\n\nWho’s signing up for ORCID?\n\nPorter led a study1, published in April, that surveyed almost 4,000 tenured and tenure-track faculty members across 31 public research universities in the United States. The results show high uptake among survey respondents in natural-sciences subjects, such as biological and biomedical sciences (93%), physical sciences (91%) and psychology (89%), and low uptake in humanities subjects, such as English language and literature (24%) and visual and performing arts (17%).\n\nAssistant professors were found to be more likely to have an ORCID number (80%) than were associate professors (67%) or full professors (71%). Porter and his co-authors suggest that the high adoption rates by early-career researchers are due either to their greater familiarity with technology or to their increased need for self-promotion as they work to secure tenure.\n\nWhen asked why they signed up to ORCID, 29% of survey respondents said it was a requirement when submitting a paper to a specific journal. ORCID itself reports a much higher number globally, noting that “about 75% of registrations occur because journals are asking authors to include their ORCID in new submissions”.\n\nMajor publishers, including Springer Nature, Wiley, PLOS and the Royal Society, have integrated ORCID into their submission systems, and their journals require or strongly encourage authors to submit with an ORCID number.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\nSimon Porter, vice-president of research futures at the technology company Digital Science in London and a member of the ORCID advisory board, says that rather than putting the onus on users to manually update their profiles, systems and institutions should support researchers in not just signing up, but also using ORCID. “The simple act of publishing work with an ORCID should be all that’s required to update the ORCID record” and other research-management systems, he says.\n\nAlice Meadows, co-founder of the MoreBrains Cooperative, a scholarly communications consultancy in Chichester, UK, and a former director of communications and community engagement for ORCID, agrees. ORCID was always designed to be used in conjunction with other systems, she writes in an article published by the Scholarly Kitchen in July. “It’s ORCID and, not ORCID or,” she writes.\n\nCountries that have linked ORCID to national research systems have shown success in increasing the amount of data attached to ORCID profiles. For example, Portugal’s science-funding agency, the Foundation for Science and Technology, has been promoting ORCID since 2013, and later integrated it with its national scientific CV platform, CIÊNCIAVITAE.",

          "abstract": "Third-party punishment is theorized by some scholars to be essential to the evolution of large-scale cooperation, but empirically, it often fails to bring about its desired effects. Here, we suggest that third-party punishment destabilizes cooperation when third parties have profit motives to punish. Across nine economic games and judgment experiments (including four preregistered studies), we find that when third-party punishment is profitable, rates of cooperation decrease immediately and remain lower even when punishment outcomes are optimized to support cooperative behavior. Profitable third-party punishment causes targets of punishment to anticipate antisocial punishment and perceive social norms in terms of self-interest, suggesting that the introduction of payment degrades the communicative signals that punishment is meant to convey about punishers’ intentions and social norms. Critically, participants who would benefit from increased cooperation inadvertently reduce their own monetary compensation by opting in to experimental conditions that pay punishers, suggesting that they intuitively fail to consider the signaling consequences of profit motives to punish. Implications for systems of punishment and cooperation in real-world contexts are discussed.",

          "abstract": "For over 5,000 y, chanting has been practiced across many Western and Eastern traditions. However, there is hardly any empirical research on 1) whether chants from across the globe share common acoustic properties, 2) whether these acoustic features make them distinct from other human vocalizations, and 3) the extent to which they may positively impact listeners’ well-being. Here, we collected 242 chants belonging to seven distinct traditions and associated with a wide range of language families, and compared them acoustically to a large corpus of song (n = 126) and speech (n = 616) samples from across 14 linguistic and 12 geographical regions. We show that, irrespective of language and geographical origin, chants share distinctive acoustic traits, namely relatively flat and slow-changing intonation and steady, unbroken voicing in a comfortable, rather low pitch range with a prevalence of mid-central vowels. Thus, chants are produced in a relaxed vocal tract configuration with minimal articulation. Additionally, playback experiments involving original chants (with a participant pool of 61 listeners), resynthesized chants (with 114 listeners), and fully synthetic chants (with 80 listeners) demonstrate that these acoustic characteristics enhance listeners’ perceived sensations of relaxation. Specifically, relatively flat and slow-changing intonation, combined with vowel production in a relatively relaxed vocal tract configuration, resulted in higher overall relaxation ratings. Together these results hint at a specific function of chants’ acoustic commonalities: the enhancement of well-being through relaxation.",

We study the rate of IUs in 48 languages from every continent and from 27 distinct language families. Using an analytic method to annotate natural speech recordings, we identify a low-frequency rate of IUs across the sample, with a peak at 0.6 Hz, and little variation between sexes or across the life span.

However, during the last decade, a large battery of KRAS inhibitors selective against specific mutations (KRAS G12C and KRAS G12D ), panKRAS inhibitors active against all KRAS isoforms, or even panRAS inhibitors, capable of inhibiting the three members of the RAS family, have been developed. In mice, the Kras locus is essential for embryonic development and can sustain adult homeostasis in the absence of Hras and Nras expression. Thus, we considered of interest to interrogate the role of the Kras locus in an experimental system to generate potentially relevant information regarding the use of panKRAS or panRAS inhibitors in the clinic. Here, we report that systemic ablation of Kras expression in adult mice does not induce significant changes in overall survival, body weight, glucose levels, metabolic profile, or heart function. In contrast, flow cytometry and histopathological analyses of organs such as blood, bone marrow, and spleen showed a significant increase of the myeloid lineage leading to myelomonocytic metaplasia. In this context, replacement of the KRAS isoforms by HRAS is sufficient to maintain adult homeostasis, suggesting that the unique properties of the Kras locus are primarily due to its pattern of expression rather than to the activity of its gene products.",

This analysis also revealed a unique metal-associated domain that likely functions as a molecular spacer and generated a working hypothesis detailing the structural mechanism behind the enzyme’s high substrate specificity.

As these murals become integral parts of cultural heritage, finding efficient strategies for their conservation is crucial. However, their typical large surface areas, heterogeneous materials, and high variability in exposure to environmental and pollution factors pose significant challenges in establishing appropriate analytical strategies to obtain the necessary information. This study proposes a multiscale and multitechnique noninvasive approach to investigate and monitor street art murals in situ. By combining portable point techniques—such as external reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy—with visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging, the mural’s composition across a square meter surface could be analyzed. Additionally, multispectral imaging mounted on a drone provided a global reconstruction and characterization of the overall mural. This method was complemented by microdestructive laboratory analyses of selected samples, using pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector and tandem mass spectrometry, to further investigate selected samples and support noninvasive results. The approach was applied to the iconic mural “Musica Popolare” (2017) by Orticanoodles in Milan, Italy, revealing detailed information about its pigments, binders, fillers, and degradation. The findings demonstrate the potential of this integrated methodology for the effective material identification, conservation assessment, and short-and long-term monitoring of urban heritage.",

Global temperature continues to rise, but how climate warming affects microbial diversity and its capacity to sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) remains uncertain. Here, by conducting a global meta-analysis with 251 paired observations from 102 studies, we showed that, on average, warming reduced bacterial and fungal diversity (measured by richness and Shannon index) by 16.0 and 19.7%, respectively, and SOC by 18.1%. The negative responses of both soil bacterial and fungal diversity to warming became more pronounced with increasing warming magnitude, experimental duration, and decreasing soil nitrogen availability. Under the worst-case climate warming scenario (2010 to 2070, 3.4 increase in °C), soil bacterial diversity and fungal diversity are projected to reduce by 56% and 81%, respectively, over 60 y. Importantly, in addition to the direct impact of warming on SOC, warming-induced declines in microbial diversity also contributed to SOC losses. We highlight that prolonged warming could substantially reduce soil microbial diversity and decrease SOC sequestration, accelerating future warming and underscoring the urgent need for decisive actions to mitigate global climate change.",

          "abstract": "Studies from the 1980s and 1990s conducted in Italy, where malaria was once endemic, hypothesized that individuals with erythrocytes deficient in flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)—collectively known as flavins—are partially protected against malaria. The condition was reported to be familial, consistent with a genetic element. This hypothesis, however, has never been tested. Using an erythrocyte FAD-dependent glutathione reductase activity assay, we identified individuals with flavin-deficient erythrocytes (FDE) in Ferrara, Italy (23% of 150 individuals screened), and in Huye, Rwanda (13% of 169 individuals). None of the individuals with FDE had a dietary riboflavin deficiency. Importantly, FDE from individuals in Ferrara, as well as erythrocytes depleted of flavins in vitro by riboflavin starvation, inhibited the intraerythrocytic proliferation of Plasmodium falciparum . We provide evidence that these erythrocytes are susceptible to oxidative stress, potentially explaining their inhibitory effect on parasite proliferation. Genetic analysis identified mutations in the FAD synthase gene of three individuals with FDE from Huye, consistent with a potential genetic basis.",

          "abstract": "Rates of phenotypic evolution vary across traits, and these evolutionary patterns themselves evolve. Understanding how development contributes to such patterns remains a challenge because it requires large-scale measurement of phenotypic variation resulting from random mutations across multiple species. Using the experimentally tractable system of nematode vulval development, we quantified the evolution and mutational sensitivity of six cell fates across two clades. First, we find that the cell whose fate evolves fastest is distinct for each clade: P3.p in Caenorhabditis and P4.p in Oscheius . Second, we show that this evolutionary pattern matches the pattern of variation within species of each clade. Third, we find that within each clade, the differential effect on each cell of random mutation, quantified as their mutational phenotypic variance, is sufficient to explain the observed phenotypic evolution. Finally, we propose that the difference between clades is explained by a simple spatial shift across cells of the sensitive region in a Wnt dose–response curve. These findings underscore the importance of integrating the evolving structure of the genotype–phenotype map and measures of developmental sensitivity into the understanding of phenotypic change at both micro- and macroevolutionary scales.",

ZNF93 depletion impairs DNA synthesis, activates replication and DNA damage checkpoints, and triggers proinflammatory phenotypes. Conversely, its overexpression enhances resistance to exogenous genotoxic stress, mirroring the effects observed with APOBEC3B depletion.

This sequestration process is mediated by the parasite’s P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesins, which bind select endothelial cell receptors. A subset of PfEMP1 binding human endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) through their cysteine-rich interdomain region alpha 1 (CIDRα1) domains drives the pathogenesis to severe malaria. Despite high sequence diversity among CIDRα1 domains, individuals living in malaria-endemic regions become immune to severe disease in part through acquisition of antibodies inhibiting the PfEMP1–EPCR interaction. Here, we demonstrate an approach to identify pathogen-specific human monoclonal antibodies from plasma, combining mass spectrometry analysis of antigen-purified polyclonal plasma IgG and Ig transcript sequencing. We identified a clonal family of broadly reactive and EPCR binding-inhibitory human monoclonal antibodies against CIDRα1. The antibodies, isolated from a 9-y-old child, exhibited potent inhibition of EPCR binding broadly across CIDRα1 domains as well as binding of infected erythrocytes to EPCR. Structural analysis of one antibody variant complexed with CIDRα1 revealed a shared epitope of the clonal antibody family overlapping the EPCR binding site and the epitopes of two previously identified monoclonal antibodies, C7 and C74, with similar functional patterns. However, although C7, C74, and 110-3 antibodies all depend on the same few residues conserved in CIDRα1 to retain EPCR binding, the 110-3 antibodies contact additional variable residues, reducing their breadth of reactivity across the CIDRα1 family. These data bolster the hypothesis that broadly inhibitory antibodies against severe malaria-associated PfEMP1 target similar epitopes and are commonly developed in malaria-exposed individuals.",

          "abstract": "Mutation rates have long been measured as averages across many genomic positions. Recently, a method to measure the rates of individual mutations was applied to a narrow region in the human hemoglobin subunit beta ( HBB ) gene containing the site of the hemoglobin S (HbS) mutation as well as to a paralogous hemoglobin subunit delta ( HBD ) region, in sperm samples from sub-Saharan African and northern European donors [Melamed et al ., Genome Res. 32 , 488–498 (2022)]. The HbS mutation, which protects against malaria while causing sickle-cell anemia in homozygotes, originated de novo significantly more frequently in the HBB gene in Africans compared to the other three test cases combined (the European HBB gene and the European and African HBD gene). Here, we apply this approach to the human apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) gene containing the site of the G1 1024A→G mutation, which protects against African sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense while causing a substantially increased risk of chronic kidney disease in homozygotes. We find that the 1024A→G mutation is the mutation of highest de novo origination rate and deviates most from the genome-wide average rate for its type (A→G) compared to all other observable mutations in the region and that it originates de novo significantly more frequently in Africans than in Europeans—i.e., in the population where it is of adaptive significance. The results are unexpected given the notion that the probability of a specific mutational event is independent of its value to the organism and underscore the importance of studying mutation rates at the individual-mutation resolution.",

In the Critically Endangered Balearic shearwater ( Puffinus mauretanicus ), this dilemma is exacerbated by a limited understanding of the extent and consequences of hybridization with the Yelkouan shearwater ( Puffinus yelkouan ). This knowledge gap has limited the scope of science-based conservation strategies to avoid the Balearic shearwater’s imminent extinction. Here, we investigate shearwater hybridization dynamics and their effect on genome-wide diversity in the Balearic shearwater. Divergence dating, demographic modeling, and admixture analyses suggest that these two poorly differentiated shearwater lineages have experienced recurrent episodes of divergence and widespread hybridization during glacial cycles. Selection scans reveal a 500 kb region hosting an adaptive haplotype that potentially underpins interspecific differences in migratory behavior and which has been repeatedly introgressed between the two taxa. Moreover, we show that interspecific gene flow has prevented increases in homozygosity and genetic load, and through forward simulations, we illustrate how it can buffer the negative effects of future population bottlenecks in the Balearic shearwater. Our findings illustrate how introgression can be crucial for maintaining genetic diversity in threatened taxa and highlight the need for considering the protection of hybridization in conservation plans.",

Studies usually focus on a single second messenger, and the mechanisms and physiological significance of the cross-regulation between different nucleotide second messengers are often unclear. Here, we show that Shewanella putrefaciens can form biofilms in both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor media. While both are controlled by c-di-GMP, the regulatory models differ. Under low nutrient conditions, cross-regulation of cAMP-CRP and c-di-GMP occurs at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels, thereby controlling biofilm development. During the early stages of biofilm development, cAMP-CRP directly promotes the transcription of a PDE gene, lrbR , by LrbA. Additionally, cAMP-CRP recruits LrbR to BpfD to suppress early biofilm formation via LrbR-dependent local degradation of c-di-GMP. Finally, as intracellular LrbR levels decrease, cAMP-CRP-BpfD enables a rapid shift to biofilm development and supports biofilm maintenance. Under high nutrient conditions, this cross-regulation does not occur, resulting in a positive correlation between global c-di-GMP levels and biofilm biomass. The identification of distinct modes of biofilm regulation in different nutrients will provide a theoretical basis for future targeted control of biofilm formation in different nutrient environments.",

We addressed the role of immune surveillance in 76 cervical biopsies (normal = 23, HPV+ benign = 16, HPV+ precancer = 37) by studying the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and the expression of the immune modulators PDL1, ICOSL, and miR-155 and compared the data to 101 cervical squamous cell carcinomas. In the normal cervix, ICOSL expression was restricted to the endocervical epithelia whereas neither miR-155 nor PDL1 were detected. MiR-155 was up-regulated in both the benign (88%) and precancerous (92%) HPV squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and colocalized to cells in the upper part of the lesion that is the area with productive viral infection. Both PDL1 (95%) and ICOSL (89%) were only evident in the precancerous SIL and each localized to squamous cells in the basal aspect that lacked replicating virus. In both microinvasive and invasive cervical squamous cell cancer miR-155 expression remained high (83%) as did PDL1 expression (80%) but ICOSL detection was reduced to 17%. Infiltration by CD8+ T cells was intense in the invasive lesions and these cells were mostly inactive as determined by the lack of granzyme B colocalization. It is concluded that miR-155 expression is a marker of HPV infection in both benign and precancerous lesions, whereas the approximately 10% of the latter lesions that progress to cancer gain PDL1 and lose ICOSL expression, which are important factors in avoiding immune surveillance.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is generally expected to stimulate plant carbon (C) sequestration and promote tree growth, thereby mitigating atmospheric CO 2 accumulation. Yet, the magnitude of N deposition contribution to forest productivity remains contentious. While correlative studies suggest substantial plant growth enhancement, controlled fertilization experiments typically demonstrate a limited impact. This discrepancy may arise from whether or not to consider canopy N uptake processes. Here, we conducted a 10-y field experiment comparing canopy addition of N (CAN) with understory addition of N (UAN) at the rate of 0, 25, and 50 kg N ha –1 y –1 in a temperate deciduous forest in central China. We show that CAN significantly enhanced net primary productivity by 37.0% over control, driven by enhanced leaf litterfall, wood and fine root production, whereas UAN effects were marginal (8%). 15 N isotopic tracing revealed that CAN, through enhanced plant N uptake and increased ecosystem N retention, yielded a 3.5-fold higher C sequestration efficiency (∆C/∆N) of 54.5 ± 7.7 kg C kg –1 N, than UAN (12.2 ± 3.4 kg C kg –1 N) resulted from greater N loss through leaching. Physiological measurements indicated CAN enhanced leaf photosynthetic rates, modified leaf morphology, and extended leaf lifespan via delayed senescence. These findings provide robust empirical evidence that canopy N uptake is crucial for maximizing N-induced forest productivity, thereby holding significant implications for refining global C models and urging modelers to incorporate canopy processes for more accurate projections of future C sinks and climate change mitigation strategies.",

          "abstract": "Most cytoplasmic RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to identify their genomic RNA (gRNA) as the sole RNA species to be packaged into assembled virions. Coronaviruses exhibit highly selective packaging of their gRNA, in spite of the presence of a large excess of subgenomic viral and host RNA in infected cells. Failure to accomplish this selectivity does not impair virion assembly but renders the virus vulnerable to host innate immunity. In the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) packaging selectivity is brought about by a packaging signal (PS), an RNA structure found exclusively in gRNA and absent from subgenomic RNAs. However, it is not well resolved how virion structural proteins participate in the recognition of the PS. Previous studies with virions have shown that the nucleocapsid (N) protein carboxy-terminal RNA-binding domain (CTD) and the carboxy-terminal tail (domain N3) both have roles in PS recognition. Separately, work with a virus-like particle system has implicated the viral membrane (M) protein as the main factor in this process. Here, we pinpoint key amino acids in the CTD and domain N3 that govern selective gRNA packaging into virions, and we provide genetic evidence that the M protein endodomain also plays a required role. We show that the N protein CTD is the primary determinant of PS recognition, and we localize residues in the CTD structure that are critical for specific and nonspecific RNA binding.",

Activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2) is the only type I receptor among the seven TGF-β type I receptors that interacts with both activin and BMP ligands. With BMPs, ALK2 acts as a signaling receptor to activate small mothers against decapentaplegic 1 (SMAD1)/5/8 signaling. Alternatively, with activins, such as Activin A (ActA), ALK2 forms nonsignaling complexes that negatively regulate ALK2 and ActA signaling. To gain insight into how ALK2 interacts with two distinct classes of ligands, we resolved the cryoelectron microscopy structure of ALK2 in complex with the type II receptor, ActRIIB, and the ligand, BMP6, in parallel with the corresponding structure with ALK3 for direct comparison. These structures demonstrate that ALK2 and ALK3 utilize different mechanisms to interact with BMP6 at the wrist interface, with ALK2 relying on BMP6 glycosylation and ALK3 relying on a salt bridge. Modeling of ALK2:ActA reveals that binding relies on ActA’s fingertip region, mirroring the interaction of ActA with its other receptor, ALK4. Our results demonstrate that ALK2 is a “hybrid” receptor that incorporates features of BMP type I receptors such as ALK3 at the wrist interface and an activin type I receptor such as ALK4 at the fingertip.",

However, the responses of tropical forests to climate change across large-scale environmental gradients remain largely unexplored. Using long-term data over 66,000 trees of more than 2,500 species occurring over 3,500 m elevation along the hyperdiverse Amazon-to-Andes elevational gradients in Peru and Bolivia, we assessed community-level shifts in species composition over a 40+ y time span. We tested the thermophilization hypothesis, which predicts an increase in the relative abundances of species from warmer climates through time. Additionally, we examined the relative contributions of tree mortality, recruitment, and growth to the observed compositional changes. Mean thermophilization rates (TR) across the Amazon-to-Andes gradient were slow relative to regional temperature change. TR were positive and more variable among Andean forest plots compared to Amazonian plots but were highest at midelevations around the cloud base. Across all elevations, TR were driven primarily by tree mortality and decreased growth of highland (cool-adapted) species rather than an influx of lowland species with higher thermal optima. Given the high variability of community-level responses to warming along the elevational gradients, the high tree mortality, and the slower-than-warming rates of compositional change, we conclude that most tropical tree species, and especially lowland Amazonian tree species, will not be able to escape current or future climate change through upward range shifts, causing fundamental changes to composition and function in Earth’s highest diversity forests.",

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown poor efficacy in PDAC, partly due to the desmoplastic stroma and low immunogenicity. Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) promotes both fibrosis and immune evasion, making it a compelling target for TME remodeling. Here, we develop a dual-action, programmable immunoprobiotic delivery system (EcN@Nbs-NP@API-1) that combines Pin1 inhibition with PD-L1 blockade to enhance immunotherapy. This system uses Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to selectively deliver nanoparticles encapsulating the Pin1 inhibitor API-1 to PDAC, enabling sustained release to degrade the fibrotic stroma and upregulate PD-L1 on tumor cells, promoting immune infiltration. Engineered EcN also produces anti-PD-L1 nanobodies in situ, synergizing with API-1 to boost CD8 + T cell–mediated immunity. In orthotopic PDAC mouse models, this strategy remodels the TME, enhances immune cell infiltration, and improves antitumor response while minimizing systemic toxicity. Moreover, it shows efficacy in other ECM-rich tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting its broader potential.

The blocked head configuration (BHC) of the IHM is unusual because its light chain binding region is held in an exaggerated prestroke angle stabilized by interactions with its own S2 tail. An additional partial OFF-state, where the second head of the IHM is not folded back onto the blocked head, has been proposed, which still has the blocked head interacting with S2. Many mutations in the human β-cardiac myosin gene that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are thought to destabilize (decrease the population of) the OFF-states. The effects of pathogenic mutations on the folded back structural states are often studied using indirect assays, including a single-ATP turnover assay that detects the biochemical state of myosin functionally. Here, we use a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based sensor for direct quantification in solution of the myosin BHC state. Using the FRET sensor, we provide evidence that the myosin tail acts as an activator of the recovery stroke transition after ATP binding to poststroke state apomyosin and that BHC formation is rapid after ATP binding and depends on formation of the prestroke state. We propose that the positively charged loop 2 of the prestroke state head interacts with the Ring 2 cluster of negatively charged residues on the S2 tail to form a preBHC state that facilitates BHC state formation.",

          "abstract": "The fast-paced improvements in mortality in high-income countries since the early 1900s have led to a sustained increase in life expectancy. However, whether this linear trend will continue or life expectancy gains will decelerate in the near future remains unclear. To answer this question, we apply multiple established and recently developed mortality forecasting methods to estimate cohort life expectancy for individuals born between 1939 and 2000 in 23 high-income countries. Across all forecasting methods, our results robustly and consistently indicate a deceleration in cohort life expectancy. The previously observed pace of improvement, 0.46 y per cohort, declines by 37% to 52%, depending on the method used. Robustness checks suggest that these findings are unlikely to be solely due to downward bias in cohort life expectancy forecasts. Furthermore, an age-decomposition analysis indicates that this deceleration is primarily driven by a slower pace of mortality improvement at very young ages. Over half of the total deceleration is attributable to mortality trends under age 5, while more than two-thirds is explained by mortality trends under age 20. This pattern had already emerged in the observed data for the cohorts included in our analysis. Thus, even if these estimates turned out to be overly pessimistic, it is unlikely that the deceleration will reverse in the near future.",

          "abstract": "It is crucial for both animal evolution and engineering to optimize the relative size of structures. Animal wings are no exception, every structural design having its limits in terms of achievable size and performance. For instance, many microinsects have bristled wings, which are more efficient at small scales than the membranous wings common in larger insects. However, the limitations and the optimal characteristics of bristled wings remain largely underinvestigated. We collected morphological and kinematic data on a variety of beetles ranging between 0.3 and 5 mm in wing length. This was followed by a theoretical analysis to explain from the mechanical standpoint the morphological traits and allometric scalings observed in the data. We derived functional dependencies for parameters such as the number of bristles, bristle length and diameter, size of the wing blade, etc., from considerations of wing inertia minimization under the aerodynamic and structural stiffness constraints. The solution of the optimization problem reveals scaling relationships aligning with empirical trends, which suggests that the reduction of wing membrane during miniaturization can be explained by mechanical optimality. Thus, scaling of the number of bristles and the average gap width between bristles follows directly from the aerodynamic condition of maintaining low permeability, while the bristle diameter and length are determined mainly by the structural stiffness requirement. Similar mechanical arguments are likely applicable to other miniature animals that propel through fluids.",

          "abstract": "Heart failure is a leading cause of death worldwide, and even with current treatments, the 5-y transplant-free survival rate is only ~50 to 70%. As such, there is a need to develop new treatments for patients that improve survival and quality of life. Recently, there have been efforts to develop small molecules for heart failure that directly target components of the sarcomere, including cardiac myosin. Danicamtiv is one of these molecules; however, its direct effects on myosin’s single molecule mechanics and kinetics are not well understood. Using optical trapping techniques, stopped flow transient kinetics, and in vitro reconstitution assays, we found that danicamtiv reduces the size of cardiac myosin’s working stroke without affecting actomyosin detachment kinetics at the level of individual crossbridges. We demonstrate that danicamtiv accelerates actomyosin association kinetics, leading to increased recruitment of myosin crossbridges and subsequent thin filament activation at physiologically relevant calcium concentrations. We demonstrate important mechanistic differences with another cardiac myosin binding myotrope, omecamtiv mecarbil. Finally, we computationally model how the observed changes in mechanics and kinetics at the level of single crossbridges can contribute to increased cardiac contraction. Taken together, our results have important implications for the design of sarcomeric-targeting compounds for heart failure.",

Plethora of methods have been proposed to reveal subsets of densely interconnected nodes using criteria such as the modularity index. These approaches have been successful for undirected graphs but directed edge information has not yet been dealt with in a satisfactory way. Here, we revisit the concept of directed communities as a mapping between sending and receiving communities. This translates into a definition that we term bimodularity. Using convex relaxation, bimodularity can be optimized with the singular value decomposition of the directed modularity matrix. Subsequently, we propose an edge-based clustering approach to reveal the directed communities including their mappings. The feasibility of the framework is illustrated on a synthetic model and further applied to the neuronal wiring diagram of the Caenorhabditis elegans , for which it yields meaningful feedforward loops of the head and body motion systems.

          "abstract": "Phytophthora soja e-induced root rot poses a major threat to soybean production. While the molecular mechanisms underlying soybean– P. sojae interactions have been extensively studied, their biochemical basis remains largely unexplored. Previous research has identified key metabolic modules involved in pathogen defense, but structural diversity has largely been constrained by studies on single soybean accessions. Here, we broadened the chemical search space to a diverse soybean germplasm collection using high-throughput metabolomics as a powerful tool for comprehensive metabolic profiling. Chemical classes of lipids and phenylpropanoids again retrieved the most pronounced responses upon P. sojae infection in general. A two-layer analytical strategy further finely resolved metabolites into pathogenesis-, resistance-, and tolerance-type accumulation patterns, leading to the identification of cinnamaldehyde and coumestrol as potent defense metabolites. Bioassays validated cinnamaldehyde directly and strongly inhibited cyst germination and mycelial growth, and coumestrol, a benzofuran-type metabolite, exhibited broad-spectrum activity against spore germination as an identified phytoalexin. Multiomics analyses nailed down the candidate of coumestrol biosynthesis genes, and genetically overexpression of regulatory genes ( Dir2a/4a/4b ) in hairy root systems increased coumestrol accumulation thus positively correlating with improved host resistance. Interestingly, tolerance-type compounds may serve distinct ecological roles, as exemplified by daidzein, which, despite being classified as a tolerance-type metabolite, recruits more zoospores facilitating secondary infection in fact. This study highlights a systematic approach for population-level investigations and emphasizes the necessity of integrating bioinformatics with experimental validation to accurately predict metabolite or gene ecological functions.",

          "abstract": "The D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) is subject to light-induced damage. In plants, D1 photodamage activates translation of chloroplast psbA mRNA encoding D1, providing D1 for PSII repair. Three D1 assembly factors have been implicated in the regulatory mechanism: HCF244 and RBD1 activate psbA translation, whereas HCF136 represses psbA translation in the dark. To clarify the regulatory circuit, we analyzed psbA ribosome occupancy in dark-adapted and illuminated rbd1 and rbd1;hcf136 double mutants in Arabidopsis and in Zm- hcf244 and Zm- hcf244; Zm- hcf136 double mutants in maize. The results show that RBD1 is required for light-induced psbA translation but has only a small effect on psbA ribosome occupancy in the dark. RBD1 is not required for psbA translation when HCF136 is absent, indicating that RBD1 activates psbA translation in the light by inhibiting HCF136’s repressive effect. By contrast, HCF244 is required to recruit ribosomes to psbA mRNA in light, dark, and in the absence of HCF136. We demonstrate further that HCF244 is not required for the translational activator HCF173 to bind the psbA 5’UTR. These results show that RBD1 is central to the perception of the D1 photodamage that triggers D1 synthesis and that it activates psbA translation by relieving repression by an HCF136-dependent assembly intermediate. HCF244 activates downstream of those events without impacting HCF173’s binding to psbA mRNA. The results implicate a feature of nascent D1 that is affected by both HCF136 and RBD1 as the signal that reports D1 photodamage to regulate psbA translation rate as needed for PSII repair.",

In this study, we used neural network models trained on natural speech input to examine how these efficient representations emerge. Our models show that multiple phonological systems can be organized through parallel representations, preserving the unique aspects of each language while maintaining shared articulatory features. This parallel structure scaled effectively from two to three languages without needing additional neural architecture, highlighting the inherent efficiency in multilingual processing. Furthermore, the development of phonological representations varied based on the timing of language exposure, showing how earlier-learned languages shape the acquisition of subsequent ones. These findings imply that the human ability to speak multiple languages may arise from general principles of neural organization that optimize shared resources while maintaining essential distinctions between languages.

Although the sensorimotor system is broadly organized somatotopically, higher-level sensorimotor areas encode action-type information for reaching and grasping actions—regardless of the acting body part. Does the brain similarly support generalization across acting body parts for more evolutionarily recent actions, such as tool-use? We tested whether there is a body-part-independent action-type organization in sensorimotor areas by examining fMRI responses for tool-use actions that participants performed with their hands or feet. We additionally included individuals born without hands to test whether hand sensorimotor experience is necessary for the development of this action-type organization. Across analyses, we found a consistent dissociation in the motor system. The primary sensorimotor cortices encoded concrete, body-part specific information in both groups. In contrast, higher-level motor areas within the tool-use network represent abstract, action-type information independent of the body part for both groups. Together, our results suggest that the hierarchical organization of the motor system is not dependent on a long evolutionary history of an action. Further, this organization is not dependent on an individual’s manual sensorimotor experience. Our results also show that the functional reorganization in congenital handlessness follows the hierarchical organization of the intact cortex, revealing the limitations of brain plasticity. Finally, the results support using a readout of a more abstract code for hierarchical brain–computer interfaces.",

Quantitative data on the abundance of de novo mutations within plants or animals are limited, as new mutations are often rare within a tissue and fall below the limits of current sequencing depths and error rates. Here, we show that mutations induced by the maize Mutator (Mu) transposon can be reliably quantified down to a detection limit of 1 part in 16,000. We measured the abundance of millions of de novo Mu insertions across four tissue types. Within a tissue, the distribution of de novo Mu allele frequencies was highly reproducible between plants, showing that, despite the stochastic nature of mutation, repeated statistical patterns of mutation abundance emerge. In contrast, there were significant differences in the allele frequency distribution between tissues. At the extremes, root was dominated by a small number of highly abundant de novo insertions, while endosperm was characterized by thousands of insertions at low allele frequencies. Finally, we used the measured pollen allele frequencies to reinterpret a classic genetic experiment, showing that evidence for late Mu activity in pollen is better explained by cell division statistics.

GCPs undergo high proliferation in the postnatal cerebellum under Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) activation, but the type of DNA lesions that require the function of the BRCA2 to prevent tumorigenesis remains unknown. To identify such lesions, we assessed both GCP neurodevelopment and tumor formation using a mouse model with deletion of exons three and four of Brca2 in the central nervous system, coupled with global Trp53 loss. Brca2 Δex3-4 ;Trp53 −/− animals developed SHH subgroup medulloblastomas with complete penetrance. Whole-genome sequencing of the tumors identified structural variants with breakpoints enriched in areas overlapping putative G-quadruplexes (G4s). Brca2 -deficient GCPs exhibited decreased replication speed in the presence of the G4-stabilizer pyridostatin. Pif1 helicase, which resolves G4s during replication, was highly upregulated in tumors, and Pif1 knockout in primary medulloblastoma tumor cells resulted in increased genome instability upon pyridostatin treatment. These data suggest that G4s may represent sites prone to replication stalling in highly proliferative GCPs and without BRCA2, G4s become a source of genome instability. Tumor cells upregulate G4-resolving helicases to facilitate rapid proliferation through G4s highlighting PIF1 helicase as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of BRCA2-deficient medulloblastomas.",

Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving ∼ 10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we reexamined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers.

China’s Clean Air Action (CAA), which was launched in 2013, provides an excellent opportunity for investigating interannual variations in source contributions and validate the accuracy of EIs. Here, we present an 11-y (2008–2018) record of the BC concentration and its source-diagnostic radiocarbon ( 14 C) and stable carbon isotope ( 13 C) signatures at a receptor site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, South China. The results revealed that the implementation of the CAA (2014–2018) led to a 41% reduction in the BC concentration compared with that in the preaction period (2008–2013). There is a large and systemic discrepancy over the whole period in the contribution of biomass burning to BC in South China between predictions from technology-based EIs (4 to 9%) and these source-diagnostic dual-isotopic fingerprints of actual ambient aerosols (21 to 32%). Observational constraints by source-diagnostic δ 13 C/Δ 14 C isotope measurements revealed that the reduction in biomass burning contributed 22% to the decrease in BC associated with the CAA, whereas predictions from EIs assigned a much smaller fraction. These results emphasize the need for observation-based source diagnostics of changing BC emission sources. Detailed source apportionment using independent δ 13 C/Δ 14 C isotope methodology is crucial for refining air pollution control strategies and improving the accuracy of models used for assessing the air quality and climate effects of BC in China and elsewhere.",

While many of its core components have been well characterized, the relevance of proteins such as FliO, which are inconsistently annotated and poorly conserved at the sequence level, has remained ambiguous in their evolutionary and functional status. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic and structural analysis of FliO across &gt;30,000 representative genomes spanning &gt;100 bacterial phyla. Additionally, during this analysis, we found that approximately 40% of bacterial genomes contain flagellar genes—significantly fewer than previously reported. Using a custom pipeline combining low-threshold Hidden Markov models searches, operon context analysis, and structural information, we demonstrate that FliO is present in ~95% of genomes encoding the core flagellar components FliP, FliQ, and FliR. This suggests that FliO is a nearly ubiquitous and ancestral core component of the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS). FliO exhibits considerable structural diversity, including lineage-specific acquisitions of LysM and AMIN domains. We identify FliO homologs not only in canonical flagellar systems but also in some virulence-associated T3SS and even some nonflagellated organisms, suggesting functional repurposing and highlighting its functional plasticity. Functional studies in Campylobacter jejuni reveal that FliO and its AMIN domain are critical for efficient amphitrichous flagellation, membrane stability of the export gate component FlhB, and colonization of the host. These findings establish FliO as a core, yet evolutionarily dynamic, component of flagella and provide insights into the evolution and diversification of bacterial secretion systems.",

However, efforts to address the homochirality problem have often focused on a single compound, a single molecular class, or invoke an extraterrestrial origin. Here, we emphasize the importance of achieving homochirality across an entire prebiotic chemical network and explore a terrestrial pathway for its emergence. This pathway is supported by recent experimental results from several independent studies, as well as analyses of pristine asteroid materials. Our analysis identifies the genome as a key site for achieving network-scale homochirality on early Earth and addresses the opposite handedness of D -nucleic acids and L -peptides in biology through nonenzymatic, stereoselective coded peptide synthesis.",

We leveraged spatially explicit tree inventory data from the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP) in Puerto Rico to validate soil eDNA as a spatially explicit indicator of tree diversity/composition. Using a comprehensive local chloroplast trnL -P6 reference library, we analyzed soil samples at multiple scales through eDNA trnL -P6 metabarcoding. We compared eDNA taxonomic diversity/composition, considering several bioinformatic thresholds, with inventory data across a range of spatial scales, as well as random points to compare observed correlations with random expectations. Despite considerable fine-scale heterogeneity in soil plant eDNA composition, we detected 53 tree Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) across the LFDP, corresponding to 68% of tree OTUs from the census data. Encouragingly, this equated to 98% of the total basal area (and 98% of the total stems). An initial confusion matrix evaluation suggested a highly localized eDNA signal (within 5 m of the sampled locations). However, comparison with random expectations revealed a lack of support for a fine-scale spatial signal due to misclassification (i.e., eDNA false presence or/and false absence) of relatively common taxa. Our study shows that “universal” PCR primer metabarcoding of tree eDNA in tropical soils may be useful for assessing dominant taxa at landscape scales, but not for spatially explicit characterization of rare species and community composition at local scales.",

          "abstract": "Disulfide bonds stabilize many bioactive peptides, but their susceptibility to reduction under physiological conditions limits broad applicability in biotechnology. PapB is a promiscuous radical S -adenosyl-L-methionine enzyme that is involved in the maturation of PapA, which is a ribosomally produced and posttranslationally modified polypeptide. PapB introduces six thioether linkages between internal Cys residues and carbon atom that is α to the side-chain carboxylate of Asp/Glu residues C-terminal to the Cys residues. Herein, we show that PapB also efficiently couples an internal Cys thiol to the C-terminal carboxylate of peptides terminating in D- or β-amino acids, forming α- or β-thioether macrocycles. Moreover, PapB tolerates β- and N-methyl amino acids within the peptide, resulting in the formation of macrocycles that are comprised entirely of unnatural amino acids, such as peptides containing all β-residues. These findings establish PapB as a sequence-agnostic thioether ligase for efficient C-terminal macrocyclization. Our work expands the enzymatic toolbox for constructing conformationally constrained peptides for therapeutics and chemical biology.",

          "abstract": "Intracellular multivesicular bodies (MVBs) act as sites of assembly and release of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) in macrophages and microglia. Recent work has shown that processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into a C-terminal fragment (CTF), termed C99, inhibits HIV-1 access to CD63+ MVBs and to counteract this, HIV-1 Group-specific antigen (Gag) increases C99 processing into toxic amyloids. However, the underlying reasons for this negative interplay between Gag and C99 remain unclear. Here, we show that HIV-1 Gag polyprotein and APP processing pathways intersect and compete, relying in different ways on two vesicular trafficking components: the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport protein, TSG101, and vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) subunit, VPS4A. VPS4A plays a complex role in infection by both directly regulating virion production and the abundance of distinct CTFs with differing subcellular localizations and effects on infection. Meanwhile, APP and C99’s use of TSG101 for insertion into vesicles limits Gag access to MVBs. Depletion of TSG101 resulted in impaired Gag localization to MVBs and processing into mature virions, and this could be partially reversed by codepletion of APP. By contrast, modulation of TSG101 or APP levels had no effect on the localization patterns of a Gag-P6 mutant that is unable to bind TSG101, while this mutant also failed to promote C99 degradation. Our findings reveal how CTF processing and HIV-1 maturation at MVBs converge in complex ways around VPS4A and TSG101, which in turn underlies how these processes negatively influence one another during virus replication in microglia.",

Being able to quantify dependencies between these variables would help us discover novel relationships between variables of interest. Simple measures of dependence, such as Pearson correlation, are fast to compute, but limited in that they are designed to detect linear relationships between variables. Complex measures are known with the ability to detect any kind of dependence, but they do not readily scale to many modern datasets of interest. We introduce the InterDependence Score (IDS), a scalable measure of dependence that captures linear and various nonlinear dependencies between random variables. Our IDS algorithm is motivated by a dependence measure defined in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, capable of capturing any type of dependence, and a fast (linear time) algorithm that neural networks natively implement to compute dependencies between random variables. We apply IDS to identify 1) relevant variables for predictive modeling tasks, 2) sets of words forming topics from millions of documents, and 3) sets of genes related to “gene-expression programs” in tens of millions of cells. We provide an efficient implementation that computes IDS between billions of pairs of variables across millions of samples in several hours on a single GPU. Given its speed and effectiveness in identifying nonlinear dependencies, we envision IDS will be a valuable tool for uncovering insights from scientific data.",

          "abstract": "Extrinsic apoptosis is initiated by signaling from death receptors, leading to the assembly of RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8 complex. Subsequently, caspase-8 forms a filamentous structure through the oligomerization of its tandem death effector domain (tDED), resulting in caspase activation and cell death. Although the DED of FADD ( FADD DED) is homologous to the tDEDs of caspase-8 ( casp8 tDED) and both oligomerize to function, the functional form of FADD DED oligomer in extrinsic apoptosis remains unclear. Here, using cryogenic-electron microscopy, we elucidate the structure of FADD DED filaments comprising three helical chains assembled through three types of iterative interactions. Mutations disrupting FADD DED filament formation impair the recruitment of RIPK1 and caspase-8, and abrogate the cell death response, suggesting that FADD DED filamentation represents an important mechanistic step in the initiation of TNF-induced extrinsic apoptosis. Contrary to the belief that the homotypic death domains of RIPK1 and FADD are solely responsible for their interaction, we here show this interaction requires FADD DED filamentation. Furthermore, cFLIP can disrupt FADD DED filaments, uncovering an additional antiapoptotic mechanism of cFLIP beyond its disruption of caspase-8 filament. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that FADD DED filament thermodynamically favors casp8 tDED monomer over FADD DED monomer, thus explaining the hierarchy and stoichiometry of FADD/caspase-8 complex assembly. These findings highlight the hitherto unappreciated roles of FADD DED filament formation in extrinsic apoptosis.",

Although there is a well-established link between ENOD40 and nodulation, it is not fully clear by which mechanism ENOD40 functions in this process. Here, we show that a region harboring box2 can complement nodule formation in an ENOD40 knock-out mutant ( enod40-1-2/1 ). The sequence of box2 bears the characteristics of a miR169 target mimic. We show that the artificial target mimic MIM169defg can indeed complement the reduced capability of nodule formation in enod40-1-2/1 , and that box2 exhibits target mimic activity in a transient luciferase assay. In addition, the introduction of a miR169 -resistant form of MtNF-YA1 also elevates the capacity to form nodules in enod40-1-2/1.

To address this challenge, we introduce laser-emitting aqueous bioreactors (LEABs) in fluorocarbon oils. These LEABs enable stable laser emission and extend a droplet lifespan over 1,000-fold. LEABs enable the encapsulation of bioactive materials for long-term analysis with unique lasing characteristic fingerprints.

          "abstract": "Selected proteins containing an N-terminal cysteine (Nt-Cys) are subjected to rapid, O 2 -dependent proteolysis via the Cys/Arg-branch of the N-degron pathway. Cysteine dioxygenation is catalyzed in mammalian cells by 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO), an enzyme that manifests extreme O 2 sensitivity. The canonical substrates of this pathway in mammalia are the regulators of G-protein signaling 4, 5, and 16, as well as interleukin-32. In addition to operating as an O 2 -sensing mechanism, this pathway has previously been described as a sensor of nitric oxide (NO), with robust effects on substrate stability upon modulation of NO bioavailability being widely demonstrated. Despite this, no mechanism to describe the action of NO on the Cys/Arg N-degron pathway has yet been substantiated. We demonstrate that NO can regulate the stability of Cys N-degron substrates indirectly via the regulation of ADO cosubstrate availability. Through competitive, O 2 -dependent inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, NO can substantially modify cellular O 2 consumption rate and, in doing so, alter the availability of O 2 for Nt-Cys dioxygenation. We show that this increase in O 2 availability in response to NO exposure is sufficient to alter both dynamic and steady-state ADO substrate levels. It is likely that this mechanism operates to couple O 2 supply and mitochondrial respiration with responses to G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation.",

The resulting free energy difference between undissociated and dissociated interfacial water exhibits a linear dependence on the field change with a slope of 1.97 e Å, which far exceeds the dissociation-induced dipole change of a water molecule. Employing a machine-learned collective variable to investigate the reaction statistics of thousands of water dissociation/recombination events, we find that small electric field changes exert minor effects on individual reaction energy barriers but significantly influence the populations of local configurations associated with initial states that are most favorable for reactions. These findings elucidate the pronounced impact of electric fields on interfacial water dissociation and reveal a mechanism for electric-field-controlled chemical reactions.",

However, the neuroimmune mechanisms underlying CIBP remain largely elusive. Substance P (SP), which is known to play a pivotal role in pain perception, became the focal point of our study. To this end, we adopted a comprehensive approach combining behavioral and physiological methods to investigate its role in neuroimmune interactions in CIBP. The results showed that SP released by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via exocytosis initiates CIBP, with its release peaking on the 14th day and correlating with pain behavior. Macrophages were found to infiltrate the DRGs and the sciatic nerves. Notably, in mice with CIBP, the population of macrophage type I was significantly augmented. Significantly, we found that the deletion of macrophages led to a notable alleviation of CIBP, while the blockade of the SP-neurokinin 1 receptor pathway effectively mitigated the infiltration of macrophages and alleviated CIBP. In the advanced phase, DRGs released C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 3 and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 to recruit macrophages. A two-phase model for CIBP progression in mice was proposed, with SP-induced macrophage infiltration in the primary phase and chemokine-mediated macrophage recruitment in the advanced phase. Our investigation has unearthed a previously unrecognized mechanism governing the neuroimmune interaction in CIBP, which highlights a critical target for impeding the progression of this debilitating pain, potentially opening up broad avenues for the development of effective therapeutic interventions at different stages of CIBP with cancer development.",

In many systems, this behavior is locally directed by self-generated signaling gradients rather than long-range, prepatterned cues. However, how heterogeneous mixtures of cells interact nonreciprocally and navigate through self-generated gradients remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for the self-organized chemotaxis of heterogeneous cell populations. We find that the relative chemotactic sensitivities of different cell populations control their long-time coupling and comigration dynamics, with boundary conditions such as external cell and attractant reservoirs substantially influencing the migration patterns. Our model predicts an optimal parameter regime that enables robust and colocalized migration. We test our theoretical predictions with in vitro experiments demonstrating the comigration of distinct immune cell populations, and quantitatively reproduce observed migration patterns under wild-type and perturbed conditions. Interestingly, immune cell comigration occurs close to the predicted optimal regime. Finally, we incorporate mechanical interactions into our framework, revealing a nontrivial interplay between chemotactic and mechanical nonreciprocity in driving collective migration. Together, our findings suggest that self-generated chemotaxis is a robust strategy for the navigation of mixed cell populations.",

We labeled a subset of CFs in neonatal mice with fluorescent markers and the tetanus toxin light chain to ablate neurotransmitter release from these CFs. Surprisingly, we found that such neurotransmitter release–deficient CFs were able to become the winners.

In dicotyledenous plants, pathogen activated Toll-like/interleukin-1 receptor-containing NLRs (TNLs) establish a signaling network of enhanced susceptibility 1 (EDS1)-family dimers with RPW8-type coiled-coil (CC R ) domain NLRs (RNLs) to stimulate transcriptional reprogramming leading to host cell death and pathogen restriction. Evidence suggests that TNL- and EDS1-activated RNLs function as oligomeric Ca 2+ permeable ion channels at the plasma membrane. However, the downstream processes for immunity execution are poorly understood. Here, we studied pathogen effector-triggered immunity conferred by Nicotiana benthamiana TNL (Roq1) which signals almost exclusively through the EDS1-senescence associated gene101 (SAG101)-N required gene 1 (NRG1) RNL module. We identify a pair of glutamate receptor–like Ca 2+ ion channels (GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b) which, unlike most other pathogen-induced GLRs, are highly up-regulated by the EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 module in the TNL immune response. We show that oligomeric NRG1 Ca 2+ channel activity is necessary for GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b induced expression. Consequently, GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b proteins contribute to NRG1 -dependent Ca 2+ accumulation in host cells, and to pathogen resistance and host cell death. We establish that GLR2.9a localizes mainly to the plasma membrane/cytoplasm whereas GLR2.9b accumulates preferentially at the nuclear envelope. The data show that transcriptionally up-regulated canonical Ca 2+ ion channels GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b are a functional output of the EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 module for TNL-triggered immunity.",

Sias can be modified with O -acetyl esters on the side chain (C7 to C9) hydroxyls. Structural analysis and functional studies of these modifications are challenging due to chemical lability and variable resistance to sialidases. For in-depth analysis of the expression and functions of O -acetyl Sia modifications, we used a unique set of sialoglycan-recognizing probes, HPLC analysis of DMB-derivatized Sias and mice lacking the first known sialate O -acetyltransferase, CASD1. C7/C9- O -acetylated Sias are most abundant in the colon, with lower levels in the heart, brain, and spleen, and minimal levels in other digestive organs of wild-type mice. CASD1 deficiency led to a marked loss of C9/C7- O -acetylated Sias in the colon and other tissues. No differences were observed in colonic O -acetylated Sias from conventional and germ-free wild-type mice, indicating that Sia O -acetylation is independent of the commensal microbiota. Nonetheless, CASD1 deficiency caused subtle changes in microbial gene repertoire consistent with potential exploitation of Sias by subsets of intestinal microbes. Furthermore, CASD1-deficient mice exhibited more severe inflammation and ulceration upon colitis induction compared to controls. Reduced Sia O -acetylation was observed in mice during acute colitis and in colon biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Together, our findings suggest CASD1 is the primary physiologically relevant enzyme to add C7/C8/C9- O -acetyl ester groups to Sias and that these Sia modifications exert important gut-protective functions, perhaps by preventing microbial Sia release and metabolism.",

Live, single-molecule imaging of endogenously tagged Unc13 revealed its instantly reduced motility and increased concentration in synaptic nanoclusters with potentiation. Presynaptic knockdown of Unc13A fully blocked fast potentiation. Moreover, deleting its N-terminal localization sequence mislocalized the protein fragment to the cytosol, but still allowed for rapid plasma membrane recruitment by diacylglycerol (DAG) analog phorbol esters and octopamine, implicating a role of more C-terminal domains. A point mutation of endogenous Unc13 in its DAG-binding C1 domain blocked plasticity-induced nanoscopic enrichment and synaptic potentiation. The mutation increased basal neurotransmission but reduced Unc13 levels, revealing a gain of function and potential homeostatic compensation. The mutation also blocked phorbol ester–induced potentiation, decreased the calcium sensitivity of neurotransmission, and caused short-term synaptic depression. Homeostatic potentiation induced by postsynaptic receptor block mirrored octopamine-induced Unc13 recruitment and required presynaptic OAMB receptors, indicating overlapping machinery. Thus, rapid Unc13 immobilization and nanoscale compaction are salient features of fast presynaptic potentiation.",

          "abstract": "Multiple case-controlled studies have shown that analyzing fragmentation patterns in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can distinguish individuals with cancer from healthy controls. However, there have been few studies that investigate various types of cfDNA fragmentomics patterns in individuals with other diseases. We therefore developed a comprehensive statistic, called fragmentation signatures, that integrates the distributions of fragment positioning, fragment length, and fragment end-motifs in cfDNA. We found that individuals with venous thromboembolism, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, or scleroderma have cfDNA fragmentation signatures that closely resemble those found in individuals with advanced cancers. Furthermore, these signatures were highly correlated with increases in inflammatory markers in the blood. We demonstrate that these similarities in fragmentation signatures lead to high rates of false positives in individuals with autoimmune or vascular disease when evaluated using conventional binary classification approaches for multicancer earlier detection (MCED). To address this issue, we introduced a multiclass approach for MCED that integrates fragmentation signatures with protein biomarkers and achieves improved specificity in individuals with autoimmune or vascular disease while maintaining high sensitivity. Though these data put substantial limitations on the specificity of fragmentomics-based tests for cancer diagnostics, they also offer ways to improve the interpretability of such tests. Moreover, we expect these results will lead to a better understanding of the process—most likely inflammatory—from which abnormal fragmentation signatures are derived.",

Here, we identify TANK-binding kinase (TBK1) as a critical signaling molecule enriched and activated in TAMs of BCBM tumors, playing an indispensable role in BCBM development and metastatic outgrowth in the brain. Mechanistically, BCBM cell-secreted matrix metalloproteinase 1 binds to protease-activated receptor 1 and integrin αVβ5 on macrophages, leading to TBK1 activation mediated by the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway. Reciprocally, TBK1-regulated TAMs produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to drive breast cancer cell epithelial–mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion, ultimately contributing to BCBM development and brain metastatic outgrowth. Inhibition of TBK1 signaling in TAMs or GM-CSF receptor in cancer cells impedes BCBM development and brain metastatic outgrowth. Correspondingly, the TBK1–GM-CSF signaling axis correlates with lower overall survival in patients with BCBM. Thus, TBK1-mediated tumor-TAM symbiotic interaction provides a promising therapeutic target for patients with BCBM.",

The hippocampus is implicated in mismatch detection, yet it is not known whether it signals mismatches with episodic memories or generalized knowledge. Across three functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiments, we show that the hippocampus selectively responds to mismatches with episodic memories of specific events. In contrast, schematic mismatches engage Semantic Control and Multiple Demand Networks, as well as subcortical regions linked to prediction error signaling. Episodic mismatches also recruit the Default Mode Network. These findings challenge accounts that propose the hippocampus is a domain-general mismatch detector.

          "abstract": "The oxygenation history of Earth’s surface environments has had a profound influence on the ecology and evolution of metazoan life. It was traditionally thought that the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event enabled the origin of animals in marine environments, followed by their persistence in aerobic marine habitats ever since. However, recent studies of redox proxies (e.g., Fe, Mo, Ce, I) have suggested that low dissolved oxygen levels persisted in the deep ocean until the Late Devonian, when the first heavily wooded ligniophyte forests raised atmospheric O 2 to modern levels. Here, we present a Paleozoic redox proxy record based on selenium enrichments and isotope ratios in fine-grained siliciclastic sediments. Our data reveal transient oxygenation of bottom waters around the Ediacaran–Cambrian boundary, followed by predominantly anoxic deep-water conditions through the Early Devonian (419 to 393 Ma). In the Middle Devonian (393 to 382 Ma), our data document the onset of permanent deep-ocean oxygenation, coincident with the spread of woody biomass across terrestrial landscapes. This episode is concurrent with the ecological occupation and evolutionary radiation of large active invertebrate and vertebrate organisms in deeper oceanic infaunal and epifaunal habitats, suggesting that the burial of recalcitrant wood from the first forests sequestered organic carbon, increased deep marine oxygen levels, and was ultimately responsible for the “mid-Paleozoic marine revolution.”",

Additionally, we found an increase in the S/G ratio from northern to southern geographic origin of the trees sampled, along with a corresponding metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming of xylem cell wall biosynthesis.

Sci. 8 , 71–78 (2004)]. The supramarginal gyrus (SMG) is a structure within the inferior parietal lobule that specifically processes object-directed patterns of manipulation during functional object use. Here, we demonstrate that neural representations of complex object-directed actions in the SMG can be predicted by a linear encoding model that componentially builds complex actions from an empirically defined set of kinematic synergies. Each kinematic synergy represents a unique combination of finger, hand, wrist, and arm postures and movements. Control analyses demonstrate that models based on image-computable similarity (AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16) robustly predict variance in visual areas, but not in the SMG. We also show that SMG activity is specifically modulated by kinematic (as opposed to visual) properties of object-directed actions. The action-relevant, as opposed to visually relevant, nature of the representations supported by the SMG aligns with findings from neuropsychological studies of upper limb apraxia. These findings support a model in which kinematic synergies are the basic unit of representation, out of which the SMG componentially builds object-directed actions. In combination with other findings [Q. Chen et al., Cereb. Cortex 28 , 2162–2174 (2018)], we suggest that kinematic synergies are related to complex object-directed actions in a similar way to how articulatory and voicing features combine to form phonological segments in spoken language production.",

          "abstract": "Understanding mechanisms that determine the response of cells to ferroptotic stress is a timely issue that has significant ramifications for biology and pathology. We investigated these mechanisms in the context of breast cancer where tumors are composed of diverse populations of cancer cells that differ in their ferroptosis sensitivity. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we determined that cancer cell populations with luminal differentiation are more resistant to ferroptosis than other cells within a heterogeneous tumor. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis and experimentation revealed that GATA3, a transcription factor that promotes luminal differentiation, has a causal role in ferroptosis resistance in luminal breast cancer cells. In pursuit of the mechanism involved, we found that GATA3 represses the expression of integrin β1 and its downstream signaling cascade. This observation led us to demonstrate that integrin β1 signaling is necessary for sensitivity to ferroptosis in basal breast cancer cells because it regulates a FAK/ROCK pathway that sustains the expression of ACSL4, a lipid-modifying enzyme that is essential for ferroptosis. The repression of integrin β1 by GATA3 inhibits this signaling pathway, rendering cells ferroptosis resistant. Together, these data provide insight into mechanisms of ferroptosis sensitivity and resistance that are linked to the cell biology and signaling pathways of the diverse types of cells present in breast tumors.",

Theoretical work has suggested that neural replay is a candidate mechanism that aids such learning. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to test whether replay is related to implicit learning of higher-order sequential relationships. Human participants viewed sequences of images that followed probabilistic transitions determined by ring-like graph structures. Behavioral modeling of response times revealed that participants acquired multistep transition knowledge in a manner consistent with gradual updating of an internal successor representation (SR) model. Yet, half of participants did not report being aware of any sequential task structure, and most participants failed to provide meaningful transition probability ratings in a posttask test. Analyses of temporal dynamics of multivariate fMRI patterns during brief 10 s pauses from the ongoing statistical learning task indicated backward sequential replay of multistep sequences in visual cortical areas. Variations in model parameters between participants that captured response time patterns related to strength of neural replay. No corresponding relations between replay and measures of explicit awareness were found. These findings indicate that implicit learning of higher-order relationships establishes an internal SR-based map of the task and is accompanied by cortical on-task replay.",

          "abstract": "AI is now a cornerstone of modern dataset analysis. In many real world applications, practitioners are concerned with controlling specific kinds of errors, rather than minimizing the overall number of errors. For example, biomedical screening assays may primarily be concerned with mitigating the number of false positives rather than false negatives. Quantifying uncertainty in AI-based predictions, and in particular those controlling specific kinds of errors, remains theoretically and practically challenging. We develop a strategy called multidimensional informed generalized hypothesis testing (MIGHT) which we prove accurately quantifies uncertainty and confidence given sufficient data, and concomitantly controls for particular error types. Our key insight was that it is possible to integrate canonical cross-validation and parametric calibration procedures within a nonparametric ensemble method. Simulations demonstrate that while typical AI based-approaches cannot be trusted to obtain the truth, MIGHT can be. We apply MIGHT to answer an open question in liquid biopsies using circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) in individuals with or without cancer: Which biomarkers, or combinations thereof, can we trust? Performance estimates produced by MIGHT on ccfDNA data have coefficients of variation that are often orders of magnitude lower than other state of the art algorithms such as support vector machines, random forests, and Transformers, while often also achieving higher sensitivity. We find that combinations of variable sets often decrease rather than increase sensitivity over the optimal single variable set because some variable sets add more noise than signal.

          "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a pattern-recognition receptor located on the plasma membrane, senses extracellular danger signals to initiate inflammatory immune responses. It is initially synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), undergoes N-linked glycosylation, and is subsequently transported to the Golgi before ultimately reaching the plasma membrane. However, the mechanisms underlying the processing and maturation of TLR4 in the ER remain elusive. Through whole genome-wide CRISPR screening, CCDC134 was identified as a critical and essential factor for TLR4-dependent inflammatory response. Localization of CCDC134 in the ER lumen rather than its exosome-mediated secretion is required for its role in TLR4 signaling. Loss of CCDC134 results in the retention of TLR4 in the ER for subsequent ER-associated degradation, and thus blockade of TLR4 maturation and plasma membrane trafficking. Defects in TLR4 processing and maturation in the ER in CCDC134-depleted cells are caused by aberrant hyperglycosylation and destabilization of glycoprotein 96 (gp96), a key chaperone of TLR4. These results suggest that CCDC134 controls gp96 glycosylation to facilitate TLR4 maturation in the ER.",

Through microbiome analysis, we identified a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) encoding biosynthetic gene cluster that correlates with dental caries and is widely represented in oral pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans . This gene cluster produces two major mutanoclumpin metabolites, MC-584 and MC-586, which feature molecular scaffolds differing in a C–C macrocyclic linkage. Both metabolites synergistically promote robust biofilm formation of S. mutans through a rare dual-metabolite mode of action. Further, each metabolite binds uniquely to the S. mutans cell surface, resulting in distinct multicellular morphologies. The biosynthesis of mutanoclumpins employs a unique chemical logic that produces two major products, rare within PKS-NRPS assembly lines.

However, the “black-box” nature of these representations limits transparency and explainability, posing challenges for human–AI collaboration and leaving open questions about their human-interpretable features. Here, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and a variant, transcoders, from natural language processing to extract, in a completely unsupervised fashion, interpretable sparse features present in both protein-level and amino acid (AA)-level representations from ESM2, a popular PLM. Unlike other approaches such as training probes for features, the extraction of features by the SAE is performed without any supervision. We find that many sparse features extracted from SAEs trained on protein-level representations are tightly associated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms across all levels of the GO hierarchy. We also use Anthropic’s Claude to automate the interpretation of sparse features for both protein-level and AA-level representations and find that many of these features correspond to specific protein families and functions such as the NAD Kinase, IUNH, and the PTH family, as well as proteins involved in methyltransferase activity and in olfactory and gustatory sensory perception. We show that sparse features are more interpretable than ESM2 neurons across all our trained SAEs and transcoders. These findings demonstrate that SAEs offer a promising unsupervised approach for disentangling biologically relevant information present in PLM representations, thus aiding interpretability. This work opens the door to safety, trust, and explainability of PLMs and their applications, and paves the way to extracting meaningful biological insights across increasingly powerful models in the life sciences.",

Migration behavior thus plays a fundamental role in the life cycle and Darwinian fitness of many organisms. While the influence of migration on early-life survival and reproduction is well documented, its effects on senescence (aging) in advanced age remain largely unexplored. Using a unique 44-y ring-resighting dataset from a long-lived, partially migratory bird species, the Greater Flamingo ( Phoenicopterus roseus ), we demonstrate that migration plays a key role in shaping age-specific trajectories of mortality and reproduction. Resident flamingos exhibit higher early-life demographic performances, with lower baseline mortality than migrants, resulting in longer adult lifespan. Residents also have a higher probability of breeding than migrants, though their breeding success is similar. However, residents seem to pay for their early-life advantages in old age, experiencing accelerated actuarial and reproductive senescence compared to migrants. Overall, our study highlights the critical impact of migration on survival and reproduction throughout life, thereby illustrating the role played by behavioral decisions in the biology of aging in long-lived vertebrates.",

In this study, we used metagenomics, viromics, and laboratory validation to explore how nano-biochar affects phage–host interactions and ARGs dissemination in vermicomposting. Our results revealed distinct niche-specific phage life strategies. In vermicompost, lytic phages dominated and used a “kill-the-winner” strategy to suppress antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). In contrast, lysogenic phages prevailed in the earthworm gut, adopting a “piggyback-the-winner” strategy that promoted ARGs transduction through mutualistic host interactions. Nano-biochar induced the conversion of lysogenic to lytic phages in the earthworm gut, while concurrently reducing the abundance of lysogenic phages and their encoded auxiliary metabolic genes carried by ARB. This shift disrupted phage–host mutualism and inhibited ARGs transmission via a “phage shunting” mechanism. In vitro validation with batch culture experiments further confirmed that lysogenic phages increased transduction of ARGs in the earthworm gut, while nano-biochar reduced the spread of ARGs by enhancing lysis infectivity. Our study constructs a mechanistic framework linking nano-biochar induced shifts in phage lifestyles that suppress ARG spread, offering insights into phage–host coadaptation and resistance mitigation strategies in organic waste treatment ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "The fungal species Candida albicans and the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis are members of the human gut microbiome. To explore the range of interactions between these two species, we utilized dual RNA-sequencing to transcriptionally profile both C. albicans and E. faecalis during coculture (compared with monoculture controls) under two conditions: 1) an in vitro setting that mimics certain features of the gut environment and 2) a gnotobiotic mouse gut model. RNA-seq analysis revealed a large number of gene expression changes induced by one species in the presence of the other. More specifically, both species highly upregulate citrate-metabolizing genes during coculture: C. albicans upregulates CIT1 (citrate synthase) which produces citrate, while E. faecalis upregulates its cit operon, which breaks down citrate. In vitro analysis showed directly that citrate cross-feeding (production of citrate by C. albicans and breakdown by E. faecalis) enhances growth of E. faecalis . A main byproduct of citrate metabolism in E. faecalis is formate, a short chain fatty acid toxic to fungi. Our RNA profiling revealed that C. albicans upregulates three formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) during coculture; we show that the FDH genes confer a growth advantage to C. albicans when E. faecalis (or simply formate) is present. These findings reveal a metabolically driven cycle between C. albicans and E. faecalis in the mouse gut and in vitro, where cross-feeding of citrate and detoxification of formate facilitates the growth of both species when they are cultured together.",

          "abstract": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in PTPN11 (protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 11) which encodes for the protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2. Approximately 85% of NSML patients develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Here, we show that SHP2 is recruited to tyrosyl phosphorylated protein-zero related (PZR) in NSML mice. This recruitment is required for the Iroquois homeobox (IRX) transcription factors 3 and 5 to suppress BMP10 which negatively regulates postnatal cardiac growth. The protein expression of IRX3 and IRX5 was elevated in hypertrophied NSML hearts. IRX3 and IRX5 upregulation was rescued in NSML mice harboring a knock-in mutation of PZR that fails to become tyrosyl phosphorylated and recruit SHP2. NSML mice treated with low-dose dasatinib also exhibited normalized IRX3 and IRX5 expression levels. Consistent with this, BMP10 expression levels were reduced in NSML mice and rescued in PZR tyrosyl phosphorylation-deficient and low-dose dasatinib-treated NSML mice. A crystal structure of the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2 bound to tyrosyl phosphorylated PZR reveals that recruitment constrains the open SHP2 conformation to facilitate cellular-Src (c-Src) binding. Disruption of c-Src binding to SHP2 abolished IRX activation and failure to suppress BMP10. Hence, NSML-associated SHP2 genetic variants disrupt IRX transcription factor signaling to BMP10, implicating this axis as a target for RASopathy-associated HCM.",

          "abstract": "Both DNA methylation and homologous recombination (HR) are extensively studied. In bacteria, Dam methylation is the most studied DNA modification, while RecA-mediated HR is a primary mechanism to repair DNA damages including double-stranded breaks, single-stranded gaps, and stalled replication forks. While HR regulation by proteins is extensively studied, whether methylation of DNA itself directly affects the functions of RecA and HR remains unclear. Mainly by single-molecule experiments, we report that Dam methylation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) promotes RecA assembly, partially by reducing the effective charge of ssDNA under counterion screening. Furthermore, Dam methylation of double-stranded DNA promotes homologous pairing, joint molecule growth, and strand exchange. In cellular experiments, dam deletion impairs HR, whereas hypermethylation of the adenines in the genome enhances HR in P1 transduction assays and DNA-damage sensitivity tests without significantly upregulated HR-related genes. In addition, the preference of RecA for Dam-methylated DNA in RecA assembly and homologous pairing is conserved across divergent species covering a gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae , a gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and a flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana . Dam methylation of ssDNA increases the ATPase activity of molecular motors such as RecQ helicase that containing RecA-like domains. These findings reveal effects of DNA methylation and mechanisms regulating RecA-mediated HR and molecular motors.",

          "abstract": "An understanding of the CO 2 + H 2 O hydration reaction is crucial for modeling the effects of ocean acidification, for enabling novel carbon storage solutions, and as a model process in the geosciences. While the mechanism of this reaction has been investigated extensively in the condensed phase, its mechanism at the air–water interface remains elusive, leaving uncertain the contribution that surface-adsorbed CO 2 makes to the overall acidification reaction. In this study, we employ machine-learned potentials trained to various levels of theory to provide a molecular-level understanding of CO 2 hydration at the air–water interface. We show that reaction at the interface follows a surface-mediated “in-and-out” mechanism: CO 2 diffuses into the aqueous surface layer, reacts to form carbonic acid, and is subsequently expelled from solution. We show that this surface layer provides a bulk-like solvation environment, engendering similar modes of reactivity and near-identical free energy profiles for the bulk and interfacial processes. Our study unveils an unconventional reaction mechanism that underscores the dynamic nature of the molecular reaction site at the air–water interface. The similarity between bulk and interfacial profiles shows that CO 2 hydration is equally as feasible under these two solvation environments and that acidification rates are likely enhanced by this additional surface contribution.",

Structure-guided mutagenesis and sequence analysis have identified a conserved aspartic acid that directs the reaction toward the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. A combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has revealed that aspartic acid acts as the catalytic base to deprotonate the carbon-cation intermediate to generate the dehydrogenated product, which otherwise undergoes a spontaneous 6π electrocyclization in the oxidative cyclization pathway to furnish the 2H-benzopyran product.",

          "abstract": "It is well established that stress generally suppresses immunity. However, under certain conditions, acute stress has been shown to stimulate the immune system, particularly those at barrier surfaces like the skin. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly understood. In the present study, we have identified an immune-enhancing effect of stress using zebrafish larvae. The use of this animal model allowed us to visualize the redistribution of macrophages to the skin upon exposure to an acute stressor, which appeared to be dependent on the increased levels of cortisol. Through real-time imaging of fluorescently labeled leukocytes, we observed that this cortisol-driven redistribution was mediated by both the mineralocorticoid and the glucocorticoid receptor, which upregulated the chemokine receptor Cxcr4. Strikingly, this stress-induced macrophage migration required the presence of melanocytes in the skin, which increased the expression of the gene encoding Cxcl12, the ligand for Cxcr4. This result indicates a pivotal role for pigment cells in immune regulation under stress. Functional assays further revealed that the redistributed macrophages actively increased antigen uptake from the external environment, suggesting an elevated state of immune readiness. Together, we demonstrate that acute stress triggers a coordinated, cortisol-mediated response that enhances immune surveillance at the skin barrier. This stress-induced enhancement of barrier immunity potentially prepares the organism for increased pathogen exposure under challenging conditions.",

Defects in processing G4 structures are associated with replication stress, a common property of both B cell cancers and hyperproliferative premalignant cells. Genome instability arising from replication stress is a hallmark of cancer and strongly contributes to the chromosome rearrangements in B cell cancers. Here, we define the impact of G4-stabilizing ligands on generating genome instability in primary and malignant B cells. Treatment with the G4-stabilizing compound pyridostatin (PDS) causes breaks and chromosome rearrangements at ribosomal DNA and pericentromeric major satellite regions in both mouse primary B cell culture and CH12 lymphoma cells. PDS also causes extensive pericentromeric DNA damage in immortalized human B cell lines. Remarkably, PDS causes high level of tetraploid metaphase cells correlated with high level of dicentric chromosomes specifically in primary but not in CH12 B cells. Unlike primary B cells, CH12 cells undergo checkpoint activation and strong G2/M arrest in response to PDS treatment thus preventing tetraploid appearance. Altogether, these results highlight the difference between primary and malignant B cells in response to PDS, revealing the therapeutic potential of G4-stabilizing drugs to selectively suppress tumor cell growth and proliferation.",

Nonetheless, these scholars continue to debate over when people first started foraging for grass seeds, when they began to readily utilize sickles, how prominent the early selection pressures were, and when the first traits of domestication fully introgressed into the cultivated grass population. Here, we present complementary archaeobotanical and archaeological (stone tool) evidence for cereal foragers from Toda-1 Cave in the Surkhan Darya, dating to 9200 cal BP. We conclude that early Holocene foragers were processing grains along with nuts and fruits as far north as the rich river valleys of southern Uzbekistan. These data expand the known range that preagricultural cereal foragers covered in the early Holocene, adding to our understanding of the cultural processes that led to farming. Additionally, we present the earliest evidence for people interacting with the progenitors for pistachios and apples (or a close apple relative). The complex foraging behaviors that led to cultivation were being undertaken by people during the early Holocene across a wider area of Eurasia than previously thought.",

Here, we show that insect (aphid) herbivory on macrophytes (duckweed) drove the adaptive evolution of a planktonic crustacean ( Daphnia magna ) in large outdoor aquatic mesocosms via indirect ecological effects. Aphid herbivory reduced duckweed growth and increased the nutrient and light availability in the water column, which promoted phytoplankton growth and boosted the abundance of D. magna that feed on phytoplankton. Whole-genome pool-sequencing and phenotypic assays revealed aphid-herbivory-mediated evolutionary changes to Daphnia population. Transplant experiments indicated that these evolutionary changes were adaptive. Furthermore, aphid-herbivory-mediated biotic and abiotic changes in the aquatic community increased the performance of the macrophytes and aphids.

          "abstract": "Type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is a Ca 2+ release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle. In excitation–contraction (E-C) coupling, RyR1 opens by depolarization of transverse tubule membrane via physical interaction with dihydropyridine receptor, which is referred to as depolarization-induced Ca 2+ release (DICR). RyR1 can also be gated via Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release (CICR), in which binding of Ca 2+ directly opens the channel. Thus, RyR1 has two Ca 2+ release modes; DICR and CICR, but the physiological role of CICR has been a matter of debate: whether CICR can amplify Ca 2+ signals in E-C coupling. To address this issue, we created a mouse model carrying a mutation in the Ca 2+ -binding site in RyR1 (RyR1-E3896A), which selectively inhibits CICR. Surprisingly, the homozygous RyR1-E3896A mice show no appreciable changes in E-C coupling, ex vivo muscle contraction, in vivo muscle performance, or muscle fiber type. Gain-of-function mutations in RyR1 cause malignant hyperthermia (MH), which is a lethal disease triggered by inhalational anesthetics. The E3896A mutation conferred resistance to isoflurane-induced MH episodes and severe heat stroke triggered by environmental heat stress. Our data suggest that RyR1-mediated CICR plays a negligible role in E-C coupling of normal skeletal muscle but may increase the risk for muscle diseases when excessively activated.",

In this paper, we employ a computationally driven matching technique to examine quantitative trends in the use of various forms of diversity and population terminology in a sample of nearly two million biomedical abstracts spanning a 30-y period. The curated dictionaries we leverage to detect these trends were formalized into open-source software that are publicly available for other researchers to use. Our analyses demonstrate marked growth in diversity, sex, gender, life course, and socioeconomic terms while terms relating to race and ethnicity largely plateaued or declined in usage, beginning in the mid-2000s. In addition, the use of national, continental, and subcontinental population labels increased dramatically over the same period. We also present logistic regression analyses to investigate what may be fueling the rise in use of diversity terminology. We argue that the use of diversity has grown to encompass concepts beyond its historical origins in race-based programs as it has in fields like higher education and employment.

          "abstract": "Emergence of quantum orders with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. In this context, recently discovered chiral loop-current order in kagome metals has garnered significant attention. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) observed in CsV 3 Sb 5 , which provides compelling evidence for the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, the origin of the eMChA and its fundamental connection to the loop-current remain highly elusive, as the loop-current itself preserves inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that the loop-current phase breaks inversion symmetry in the presence of the experimentally observed stripe charge-density wave, leading to finite eMChA coefficient γ eM . In this mechanism, γ eM is proportional to the product of the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization, M orb 0 , and the lifetime of conduction electrons, τ . Therefore, γ eM is reversible by the magnetic fields, and it takes large value in kagome metals with τ v Fermi ≫ a 0 (=lattice constant). Surprisingly, the quantum metric, which defines a fundamental geometric aspect of Bloch wavefunctions, acquires significant momentum dependence in the loop-current phase, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of eMChA by ∼100 times. This research not only clarifies the fundamental symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals but also opens a path for exploring quantum metric–induced phenomena arising from exotic quantum phase transitions in various metals.",

It also serves as a template for the assembly of the rod structure, which consists of FliE, FlgB, FlgC, FlgF, and FlgG. FliP, FliQ, and FliR assemble into a right-handed helical structure within the central pore of the flagellar basal body MS-ring, and the complex has two gates on the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides. The periplasmic gate, formed by the N-terminal α-helices of FliP and FliR, remains closed until six FliE subunits assemble onto FliP and FliR to form the first layer of the rod, but it has remained unclear how each FliE subunit opens the gate and assembles in the absence of the rod cap required for efficient assembly of other rod proteins. Here, we present a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the FliPQR complex in closed form at 3.0 Å resolution. A β-cap, formed by the N-terminal β-strands of FliP and FliR, is located at the top of the FliPQR complex and tightly seals the closed gate. The β-cap has a narrow pore that efficiently and accurately leads the first FliE subunit to its assembly site. Interactions of FliE with FliP and FliR induce a conformational change in FliP and FliR, with their N-terminal α-helices move up and outward to open the gate. Consequently, each of the N-terminal β-strands of FliP and FliR detaches from the β-cap one after another, thereby creating a docking site for the next FliE subunit to efficiently assemble.",

          "abstract": "A remarkable example of symbiosis involves the pygmy seahorse ( Hippocampus bargibanti ). It lives obligatorily on gorgonian corals, mimicking their polyps with pink coloration and skin protuberances. Unique for seahorses, pygmy seahorses retain juvenile paedomorphic stunted snouts, resembling the coral’s polyps. We analyzed the tiny seahorse’s genome revealing the genomic bases of several adaptations to their mutualistic life including substantial reductions in conserved noncoding elements that are associated with genes in the vicinity of those CNEs that are known to play a role in growth and metamorphosis-related pathways. Comparative RNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses during their ontogeny suggest that their stunted snout might result from craniofacial remodeling associated with hoxa2b defunctionalization. This is consistent also with findings from in situ hybridization and CRISPR experiments. Their immune system shows extremely low numbers of MHC genes and additional considerable losses of other immune-related genes. This is likely facilitated by the host coral’s antimicrobial metabolites and by the earlier evolution of male pregnancy that requires immunotolerance.",

          "abstract": "Vocal development in human infants is strongly influenced by interactions with caregivers who reinforce more speech-like sounds. This trajectory of vocal development in humans is radically different from those of our close phylogenetic relatives, cercopithecoid monkeys and apes. In these primates, social feedback seems to play no significant role in their vocal development. Oddly,marmoset monkeys, a more distantly related primate species, do exhibit socially guided vocal learning. How can this be? We hypothesized that the evolution of human and marmoset vocal learning in early infancy is facilitated by their neurally altricial births (relative to other primates) and their cooperative breeding social environment. Our analysis found that, indeed, both human and marmoset brains are growing faster at birth when compared with chimpanzees and rhesus macaques, making humans and marmoset monkeys altricial relative to these other primates. The time interval of this faster brain growth overlaps with important vocal learning milestones. We formalized our hypothesis using a simple model showing that if vocal learning is influenced by the timing of brain growth and social stimuli, it benefits from an altricial brain and a cooperative breeding environment. Our data support the idea that the evolution of socially guided vocal learning during early infancy in humans and marmosets was afforded by infants with an altricial brain embedded in a vocally rich environment.",

          "abstract": "Inadequate response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) frequently arises in prostate cancer, driven by cellular mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics to define the transcriptional, epigenetic, and spatial basis of cell identity and castration response in the mouse prostate. Leveraging these data along with a meta-analysis of human prostates and prostate cancer (PCa), we identified cellular orthologs and key determinants of ADT response and resistance. Our findings reveal that mouse prostates harbor lobe-specific luminal epithelial cell types distinguished by unique gene regulatory modules and anatomically defined androgen-responsive transcriptional programs, indicative of divergent developmental origins. Androgen-insensitive, stem-like epithelial populations—resembling human club and hillock cells—are notably enriched in the urethra and ventral prostate but are rare in other lobes. Within the ventral prostate, we also uncovered two additional androgen-responsive luminal epithelial cell types, marked by Pbsn or Spink1 expression, which align with human luminal subsets and may define the origin of distinct PCa subtypes. Castration profoundly reshaped luminal epithelial transcriptomes, with castration-resistant luminal epithelial cells activating stress-responsive and stemness programs. These transcriptional signatures are enriched in tumor cells from ADT-treated and castration-resistant PCa patients, underscoring their likely role in driving treatment resistance. Temporal tracking of cells will precisely map disease-associated cellular transitions, and our technical framework facilitates such interrogations. Collectively, our comprehensive cellular atlas of the mouse prostate illuminates the importance of lobe-specific contexts for PCa modeling and reveals potential therapeutic targets to counter castration resistance.",

          "abstract": "The rapid expansion of protein sequence and structure databases has resulted in a significant number of proteins with ambiguous or unknown function. While advances in machine learning techniques hold great potential to fill this annotation gap, current methods for function prediction are unable to associate global function reliably to the specific residues responsible for that function. We address this issue by introducing PARSE (Protein Annotation by Residue-Specific Enrichment), a knowledge-based method which combines pretrained embeddings of local structural environments with traditional statistical techniques to simultaneously predict function and provide residue-level annotations. For the task of predicting the catalytic function of enzymes, PARSE achieves comparable or superior global performance to state-of-the-art machine learning methods (F1 score &gt; 85%) while simultaneously annotating the specific residues involved in each function with much greater precision. Since it does not require supervised training, our method can make one-shot predictions for very rare functions and is not limited to a particular type of functional label (e.g. Enzyme Commission numbers or Gene Ontology codes). Finally, we leverage the AlphaFold Structure Database to perform functional annotation at a proteome scale. By applying PARSE to the dark proteome—predicted structures which cannot be classified into known structural families—we predict several bacterial metalloproteases. Each of these proteins shares a strongly conserved catalytic site despite highly divergent sequences and global folds, illustrating the value of local structure representations for new function discovery.",

          "abstract": "The human Fic enzyme FicD plays an important role in regulating the Hsp70 homolog BiP in the endoplasmic reticulum: FicD reversibly modulates BiP’s activity through attaching an adenosine monophosphate to the substrate binding domain. This reduces BiP’s chaperone activity by shifting it into a conformation with reduced substrate affinity. Crystal structures of FicD in the apo, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-bound, and BiP-bound states suggested significant conformational variability in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. However, nothing is known about the underlying dynamics. In this study, we investigate the conformational dynamics of FicD’s TPR motifs using two-color, single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments. We demonstrate that the TPR motifs exhibit conformational dynamics between a TPR-out and a TPR-in conformation on timescales ranging from microseconds to milliseconds. In addition, we extend our investigation on multiple labeling positions within FicD, revealing how conformational dynamics vary depending on the location within the TPR motif. We quantify the motions with dynamic photon distribution analysis for the FRET constructs and generate an ensemble of structures for the different states consistent with the smFRET data using molecular dynamic simulations. We propose a conformational landscape model for FicD where the TPR-in/out states exist in equilibrium and the fraction of dynamic population is altered due to the presence of ATP and BiP. These results indicate that not only is FicD dynamic, but the dynamics are linked to the functionality and interactions of FicD with BiP.",

          "abstract": "Membranes that selectively enhance target solute permeation while rejecting competing species are essential for precision separations. This study introduces charge-patterned mosaic membranes (CMMs) that selectively transport divalent asymmetric salts by leveraging a net-neutral membrane–solution interface. This mechanism, dictated by the charge ratio of positive and negative domains on the membrane surface and the balance of cations and anions in the salt, is supported by analytical, numerical, and experimental results. Analytical solutions identified cationic domain coverages ( f + ) of 33%, 50%, and 66% as optimal for the selective transport of +2:−1 salts, +1:−1 salts, and +1:−2 salts, respectively, under conditions where the pattern size ( L ) is significantly larger than the Debye length. Numerical simulations and experiments using CMMs with alternating charged-stripes inkjet-printed onto nanostructure copolymer substrates confirmed these findings. By varying stripe widths to control f + , pressure-driven filtration experiments demonstrated selective enrichment of MgCl 2 and K 2 SO 4 at the predicted f + values, with deviations from these values leading to salt rejection. These results highlight the pivotal role of a net-neutral interface in enabling asymmetric salt enrichment. This study positions CMMs as a versatile platform for tuning ion selectivity, addressing challenges in resource recovery, water treatment, and precision separations.",

It was framed as the art of bridge building, opening channels between adversaries, a common language across cultures, and a refuge for dialogue in times of political rupture. This aspirational model helped connect scientists across geopolitical divides, built trust, and was a cornerstone of post–Cold War internationalism. In recent years, these ideals have become increasingly affected by the pull of geopolitics. As multilateralism falters and geopolitical rivalries intensify, nations are putting greater emphasis on science and technology as strategic assets.

Increased exposure was mainly driven by enhanced colocation of wildland fires and human settlements, doubling the exposure per unit burned area. We show that population dynamics accounted for 25% of the 440 million human exposures to wildland fires. Although wildfire disasters in North America, Europe, and Oceania have garnered the most attention, 85% of global exposures occurred in Africa.

Stress-induced lysosomal lipid signaling contributed to both the recruitment and activation of LYVAC. By directly sensing lysosomal phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, the lipid transfer domain of LYVAC mediated directional ER-to-lysosome lipid movement, leading to osmotic membrane expansion of lysosomes.

          "abstract": "A primary axiom in geoscience is that the evolution of plants drove global changes in river dynamics. Notably, the apparent sinuosity of rivers, derived from the variance of sediment accretion direction measured in rocks, dramatically increased when land plants evolved, ca. 425 Ma. This led to the hypothesis that the rise of vegetation triggered river meandering. Recent studies of barren, meandering rivers challenge this notion, but the Paleozoic shift in the geometry of river deposits remains unexplained. Here, we suggest that it occurred because vegetation changes how river bends move through space. Using satellite images to monitor river migration, we find that bank vegetation alters the orientation of point bar accretion, resulting in a 62% increase in the inferred variance of flow direction. These results explain why meandering rivers have been under-recognized in pre-vegetation stratigraphy.",

          "abstract": "The ability to shape light spectra dynamically and arbitrarily would revolutionize many photonic systems by offering unparalleled spectral efficiency and network flexibility. However, most existing optical components have rigid spectral functionalities with limited tunability, hindering compact and fast optical spectral shaping. We introduce a pixelated nano-opto-electro-mechanical (NOEM) grating that exploits electromechanically induced symmetry breaking for precise, pixel-level control of grating coupling strength, yielding a miniaturized (~0.007 square millimeters) on-chip spectral shaper. We demonstrate the synthesis of grating pixels for arbitrary spectral responses, and we achieved rapid (&lt;10 nanoseconds), high-contrast (&gt;100 decibels), wavelength-selective switching through collective, nanometer-scale electrostatic perturbations. Our pixelated NOEM grating delivers exceptional spectral manipulation capabilities in an ultracompact, on-chip manner, offering prospects for next-generation optical information networks, computing architectures, and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Biology is governed by macromolecular interactions, perturbation of which often lies at the heart of disease. Most therapeutic drugs, whether they are small molecules or biologics, exert their effects through impeding such interactions, whether they are of an enzyme with its substrate or a ligand with its receptor. Conversely, a handful of approved drugs and a larger number of candidates in development have the opposite effect: They either activate or inhibit a biological output by stabilizing a preexisting complex through reducing the rate at which its components dissociate ( k off ). In this Review, we present examples of therapeutic candidates that we term “LOCKTACs,” which modulate k off , and discuss possible theoretical and practical advantages of this class of drugs. Prospective discovery of LOCKTACs has the potential to usher in a new class of therapeutics for today’s most challenging targets.",

          "abstract": "Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of electronic wavefunctions that are encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. Whereas Berry curvature–mediated transport effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric–induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here, we show that spin-momentum locking, a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit–coupled materials, leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measured and electrically controlled in 111-oriented LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and enable previously unexplored strategies to design functionalities based on quantum geometry.",

We investigated how energy disorders affect vibrational polariton dynamics by probing ultrafast dynamics in 2,6-di- tert -butylphenol in liquids (inhomogeneous) and solids (homogeneous) using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. In liquids, energy disorder disrupted delocalization, preventing vibrational energy transfer. By contrast, with reduced inhomogeneity, vibrational strong coupling in solids restored delocalization and enabled energy transfer. We established a stringent delocalization criterion, requiring collective coupling strengths exceeding three times inhomogeneous linewidths to sustain polariton coherence. This finding highlights energy disorder’s detrimental effects and outlines strategies to overcome localization—either by minimizing disorder through chemical control or by achieving sufficient couplings using advanced photonic structures.",

For different initial states, we reveal universal scaling in the experimentally accessible finite-time dynamics by elucidating and accounting for the initial-state-dependent prescaling effects.

However, the mechanisms of defense remain unclear. The Retron-Septu system integrates retron and Septu antiphage defenses. Cryo–electron microscopy structures reveal asymmetric nucleoprotein complexes comprising a reverse transcriptase, msDNA (a hybrid of msdDNA and msrRNA), and two PtuAB copies. msdDNA and msrRNA are essential for assembling this complex, with msrRNA adopting a conserved lariat-like structure that regulates reverse transcription. Notably, the assembled Retron-Septu complex is inactive, with msdDNA occupying the PtuA DNA binding site. Activation occurs upon disassembly, releasing PtuAB, which degrades single-stranded DNA to restrict phage replication. This “arrest-and-release” mechanism underscores the dynamic regulatory roles of msDNA, advancing our understanding of antiphage defense strategies.",

We find that recent changes in primates are associated with immune barrier function and lipid and xenobiotic metabolism and that human-specific genetic features affect these functions. Enhancer assays, genetic deletion, and in silico mutagenesis resolve evolutionarily important enhancers of lactase ( LCT ) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 ( IGFBP2 ).

Here, we model the contribution of major lifecycle stages (upstream, midstream, downstream, and end-use) to air pollution and estimate the associated chronic health outcomes and racial-ethnic disparities across the contiguous US in 2017. We estimate lifecycle annual burdens of 91,000 premature deaths attributable to fine particles (PM 2.5 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and ozone, 10,350 PM 2.5 -attributable preterm births, 216,000 incidences of NO 2 -attributable childhood-onset asthma, and 1610 lifetime cancers attributable to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). Racial-ethnic minorities experience the greatest disparities in exposure and health burdens across almost all lifecycle stages. The greatest absolute disparities occur for Black and Asian populations from PM 2.5 and ozone, and the Asian population from NO 2 and HAPs. Relative inequities are most extreme from downstream activities, especially in Louisiana and Texas.",

Public wolf hunting is a highly contentious strategy for mitigating these risks, yet few empirical studies examine its effectiveness in doing so. Using difference-in-differences and structural equation modeling of data from the northwestern US between 2005 and 2021, we analyzed impacts of wolf hunting on livestock predation by wolves and government removal of wolves in the same year and with a 1-year time lag while controlling for social and environmental variables.

          "abstract": "DNA has emerged as a robust platform for engineering molecular circuits with arbitrary logic operations. Nevertheless, implementing DNA circuits for such functions generally relies on the use of dual-rail expression that doubles the number of required gates, constraining the achievable complexity in a single solution. A fundamental limitation is that conventional single-rail circuits cannot support nonfirst-layer NOT operations. Here, we introduce the design of a DNA synchronizer (DSN), a temporal regulation module that enables time-dependent NOT function, to circumvent the fundamental limitation of conventional single-rail designs. Tuning the binding affinity between the DSN strand and an inverter strand allows for regulating the execution time of NOT gates at varying cascade depths. Single-rail NAND and NOR gates are implemented using DSNs, which are Boolean complete. We further demonstrate a 4-bit square root circuit using a minimal set of only five gates. This single-rail architecture holds promise for developing compact yet scalable DNA computing circuits while advancing applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between cell fate specification and morphogenetic changes remains a challenge in developmental biology. Gastruloids, stem cell models of postimplantation mammalian development, provide a platform to address this question. Here, using quantitative live imaging and transcriptomic profiling, we show that physical parameters, particularly system size, affect morphogenetic timing and outcomes. Larger gastruloids exhibit delayed symmetry breaking, increased multipolarity, and prolonged axial elongation, with morphogenesis driven by size. Despite these variations, transcriptional programs and cell fate composition remain stable across a broad size range, illustrating the scaling of gene expression domains. In particular, extreme sizes show distinct transcriptional modules and shifts in gene expression patterns. Size perturbation experiments rescued the morphogenetic and pattern phenotypes observed in extreme sizes, demonstrating the adaptability of gastruloids to their effective system size. These findings position gastruloids as versatile models for dissecting spatiotemporal coordination in mammalian development and reveal how physical constraints can decouple gene expression programs from morphogenetic progression.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotes have evolved defense systems to protect their genomes from invasive genetic elements. We report a fungal defense mechanism, tandem repeat–induced sexual silencing (TRISS), active during sexual stages. TRISS is a unique RNA interference (RNAi) pathway distinct from known mechanisms like quelling and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). Triggered by tandem repeats, it involves RNAi components similar to quelling but uniquely includes the MSUD-specific Argonaute Sms2. TRISS operates independently of recombination. We identified small interfering RNA sassociated with TRISS (trasiRNAs) in tandem repeats. Sms2, guided by trasiRNAs, mediates translational repression of target mRNAs and is crucial for trasiRNA biogenesis. TRISS requires the DNA methyltransferase Rid but not Rid-mediated repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Both Sms2 and Rid interact with replication protein A (RPA) to recruit the RPA-Qde1/RdRP complex, dependent on the helicase Qde3. This study reveals a potentially conserved strategy linking RIP and RNAi to silence tandem repeats during fungal sexual stages, offering insights into fungal genome defense.",

The depth of their source that became progressively shallower over time, combined with thermal modeling results, suggests that magmatic underplating beneath the ilmenite-bearing cumulate (IBC) that escaped the mantle overturn phase could be a thermal driver for the young lunar magmatism. Global remote-sensing investigations further reveal different TiO 2 contents between young basalts from each side of the Moon, attributable to asymmetric composition and thickness of the IBC in the uppermost mantle.",

We elucidate the mechanism of complex crater formation by examining crater formation on different polymer substrates resulting from microparticle impacts with tunable microparticle diameter (1.8 to 6.1 micrometers) and impact velocities up to 840 meters per second. Central uplift is uniquely observed in craters on amorphous polymers, with the degree of complexity directly linked to the polymer thermal properties and homogeneity. We demonstrate that the complex crater volume scales with the ratio of the specific kinetic energy of the impacting object to the specific energy required to raise the impacted substrate to its glass transition temperature (the Eckert number). Our results also confirm that complex crater formation can occur not only for macroscopic celestial collisions but also during sufficiently high velocity collisions at the micrometer scale.",

Conditional knockout of Rpa1 , a representative DNA damage response factor, in early limb bud mesenchyme results in the near-total absence of forelimbs and severely underdeveloped hindlimbs. Mechanistically, Rpa1 deletion leads to extensive DNA damage and activates the cGAS-STING pathway, driving transcription of Zbp1 . Rpa1 deletion also leads to accumulation of Z-DNA bound by ZBP1, triggering the full activation of ZBP1 and subsequent mesenchymal stem cell death through PANoptosis.

We discover a distinct “staging” behavior during the oxidation process: A fully ordered intermediate phase, SrCoO 2.75 , forms before transitioning into a near-perovskite SrCoO 3−δ . In addition, antiphase boundaries, originating at step terraces of SrTiO 3 , alleviate strain by creating reversible nanoscale “gaps” during lattice contraction under oxidation, providing a pathway for preserving structural integrity throughout redox cycling. This work provides atomic-level guidance for engineering TMOs by leveraging water vapor to control their redox behavior and tailor functional properties.",

Despite decades of investigation, there is still no consensus on what causes Pol I transcription termination. Here, we show that efficient termination by Pol I, paused by termination roadblock protein, is caused by RNA hairpin of the nascent pre-rRNA. Hairpin-dependent termination takes place at a physiological rate and does not require trans-acting factors. The function of the roadblock protein and the T-rich sequence is to synergistically cause deep backtracking of Pol I toward the termination RNA hairpin. Simultaneously, Pol I is catalytically inactivated, preventing rescue from backtracking through RNA cleavage and thus committing Pol I to termination. Termination RNA hairpins are present in most of Pol I terminators of eukaryotes, suggesting conservation of the RNA hairpin–dependent mechanism of Pol I transcription termination. We propose a simple model that unifies previous findings.",

Unlike data-driven approaches, BayROM does not require training datasets, but instead, it uses probabilistic model-based reconstruction to facilitate fast high-resolution imaging.

We identify a direct interaction between RSMV P and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor 1 (OsARF1C), a crucial regulator of the coatomer protein I (COP I) vesicle transport pathway that is vital for viral replication. This interaction indirectly recruits OsARF1C’s partner, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (OsPI4KB), which drives localized phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate (PI4P) synthesis.

We present a coupled chemical and thermal evolution model tracking Ceres’s interior aqueous environment through time. If the rocky interior reached ≳550 K, then fluids released by rock metamorphism would have promoted conditions favorable for habitability by introducing redox disequilibrium into the ocean, a source of chemical energy for chemotrophs.

          "abstract": "The mechanisms that organisms allocate resources to sustain biological phenotypes remain largely unknown. Here, we use mobilized colistin resistance ( mcr-1 ), which modifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to confer colistin resistance, as a model to explore how bacteria reallocate resources to support mcr-1 –mediated resistance. We show that bacteria redirect resources from glycolysis, the pyruvate cycle, and LPS biosynthesis toward glycerophospholipid metabolism to produce phosphatidylethanolamine, the substrate for mcr-1 to modify LPS, while reducing LPS content to limit colistin binding. This reallocation down-regulates succinyl–coenzyme A (CoA) to diminish succinylation of proteins including triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), CpxR, and PdhR, thereby sustaining resistance. Exogenous succinate or α-ketoglutarate restores succinylation in a succinyl-CoA–dependent manner. Succinylation of TPI redirects metabolic flux to glycolysis and the pyruvate cycle, while succinylation of CpxR and PdhR up-regulates LPS biosynthesis, ultimately attenuating colistin resistance. Thus, we reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which bacteria regulate resource allocation through metabolism-driven posttranslational protein modification, offering strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.",

          "abstract": "The replacement of hunter-gatherer lifestyles by agriculture represents a pivotal change in human history. The initial stage of this Neolithic transition in Europe was instigated by the migration of farmers from Anatolia and the Aegean basin. In this study, we modeled the expansion of Neolithic farmers into central Europe along the continental route of dispersal. We used spatially explicit simulations of paleogenomic diversity and high-quality paleogenomic data from 67 prehistoric individuals to assess how population dynamics between Indigenous European hunter-gatherers and incoming farmers varied across space and time. Our results demonstrate that admixture between the two groups increased locally over time at each stage of the Neolithic expansion along the continental route. We estimate that the effective population size of farmers was about five times that of hunter-gatherers. In addition, we infer that sporadic long-distance migrations of early farmers contributed to their rapid dispersal, while competitive interactions with hunter-gatherers were limited.",

We use iterative exponential growth to synthesize monodisperse mesogenic oligomers ranging from dimer to octamer. By analyzing their phase behavior and microstructure, we elucidate how length-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic effects tune their hierarchical degree of ordering. The oligomers’ length-dependent crystalline order drives the formation of scrolled sheets in shorter oligomers and twisted ribbons in longer oligomers. These studies highlight how oligomer length interplays with mesogen geometry and crystalline packing to drive self-assembly, introducing oligomer length as a powerful design parameter toward tailored applications of mesogenic systems.",

We show that these two patterns—uniform variation and east-west contrast—are present in instrumental observations and in simulations with constant or time-varying external forcing. Uniform variation is amplified by 20th century external forcing, while a global warming–induced strengthening of the monsoon seeds the east-west contrast. This contrast is deepened by a mid-21st century transition to a North Atlantic cooling relative to the global tropical oceans, which affects the western Sahel most strongly because it is immediately adjacent to the North Atlantic, leading to a divergence in outcomes—between a progressively wetter central and eastern Sahel and an abruptly drier western Sahel—that is unparalleled in instrumental observations.",

Existing AMPK inhibitors are however limited, with poor selectivity and substantial off-target effects. Here, we provide mechanistic insights and describe the cellular selectivity of the recently identified AMPK inhibitor BAY-3827. A 2.5-Å cocrystal structure of the AMPK kinase domain with BAY-3827 revealed distinct features including a disulfide bridge between the αD helix Cys 106 and the activation loop residue Cys 174 . This bridge appears to stabilize the activation loop such that Asn 162 repositions the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif Phe 158 toward the C-terminal lobe, displacing His 137 and disrupting the regulatory spine, promoting an inactive kinase state. In hepatocytes, BAY-3827 blocked AMPK activator (MK-8722)–mediated phosphorylation of ACC1 and corresponding inhibition of lipogenesis. Transcriptome analysis revealed that BAY-3827 down-regulated ~30% of MK-8722–stimulated AMPK-dependent genes. We establish the molecular and cellular basis of BAY-3827’s selectivity and utility for delineating AMPK functions while highlighting its limitations.",

To investigate these spatiotemporal dynamics during one of Europe’s most transformative periods, we compiled a dataset of radiocarbon dates from 967 burials, applying kernel density estimation alongside optimal linear estimation. We show that the adoption of CW and BB funerary rites is not synchronized with, and often contradicts, the spread of steppe ancestry. Furthermore, we show that these burial traditions spread rapidly and polyfocally among dispersed communities before a brief yet continent-wide consolidation phase around 2600 BCE for CW and 2400 BCE for BB, suggesting broad, simultaneous societal changes among preliterate societies.",

Here, we examine the specific contribution of the reticular thalamic nucleus (RT), a key modulator of thalamocortical activity, to ASD-related behavioral deficits using a Cntnap2 knockout mouse model. Cntnap2 −/− mice displayed increased seizure susceptibility, locomotor activity, and repetitive behaviors. Electrophysiological recordings revealed enhanced intrathalamic oscillations and burst firing in RT neurons, accompanied by elevated T-type calcium currents. In vivo fiber photometry confirmed behavior-associated increases in RT population activity. Notably, pharmacological and chemogenetic suppression of RT excitability via Z944, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and via C21 activation of the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di significantly improved ASD-related behaviors.

          "abstract": "Metabolic enzymes, critical for cellular homeostasis, are frequently co-opted in a disease-specific manner to drive cancer progression. Here, we identify aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10), down-regulated in gastrointestinal cancers, as a pivotal metastasis suppressor correlating with improved colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. Mechanistically, AKR1B10 activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by preventing redox-regulated nitration of its B56α subunit, preserving holoenzyme assembly and enabling c-Myc dephosphorylation at serine-62. Loss of AKR1B10 disrupts this pathway, stabilizing c-Myc, which drives integrin signaling and metastatic dissemination in CRC. We further demonstrate that lysine-125 of AKR1B10 is essential for its interaction with PP2A-Cα and B56α nitration, thereby attenuating CRC metastatic aggressiveness. Pharmacological restoration of PP2A activity effectively mitigates metastasis associated with AKR1B10 loss. In addition, c-Myc transcriptionally represses AKR1B10, establishing a feedback loop that sustains its down-regulation and enhances metastatic progression. This study uncovers an antimetastatic mechanism involving AKR1B10-mediated PP2A activation and highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.",

A total of 82 humans are analyzed, together with 53 animals and 35 modern plants to establish regional isotope baselines. Results show statistically significant isotopic differences between victims and nonvictims and suggest that the former were members of invading groups brutally killed, perhaps exposed and deposited in pits—together with trophies in the form of severed upper limbs—by local groups in what might be one of the earliest well-documented instances of martial victory celebrations in prehistoric Europe.",

The differentiation of these precursors is independent of Dapl1 but relies on the transcription factor B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11b (Bcl11b), resulting in the generation of Dapl1 + central memory–like CD8 T cells after infection and stem-like memory cells in cancer. Dapl1 + naïve T cells originate among mature thymocytes and gradually appear in the periphery postnatally. Peripheral Dapl1 + and Dapl1 − populations show limited plasticity, supporting a thymic-imprinting model.

Magnetic resonance imaging–based velocity measurements inside the printed model, which is perfused with a Newtonian fluid at two Reynolds numbers, revealed that the flow patterns are primarily influenced by the Reynolds number and the dilation of the arterial inlet.

Here, we report on high-resolution observations performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array that reveal inflows in the form of streamers. These streamers persist well within the expected disk radius, indicating that they play a substitute role channeling material from the envelope directly to an unresolved small disk or even directly to the forming high-mass protostar.

Under this synergistic effect, the fatigue performance of the natural AM microstructure across all stress ratios not only outperforms all additive manufactured and forged Ti-6Al-4V alloys, but also surpasses other metallic materials.

To model CRLM, we induced liver metastasis in mice by transsplenically injecting MC38 cells. We found that patients with CRLM and mice undergoing major hepatectomy had better survival compared to those undergoing minor hepatectomy. Mechanistically, extensive hepatectomy activates hepatocellular YAP1 by regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor, altering glutamine metabolism–related gene expression and increasing liver glutamine consumption. This metabolic shift leads to glutamine scarcity in tumor cells, causing increased reactive oxygen species production, which promotes loss of YAP1 activity in tumor cells. Consequently, the production of the chemokine CXCL5 is suppressed, which inhibits myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration and enhancing the immunological function of CD8 + T cells.",

Current control approaches tend to enforce a single desired response rather than restore the proper capacity for variable responses to different stimulus. Here, we present an algebraic reverse control (ARC) framework for reversion of altered biological networks. ARC leverages matrix operations to quantify the phenotype landscape of the altered network and identifies reverse control targets for recovering the phenotype landscape of a nominal network.

          "abstract": "Splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ) is an RNA binding protein that broadly regulates RNA metabolism. Although its nuclear roles are well studied, evidence of SFPQ’s cytoplasmic functionality is emerging. Altered expression and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution of SFPQ have been recognized in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology, yet the mechanistic bases for these phenomena remain undetermined. We identified altered SFPQ splicing in ALS, increasing the expression of an alternative mRNA isoform lacking a nuclear localization sequence, which we termed “ altSFPQ .” We find that altSFPQ mRNA contributes to SFPQ autoregulation and is highly unstable yet exhibits context-specific translation with cytoplasm-predominant localization. Notably, reduced canonical SFPQ coincides with increased altSFPQ transcript expression in familial and sporadic ALS models, providing a mechanistic basis for SFPQ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution in patients with ALS. Last, we observe that the altSFPQ protein has reduced phase separation potential and differential protein binding compared to its canonical counterpart, providing insight into its mechanistic relevance to physiology and ALS pathogenesis.",

We synthesized a metasurface-enhanced cooling cement using a universal, scalable pressure-driven fabrication strategy during a low-carbon production process. The self-assembly of multiple-sized reflective ettringites as main hydration products toward the metasurface, coupled with hierarchical pores, guaranteed high solar reflectance (96.2%), whereas raw materials containing alumina- and sulfur-rich function groups leveraged inherent mid-infrared emissivity (96.0%). This photonic-architectured cement achieved a temperature drop of 5.4°C during midday conditions with a solar intensity of 850 watts per square meter. This supercool cement featured intrinsic high strength, armored abrasive resistance, and optical stability, even when exposed to harsh conditions, such as corrosive liquids, ultraviolet radiation, and freeze-thaw cycles. A machine learning–guided life-cycle assessment indicated its potential to achieve a net-negative carbon emission profile.",

Here, we perform operando superfluid density measurements on ion-gated FeSe films. We observe a synchronized evolution of the superconducting condensate and the strange-metal phase with electron doping, from which a linear scaling between zero-temperature superfluid density and strange-metal resistivity coefficient is further established. The scaling also applies to different iron-based and cuprate superconductors despite their distinct electronic structures and pairing symmetries. Such a correlation can be reproduced in a theoretical calculation on the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model by considering a cooperative effect of quantum critical fluctuation and disorder. These findings suggest that a common mechanism may govern both the Cooper pair condensation and the normal-state strange metallicity in unconventional superconductors.",

However, the growth of lithium dendrites is inevitable, driven by the intrinsic properties of SSEs. Hence, guiding the growth of lithium dendrites in a controllable way is more feasible instead of completely preventing their growth. Here, we present a strategically designed structural layer composed of graded lithium nitride particles, which guides the growth of lithium dendrites within confined spaces. Meanwhile, this layer is paired with a less lithium-stable electrolyte and enables the guided lithium dendrites to self-limit within localized regions at the interface. The comprehensive analysis further reveals that the designed bilayer SSE effectively harnesses the interface-generated pressure during battery cycling, achieving dynamic control of lithium dendrite growth. This interfacial structure design of SSE holds broad applicability for regulating lithium dendrites in all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries.",

Integrating constraints from their spatiotemporal evolution with heat transfer estimates and geological observations, we propose that while the largest events might be related to volatiles degassed from magma, most events are generated by the implosion of bubbles formed from the vaporization of entrapped seawater by hot erupted lava. Similar events have been detected at other seamounts and slow to fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges, although eruptions at &gt;3000-meter depth have proportionately fewer events because seawater vaporization is inhibited. Therefore, these impulsive seafloor events can be leveraged to remotely characterize eruption dynamics in most submarine volcanic settings.",

Here, we describe a mechanism by which tubulin tyrosine ligase–like 11 (TTLL11) expands and diversifies the code. Cryo–electron microscopy revealed a unique bipartite MT recognition strategy wherein TTLL11 binding and catalytic domains engage adjacent MT protofilaments. Biochemical and cellular assays identified previously uncharacterized polyglutamylation patterns, showing that TTLL11 directly extends the primary polypeptide chains of α- and β-tubulin in vitro, challenging the prevailing paradigms emphasizing lateral branching. Moreover, cell-based and in vivo data suggest a cross-talk between polyglutamylation and the detyrosination/tyrosination cycle likely linked to the TTLL11-mediated elongation of the primary α-tubulin chain. These findings unveil an unrecognized layer of complexity within the tubulin code and offer mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of functional specialization of MT cytoskeleton.",

One possible hypothesis explaining this dichotomy is that cancer genes regulate common targets, which then function as master regulators of essential cancer phenotypes. To identify mechanisms that drive the most fundamental feature shared by all tumors—unrestricted cell proliferation—we used a multiomic approach, which identified translation and ribosome biogenesis as common targets of major oncogenic pathways across cancer types. Proteomic analysis of tumors and functional studies of cell cultures established nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 as a key node, whose convergent regulation, both transcriptionally and posttranslationally, is critical for tumor cell proliferation. Our results indicate that lineage-specific oncogenic pathways regulate the same set of targets for growth control, revealing key downstream nodes that could be targeted for therapy or chemoprevention.",

Moreover, we show that osteocytes are responsive to cholinergic signaling, influencing bone mechanoadaptation. We report sexually dimorphic patterns in bone structure and mechanobiology based on nAChR function. In females, osteocyte mechanosensitivity was decreased at small force magnitudes and tissue level deficits were recovered with anabolic loading. In males, osteocyte mechanosensitivity was increased in some groups and anabolic loading had very little effect on overall tissue architecture.

However, the mechanisms linking this pathway with membrane dynamics and signaling remain elusive. Here, we used cryo–focused ion beam–scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional tomography to identified GDSVs as a distinct vesicle population at the pollen tube tip. We further demonstrated that tobacco LORELEI-like glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein 4 (NtLLG4), a key signaling molecule controlling membrane dynamics and integrity, functions as a receptor for NtPPME1, regulating its polar exocytosis via GDSVs to control cell wall stiffness. Furthermore, we identified trafficking signals that direct the unconventional exocytosis of NtPPME1 across intracellular organelles.

By culturing doughnut-shape organoids on 3D-printed devices within standard 96-well plates, we generate hCO-MPSs with reduced necrosis, minimized hypoxia, and improved viability. Using these models, we found that monocytes from AD patients exhibit increased infiltration ability, decreased amyloid-β clearance capacity, and stronger inflammatory response than monocytes from age-matched control donors. Moreover, we observed that AD monocytes induce pro-inflammatory effects such as elevated astrocyte activation and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the marked increase in IL1B and CCL3 expression underscores their pivotal role in AD monocyte-mediated neuroinflammation.

Together with a complete theoretical framework, we found that such behavior is caused by the smaller liquid-solid friction with the same surface charge density for the semiconducting system.

          "abstract": "Scalable fabrication of high-efficiency all-perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) remains challenging due to notable voltage deficits in wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells, primarily driven by severe halide segregation during the large-scale blade coating process. Here, we introduce 4-aminobenzylphosphonic acid as a functional “2H-imprison” additive that selectively bypasses the formation of the 2H phase (an iodine-rich structure) and promotes the direct crystallization of the desired 3C phase, resulting in a homogeneous phase and halide distribution. Consequently, blade-coated 1.77–electron volt–bandgap perovskite solar cells achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.35% (certified 19.72%) with an open-circuit voltage of 1.35 volts for a ~0.07–square centimeter aperture area, while 1.02–square centimeter devices delivered a PCE of 19.00%. Furthermore, the corresponding blade-coated two- and four-terminal all-perovskite TSCs demonstrated high PCEs of 27.34 and 28.46%, respectively. This study reveals the origins of phase segregation during blade coating and provides a viable strategy to mitigate it, paving the way for scalable and high-efficiency TSCs.",

          "abstract": "Craniosynostosis is a common birth defect affecting 1 of the 2200 live births causing severe skull and cognitive defects, due to premature cranial suture fusion. The current surgical treatments require invasive calvaria vault remodeling and cranial bone resection in the baby. We demonstrate that inhibition of miR-200a in PMIS–miR-200a mice results in coronal suture fusion (craniosynostosis). Therefore, we use overexpression of miR-200a to prevent suture fusion in Twist1 mutant mice, a well-known model for craniosynostosis. We developed a PEGylated-peptide nanoparticle system to deliver plasmid DNA expressing miR-200a directly to the sutures of postnatal day 4 (P4) Twist1 mutant mice before suture fusion. Injection of the miR-200a nanoparticles under the scalp before suture fusion at P7 to P10 inhibited suture fusion. Treatments increased Gli1- and Six2-positive suture stem cells and the thickness of the periosteum layer. The treated Twist1 +/− mice increased body weight and were alert and active. We demonstrate an effective noninvasive gene therapy treatment for craniosynostosis.",

          "abstract": "Optical selection rules endorsed by symmetry are crucial for understanding the optical properties of quantum materials and the associated ultrafast spectral phenomena. Here, we introduce momentum-resolved Floquet optical selection rules using group theory to elucidate the pump-probe photoemission spectral distributions of monolayer black phosphorus (BP), which are governed by the symmetries of both the material and the lasers. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we further investigate the dynamical evolution of Floquet(-Volkov) states in the photoemission spectra of monolayer BP, revealing their spectral weights at specific momenta for each sideband. These observations are comprehensively explained by the proposed Floquet optical selection rules. Our framework not only clarifies experimental photoemission spectra but also uncovers unexplored characteristics under different pump-probe configurations. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of light-induced ultrafast spectra in BP and can be extended to other Floquet systems.",

          "abstract": "Writing magnetic bits through spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching is promising for fast and efficient magnetic random-access memory devices. While SOT switching of out-of-plane (OOP) magnetized states requires lateral symmetry breaking, in-plane (IP) magnetized states suffer from low storage density. Here, we demonstrate a field-free switching scheme using a 5-nanometer europium iron garnet film grown with a (110) orientation that shows a spin reorientation transition from OOP to IP above room temperature. This scheme combines the benefits of high-density storage in the OOP states at room temperature and the efficient field-free SOT switching in the IP states at elevated temperatures. While conventional switching of OOP bits faces the dilemma that high OOP anisotropy is required to improve bit stability and low OOP anisotropy is required to lower switching current density, this scheme disentangles this interdependence, allowing for low switching currents to be possible without sacrificing the bit stability, offering opportunities for future memory devices.",
