          "abstract": "Many children from low-income backgrounds worldwide fail to master school mathematics1; however, some children extensively use mental arithmetic outside school2,3. Here we surveyed children in Kolkata and Delhi, India, who work in markets (n = 1,436), to investigate whether maths skills acquired in real-world settings transfer to the classroom and vice versa. Nearly all these children used complex arithmetic calculations effectively at work. They were also proficient in solving hypothetical market maths problems and verbal maths problems that were anchored to concrete contexts. However, they were unable to solve arithmetic problems of equal or lesser complexity when presented in the abstract format typically used in school. The children’s performance in market maths problems was not explained by memorization, access to help, reduced stress with more familiar formats or high incentives for correct performance. By contrast, children with no market-selling experience (n = 471), enrolled in nearby schools, showed the opposite pattern. These children performed more accurately on simple abstract problems, but only 1% could correctly answer an applied market maths problem that more than one third of working children solved (β = 0.35, s.e.m. = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = 0.30–0.40, P < 0.001). School children used highly inefficient written calculations, could not combine different operations and arrived at answers too slowly to be useful in real-life or in higher maths. These findings highlight the importance of educational curricula that bridge the gap between intuitive and formal maths.",

          "abstract": "The integration of Indigenous perspectives and knowledge with biomedical approaches in neurosciences can significantly broaden the understanding of the human brain and mind. Drawing upon the writings of Elders in Canada, we refer to this integration as Two-Eyed Seeing or Etuaptmumk. We discuss how Two-Eyed Seeing and other dual perspectives can bring both breadth of knowledge and humility to the development of research and clinical practices for brain health. In this forward-looking discussion, we include both traditional academic and non-academic traditions and the work of Indigenous scholars on methodologies, life, health, culture, language and history. To describe challenges and consider solutions, we offer broad strategies for allyship, humility and universalism and situate them in four specific examples pertaining to disability, suicide, migration and the environment. We further advance the power of Two-Eyed Seeing in the context of new considerations for communication and public engagement. Two-Eyed Seeing, per se, is only one approach, but as neuroscience becomes ever more global, inclusive and ethically proactive, it must universally see the world of brain and mental health through the eyes of both reductionism and holism.",

          "abstract": "The genetic code is conserved across all domains of life, yet exceptions have revealed variations in codon assignments and associated translation factors1,2,3. Inspired by this natural malleability, synthetic approaches have demonstrated whole-genome replacement of synonymous codons to construct genomically recoded organisms (GROs)4,5 with alternative genetic codes. However, no efforts have fully leveraged translation factor plasticity and codon degeneracy to compress translation function to a single codon and assess the possibility of a non-degenerate code. Here we describe construction and characterization of Ochre, a GRO that fully compresses a translational function into a single codon. We replaced 1,195 TGA stop codons with the synonymous TAA in ∆TAG Escherichia coli C321.∆A4. We then engineered release factor 2 (RF2) and tRNATrp to mitigate native UGA recognition, translationally isolating four codons for non-degenerate functions. Ochre thus utilizes UAA as the sole stop codon, with UGG encoding tryptophan and UAG and UGA reassigned for multi-site incorporation of two distinct non-standard amino acids into single proteins with more than 99% accuracy. Ochre fully compresses degenerate stop codons into a single codon and represents an important step toward a 64-codon non-degenerate code that will enable precise production of multi-functional synthetic proteins with unnatural encoded chemistries and broad utility in biotechnology and biotherapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Fossils representing Cretaceous lineages of crown clade birds (Aves) are exceptionally rare but are crucial to elucidating major ecological shifts across early avian divergences. Among the earliest known putative crown birds is Vegavis iaai1,2,3,4,5, a foot-propelled diver from the latest Cretaceous (69.2–68.4 million years ago)6 of Antarctica with controversial phylogenetic affinities2,7,8,9,10. Initially recovered by phylogenetic analyses as a stem anatid (ducks and closely related species)1,2,11, Vegavis has since been recovered as a stem member of Anseriformes (waterfowl)7,8,9, or outside Aves altogether10. Here we report a new, nearly complete skull of Vegavis that provides new insight into its feeding ecology and exhibits morphologies that support placement among waterfowl within crown-group birds. Vegavis has an avian beak (absence of teeth and reduced maxilla) and brain shape (hyperinflated cerebrum and ventrally shifted optic lobes). The temporal fossa is well excavated and expansive, indicating that this bird had hypertrophied jaw musculature. The beak is narrow and pointed, and the mandible lacks retroarticular processes. Together, these features comprise a feeding apparatus unlike that of any other known anseriform but like that of other extant birds that capture prey underwater (for example, grebes and loons). The Cretaceous occurrence of Vegavis, with a feeding ecology unique among known Galloanserae (waterfowl and landfowl), is further indication that the earliest anseriform divergences were marked by evolutionary experiments unrepresented in the extant diversity3,11,12,13.",

          "abstract": "Linear conducting polymers show ballistic transport, imposed by mobile carriers moving along the polymer chains1,2, whereas conductance in the extended dimension, that is, between polymer strands or layers, remains weak due to the lack of intermolecular ordering and electronic coupling3,4,5. Here we report a multilayer-stacked two-dimensional polyaniline (2DPANI) crystal, which shows metallic out-of-plane charge transport with high electrical conductivity. The material comprises columnar π arrays with an interlayer distance of 3.59 Å and periodic rhombohedral lattices formed by interwoven polyaniline chains. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals significant electron delocalization in the 2DPANI lattices. First-principles calculations indicate the in-plane 2D conjugation and strong interlayer electronic coupling in 2DPANI facilitated by the Cl-bridged layer stacking. To assess the local optical conductivity, we used terahertz and infrared nanospectroscopy to unravel a Drude-type conductivity with an infrared plasma frequency and an extrapolated local d.c. conductivity of around 200 S cm−1. Conductive scanning probe microscopy showed an unusually high out-of-plane conductivity of roughly 15 S cm−1. Transport measurements through vertical and lateral micro-devices revealed comparable high out-of-plane (roughly 7 S cm−1) and in-plane conductivity (roughly 16 S cm−1). The vertical micro-devices further showed increasing conductivity with decreasing temperature, demonstrating unique out-of-plane metallic transport behaviour. By using this multilayer-stacked 2D conducting polymer design, we predict the achievement of strong electronic coupling beyond in-plane interactions, potentially reaching three-dimensional metallic conductivity6,7.",

          "abstract": "The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moiré systems research, and it may provide an insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-critical-temperature superconductors. Here we use d.c. transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics to directly measure the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG through its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory. Rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions1 and recent experimental indications2 of quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power law, which contraindicates an isotropic Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) model. Instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted in the Fermi liquid framework or by considering the quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both d.c. and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with the Ginzburg–Landau theory. Taken together, our findings show that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined d.c.–microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.",

          "authors": "Claire Kokontis, Timothy A. Klein, Sukrit Silas, Joseph Bondy-Denomy",
          "abstract": "Bacteriophages use diverse mechanisms to evade antiphage defence systems. ΦKZ-like jumbo phages assemble a proteinaceous, nucleus-like compartment that excludes antagonistic host nucleases and also internalizes DNA replication and transcription machinery1,2,3,4. The phage factors required for protein import and the mechanisms of selectivity remain unknown, however. Here we uncover an import system comprising proteins highly conserved across nucleus-forming phages, together with additional cargo-specific contributors. Using a genetic selection that forces the phage to decrease or abolish the import of specific proteins, we determine that the importation of five different phage nuclear-localized proteins requires distinct interfaces of the same factor, Imp1 (gp69). Imp1 localizes early to the nascent phage nucleus and forms discrete puncta in the mature phage nuclear periphery, probably in complex with direct interactor Imp6 (gp67), a conserved protein encoded in the same locus. The import of certain proteins, including a host topoisomerase, additionally requires Imp3 (gp59), a conserved factor necessary for proper Imp1 function. Three additional non-conserved phage proteins (Imp2 and Imp4/Imp5) are required for the import of two queried nuclear cargos (nuclear-localized protein 1 and host topoisomerase, respectively), perhaps acting as specific adaptors. We therefore propose a core import system that includes Imp1, Imp3 and Imp6, with multiple interfaces of Imp1 licensing transport through a protein lattice.",

          "abstract": "Cancer genome alterations often lead to vulnerabilities that can be used to selectively target cancer cells. Various inhibitors of such synthetic lethal targets have been approved by the FDA or are in clinical trials, highlighting the potential of this approach 1–3 . Here we analysed large-scale CRISPR knockout screening data from the Cancer Dependency Map and identified a new synthetic lethal target, PELO , for two independent molecular subtypes of cancer: biallelic deletion of chromosomal region 9p21.3 or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). In 9p21.3-deleted cancers, PELO dependency emerges from biallelic deletion of the 9p21.3 gene FOCAD , a stabilizer of the superkiller complex (SKIc). In MSI-H cancers, PELO is required owing to MSI-H-associated mutations in TTC37  (also known as  SKIC3 ), a critical component of the SKIc. We show that both cancer subtypes converge to destabilize the SKIc, which extracts mRNA from stalled ribosomes. In SKIc-deficient cells, PELO depletion induces the unfolded protein response, a stress response to accumulation of misfolded or unfolded nascent polypeptides. Together, our findings indicate PELO as a promising therapeutic target for a large patient population with cancers characterized as MSI-H with deleterious TTC37 mutations or with biallelic 9p21.3 deletions involving FOCAD .",

Thus, the identification of key regulators that promote the generation of pathological fibroblasts can inform the development of effective countermeasures against disease progression. Here we use two mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis to show that LEPR+ fibroblasts that arise during alveologenesis include SCUBE2+ alveolar fibroblasts as a major constituent. These alveolar fibroblasts in turn contribute substantially to CTHRC1+POSTN+ pathological fibroblasts. Genetic ablation of POSTN+ pathological fibroblasts attenuates fibrosis. Comprehensive analyses of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data reveal that RUNX2 is a key regulator of the expression of fibrotic genes. Consistently, conditional deletion of Runx2 with LeprcreERT2 or Scube2creERT2 reduces the generation of pathological fibroblasts, extracellular matrix deposition and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, LEPR+ cells that include SCUBE2+ alveolar fibroblasts are a key source of pathological fibroblasts, and targeting Runx2 provides a potential treatment option for pulmonary fibrosis.",

          "abstract": "Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, ideally enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity 1,2 . Photonic networks are well suited as a versatile and reconfigurable interconnect layer for DQC; remote entanglement shared between matter qubits across the network enables all-to-all logical connectivity through quantum gate teleportation (QGT) 3,4 . For a scalable DQC architecture, the QGT implementation must be deterministic and repeatable; until now, no demonstration has satisfied these requirements. Here we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of quantum computations between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules. The modules, separated by about two metres, each contain dedicated network and circuit qubits. By using heralded remote entanglement between the network qubits, we deterministically teleport a controlled-Z (CZ) gate between two circuit qubits in separate modules, achieving 86% fidelity. We then execute Grover’s search algorithm 5 —to our knowledge, the first implementation of a distributed quantum algorithm comprising several non-local two-qubit gates—and measure a 71% success rate. Furthermore, we implement distributed iSWAP and SWAP circuits, compiled with two and three instances of QGT, respectively, demonstrating the ability to distribute arbitrary two-qubit operations 6 . As photons can be interfaced with a variety of systems, the versatile DQC architecture demonstrated here provides a viable pathway towards large-scale quantum computing for a range of physical platforms.",

Human-directed applications of fungi extend from leavened bread, alcoholic beverages and biofuels to pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and psychoactive compounds. Conversely, fungal infections pose risks to ecosystems ranging from crops to wildlife to humans; these risks are driven, in part, by human and animal movement, and might be accelerating with climate change.

The increased rate of short-timescale, repetitive events around SMBHs, including the recently discovered quasi-periodic eruptions1,2,3,4,5, are garnering further interest in stellar-mass companions around SMBHs and the progenitors to millihertz-frequency gravitational-wave events. Here we report the discovery of a highly significant millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in an actively accreting SMBH, 1ES 1927+654, which underwent a major optical, ultraviolet and X-ray outburst beginning in 20186,7. The QPO was detected in 2022 with a roughly 18-minute period, corresponding to coherent motion on a scale of less than 10 gravitational radii, much closer to the SMBH than typical quasi-periodic eruptions. The period decreased to 7.1 minutes over 2 years with a decelerating period evolution (\\(\\ddot{P}\\) greater than zero). To our knowledge, this evolution has never been seen in SMBH QPOs or high-frequency QPOs in stellar-mass black holes. Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion struggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset angular-momentum losses, and the lack of a direct analogue to stellar-mass black-hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the observed properties of the QPO in 1ES 1927+654. Future X-ray monitoring will test these models, and if it is a stellar-mass orbiter, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should detect its low-frequency gravitational-wave emission.",

          "abstract": "Personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) can generate circulating immune responses against predicted neoantigens1,2,3,4,5,6. However, whether such responses can target cancer driver mutations, lead to immune recognition of a patient’s tumour and result in clinical activity are largely unknown. These questions are of particular interest for patients who have tumours with a low mutational burden. Here we conducted a phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02950766) to test a neoantigen-targeting PCV in patients with high-risk, fully resected clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC; stage III or IV) with or without ipilimumab administered adjacent to the vaccine. At a median follow-up of 40.2 months after surgery, none of the 9 participants enrolled in the study had a recurrence of RCC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All patients generated T cell immune responses against the PCV antigens, including to RCC driver mutations in VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, KDM5C and PIK3CA. Following vaccination, there was a durable expansion of peripheral T cell clones. Moreover, T cell reactivity against autologous tumours was detected in seven out of nine patients. Our results demonstrate that neoantigen-targeting PCVs in high-risk RCC are highly immunogenic, capable of targeting key driver mutations and can induce antitumour immunity. These observations, in conjunction with the absence of recurrence in all nine vaccinated patients, highlights the promise of PCVs as effective adjuvant therapy in RCC.",

          "abstract": "The hypothalamus is a brain region that plays a key role in coordinating fundamental biological functions 1 . However, our understanding of the underlying cellular components and neurocircuitries have, until recently, emerged primarily from rodent studies 2,3 . Here we combine single-nucleus sequencing of 433,369 human hypothalamic cells with spatial transcriptomics, generating a comprehensive spatio-cellular transcriptional map of the hypothalamus, the ‘HYPOMAP’. Although conservation of neuronal cell types between humans and mice, as based on transcriptomic identity, is generally high, there are notable exceptions. Specifically, there are significant disparities in the identity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and in the expression levels of G-protein-coupled receptors between the two species that carry direct implications for currently approved obesity treatments. Out of the 452 hypothalamic cell types, we find that 291 neuronal clusters are significantly enriched for expression of body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study genes. This enrichment is driven by 426 ‘effector’ genes. Rare deleterious variants in six of these ( MC4R , PCSK1 , POMC , CALCR , BSN and CORO1A ) associate with BMI at population level, and CORO1A has not been linked previously to BMI. Thus, HYPOMAP provides a detailed atlas of the human hypothalamus in a spatial context and serves as an important resource to identify new druggable targets for treating a wide range of conditions, including reproductive, circadian and metabolic disorders.",

Unlocking the full potential of such systems towards this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution and extensive probes for final state characterization. Here we present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits that supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analogue evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. This hybrid platform features more versatile measurement capabilities compared with analogue-only simulators, which we leverage here to reveal a coarsening-induced breakdown of Kibble–Zurek scaling predictions 3 in the XY model, as well as signatures of the classical Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition 4 . Moreover, the digital gates enable precise energy control, allowing us to study the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis 5–7 in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. We also demonstrate digital preparation of pairwise-entangled dimer states, and image the transport of energy and vorticity during subsequent thermalization in analogue evolution. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analogue–digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics.",

Over the past 15 years, synthetic lethal cancer target discovery approaches have led to clinical successes of PARP inhibitors2 and ushered several next-generation therapeutic targets such as WRN3, USP14, PKMYT15, POLQ6 and PRMT57 into the clinic. Here we identify, in human cancer, a novel synthetic lethal interaction between the PELO–HBS1L and SKI complexes of the mRNA quality control pathway. In distinct genetic contexts, including 9p21.3-deleted and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) tumours, we found that phenotypically destabilized SKI complex leads to dependence on the PELO–HBS1L ribosomal rescue complex. PELO–HBS1L and SKI complex synthetic lethality alters the normal cell cycle and drives the unfolded protein response through the activation of IRE1, as well as robust tumour growth inhibition. Our results indicate that PELO and HBS1L represent novel therapeutic targets whose dependence converges upon SKI complex destabilization, a common phenotypic biomarker in diverse genetic contexts representing a significant population of patients with cancer.",

          "abstract": "Dense crowds form some of the most dangerous environments in modern society1. Dangers arise from uncontrolled collective motions, leading to compression against walls, suffocation and fatalities2,3,4. Our current understanding of crowd dynamics primarily relies on heuristic collision models, which effectively capture the behaviour observed in small groups of people5,6. However, the emergent dynamics of dense crowds, composed of thousands of individuals, remains a formidable many-body problem lacking quantitative experimental characterization and explanations rooted in first principles. Here we analyse the dynamics of thousands of densely packed individuals at the San Fermín festival (Spain) and infer a physical theory of dense crowds in confinement. Our measurements reveal that dense crowds can self-organize into macroscopic chiral oscillators, coordinating the orbital motion of hundreds of individuals without external guidance. Guided by these measurements and symmetry principles, we construct a mechanical model of dense-crowd motion. Our model demonstrates that emergent odd frictional forces drive a non-reciprocal phase transition7 towards collective chiral oscillations, capturing all our experimental observations. To test the robustness of our findings, we show that similar chiral dynamics emerged at the onset of the 2010 Love Parade disaster and propose a protocol that could help anticipate these previously unpredictable dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The robustness of the macroscopic quantum nature of a superconductor can be characterized by the superfluid stiffness, ρs, a quantity that describes the energy required to vary the phase of the macroscopic quantum wavefunction. In unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, the low-temperature behaviour of ρs markedly differs from that of conventional superconductors owing to quasiparticle excitations from gapless points (nodes) in momentum space. Intensive research on the recently discovered magic-angle twisted graphene family has revealed, in addition to superconducting states, strongly correlated electronic states associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, inviting the study of ρs to uncover the potentially unconventional nature of its superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of ρs in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG), revealing unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity. Utilizing radio-frequency reflectometry techniques to measure the kinetic inductive response of superconducting TTG coupled to a microwave resonator, we find a linear temperature dependence of ρs at low temperatures and nonlinear Meissner effects in the current-bias dependence, both indicating nodal structures in the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, the doping dependence shows a linear correlation between the zero-temperature ρs and the superconducting transition temperature Tc, reminiscent of Uemura’s relation in cuprates, suggesting phase-coherence-limited superconductivity. Our results provide strong evidence for nodal superconductivity in TTG and put strong constraints on the mechanisms of these graphene-based superconductors.",

North Pontic foragers had ancestry from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 as well as European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. During the Eneolithic period, a wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga area7 bypassed local foragers to mix in equal parts with Trypillian farmers, forming the people of the Usatove culture around 4500 bce. A temporally overlapping wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga blended with foragers instead of farmers to form Serednii Stih people7. The third wave was the Yamna—descendants of the Serednii Stih who formed by mixture around 4000 bce and expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 bce). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka, Ukraine (3635–3383 bce), a site of archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic–Bronze Age transition and a likely epicentre of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves of migration propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders, a flexible strategy that may explain the success of the peoples of the North Pontic in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3,4,5,8,9,10.",

Cytokines that sustain CTL activity are attractive for cancer immunotherapy, but avoiding inflammatory toxicity remains a challenge for their clinical use2. Here we show that expression of a CTL signature is strongly associated with IL27 expression in human and mouse tumours. In mice, IL-27 acts directly on tumour-specific CTLs to promote their persistence and effector function in the tumour microenvironment. Moreover, treatment with inducible IL-27 overexpression or a half-life-extended IL-27 protein in vivo is well tolerated, induces regression of established tumours, drives an enhanced cytotoxic program in anti-tumour CTLs and synergizes with PD-L1 blockade. In patients with cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, high expression of IL-27 correlates with a favourable clinical response, and IL-27 supports human CTL function during chronic antigen stimulation ex vivo. Our data demonstrate that endogenous IL-27 is essential for anti-tumour immunity and that IL-27 receptor agonism can safely improve anti-tumour T cell responses alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade.",

If widely adopted on farmlands, it could help achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 2–4 . Here we show, with a detailed US state-specific carbon cycle analysis constrained by resource provision, that EW deployed on agricultural land could sequester 0.16–0.30 GtCO 2 yr −1 by 2050, rising to 0.25–0.49 GtCO 2 yr −1 by 2070. Geochemical assessment of rivers and oceans suggests effective transport of dissolved products from EW from soils, offering CDR on intergenerational timescales. Our analysis further indicates that EW may temporarily help lower ground-level ozone and concentrations of secondary aerosols in agricultural regions. Geospatially mapped CDR costs show heterogeneity across the USA, reflecting a combination of cropland distance from basalt source regions, timing of EW deployment and evolving CDR rates. CDR costs are highest in the first two decades before declining to about US$100–150 tCO 2 −1 by 2050, including for states that contribute most to total national CDR. Although EW cannot be a substitute for emission reductions, our assessment strengthens the case for EW as an overlooked practical innovation for helping the USA meet net-zero 2050 goals 5,6 . Public awareness of EW and equity impacts of EW deployment across the USA require further exploration 7,8 and we note that mobilizing an EW industry at the necessary scale could take decades.",

However, there are limited data on the antibody concentrations required to prevent infection. Clinical trials of bNAb prophylaxis have demonstrated partial efficacy 2 , but the sampling frequency typically does not allow precise timing of infection events and concurrent antibody levels. Here, using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, we show that although potent bNAbs can delay the onset of acute viremia, subclinical infections occur while bNAb levels remain high. Serial SIV challenge of monkeys given partially and fully neutralizing bNAbs revealed that ‘viral blips’—low and transient plasma viremia—often occur while serum bNAb concentrations are well above currently accepted protective levels. To understand the precise timing of the infections resulting in such blips, we performed plasma viral sequencing on monkeys that were serially challenged with genetically barcoded SIV after bNAb administration. These analyses showed that subclinical infections occurred in most animals that were given potent bNAb prophylaxis. These subclinical infections occurred while antibody concentrations were 2- to 400-fold higher than the levels required to prevent fully viremic breakthrough infection. This study demonstrates that immunoprophylaxis can mask subclinical infections, which may affect the interpretation of prophylactic HIV-1 bNAb clinical trials.",

In particular, optical vortices have found numerous applications20,21, ranging from quantum information to astrophysics. Furthermore, both optical and acoustic structured waves are crucial in the manipulation of small particles22,23,24,25, from atoms to macroscopic biological objects. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in structured water surface waves, which can be notable analogues of quantum, optical and acoustic wave systems26,27,28,29. However, topological water-wave forms, especially their ability to manipulate particles, have not yet been demonstrated. Here we describe the controllable generation of topological structures, namely wave vortices, skyrmions and polarization Möbius strips, in gravity water waves. Most importantly, we demonstrate the efficient manipulation of subwavelength and wavelength-order floating particles with topologically structured water waves. This includes trapping the particles in the high-intensity field zones and controlling their orbital and spinning motion due to the orbital and spin angular momenta of the water waves. Our results reveal the water-wave counterpart of optical and acoustic manipulation, which paves the way for applications in hydrodynamics and microfluidics.",

          "abstract": "The construction of superlattices with a spatial modulation of chemical compositions allows for the creation of artificial materials with tailorable periodic potential landscapes and tunable electronic and optical properties1,2,3,4,5. Conventional semiconductor superlattices with designable potential modulation in one dimension has enabled high-electron-mobility transistors and quantum-cascade lasers. More recently, a diverse set of superlattices has been constructed through self-assembly or guided assembly of multiscale building units, including zero-dimensional nanoclusters and nanoparticles6,7, one-dimensional nanorods and nanowires8,9, two-dimensional nanolayers and nanosheets10,11,12,13, and hybrid two-dimensional molecular assemblies14,15,16,17. These self-assembled superlattices feature periodic structural modulation in two or three dimensions, but often lack atomic precision owing to the inevitable structural disorder at the interfaces between the constituent units. Here we report a one-pot synthesis of multi-dimensional single-crystalline superlattices consisting of periodic arrangement of zero-, one- and two-dimensional building units. By exploiting zirconium (IV) metal–organic frameworks as host templates for directed nucleation and precise growth of metal-halide sublattices through a coordination-assisted assembly strategy, we synthesize a family of single-crystalline porous superlattices. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy clearly resolve the high-order superlattice structure with deterministic atomic coordinates. Further treatment with selected amine molecules produces perovskite-like superlattices with highly tunable photoluminescence and chiroptical properties. Our study creates a platform of high-order single-crystalline porous superlattices, opening opportunities to tailor the electronic, optical and quantum properties beyond the reach of conventional crystalline solids.",

          "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved over short timescales, leading to the emergence of more transmissible variants such as Alpha and Delta 1–3 . The arrival of the Omicron variant marked a major shift, introducing numerous extra mutations in the spike gene compared with earlier variants 1,2 . These evolutionary changes have raised concerns regarding their potential impact on immune evasion, disease severity and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments 1,3 . In this epidemiological study, we identified two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron versus pre-Omicron eras. Before Omicron, natural infection provided strong and durable protection against reinfection, with minimal waning over time. However, during the Omicron era, protection was robust only for those recently infected, declining rapidly over time and diminishing within a year. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by a dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution, leading to contrasting reinfection patterns before and after Omicron’s first wave. This shift in patterns suggests a change in evolutionary pressures, with intrinsic transmissibility driving adaptation pre-Omicron and immune escape becoming dominant post-Omicron, underscoring the need for periodic vaccine updates to sustain immunity.",

          "abstract": "In the centres of many galaxy clusters, the hot (approximately 107 kelvin) intracluster medium can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales1,2. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies3,4,5,6 and the absence of soft X-ray lines from the cooling gas7,8,9 suggest that most of this gas never cools. This is known as the cooling flow problem. The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures10,11,12,13,14,15,16. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all the gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here we present observations of the Phoenix cluster17 using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne vi] λ 7.652-μm emission line, enabling us to probe the gas at 105.5 kelvin on large scales. These data show extended [Ne vi] emission that is cospatial with the cooling peak in the intracluster medium, the coolest gas phases and the sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate, which we estimate to be 5,000–23,000 solar masses per year. These data provide a large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 105 kelvin and 106 kelvin in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback has in not only regulating cooling but also promoting it18.",

          "abstract": "Expanding the performance of field-effect devices is a key challenge of the ever-growing chip industry at the core of current technologies1. Non-volatile multiferroic transistors that control atomic movements rather than purely electronic distribution are highly desired2. Recently, a field-effect control over structural transitions was achieved in commensurate stacking configurations of honeycomb van der Waals (vdW) polytypes by sliding boundary strips between oppositely polarized domains3,4,5,6. This ferroelectric hysteretic response, however, relied on pre-existing dislocation strips between relatively large micron-scale domains, severely limiting practical implementations3,7,8. Here we report the robust electric switching of single-domain polytypes in nanometre-scale islands embedded in super-lubricant vdW arrays. We etch cavities into a thin layered spacer and then encapsulate it with functional flakes. The flakes above/under the lattice-mismatched spacer sag and touch at each cavity to form islands of commensurate and metastable polytype configurations. By imaging the polarization of the polytypes, we observe nucleation and annihilation of boundary strips and geometry-adaptable ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Using mechanical stress, we further control the position of boundary strips, modify marginal twist angles and nucleate patterns of polar domain. This super-lubricant arrays of polytype (SLAP) concept suggests ‘slidetronics’ device applications such as elastic-coupled neuromorphic memory cells and non-volatile multiferroic tunnelling transistors and programmable response by designing the size, shape and symmetry of the islands and of the arrays9.",

          "abstract": "Antimicrobial compounds are essential for controlling bacterial infections. Stress-induced bacterial tolerance and persisters can undermine antimicrobial activities under laboratory conditions, but their quantitative effects under physiological conditions remain unclear 1,2 . Here we determined constraints on clearance of Salmonella by antimicrobials in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats. The antibiotics enrofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited poor anti- Salmonella activity under both conditions, primarily owing to severe nutrient starvation, which restricted Salmonella replication 3–5 . Other infection-associated conditions, such as acidic pH, glucose, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, antimicrobial peptides, osmolarity, oxygen limitation, carbon dioxide and carbonate, as well as drug efflux, toxin–antitoxin modules and cell size had limited effects. A subset of resilient Salmonella appeared as a key obstacle for clearance by enrofloxacin, based on the biphasic decline of Salmonella colony-forming units. However, these data were misleading, because colony formation was confounded by extensive post-exposure killing. More accurate single-cell, real-time assays showed uniformly slow damage, indicating high resilience across the entire Salmonella population. The resulting extensive survival of bulk bacteria minimized the effect of hyper-resilient persisters. Thus, starvation-induced general resilience of Salmonella was the main cause of poor antibiotic clearance. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying antibiotic activity with real-time, single-cell assays under physiological conditions.",

          "abstract": "The Yamnaya archaeological complex appeared around 3300 bc across the steppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and by 3000 bc it reached its maximal extent, ranging from Hungary in the west to Kazakhstan in the east. To localize Yamnaya origins among the preceding Eneolithic people, we assembled ancient DNA from 435 individuals, demonstrating three genetic clines. A Caucasus–lower Volga (CLV) cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer1 ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end and a northern end at Berezhnovka along the lower Volga river. Bidirectional gene flow created intermediate populations, such as the north Caucasus Maikop people, and those at Remontnoye on the steppe. The Volga cline was formed as CLV people mixed with upriver populations of Eastern hunter-gatherer2 ancestry, creating hypervariable groups, including one at Khvalynsk. The Dnipro cline was formed when CLV people moved west, mixing with people with Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry3 along the Dnipro and Don rivers to establish Serednii Stih groups, from whom Yamnaya ancestors formed around 4000 bc and grew rapidly after 3750–3350 bc. The CLV people contributed around four-fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya and, entering Anatolia, probably from the east, at least one-tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age central Anatolians, who spoke Hittite4,5. We therefore propose that the final unity of the speakers of ‘proto-Indo-Anatolian’, the language ancestral to both Anatolian and Indo-European people, occurred in CLV people some time between 4400 bc and 4000 bc.",

However, a theory-guided mechanoresponsive materials system with well-defined ultrasound activation has yet to be explored5,6. Here we present the concept of using porous hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) as toolkits for focused ultrasound (FUS) programmably triggered drug activation to control specific cellular events in the deep brain, through on-demand scission of the supramolecular interactions. A theoretical model is developed to potentially visualize the mechanochemical scission and ultrasound mechanics, providing valuable guidelines for the rational design of mechanoresponsive materials to achieve programmable control. To demonstrate the practicality of this approach, we encapsulate the designer drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO) into the optimal HOF nanocrystals for FUS-gated release to activate engineered G-protein-coupled receptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of mice and rats and hence achieve targeted neural circuit modulation even at depth 9 mm with a latency of seconds. This work demonstrates the capability of ultrasound to precisely control molecular interactions and develops ultrasound-programmable HOFs to non-invasively and spatiotemporally control cellular events, thereby facilitating the establishment of precise molecular therapeutic possibilities.",

In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter1, fundamental high-energy processes2, quantum metrology3,4 and quantum algorithms5. Here we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)-dimensional Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains6. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (‘Higgs’) mode7. These observations offer a viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and non-equilibrium quantum processes.",

          "abstract": "Granzymes are a family of serine proteases mainly expressed by CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and innate-like lymphocytes1. Although their primary function is thought to be the induction of cell death in virally infected and tumor cells, accumulating evidence indicates certain granzymes can elicit inflammation by acting on extracellular substrates1. Recently, we found that the majority of tissue CD8+ T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium and in inflamed organs across other diseases express granzyme K (GZMK)2, a tryptase-like protease with poorly defined function. Here, we show that GZMK can activate the complement cascade by cleaving C2 and C4. The nascent C4b and C2b fragments form a C3 convertase that cleaves C3, enabling assembly of a C5 convertase that cleaves C5. The resulting convertases generate all the effector molecules of the complement cascade: the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, the opsonins C4b and C3b, and the membrane attack complex. In RA synovium, GZMK is enriched in regions with abundant complement activation, and fibroblasts are the major producers of complement proteins that serve as substrates for GZMK-mediated complement activation. Further, Gzmk-deficient mice have less severe arthritis and dermatitis with concomitant decreases in complement activation. Our findings describe the discovery of a previously unidentified mechanism of complement activation that is entirely driven by lymphocyte-derived GZMK. Given the widespread abundance of GZMK-expressing T cells in tissues in chronic inflammatory diseases, GZMK-mediated complement activation is likely to be an important contributor to tissue inflammation in multiple disease contexts.",

          "abstract": "Place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are elements of a neural map of self position 1–5 . For these cells to benefit navigation, their representation must be dynamically related to the surrounding locations 2 . A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal’s path has been described for place cells, in which the sequence of spikes in each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal’s current location towards upcoming locations 6–8 . In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms when the animal approaches the choice point 9,10 , raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials 10 . However, to bridge the animal’s path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats that in individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal’s location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps are accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells that have putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive grid × direction cells. Sweeps extend into never-visited locations that are inaccessible to the animal. Sweeps persist during REM sleep. The sweep directions can be explained by an algorithm that maximizes the cumulative coverage of the surrounding manifold space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left–right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal–hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient ‘look around’ mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path.",

Several times a year, she says, researchers at prestigious US institutions come to her asking to recruit study participants from her community.\n\nFraser turns many away for neglecting to consider the community’s input or failing to recognize and compensate the work that the institution would contribute by facilitating collaboration. She now accepts only the proposals that share funding and project leadership with researchers at Arthur Ashe. It’s exhausting, says Fraser. “You feel as though you are always in a constant fight.”\n\nThis experience is not unique. Around the world, many resource-poor institutions that support marginalized communities, such as Indigenous peoples or Black and Latine groups, are courted by staff and researchers at nearby well-off institutions who lack the understanding to create equitable partnerships. “The issue is that a privileged person is taking advantage of a less-privileged one. It can be very patronizing,” says Adriana Romero-Olivares, a microbial ecologist at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.\n\nDescribed as ‘domestic helicopter research’ in Cell last year1, the term refers to a well-documented scenario in which scientists from wealthy countries conduct research in low- or middle-income countries with little to no involvement of local communities and researchers. The “helicopter” or “parachute” collaborators leave, taking data and expertise from local people instead of working to ensure that they are engaged with and benefit from the research.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nDomestic helicopter research — often focused on race, ethnicity or genetic ancestry — occurs when unequal partnerships form between researchers in the same country. It results in the “erosion of trust between researchers and the communities they aim to serve”, wrote Marcus Lambert, a public-health epidemiologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in New York City, and his co-authors in the Cell commentary. A major concern, he says, is that the practice seems to be on the rise in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nHarmful effects\n\nOne damaging aspect of domestic helicopter research is that it “saps funding” from poorer institutions, Lambert and his co-authors say. In the past three years, less than one-third of funding from the US National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities — a department that aims to address health challenges faced by minority racial and ethnic groups, rural populations and those with low socio-economic status — has gone to the poorer institutions that serve these communities.\n\nResearchers are also concerned that such work often doesn’t serve the people who were asked to participate, and can sometimes harm them.\n\nA 2020 paper led by Brandon Brown, a public-health researcher at the University of California, Riverside, describes a case study in which a community leader had agreed to work with a researcher from a US university on a survey about HIV and ageing2. The local leader was expected to recruit participants and pay for a space to conduct the survey. He then had to fight to get access to the resulting survey material, which he discovered contained stigmatizing and outdated terminology. He also found out that there were no plans to disseminate the data or results in a way that might help the participants or their wider community.\n\nWhen Brown presented the paper at a conference, he received criticism from some attendees for naming the researchers involved. “I responded that this is why it keeps happening — because it’s invisible,” he says.\n\nLambert and his colleagues say that the COVID-19 pandemic — which brought US health disparities into sharp focus — has led to an increase in domestic helicopter research across the country. Health-equity studies gained more funding as a result of the pandemic, and the recipients sought out more researchers and participants from poorer communities. This has led to surging cases of domestic helicopter research, the Cell commentary states.\n\nThere are no data on the incidence of domestic helicopter research worldwide, but Fernanda Adame, an environmental scientist at Griffith University in Nathan, Australia, says that it’s likely to be more common in countries that have large wealth disparities. “If you don’t address it, your research is not going to be as good, as you will have limited information and limited impact,” she adds. “If you didn’t speak to the people involved [in the research], they are less likely to use that information.”\n\nPositive changes",

          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "The headquarters of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.Credit: Getty\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has mandated that all scientific manuscripts produced by its researchers that are under review at a journal be withdrawn so that certain language relating to gender can be stripped from them.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nThe directive, sent by the agency’s chief science officer to some staff members on 31 January, is meant to bring the CDC into compliance with an executive order issued that month by US President Donald Trump seeking to restore “biological truth” to the federal government by recognizing only two sexes: male and female. Executive orders can direct agencies inside the federal government but cannot change existing laws.\n\nAccording to a copy of the e-mail, shared in the newsletter Inside Medicine, manuscripts must not include any mention of terms including ‘gender’, ‘transgender’, ‘pregnant person’, ‘transsexual’ or ‘non-binary’. CDC scientists who co-author papers originating from outside the agency that include these terms are also expected to rescind their authorship.\n\nIt’s unclear how many scientific reports will be affected by the mandate, which applies to all manuscripts written or co-authored by CDC researchers and includes papers that are being prepared for submission, in revisions with journal editors or have been accepted for publication but not yet posted online. It is also uncertain whether journals, which have their own rules for discussing gender and sex, will comply with the directive. Fields such as public health, which have embraced gender identity as an aspect of research in topics including health disparities, are likely to be affected the most by the rules.\n\n“This announcement is mind-boggling in its implications,” says Thomas Babor, an emeritus professor of public health at UConn Health in Farmington, Connecticut. “Because of the enormous impact the CDC has in the United States and globally, the instruction to remove mentions of ‘forbidden terms’ could stifle the usefulness of scientific research for years to come.”\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services, which is the parent agency to the CDC, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe importance of language\n\nGendered terms such as ‘man’, ‘woman’ and ‘non-binary’ have been widely embraced across scientific disciplines because, unlike terms related to biological sex (for example, male and female), they provide cultural, social and psychological context for a person’s lived experience.\n\n‘Never seen anything like this’: Trump’s team halts NIH meetings and travel\n\nThe CDC mandate, however, will erase mention of queer, intersex and transgender individuals from future literature and seems to legitimize “scientific sexism”, says James Mungin, a biomedical scientist at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, who identifies as transgender. Under the new rules, CDC researchers would be unable to share basic demographic data, such as gender identity or sexual orientation, about study participants — omissions that could lead to inaccuracies or ethical breaches if scientists are barred from disclosing why certain participants were removed from a study, Mungin says. Furthermore, gender identity and sexual orientation are nearly impossible to exclude when it comes to the study and treatment of conditions such as HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n“If you’re working in basic science, you might get away with just references to sex, but gender is everywhere in public health,” says Ayden Scheim, a social epidemiologist at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who identifies as trans and studies the health care of marginalized communities. “Unfortunately, I see two things happening: a lot of these withdrawn papers will never be published” because collaborators outside the CDC aren’t going to agree to omit data, Scheim says, “and in the long term, a lot of research that focuses on health inequities for women or LGBTQ+ people will disappear”.",

          "title": "‘Taung Child’ fossil offers clues about the evolution of childhood",
          "authors": "Dean Falk",
          "abstract": "In November 1924 — on the day they were hosting a wedding at their Johannesburg home in South Africa — Australian anatomist and physician Raymond Dart and his wife Dora noticed two men staggering up the drive with two large boxes. According to Dart’s memoirs, written decades later1, Dora had bemoaned the fact that the fossils Dart had been expecting had arrived on this day “of all days”. She had begged him not to “go delving in all that rubble until the wedding [was] over and everybody [had] left”.\n\nThe boxes contained what would become one of the world’s most famous fossils, the Taung Child.\n\n100 years of Australopithecus\n\nIn just a few weeks — astonishingly — Dart was able to use this one individual to surmise the broad course of human evolution as we understand it today. Previous evidence for human ancestry made use of fossils that bore a closer resemblance to modern humans. Dart’s description was astounding because it was of a species that was more apelike than humanlike, a revelation that in turn suggested that humanity’s evolutionary path had originated in Africa.\n\nDart’s report of the fossilized skull and matching endocast — an internal cast of the braincase formed from sediments that had accumulated in it — was published2 in Nature on 7 February 1925. Both the discovery and Dart’s insights deserve to be celebrated. There were, however, things that Dart could not have known and details that he misconstrued. Today — a century on — the fossil is still prompting questions about human evolution.\n\nFresh finds\n\nIn his Nature paper, Dart argued that the Taung Child belonged to a previously unknown group of bipedal human ancestors that he called ‘man-apes’ or more formally, Australopithecus africanus, meaning southern ape from Africa.\n\nDart’s find was described in newspapers all over the world, and he became famous overnight. But it took decades and the discovery of more australopithecine fossils in South Africa before scientists began to accept his controversial ideas about human evolution. At the time, several fellows of the Royal Society of London thought that a specimen found in the village of Piltdown in East Sussex, UK, known as Piltdown Man (which was later exposed as a hoax), belonged to the oldest ancestor leading to modern humans.\n\nBut Dart’s ideas were eventually accepted. In fact, his announcement in 1925 nailed the big picture of hominin evolution as it is understood today. His claim that Taung belonged to a previously unrecognized group of early hominins that shared features of both humans and other living apes still holds. So does his inference that Taung was bipedal because of where the spinal cord entered the bottom of the skull. He also speculated correctly that the genus Homo arose from Australopithecus and that, as Charles Darwin had predicted3, the cradle of humanity was in Africa rather than in England or Asia.\n\nDart judged Taung to be a six-year-old child with a cranial capacity (a proxy for brain size) of 520 cubic centimetres4. He also estimated the fossil’s age to be about one million years. However, in the mid-1920s, few comparisons had been made of the development of humans and other apes after birth and during infancy and other life-history stages. Moreover, Dart did not have access to imaging technologies available today, which enable scientists to ‘see’ inside fossilized bones5, or to the techniques now used to date fossils.\n\nPalaeoanthropologist Phillip Tobias (right) points out a feature on Taung’s endocast to Ramond Dart (left) and the author (D.F.) in 1984.Credit: Dean Falk\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Taung’s age at death has been revised by researchers who study the evolution of growth and development in part by evaluating dental development and brain growth in an expanding record of fossil hominin juveniles6. We now know that Taung was around 3.8 years old when it died, with a brain of near-adult size and developmental maturity beyond that of a human of the same age6. (Some scientists think Taung was female because the best current estimate for its adult cranial capacity, around 405 cubic centimetres, is low for australopithecines, and female australopithecines had smaller braincases than males did7.) Another study indicates that Taung dates to about 2.58 million years ago, which is well within the range of 3.6 million to 2 million years ago for all of the Australopithecus specimens found in South Africa8.\n\nOut of Africa: celebrating 100 years of human-origins research\n\nThese are not trivial revisions. On the contrary, they raise important questions about when, why and how an unusual life-history stage — namely childhood — evolved and what other changes (such as in brain size) accompanied its emergence.\n\nMost ape infants can cling onto their mothers’ bodies actively by a few months after their birth, whereas human babies are slower to mature and remain dependent on their parents or carers for much longer. Indeed, most apes do not have a childhood — a period during which individuals who are weaned continue to be nurtured, mainly by their elders.\n\nIn her assessment of Taung’s baby teeth and first permanent molars, biological anthropologist B. Holly Smith concluded that Taung was maturing at the rate of a non-human ape and was well accustomed to solid foods, although it might still have received a low level of nursing. According to Smith, “Taung died at, or did not long survive, the transition to independent feeding, as a ‘weanling’.” It was not a “‘child’ in any scientific sense”6.\n\nHumans evolved for distance running — but ancestor ‘Lucy’ didn’t go far or fast\n\nThe revised estimates, suggesting an ape-like rate of development, indicate that — ironically — the Taung Child never had, and would never have had (even had it survived), a childhood6.\n\nChildhood is probably a crucial innovation in human evolution because it creates the opportunity for offspring to learn much more from their nurturing elders than would otherwise be possible. In fact, the emergence of a prolonged period of dependency or ‘helplessness’ in human ancestors is widely thought to have produced conditions conducive to cognitive evolution.\n\nAt first blush, it might seem puzzling that australopithecines matured at an apelike pace even though they were bipedal. But unlike later hominins, australopithecines spent much of their time in trees and, like other apes, probably slept there. They would have needed the faster-developing apelike anatomy to climb and move through trees. The apelike development of Taung and other australopithecines suggests that delayed growth and childhood emerged only after the descendants of australopithecines had begun to live fully on the ground and had lost numerous arboreal adaptations. As terrestrial bipedalism became more habitual, evolutionary tweaks that slowed down and elaborated the development of nervous, skeletal and muscular systems probably repurposed much of the anatomy that had been needed for arboreal locomotion.\n\nInto the unknown\n\nSmith and others have suggested that, rather than emerging in australopithecines, childhood probably evolved in Homo erectus — possibly along with increased body size, brain size and cognitive capacities. Meanwhile, some researchers have found that the rate of dental growth in an approximately 1.77-million-year-old Homo fossil from Dmanisi, Georgia, was relatively high9 — similar to the rate of dental growth found in Taung and living great apes6. In this specimen, however, the formation of the posterior teeth was delayed, as it is in modern humans. Because Dmanisi individuals had brains that were not much bigger than those of great apes or australopithecines, some have suggested that this delay might have been associated with the emergence of childhood before a large brain evolved9.",

Missteps in communication — whether intentional or not — can undermine trust and even harm the reputation of entire fields.\n\nI started working in science communication as a postdoctoral fellow at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), and I spent time in the policy and communications office at the NIH’s National Institute of Nursing Research. When the COVID-19 pandemic shut down non-urgent research on the NIH campus, I decided to start exploring careers in communication. I took a position supporting medical and scientific communications for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, which funds US biomedical research. In 2021, I transitioned into public relations through an account role at an agency called LifeSci Communications, in New York City; a year later, I shifted to specialize in scientific storytelling at Syneos Health Communications, also in New York.\n\nIn public relations, we shape how people perceive a company or a product, working across many communication platforms: websites, press releases, social media and more. In my role, I focus on creating a compelling narrative to help biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies communicate their scientific approach to investors, the media and consumers. For me, distilling complex topics into messages that resonate is a welcome challenge.\n\nWhether helping a client to explain why the science behind their treatment is unique, or combating vaccine misinformation, I’ve found that the temptation to misrepresent, inflate or otherwise hype data is ever present, as are the dangers that come with doing so.\n\nConsider Theranos, the biotech start-up in Palo Alto, California. The company’s bold claims about revolutionizing blood testing captured public and investor interest, but its refusal to acknowledge technical limitations or share transparent data led to one of the most notorious scandals in science and technology. Ultimately, the company was shut down in 2018, and founder Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of fraud in 2022.\n\n‘Blood, sweat and tears’: Building a network for Black scientists\n\nThe fallout left scientists questioning whether the benefits of other scientific innovations had been over-inflated, and many called for more rigorous peer-reviewed evidence before funding new ventures. This ripple effect shows the stakes of miscommunication – it can undermine public trust in legitimate breakthroughs, spinning fact into fiction.\n\nThe temptation to ‘sell out’ is present across the science-communications industry, in which the pressure to stand out might overshadow the responsibility to communicate with integrity. Overselling findings, cherry-picking data or making claims that the evidence does not yet support can seem like a quick route to funding or to recognition. But these shortcuts come at a cost: eroded trust, scepticism about future work and, in some cases, damage to a field’s reputation.\n\nKisha Greer works in public relations, helping companies to honestly and ethically communicate their scientific approach.Credit: Julia Johnson Photography\n\nThe lessons from Theranos are clear: hype and secrecy are a dangerous combination. But how can scientists avoid these pitfalls and communicate their work responsibly? Here are some strategies for selling science without crossing the line into spin.\n\nSet realistic expectations\n\nScience is inherently exciting; it offers new possibilities and solutions to pressing challenges. But that excitement should never come at the expense of honesty. Research is rarely foolproof, and overselling it by exaggerating its impact or downplaying its limitations can backfire, leading to disappointment and scepticism when the full picture emerges.\n\nOne way to set realistic expectations is to ask yourself, “If this statement was taken out of context in a headline, would it still accurately represent the research?” This exercise helps to identify overly broad or optimistic phrases, which should be replaced with precise, contextual language such as ‘early-stage research’ or ‘preclinical findings’.\n\nAnother approach is to emphasize the scientific journey rather than just the destination. Instead of saying, “On the basis of the early clinical data, this treatment could cure cancer,” highlight the next step forwards: “Early clinical data suggest this treatment has the potential to improve outcomes for people with cancer. To explore this further, we’ve initiated a phase II study to better understand its effects and expect to see initial results by the end of the next year.” This statement highlights progress while acknowledging that the research is ongoing.\n\nClear communication ensures that audiences understand the iterative nature of science. Research evolves. Setting realistic expectations from the start fosters trust and enthusiasm that will last beyond the initial headlines.\n\nKnow your audience’s needs\n\nA message that resonates with one group might fall flat with another. Tailoring communication to your audience is critical.\n\nFor instance, if you’re writing a grant application for research on stem-cell responses to traumatic brain injury (TBI), focus on feasibility, potential impact and measurable goals to show how the work could fill a gap in TBI treatments. When presenting your findings at a scientific conference, highlight the methodologies and technical details that underpin your results. Discuss, for example, which imaging techniques were used to track the integration of stem cells and the strategies for quantifying stem-cell responses.\n\nIf, instead, you are communicating to the general public, focus on why your research matters to society and what people can expect as a result. Avoid boring them with too many technical details. This might require simplifying your message, so that more people can understand it: “My research explores how the brain can heal itself by using its own cells to repair damage.”\n\nBy aligning your message with your audience’s needs, you can prevent misunderstandings and ensure that the most relevant information comes through. Clear, targeted messaging builds credibility, creating a foundation for long-term engagement.\n\nUse data transparently to build trust\n\nTransparency is more than an ethical responsibility; it’s the foundation of trust. People respect honesty, especially when it includes uncertainties and setbacks.\n\nData are at the core of science and should be used thoughtfully and generously to support your points. Highlighting only favourable results can give a skewed picture of the research, leading audiences to overestimate its impact. Instead, aim for a balanced view, showing both supportive and contrasting data and acknowledging any limitations.\n\nWhen preparing to present data, I often start by asking, “What’s the most important takeaway, and what context does the audience need to fully understand it?” For example, if a study on Parkinson’s disease showed positive results in a small subgroup of participants with mild neurocognitive decline but mixed outcomes in the overall study group, craft your messaging to reflect that variability.\n\nEmphasize how the findings added to the scientific understanding of the disease. Rather than focusing solely on the positive results found in the subgroup, this approach provides the context needed to position the study as an important step forwards without overstating its immediate implications for people with Parkinson’s.\n\nSuch transparency builds trust with your audience and amplifies the impact of your science.",

Wanyama, a 29-year-old in Nairobi who was born HIV-positive, is one of millions of people worldwide whose life-saving treatment is funded by a US foreign aid programme.\n\nThe HIV clinic Wanyama visits has managed to continue delivering medications to its patients — although many clinics aren’t, say researchers. But drug supplies are being rationed.\n\nExclusive: how NSF is scouring research grants for violations of Trump’s orders\n\n“We patients who are HIV positive, we are really panicked,” says Wanyama, whose two children do not carry the virus. He’s lost his job mentoring other HIV-positive people at a US-funded facility and is worried about continued access to medication. “The way things are going, I feel like I have worked so much for nothing.”\n\nAs the Trump administration announces drastic policy changes, nowhere is the shock more palpable than in the field of global health. Scientists, medics and health officials say the outsize US influence on battling disease globally will be difficult to quickly replace.\n\nUS actions such as the foreign-aid freeze and its pull-out from the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, will affect billions of dollars in annual funding to battle HIV, malaria and other areas in global health. That will cost lives and threaten global security, say researchers. “It will make the world a less safe place,” says Peter Horby, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of Oxford, UK.\n\n‘High anxiety moment’: Biden’s NIH chief talks Trump 2.0 and the future of US science\n\nFunding freeze\n\nAfter the Trump administration announced a three-month freeze on foreign aid last month, effects have rippled through the global-health community. Programmes supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) — where many employees have been furloughed, according to news reports — fund research, prevention and care for diseases such as HIV and malaria, and work on other global health priorities.\n\n“People haven’t had a chance to get alternative funding because of the abrupt nature of this,” says Salim Abdool Karim, director of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, in Durban. The centre was due this week to enrol the first patient in a USAID-funded trial of HIV vaccines, which is now on hold. It is using its reserve funds to continue a trial testing whether a vaginal insertion can prevent HIV transmission.\n\nHIV clinics in Kenya and elsewhere have been affected by the freezes on US aid money.Credit: Pedro Ugarte/AFP via Getty\n\n“It is chaos,” says an HIV researcher in Africa, who runs a clinic that treats thousands of patients and is supported by a US programme called the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and asked not to be named because of fears of reprisal. More than 20 million people mostly in Africa, including more than a million children and pregnant people, receive antiretroviral drugs through the US$6.5-billion programme.\n\nThe clinic has had to suspend staff, which were funded by PEPFAR, and its patients are continuing to receive drugs only because of volunteer efforts. Last night, the clinic received a waiver from the US government that appears to allow them to resume HIV treatment, but uncertainty abounds.\n\nHIV treatments threatened\n\nIn South Africa, where the government provides the bulk of HIV care using some PEPFAR funding, the impact of the aid freeze will be minimal, says Abdool Karim. But in many other African countries, “if PEPFAR services stop, the effect will be catastrophic. The governments can’t just step in to meet the shortfall”.\n\nStopping antiretroviral treatment causes virus levels to rebound, making it possible for a person to transmit HIV — including through pregnancy to unborn children — and facilitating the evolution of drug resistance. “I’m hoping that someone somewhere sees sense and does not continue this abrupt ending of AIDS treatment programmes,” says Abdool Karim.",

The findings are published on 5 February in Nature1,2.\n\n“I think they are truly groundbreaking,” says Kristian Kristiansen, an archaeologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. “This really solves two big unresolved questions.” The first is the origin of the Yamnaya.\n\nThe second was posed in the eighteenth century, when scholars noticed similarities between classical Greek and Latin and Sanskrit, an ancient language from South Asia, and suggested a common origin.\n\nNearly half the world’s population speaks at least one of the roughly 400 Indo–European languages. These include nearly all European and Central Asian languages, as well as those from South Asia and Iran.\n\n“This Indo–European story has been mystery for 200 years, and now step by step, we are coming closer to the solution,” says Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Helsinki.\n\n‘Tracer dye’\n\nFor decades, the leading theory for the ubiquity of Indo–European languages was that early farmers, living in a region known as Anatolia, which includes present-day Turkey, exported languages in the family as the agricultural revolution spread starting around 9,000 years ago.\n\nThe ‘Anatolian hypothesis’ took a blow in 2015, when two blockbuster ancient-genomics papers identified a migration of Yamnaya herders across Eurasia beginning 5,500 years ago3,4. This and subsequent work showing the arrival of ‘steppe’ ancestry in most places that Indo–European languages are spoken was ammunition for the ‘steppe hypothesis’ that Yamnaya were responsible for seeding Indo-European languages far and wide.\n\n“Yamnaya ancestry is like a tracer dye whose spread you can connect with Indo–European language spread,” says David Reich, a population geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who co-led the latest studies.\n\nThe region around the Caucasus mountains, between Europe and Asia, was home to people who spoke the earliest Indo-European languages.Credit: Yuriy Pozdnikov/Alamy\n\nBut even with the genetic evidence, the steppe hypothesis had a major problem: how to explain the Anatolian branch of Indo–European — some scholars use the term Indo–Anatolian — which includes Hittite, a language used by a civilization that flourished in modern-day Turkey in the second millennium bc. Geneticists have failed to find Yamnaya ancestry in ancient Anatolian speakers.\n\nIn search of that connection, Reich and his colleagues hoped to identify the genetic origins of the Yamnaya. This has been a challenge because of the group’s rapid expansion of a nearly identical genetic signature. “It looks like a kind of cancer tumour, and you can’t say where the origin of the tumour is because it expanded so fast,” says Reich.\n\nTo overcome this, Reich and his colleagues, including scientists in Russia and Ukraine, generated genome data from 428 ancient individuals, including hundreds of Yamnaya people and individuals who predated them living across the steppe and further southeast along the Caucasus mountains.\n\nRoute to Anatolia\n\nThe approach identified a genetic signature in people living in a region between the Caucasus mountains and the lower Volga River to the north that connects the earliest Yamnaya and ancient Anatolians. Reich’s team found that the Yamnaya emerged when people with Caucasus-Lower Volga ancestry moved west around 6,000 years ago and mixed with a diverse group of hunter-gatherers living along the Black Sea. The same Caucasus-Lower Volga ancestry also appeared in ancient Anatolia around this time.\n\nBased on this evidence, the researchers think that the earliest Indo-European languages were spoken by people living in the Caucasus–Lower Volga, who then carried them to Anatolia and to the Black Sea steppe, where the Yamnaya and their descendants spread them still further.\n\nThe geneticists stress that migrations aren’t the only way languages transmit, and that their work provides a hypothesis for others to test. “This is a very good case for the solution to the Indo-European problem,” says Iosif Lazaridis, a Harvard population geneticist who co-led the studies. “But we can’t prove these people spoke Anatolian language because they’re not buried with tablets saying I’m an Anatolian speaker.”",

          "title": "These Gaza scientists are keeping research alive amid war, destruction and uncertainty",
          "authors": "Michele Catanzaro",
          "abstract": "The 42-day ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, which took effect on 19 January, provides a vital opportunity to begin to address the devastation from the 15-month war, scientists there have told Nature. The ceasefire might yet prove temporary, and whether or not it holds, the long-term future for the territory and its citizens remains highly uncertain.\n\nWhile daily bombing is suspended, international organizations can complete a detailed assessment of Gaza’s water, food, health and infrastructure needs, the researchers say.\n\n“There’s a need to document what has been happening here in Gaza and to publish [the results] with other researchers worldwide,” says neuroscientist Khamis Elessi, head of the Evidence-Based Medicine Unit at the Islamic University of Gaza, who now spends most of his time treating injured people at the Ahli Arab hospital.\n\nThis knowledge is needed to guide those undertaking recovery and rebuilding in Gaza, during the ceasefire and when the war is over. “Research is critical [at this stage]” adds Samer Abuzerr, who studies water-borne diseases at the University College of Science and Technology in Gaza.\n\nElessi and Abuzerr are among more than ten scientists who spoke to Nature for this article. These scholars managed to continue their research, and some even published their results, despite facing homelessness, recurrent displacement and a dearth of food and basic necessities.\n\nLeft: Neuroscientist Khamis Elessi receives an award (left) in 2022 from Liz Grant, director of the Global Health Academy at the University of Edinburgh, UK.

Credit: Khamis Elessi\n\n“The Palestinian academic community’s efforts to continue their work under such difficult circumstances are a testament to their unwavering commitment to education and knowledge,” says Aya ElMashharawi, an online-learning researcher at the University College of Applied Sciences in Gaza.\n\nOn 7 October 2023, some 1,200 people were killed when Hamas attacked Israel. Some 47,500 people have been killed as a result of Israel’s retaliation. These figures are according to data reported to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nResearchers and specialists in humanitarian assistance estimate that 90% of Gaza’s 2.2-million population is homeless. Systems ensuring food, supplies, water, sanitation, education, health care, energy and the broader economy have been destroyed or are critically endangered, requiring rebuilding.\n\nAnother urgent need, the researchers say, is removal of debris from bomb damage. According to a preliminary assessment by the UN Environment Programme published in June, for every square metre of the Gaza Strip, there is an estimated 100 kilogrammes of debris, such as concrete, iron and steel, as well as residue from exploded and unexploded bombs, asbestos and human remains.\n\n“More than 97% of Gaza’s water comes from a groundwater aquifer,” says Ahmed Hilles, head of the National Institute for Environment and Development in Gaza. “The porosity [of the aquifer’s layers] is very high, so the potential of [groundwater] contamination is also very high,” he adds.\n\nUniversities, too, will need to be rebuilt. Fifteen of Gaza’s 21 universities, university-colleges and community colleges have been either severely damaged or destroyed, according to September data from the UN science and cultural agency UNESCO.\n\nIn a written response sent to Nature, an Israel Defense Forces representative explained that, as part of its efforts to dismantle Hamas’s military capabilities, “there has been an operational need, among other things, to strike or raid buildings” where Hamas “placed some of its terror infrastructure”. The representative added: “Hamas systematically uses public buildings that are supposed to be used for civilian purposes only, including educational institutions and universities.”\n\nSewage in the streets\n\nEven before the war, just 10% of Gazans had access to safe water. That is now 4%. Thirty per cent have access to a sewage network, compared with 70% pre-war, according to a November report of Gaza's reconstruction needs1 authored by Hilles who also lectured at Al-Azhar University in Gaza. “There is sewage water collected in the streets. Repairing the sewage system is urgent, so people will not get water-borne diseases,” Elessi adds.\n\nAround half of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are not functioning, and the rest are only partially operational, according to the World Health Organization. Gazans are experiencing high rates of diarrhoea, respiratory infections, skin rash, scabies and viral hepatitis, according to a study co-authored by Abuzerr, published last November2.\n\n“We have 350,000 patients with chronic diseases who have not been followed for the last 16 months. We have 11,000 cancer patients,” says Elessi. “They are all in pain and deteriorating because there is no therapy nor referral abroad. These patients should be dealt with urgently.”\n\n‘Expedite reconstruction’\n\nElMashharawi studied the impact of displacement on almost 200 staff members at her university. “Establishing temporary shelters and expediting the reconstruction of houses is a top priority,” she says.\n\nAya ElMashharawi: ‘I remain committed to my academic journey.’Credit: Aya ElMashharawi- UCAS\n\n“Four floors above us were bombed, killing 30 people,” says ElMashharawi, who is now in the Nuseirat refugee camp. “It was an incredibly terrifying experience that I can’t even describe, but by the grace of God, we survived,” she recalls.",

          "title": "Microbes in space: how bacteria could help sustain long-distance space travel",
          "authors": "Amber Dance",
          "abstract": "The microorganisms lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 25 July 2019, headed for the International Space Station, some 400 kilometres above. Their mission: to boldly mine basalt, in low Earth orbit, where no living organisms had mined before.\n\nFive days after take off, astronaut Luca Parmitano unpacked microbe-laden cartridges and installed them in an incubator. The bacteria were given liquid growth media plus Icelandic basalt, from which, Earth-based experimenters hoped, they would extract valuable rare-earth elements1.\n\nWhen Parmitano, a European Space Agency astronaut based in Houston, Texas, thinks about microbes, he mainly worries about how they might harm him, and how to prevent them from contaminating lifeless environments such as the Moon. But as space agencies look beyond the space station’s low Earth orbit, scientists say that microbes are poised to take on new and beneficial roles, including mining useful elements, making foodstuffs and medicines, and creating the building blocks for habitats.\n\nMicrobial miners take on rare-earth metals\n\n“Microorganisms can do a lot of different tasks for us,” says space microbiologist Rosa Santomartino, co-director of the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh and co-organizer of the study that sent the microbes up in 2019. “Particularly, microorganisms are going to be important in the long-term and long-distance space experiments,” she adds.\n\nThat’s because the farther spacefarers travel, the harder and more expensive it will become to ship all the supplies that they’ll need. The International Space Station will close down in 2030, but the space station Lunar Gateway, which will orbit the Moon, will open in 2028 or so; Mars, and perhaps asteroids, are also on the horizon. Planners are therefore looking for ways to make what they need from what’s already available at their destination, and to recycle waste.\n\nMicrobes, which have evolved on Earth to perform all manner of chemical transformations, could be big assets in such work. But much is still unknown about how microbes will react to conditions in space, and even basic experiments can be tough to carry out.\n\n“We just have so much to do to understand what microbes are going to do up there, what they’re not going to do up there, and how can we make them do what we want them to do?” says Cheryl Nickerson, a microbiologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.\n\nMultifunctional microbes\n\nResearchers predict myriad mission tasks for space-bound microbes, including producing breathable oxygen, purifying water for drinking and supplying nutrients to crop plants. At NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, synthetic biologist Lynn Rothschild works with the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. A hardy microbe capable of forming long-lasting spores, B. subtilis has already proved it can survive the extremes of space travel. Rothschild hopes to engineer it to remediate toxic compounds called perchlorates that are naturally present in Martian water sources and to produce medicines.\n\nAstronauts might require any number of medications during a Mars mission, which could take nearly three years including 18 months in transit and time on the planet’s surface working and waiting for the planets to align for the return journey. Drugs that would counter damage to their bones from solar radiation, for instance, could come in handy. “You can’t take an entire pharmacy,” Rothschild says. “And even if you could, they go bad.” She and others hope to engineer bacteria to produce any medicines needed, to order and en route.\n\nSpirulina cyanobacteria have been engineered to produce painkillers.Credit: Sinclair Stammers/Science Photo Library\n\nWhile Rothschild predicts a library of dried-up B. subtilis spores, ready to re-animate and pump out medication, scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, are considering another group of microbes, called cyanobacteria. These organisms are photosynthetic, so they would use sunlight and the carbon dioxide already present in the Martian atmosphere. As a bonus, photosynthesis produces something else astronauts will need — oxygen.\n\nBerkeley bioengineer Adam Arkin and his colleagues have engineered the cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis, commonly known as spirulina, to synthesize the painkiller paracetamol (acetaminophen)2. It takes just two added genes, one from a bacterium and one from a mushroom, to get spirulina to convert the amino acid tyrosine into the drug. Arkin speculates that if they could get the microbes to make enough of it, astronauts could skip chemical purification and ingest the microbes directly — in a smoothie, he suggests — to quell a headache. But, he admits, there’s one significant gastronomic hurdle: “You’d be eating a lot of spirulina. And I promise you, nobody wants to eat a lot of spirulina. It tastes like armpits.”\n\nLunar cement\n\nMicrobes can also produce building materials, and even habitats. For housing, Rothschild is pursuing fungi, or what her team calls myco-architecture3. Fungi could transform feedstocks, such as wood chips or perhaps some sort of nutritious hydrogel, into long strands called hyphae. Such a material would have many advantages, including blocking radiation and sound and being relatively fire resistant. Rothschild says it even looks ‘cosy’, like chipboard — more home-like than, say, steel walls. She and her colleagues imagine sending up inflatable habitat moulds that are pre-seeded with fungi and their food; just add water and oxygen, and the fungi should do the rest.\n\nAt the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, mechanical engineer Aloke Kumar is thinking about a more conventional building material: bricks. Regolith, the loose rock and dust that tops the bedrock of Mars and the Moon, is more sand than clay — no clay at all on the Moon — so it needs help to stick together. Kumar proposes the assistance of Sporosarcina pasteurii. Found in sewage and soils, S. pasteurii convert soil urea into carbonate ions. Engineers on Earth have used the organism to remediate soils, and to produce limestone for biocement by combining the carbonate with calcium ions.\n\nToward sustainable space exploration: a roadmap for harnessing the power of microorganisms\n\nKumar’s team tried mixing the microbes and a calcium salt with simulated versions of lunar or Martian regolith4, which are available from government space agencies and commercial suppliers. After five days, the microbes had made bricks, although not particularly good ones. “I could crush these bricks with my own hands,” says Kumar.\n\nPerhaps, he mused, a natural additive would help. The team landed on guar gum, a binding and thickening agent used in applications such as textiles and cosmetics. Adding 1% guar gum resulted in tougher ‘space bricks’ as the team calls them; Kumar thinks that it makes the sandy regolith more habitable for the microbes, and that they probably eat it.\n\nBeyond structural applications, Santomartino and her colleagues hope to mine regolith, too. Microbes are already used on Earth to leach metals such as copper and gold from ore, and researchers are assessing their potential to collect the rare-earth metals that are essential for modern technologies such as mobile phones and wind turbines. A key question in their 2019 International Space Station experiment, known as BioRock, was whether microgravity would influence the ability of the soil microbe Sphingomonas desiccabilis to leach rare-earth elements and vanadium out of the rock. They compared the low-gravity space station cultures to controls on Earth. Parmitano also used centrifuges to simulate Earth gravity and Mars gravity, which is about three-eighths that of Earth.\n\nOver three weeks in culture, the microbes extracted small amounts of rare-earth elements from the rock — enough to prove the principle. But to the researchers’ surprise, gravity was largely irrelevant to S. desiccabilis1. They’d anticipated that in microgravity, there would be less mixing of the microbes with their media, leaving the bacteria undernourished, but the microbes’ needs seem to have been met. However, the researchers caution that they used just five millilitres of culture; the situation might be different if the experiment were scaled up.\n\nMicrobes could even produce the raw materials for making tools. Benjamin Lehner, director of the Dutch Marine Energy Centre in the Hague, the Netherlands, used microbes to extract iron from simulated regolith during his doctoral studies at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. His workhorse was Shewanella oneidensis, a soil- and deep-sea-dwelling microbe with no need for oxygen and a natural ability to reduce metal ions to create pure metal. Once the microbes processed the iron in the regolith, Lehner collected the metal using magnets. He then fed it into a 3D printer to produce cylinders, which were four times stronger than versions made without microbial help5, he says — probably because the microbe-mined material contained higher amounts of iron and lower levels of silicon.\n\nA lot to learn\n\nArkin and other astro-microbial engineers propose linking bioreactors to create ‘closed loop’ systems, in which the waste of one bioreactor feeds into the next, to grow food, produce breathable air and perform other tasks in an all-in-one solution.\n\nBut first, scientists have a lot to learn about microbial growth and activity beyond Earth. Although the International Space Station is slated to be de-commissioned, commercial companies such as Voyager Space, Airbus and Axiom Space will offer opportunities in low Earth orbit, the satellite-filled region about 160–1,600 kilometres above Earth’s surface. Even that close to home, researchers face many challenges. “Doing microbiology in space is 100% nothing like what you’ve done in your lab,” says Nickerson. “It’s not even close.”\n\nThe main challenge in low Earth orbit is the lack of gravity, so researchers typically pair their space experiments with Earth-based controls. Microgravity can affect microbes in unexpected ways. For example, in Nickerson’s early experiments, Salmonella typhimurium that had been to the space station made mice sicker than did cultures that stayed on Earth6. Microbes probably don’t sense the lack of gravity itself, Nickerson says, but they do experience less mixing in the liquid media. Nickerson has found that the fluid force surrounding space-faring microbes seems to mimic conditions inside animal intestines, in which Salmonella species would naturally activate their infectious abilities.\n\nBricks produced using mycelium, garden waste and wood chips as a part of a myco-architecture project.Credit: NASA\n\nThe launch itself is also a huge stressor, notes Nicol Caplin, a deep-space exploration scientist at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. She recommends shipping cultures desiccated and in stasis so that they won’t react to the launch; alternatively, scientists can use centrifuges or vibration plates to mimic the launch effects on terrestrial controls.",

          "authors": "Gretchen T. Goldman",
          "abstract": "When asked in 1787 whether the fledgling United States would be a monarchy or a republic, founding father Benjamin Franklin replied, “a republic, if you can keep it”. Today, the republic is composed of US federal agencies filled with scientists tasked with advancing the nation’s health, safety, security and competitiveness — through forecasting storms, preventing the spread of food-borne illnesses and making roads safer.\n\nUntil last month, when Donald Trump became US president, I was one of those scientists. I know what it means to take the oath of federal service and to take pride in being a public servant. And I know that there are several steps that the scientific community — both inside and outside the US government — should be prepared to take in the light of the second Trump presidency.\n\nTrump will weaken climate action — the rest of the US must not follow suit\n\nI’ve spent much of my career tracking the use and misuse of science in policy decisions. In 2021, I was called up to the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, and in 2023, I became the climate-change research and technology director at the US Department of Transportation. The passing of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (2021), the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) and the CHIPS and Science Act (2022) represented an opportunity for the nation to meet its greatest challenges, from clean energy to industrial innovation and artificial intelligence. I wanted to be a part of it.\n\nI wasn’t alone. Hundreds of technical specialists also said yes to government work, driving our nation’s responses to climate change, societal inequities and more. In the past few years, the United States has made remarkable progress, investing billions of dollars in projects across all the states.\n\nNow, the Trump administration has moved to undo that progress. Week-one executive orders have led to the furlough and firing of government staff who work in environmental justice and equity. Many people in these jobs will watch their hard-won work get dismantled before their eyes. An unlucky few will be tasked with dismantling it themselves. Others might choose to leave federal service.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nBut despair is not an option. It is important to remember that notable gains have been made in federal scientific-integrity protections in the past two decades. And, as recent years attest, many researchers are willing and able to engage in policy conversations through advocacy, public commentary and demonstrations (A. D. Ross et al. Sci. Commun. 40, 228–245; 2018).\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists and others have developed policies to strengthen scientific integrity, which have since been implemented by federal agencies and Congress. More than 20 agencies have executed or bolstered their scientific-integrity policies and hired specialists, covering hundreds of thousands of people across the federal workforce.\n\nAs a result, federal scientists now have more rights and protection from political interference than ever. For example, many can speak to the media about their science without approval from their supervisors, and can publicly note a differing scientific opinion for their work. Procedures for adjudicating allegations are being implemented.\n\nThese protections provide a solid foundation for the defence of science. Combined with a more scientific-integrity-savvy workforce, these put federal scientists on higher ground than was the case under earlier administrations.",

          "title": "NASA’s ‘most prolific planet hunter so far’ — the story of the Kepler Space Telescope",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Tasker",
          "abstract": "Hidden in the Heavens: How the Kepler Mission’s Quest for New Planets Changed How We View Our Own Jason Steffen Princeton Univ. Press (2024)\n\nIn the mid-1980s, NASA engineer William Borucki faced a panel of in-house specialists. They told him to either justify an idea that many were calling crazy, or quit. His concept was for a space telescope dedicated to detecting extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, which orbit stars other than the Sun. It was an audacious idea, a decade before any such planets had been found.\n\nBorucki had been developing the concept since the 1970s and was under pressure to stop wasting NASA resources. Yet he managed to convince the panel to let him carry on, and even persuaded several members to join him. Still, it would take until 2001 for the mission to be signed off, and another eight years before Borucki’s crazy idea sat on the launchpad.\n\nWhy did Earth’s first radio message to alien civilizations leave out half of humanity?\n\nThat spacecraft, the Kepler Space Telescope, remains humanity’s most prolific planet hunter so far, having spied thousands of distant planets and many more candidate ones. In Hidden in the Heavens, astrophysicist Jason Steffen — who joined the mission a year before it launched in 2009 — relates the story of Kepler and its surprising discoveries.\n\nKepler detected planets by identifying the dimming of light from a star as a planet moved across its face. Doing this is extremely hard — Steffen compares the process to looking down at Las Vegas from space and searching for a fly buzzing around a street light. The Kepler team had to prove that the telescope’s instruments were up to the task this before the project was given the green light. So deputy principal investigator David Koch designed a simple but clever experiment to do so.\n\nKoch punched holes in a sheet of metal and illuminated it from behind to make an artificial field of stars. Wire was stretched across the holes, and an electric current was passed through it. The current warmed the wire, causing it to expand a little — just enough to simulate an Earth-sized planet crossing a distant star similar to the Sun. This test proved that, technically at least, the concept could work.\n\nOn the hunt\n\nNext, real target stars had to be selected. In practice, more than one light dip would need to be detected to prove that a planet was orbiting the star and to measure the period. To find a planet on an orbit similar to our own, Kepler would have to monitor the star for several years to confirm that the dips repeated.\n\nScaled up, that meant that Kepler needed to watch one patch of sky, which ideally contained as many stars as possible. That raised engineering problems — it needed to distinguish light from individual stars in a dense crowd, avoid bright stars that would saturate the detectors and handle limitations to the bandwidth needed to send the data back to Earth. The final choice was a region with plenty of stars for Kepler to explore, but not so many that the telescope would be overwhelmed.\n\nNASA engineer William Borucki drove development of the Kepler Space Telescope.Credit: Paul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle via AP/Alamy\n\nOnce Kepler’s hunt began, decisions also needed to be made around how the science team worked together. And Steffen describes how practices held over from the lengthy developmental phases — such as being overly protective about who had access to data — led to uneven workloads. Some members “were swamped and just trying to keep their heads above water“; others “felt stuck twiddling [their] thumbs with nothing to do”. Steffen sought a solution, which in the end was simply ensuring that the whole scientific team could access the regular teleconferences. “‘The participating scientists went rogue’ and changed everything,” Steffen recalls a colleague joking.\n\nDespite stringent planning, however, nothing involving space ever goes smoothly. And the team faced yet more decisions. One question was whether to sharpen the telescope’s focus after the first images seemed slightly blurry. It was designed to be adjusted, but moving any of the parts came with a risk. If the team did nothing, Kepler would still detect relatively large planets but would miss the smallest ones. If the scientists went ahead with adjusting it, results might improve — or there could be irreparable damage, and the entire mission could be jeopardized.\n\nWhether to intervene with a spacecraft far from Earth is a dilemma faced by most mission leaders. For example, in April 2023 the radar antenna on board the Juice mission, led by the European Space Agency, failed to fully deploy after a pin jammed. Mission control delivered a mechanical shock that helped the antenna to unfold. In January 2024, researchers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and NASA made a different decision for the XRISM X-ray telescope, when a protective aperture door failed to open. The telescope is otherwise performing well, so the team has decided not to attempt to free the door for the moment.\n\nIt all came down to a simple question, Steffen recalls: “Do we risk it all for that twenty percent?” In the case of Kepler, the team did. The mirror was moved by a mere 40 micrometres and the images sharpened.",

          "abstract": "Everyone has their favourite example of a trick that reliably gets a certain job done, even if they don’t really understand why. Back in the day, it might have been slapping the top of your television set when the picture went fuzzy. Today, it might be turning your computer off and on again.\n\nQuantum mechanics — the most successful and important theory in modern physics — is like that. It works wonderfully, explaining things from lasers and chemistry to the Higgs boson and the stability of matter. But physicists don’t know why. Or at least, if some of us think we know why, most others don’t agree.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nThe singular feature of quantum theory is that the way we describe physical systems is distinct from what we see when we observe them. The textbook rules of quantum mechanics therefore need to invoke special processes to describe ‘measurement’ or ‘observation’, unlike every previous framework for physics. As a field, physics does not have any consensus on why that is the case, or what it even means.\n\nThe first hints of quantum behaviour in nature came in works by physicists Max Planck in 1900 and Albert Einstein in 1905. They showed that certain properties of light could best be explained by imagining that it came in discrete, particle-like chunks, rather than as the smooth waves that classical electromagnetism depicts. But their ideas fell short of describing a complete theory. It was the German physicist Werner Heisenberg who, in 1925, first put forward a comprehensive version of quantum mechanics. Later that year, Max Born and Pascual Jordan followed up on that with Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger soon produced an independent formulation of the theory1.\n\nSo it is fair to celebrate 2025 as the true centenary of quantum theory. Although such a commemoration can rightly point to a wide variety of breathtaking experimental successes, it must leave room to acknowledge the foundational questions that remain unanswered. Quantum mechanics is a beautiful castle, and it would be nice to be reassured that it is not built on sand.\n\nBreak from the past\n\nEver since Isaac Newton formulated classical mechanics in the seventeenth century, theories of physics have followed a definite pattern. You have a system under consideration: perhaps a planet orbiting a star, or an electric field or a box of gas. At any one moment in time, the system is described by its ‘state’, which includes both the system’s current configuration and its rate of change; for a featureless single particle, this amounts to its position and velocity (or, equivalently, momentum). Then, you have equations of motion, which tell us how the system will evolve, given its present state. This basic recipe worked for everything from Newtonian gravity right up to Einstein’s theories of relativity, which, like quantum theory, are a product of the early twentieth century. But with the advent of quantum mechanics, the recipe suddenly failed.\n\nThe failure of the classical paradigm can be traced to a single, provocative concept: measurement. The importance of the idea and practice of measurement has been acknowledged by working scientists as long as there have been working scientists. But in pre-quantum theories, the basic concept was taken for granted. Whatever physically real quantities a theory postulated were assumed to have some specific values in any particular situation. If you wanted to, you could go and measure them. If you were a sloppy experimentalist, you might have significant measurement errors, or disturb the system while measuring it, but these weren’t ineluctable features of physics itself. By trying harder, you could measure things as delicately and precisely as you wished, at least as far as the laws of physics were concerned.\n\nLaser experiments have probed the reality of quantum entanglement, a concept alien to intuitive conceptions of how physics should work.Credit: Pascal Goetgheluck/SPL\n\nQuantum mechanics tells a very different story. Whereas in classical physics, a particle such as an electron has a real, objective position and momentum at any given moment, in quantum mechanics, those quantities don’t, in general, ‘exist’ in any objective way before that measurement. Position and momentum are things that can be observed, but they are not pre-existing facts. That is quite a distinction. The most vivid implication of this situation is Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, introduced in 1927, which says that there is no state an electron can be in for which we can perfectly predict both its position and its momentum ahead of time2.\n\nInstead, quantum theory describes the state of a system in terms of a wavefunction, a concept introduced3 by Schrödinger in 1926, together with his eponymous equation that describes how the system changes over time. For our single electron, the wavefunction is a number assigned to every position we might observe the electron to be in — a wave, in other words, that might be mostly localized near an atomic nucleus or spread widely throughout space.\n\nWhere things get tricky is in the relationship between the wavefunction and observable quantities, such as position and momentum, that we might want to measure. The answer was suggested4 by Born soon after Schrödinger’s original paper. According to Born’s interpretation, we can never precisely predict the outcome of a quantum measurement. Instead, we can determine the probability of getting any particular outcome for an electron’s position, say, by calculating the square of the wavefunction at that position. This recipe completely overturned the ideal of a deterministic, clockwork universe that had held sway since Newton’s time.\n\nIn retrospect, it is impressive how quickly some physicists were able to accept this shift. Some, not all. Luminaries such as Einstein and Schrödinger were unsatisfied with the new quantum consensus. It’s not that they didn’t understand it, but that they thought the new rules must be stepping stones to an even more comprehensive theory.\n\nThe appearance of indeterminism is often depicted as their major objection to quantum theory — “God doesn’t play dice with the Universe”, in Einstein’s memorable phrase. But the real worries ran deeper. Einstein in particular cared about locality, the idea that the world consists of things existing at specific locations in space-time, interacting directly with nearby things. He was also concerned about realism, the idea that the concepts in physics map onto truly existing features of the world, rather than being mere calculational conveniences.\n\n‘Shut up and calculate’: how Einstein lost the battle to explain quantum reality\n\nEinstein’s sharpest critique appeared in the famous EPR paper5 of 1935 — named after him and his co-authors Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen — with the title ‘can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?’. The authors answered this question in the negative, on the basis of a crucial quantum phenomenon they highlighted that became known as entanglement.\n\nIf we have a single particle, the wavefunction assigns a number to every possible position it might have. According to Born’s rule, the probability of observing that position is the square of the number. But if we have two particles, we don’t have two wavefunctions; quantum mechanics gives a single number to every possible simultaneous configuration of the two-particle system. As we consider larger and larger systems, they continue to be described by a single wavefunction, all the way up to the wavefunction of the entire Universe.\n\nAs a result, the probability of observing one particle to be somewhere can depend on where we observe another particle to be, and this remains true no matter how far apart they are. The EPR analysis shows that we could have one particle here on Earth and another on a planet light years away, and our prediction for what we would measure about the faraway particle could be ‘immediately’ affected by what we measure about the nearby particle.\n\nThe scare quotes serve to remind us that, according to the special theory of relativity, even the concept of ‘at the same time’ isn’t well defined for points far apart in space, as Einstein knew better than anyone. Entanglement seems to go against the precepts of special relativity by implying that information travels faster than light — how else can the distant particle ‘know’ that we have just performed a measurement?\n\nWe can’t actually use entanglement to communicate across great distances. Measuring our quantum particle here, we now know something about what will be observed far away, but anyone who is actually far away doesn’t have access to the knowledge we have, so no communication has occurred. But there is at least a certain tension between how quantum theory describes the world and how we think space-time works in Einsteinian relativity.\n\nReclaiming reality\n\nAttempts to resolve this tension have proliferated, with no clear consensus in sight. Indeed, significant disagreement lingers around the most central question we can think of: is the quantum wavefunction supposed to represent reality, or is it just a tool we use to calculate the probability of experimental outcomes? This issue fundamentally divided Einstein and the Danish physicist Niels Bohr in famous debates they had over decades about the meaning of quantum mechanics. Einstein, like Schrödinger, was a thoroughgoing realist: he wanted his theories to describe something we might recognize as physical reality. Bohr, along with Heisenberg, was willing to forgo any talk about what was ‘really happening’, focusing instead on making predictions for what will happen when something is measured.\n\nThe bizarre logic of the many-worlds theory\n\nThe latter perspective gave rise to ‘epistemic’ interpretations of quantum theory. The views of Bohr and Heisenberg came to be known as the Copenhagen interpretation, which is very close to what physicists teach in textbooks today. Modern versions include QBism6, short for ‘quantum Bayesianism’, and relational quantum mechanics7. Both of these interpretations emphasize how quantum states shouldn’t be considered in their own right, but only relative to an observer, the process of measuring and the changing states of knowledge during that process.",

          "abstract": "OpenAI’s chief executive Sam Altman announced the release of its ‘deep research’ tool.Credit: Franck Robichon/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nTech giant OpenAI has unveiled a pay-for-access tool called ‘deep research’, which synthesizes information from dozens or hundreds of websites into a cited report several pages long. The tool follows a similar one from Google released in December and acts as a personal assistant, doing the equivalent of hours of work in tens of minutes.\n\nMany scientists who have tried it are impressed with its ability to write literature reviews or full review papers and even identify gaps in knowledge. Others are less enthusiastic. “If a human did this I would be like: this needs a lot of work,” says Kyle Kabasares, a data scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute in Moffett Field, California, in an online video review.\n\nScientists flock to DeepSeek: how they’re using the blockbuster AI model\n\nThe firms are presenting the tools as a step towards AI ‘agents’ that can handle complex tasks. Observers say that OpenAI’s deep research tool, released on 2 February, is notable because it combines the improved reasoning skills of the o3 large language model (LLM) with the ability to search the Internet. Google says its Deep Research tool is, for now, based on Gemini 1.5 Pro, rather than on its leading reasoning model 2.0 Flash Thinking.\n\nReview writing\n\nMany users are impressed with both tools. Andrew White, a chemist and AI expert FutureHouse, a start-up in the San Francisco, California, says that Google’s product is “really leveraging Google’s advantages in search and compute” to get users up to speed on a topic quickly, while o3’s reasoning skills add sophistication to OpenAI’s reports.\n\nDerya Unutmaz, an immunologist at the Jackson Laboratory in Farmington, Connecticut, who has free access to ChatGPT Pro granted by OpenAI for medical research, says the OpenAI deep research reports are “extremely impressive”, “trustworthy” and as good or better than published review papers. “I think writing reviews is becoming obsolete.”\n\nWhite anticipates that AI systems like these could be used to update human-authored reviews. “Authoritative reviews cannot feasibly be updated [by humans] every 6 months.”.\n\nBut many caution that all LLM-based tools are sometimes inaccurate or misleading. OpenAI’s website admits that its tool “is still early and has limitations”: it can get citations wrong, hallucinate facts, fail to distinguish authoritative information from rumors and fail to convey its uncertainty accurately. The company expects the issues to improve with more usage and time. Google’s Deep Research has a disclaimer that simply reads “Gemini can make mistakes, so double-check it”.\n\nHow China created AI model DeepSeek and shocked the world",

          "abstract": "An ongoing trial of Zepbound (tirzepatide) is testing effects on heart disease in people with obesity and diabetes.Credit: Shelby Knowles/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nAs appetite for blockbuster weight-loss drugs grows worldwide, scientists are developing the next crop of medications that, they hope, will improve the performance of these drugs and offer benefits beyond weight loss.\n\n“It’s going to be another year where, every week, there’s going to be something really cool,” says Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nNew obesity definition sidelines BMI to focus on health\n\nDrug makers are building on the success of medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which contain the active ingredient semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. These drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1, helping to regulate blood-sugar levels and appetite.\n\nBut most of these medications are costly, require weekly injections and need to be taken long-term to prevent weight regain. These are some of the issues that companies hope alternative drugs will address.\n\nNature looks at the weight-loss medicines being tested in 2025 and what they have to offer.\n\nTirzepatide: cuts heart weight and surrounding fat\n\nTirzepatide — sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound and given by injection — mimics GLP-1 and another hormone called gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which is involved in fat metabolism. In trial results published in November, it helped participants to lose up to 20% of their body weight over 72 weeks and reduced the risk of diabetes, compared with a placebo. People taking semaglutide for 68 weeks lose up to 15% of their body weight. Participants who took tirzepatide also had a beneficial reduction in heart weight and in fat surrounding the heart, improved mobility and lower blood pressure and inflammation compared with people on a placebo.\n\nOne trial expected to conclude in 2025 is examining tirzepatide’s effects on heart disease in people with obesity and diabetes.\n\nRetatrutide: trial participants report major weight loss\n\nRetatrutide, which has not yet received regulatory approval for weight loss, activates receptors for GLP-1, GIP and glucagon, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Developed by Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, it has shown even more promising results than tirzepatide and semaglutide, with trial participants losing an average of 24% of their body weight over 11 months. The drug also helped to reduce blood-sugar levels in people with diabetes, and it’s now being tested in phase III trials that are expected to conclude by 2026.\n\nAnti-obesity drug has life-changing benefits for arthritis\n\nResearchers are excited about combination therapies such as retatrutide, says Beverly Tchang, an endocrinologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, who notes that obesity’s complexity makes targeting multiple pathways the most promising approach.\n\nOrforglipron: oral drug shows promise\n\nOrforglipron, an oral small-molecule drug candidate also developed by Eli Lilly, showed similar results to GLP-1 injections in rodents, and led to a weight loss of about 10% over 26 weeks in people with obesity, improving blood pressure and levels of circulating fatty molecules. Like Ozempic, orforglipron is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, but whereas Ozempic requires injection, orforglipron comes as a daily pill.\n\nLilly expects to complete phase III trials in 2025, and orforglipron could receive US regulatory approval in 2026, according to Lilly’s chief executive Dave Ricks.\n\n“The wild card is the oral small molecules,” says Randy Seeley, an obesity specialist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. Many companies are working on this approach, because pills might be more appealing and cost-effective than injections, but progress has been slower than expected owing to dosing challenges, he says. “If one of them finally breaks through, it has the ability to alter the landscape pretty considerably.”\n\nMariTide: weight-loss maintenance\n\nBiopharmaceutical company Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California, is planning a phase III trial of its drug candidate MariTide, which activates GLP-1 receptors while reducing GIP’s activity. The medication can be taken monthly by injection and resulted in an average weight loss of up to 20% over 52 weeks, according to data released by the company.\n\nUnlike other treatments, MariTide has shown the ability to maintain weight loss for several months after the last dose. When people stop taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, they tend to regain weight quickly, but that doesn’t seem to happen with MariTide, which might encourage more people to have the treatment, says Seeley, who consults for and receives funding from Amgen and other companies developing obesity drugs.\n\nCagriSema: combination drug outperforms semaglutide",

          "authors": "Jo Waters",
          "abstract": "Many universities once admitted only male students — and traditions and values from that era still prevail, says Nicole Bedera.Credit: Bettmann/Getty\n\nNicole Bedera spent the 2018–19 academic year investigating how a US university handled allegations of sexual harassment and violence. Her resulting book, On the Wrong Side: How Universities Protect Perpetrators and Betray Survivors of Sexual Violence, was published last year.\n\nBedera’s investigation was based on interviews with 24 administrators and 45 perpetrators and survivors at the university, which she does not name. She also reviewed more than 700 documents, including media reports and Instagram posts.\n\nFreedom and safety in science\n\nHer research painted a picture of an institution that felt threatened by complaints about gender-based violence, says Bedera. Male perpetrators’ education was routinely prioritized over that of female victims, leaving the impression that sexual-violence complaints were not taken seriously, she adds.\n\nMany higher-education institutions in the United States continue to rely on traditions and values that pre-date the admission of female students. Women continue to feel excluded.\n\nA sociologist and sexual-violence researcher based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bedera co-founded Beyond Compliance Consulting in 2023. The company’s work includes helping organizations to develop anti-violence strategic plans.\n\nNicole Bedera is a sociologist who studies sexual violence and responses to it.\nHow did you become interested in researching sexual violence on campus?\n\nIt dates back to 2010, when I started my bachelor’s degree in sociology at a US liberal-arts college. I thought feminism had been won. That was what I’d been taught growing up in Nevada at the height of the 1990s ‘girl power’ era.\n\nOn our very first day, we were told that there had not been a rape on my campus in ten years.\n\nBut some of my friends were later sexually assaulted, and were left with the impression that their continued presence in campus accommodation would somehow disturb their roommates. I felt that was a horrible message.\n\nI began volunteering for a rape crisis centre, and this led to me working as a victim advocate in hospitals. In that role, I got a lot of questions from survivors that there just weren’t really very clear answers to. One of these was why everything got worse, instead of better, after they reported their assault.\n\nFor example, in the United States, if you’re sexually assaulted, the place where you start the criminal-justice process is a hospital, for an examination. That is the exact opposite of what a sexual-assault survivor would want — being stripped naked and examined from head to toe.\n\nWe had things that we said as advocates, but I wanted to give a scientific answer to their questions.\n\nThe conventional approach and that of a lot of the academic literature at the time was to say that they’d done something risky, that they’d done something wrong, that they’d put themselves in that situation. But that was hard for me to believe, and it wasn’t something I wanted to repeat.\n\nAnd so that’s how I came into my research interest and my PhD at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, which focused on how organizations shape the experience of college sexual assault.\n\nHow did your advocacy experience inform your work as a social scientist?\n\nWhat I learnt as an advocate that was most useful as a scientist was to make space for the full expression of emotion. A lot of the time, whether it’s in the hospitals or in a research interview, victims will act differently than you’ve been taught to expect.\n\nIn the cultural stereotypes, people think interviews will be very sad, and people will cry through all of them. That’s not true. A lot of them are very funny — some people cope through humour. People also cope through anger, as well as sadness.\n\nWhen you make room for that full expression in each interview, you often see all those emotions, and you get a much more nuanced account of what the person has experienced and a more honest story. It means people don’t feel like they have to be ‘the perfect victim’.\n\nHow did you maintain scientific rigour when you were interviewing survivors?\n\nYour role as an advocate is to be there, be compassionate, be empathetic, hear what they’re saying, really listen, but also keep some distance because they might handle things differently than you.\n\nThose skills are really useful when working as a scientist, too. When you are interviewing people, you don’t want to have a big emotional reaction. You don’t want them to know your opinion about what they’ve experienced, or how they decided to handle it. Those things are really not relevant to the research.\n\nWhat struck you most during the research for your book?\n\nVictims of sexual assault shouldn’t be made to feel it’s their fault, and that’s motivated my work.\n\nOne of the most upsetting parts of my research was the way administrators talked about handling sexual-violence complaints. There were a lot of cases of sexual harassment, for instance, where the perpetrator would confess to what they had done. And even in those cases, administrators would say, “We don’t want to have to deal with this, we don’t think it’s that big a deal.”\n\nBedera’s book On the Wrong Side explores responses to complaints of sexual violence at a US university.\n\nOne of them said something that immediately stuck in my head: “I just feel like we are regulating student dating, and we’re not interested in doing that.”\n\nThey were saying they didn’t enjoy making people accountable for violating the university’s own code of conduct, and that as much as they could, they tried to look for loopholes and ways to avoid investigating or making a meaningful sanction.\n\nOne of the consistent themes was that schools prioritized “neutrality”, which meant treating victims and perpetrators exactly the same. For example, the university was sending no-contact directives to perpetrators, but also to the victims, treating them equally, literally as Party 1 and Party 2. Neither were allowed to contact each other or ask others to contact the other person on their behalf. They weren’t permitted to talk about each other to anyone else or share space with each other. But enforcement was fuzzy — for example, they were allowed to take classes together or be in the library at the same time.",

          "title": "Are the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "Adrian Ward had been driving confidently around Austin, Texas, for nine years — until last November, when he started getting lost. Ward’s phone had been acting up, and Apple Maps had stopped working. Suddenly, Ward couldn’t even find his way to the home of a good friend, making him realize how much he’d relied on the technology in the past. “I just instinctively put on the map and do what it says,” he says.\n\nWard’s experience echoes a common complaint: that the Internet is undermining our memory. This fear has shown up in several surveys over the past few years, and even led one software firm to coin the term ‘digital amnesia’ for the experience of forgetting information because you know a digital device has stored it instead. Last year, Oxford University Press announced that its word of the year was ‘brain rot’ — the deterioration of someone’s mental state caused by consuming trivial online content.\n\n“What you’ll see out there is all kinds of dire predictions about digital amnesia, and ‘we’re gonna lose our memory because we don’t use it anymore’,” says Daniel Schacter, who studies memory at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nAI hallucinations can’t be stopped — but these techniques can limit their damage\n\nIn fact, various studies paint a more complicated picture. Some do suggest that the Internet and digital technologies impair or otherwise alter performance on specific learning and memory tasks: people who use GPS devices to navigate seem worse at recalling routes, for instance. Ward, who is a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin, has found that Googling information gives people an inflated sense of their own knowledge1. But there is no convincing evidence that the technology is having a broader detrimental effect on memory, researchers say. Claims, such as ‘Google is making us stupid’, are “overstatements”, says Elizabeth Marsh, a memory researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nThe revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) is raising a host of questions. Large language models (LLMs) that power tools such as ChatGPT are rapidly being incorporated into search engines and other software, which means they are becoming part of everyday experiences for most people. And they could affect learning and memory in more profound ways than conventional Internet searching. “This whole ChatGPT thing is another level of technology that’s really different from just typing into a Google browser, ‘What’s the capital of Madagascar?’” says Marsh.\n\nResearchers have suggested, for example, that chatbots and other AI tools could make people cognitively lazy and even seed their minds with realistic false memories. Already, generative AI is being used to create ‘deadbots’ — digital avatars of dead people, who can say things that the living person never said. “It’s kind of reassembling a past that we never experienced,” says Andrew Hoskins, who studies AI and memory at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nThe Google effect\n\nPeople have been using technology to aid their memories for centuries — from the printing press to photographs and video cameras. But the idea that the Internet is eroding human memory gained ground after a 2011 study2 by psychologist Betsy Sparrow, who was then at Columbia University in New York City, and others. In the first of a series of experiments, they reported that people presented with difficult questions instinctively thought about the Internet and computers, as if they were itching to search for answers.\n\nIn other tests, participants seemed to be worse at remembering trivia statements they’d typed into a computer if they’d been told that the machine would save, rather than erase, their notes. They often remembered the folder they’d saved facts in better than the information itself. The study popularized the idea of a ‘Google effect’ — that people are using the Internet as an external memory bank and therefore weakening their own.\n\nBut some researchers later questioned the reliability of these results. A study3 in 2018 failed to replicate the first experiment in Sparrow’s 2011 study — differences that Sparrow argued could be explained4. Then, a second attempt to replicate the same experiment also failed to mirror the original results5. “‘Google effects’ are plausible and have garnered significant attention,” says Guido Hesselmann, a psychologist at the Berlin Psychological University who did the second replication attempt. But he adds that “a higher standard should be applied when researching these ideas”.\n\nStudies have shown that people remember a route less well after using GPS to navigate it.Credit: Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty\n\nWard was a PhD student with one of Sparrow’s co-authors, Daniel Wegner at Harvard University, and remains convinced by the 2011 study. The results fit with a widely accepted concept6 called transactive memory that Wegner proposed in the 1980s. This says that people lessen the burden of remembering information by sharing it with others — a spouse or colleague, for example.\n\nWhen the other party in the transaction is the Internet, however, we’re potentially relieved of having to know much at all. “Why put it in my head, when I have a smartphone in my pocket and sometimes searching Google is faster than searching your own mind?” Ward says. This is a form of ‘cognitive offloading’, in which people use anything from lists to calendars to phones to lessen the demands on their brains.\n\nSome of the strongest data to support cognitive offloading, says Carey Morewedge, who studies decision-making at Boston University, Massachusetts, are from a 2010 study of GPS navigation7. Participants in a driving simulator travelled a route either with or without the assistance of GPS. Then they were asked to drive the same route from memory. Those who had used GPS were as bad at navigating as people who’d never travelled the route at all.\n\nA later study8 of virtual navigation skills suggested that the spatial memory of people who used GPS extensively deteriorated faster than that of those who used it less. In a similar vein, a few studies have suggested that taking photos can reduce memories of the photographed objects — at least in certain situations.\n\nWhat’s so special about the human brain? A graphical guide\n\nCognitive offloading makes adaptive sense, researchers say, because it frees up limited brain bandwidth to attend to other business. A study by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, demonstrated this effect. They asked students to study a document of words, and then randomly assigned some to save it. Those who saved the first file were better able to memorize words in a second file9.\n\nOther studies support the idea that people rely on the Internet as a surrogate memory — so much so, that they confuse it with their own. In Ward’s study1, he asked people to answer a series of trivia questions using Google or on their own. Those who used Google later rated themselves as having more confidence in their own memory, on average, than those who didn’t use the search engine. Searching for answers, it seemed, didn’t remind them of their ignorance; it made them think that the online knowledge had been theirs all along.\n\n“I think less of our knowledge is internal and more of it is stored externally — and we’re accessing it and feeling like it’s our own,” Ward says.\n\nMarsh says this false confidence inspired by searching “might be one reason that you’re so surprised if you later can’t remember something”. Her experiments10 suggest the phenomenon might stem from search results that are displayed as a list of web links with a snippet of information about the page. Glimpsing these previews and then selecting a page creates a feeling of familiarity with the page’s content — a form of what psychologists call ‘priming’ — even before reading it. This effect might lead people to overestimate their own knowledge. Researchers don’t yet know whether these types of misconception could worsen now that search engines provide AI-generated summaries at the top of search results.\n\nInformation overload\n\nSchacter, who reviewed11 studies on technology use and memory in 2022, says that, taken together, there is convincing research from studies so far that the Internet and technology can affect memory performance for specific tasks, such as remembering a route or a photographed item.",

The discovery, published on 5 February in Nature1, contrasts with previous studies that have found crowds to move in more-chaotic ways.\n\n“I was like, what is this? Why 18 seconds?” says study co-author François Gu, referring to how often the circular motion repeated itself. The finding, which was the outcome of a computer analysis of video footage, was so puzzling that he spent more than a month double-checking the methods, says Gu, a physicist at the École Normale Supérieure in Lyon, France.

But Gu and his collaborators focused instead on the opening of the festival, in which thousands of people gather in the Plaza Consistorial.\n\nGu and his colleagues set up cameras on balconies overlooking the plaza, and used computer models to analyse the videos. To understand the crowd’s behaviour, they modelled it as a dense continuum, akin to a fluid made up of particles (most previous studies have instead modelled crowds as made up of discrete, individual agents). They found that, as the area filled up in the morning, the crowd reached a critical density of around four people per square metre, beyond which it started — initially very slowly and almost imperceptibly — to form rotating vortices that pushed against one another, each involving hundreds of people.\n\nCrowd crush: Could fluid dynamics save lives?",

          "abstract": "The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, is the second-wealthiest medical-research foundation in the world.Credit: imageBROKER/Alamy\n\nThe Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) — one of the world’s largest private funders of basic biomedical research — has abruptly cancelled a US$60-million initiative aimed at boosting diversity in science at universities. It has also scrubbed mention of the programme from its website.\n\n‘Mind-boggling’: US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers\n\nIn doing so, the funder has terminated grants to 104 US universities approximately in the middle of a six-year funding cycle without any explanation. The move has unsettled many scientists, who are reeling after US President Donald Trump issued a stream of orders in the past few weeks targeting “illegal” diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies and funding across the country, saying that they diminish “the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society”. In the wake of these orders, US science agencies have ordered staff members to strip DEI mentions from government websites and are scrutinizing federal research grants that violate the decrees with an eye towards revising or cancelling them.\n\nThat such a massive private funder, which doesn’t receive federal funding, is cutting support at such a sensitive time “is so disappointing”, says Danielle Beckman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Davis. “Now is the time that we need private funders to fill the gap that the new administration has left” by threatening public science funding.\n\nAn HHMI spokesperson confirmed that the institution terminated the initiative, called Inclusive Excellence 3, on 5 February, adding that HHMI “remains committed to supporting outstanding scientists and talented students training to become scientists” through its other programmes. The spokesperson did not respond to Nature’s queries about why IE3 was cancelled, why HHMI deleted all its webpages referencing the programme or about scientists’ distress over the termination.\n\nA ‘safe haven’?\n\nWith a $24 billion endowment, HHMI is the second-wealthiest medical-research foundation in the world. Its prominent Investigators programme offers each of its awardees $11 million over a renewable seven-year term to conduct groundbreaking research.\n\nRNA biologist loses disability case against Howard Hughes Medical Institute\n\nIts IE3 initiative arranged its awardee universities into seven different ‘learning communities’ to encourage collaboration on projects. Each community of about 15 US institutions received nearly $9 million and was tasked with deciding how and where it wished to invest that money. For example, one of these communities was working to build more robust peer-mentoring programmes that would help to boost student outcomes.\n\nAlthough HHMI did not say why it ended IE3, Trump’s 21 January order on DEI might have played a role. In it, he calls for US agencies to encourage the private sector to end “illegal DEI discrimination”. He directed each agency, within four months, to produce a list of up to nine companies, non-profit organizations, “foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more” or other private institutions for possible civil-compliance investigations.\n\nTo understand the importance of IE3, Nature reached out to nine researchers listed as a principal investigator on one of the programme’s grants. Some did not respond, and the others either declined to comment or requested anonymity because they feared drawing attention to their university in the current political climate.\n\nIn the United States, “we know we have a problem retaining STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] students, especially with how COVID interrupted schooling”, and this money helped to bring institutions together to address the problem, says one of the researchers. “All the momentum we had built — gone.”\n\nThe decision has left scientists in a bind, because it appears that federal funding for research related in any way to diversity and inclusion will dry up after Trump’s crackdown. “There were rumours this would happen to federally funded grants, but many people thought that private foundations might be a safe haven from all that,” the same researcher says.\n\nThe fact that HHMI not only ended the programme but also wiped IE3 off its website was particularly disheartening, Beckman says. “It’s like it never existed.” Sometime in the past six months, HHMI also deleted a landing page where it stated its commitment to DEI and posted demographic data about its grantees and staff members.",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto, Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "The National Science Foundation, headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, funds about 25% of basic US academic research.Credit: JHVEPhoto/Alamy\n\nThe US National Science Foundation (NSF), a major funder of basic academic research, announced yesterday that it has reopened a website that distributes money from research grants to scientists. The move comes after a week of confusion and frustration for NSF-funded researchers in which the agency froze their funding — including for postdoctoral fellowships — and said it was reviewing grants worth billions of dollars to comply with President Donald Trump’s directives to terminate funding for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and to scrub all federal resources of these terms.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nAlthough the funds have been unfrozen after a federal judge issued an order blocking the US government from freezing grant money, the NSF has said it will continue its review.\n\nThis whiplash shows that the “United States is not a stable place to be a scientist”, says Julia Barnes, an NSF-funded cultural anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. “Scientists funded by the NSF aren’t paid a lot, but we care a lot about the research we do.”\n\nTo better understand what is happening inside the NSF and what the future might hold, Nature spoke to six NSF staff members, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the press. All expressed strong concerns about recent agency decisions, especially to freeze funds.\n\n“People are trying to understand what’s going on,” says one NSF employee. “The freeze in funding was, and continues to be, completely confusing to everyone.”\n\nAn NSF spokesperson declined to comment about the agency’s actions and instead pointed Nature to information on the NSF website about its implementation of Trump’s executive orders.\n\nA week of whiplash\n\nIn the first hours of his presidency, Trump signed a barrage of executive orders, which are decrees that direct the US government’s actions but that cannot change existing laws. The orders aimed to reshape US policy on climate science, public health, the federal workforce and more. A week later, the Trump administration issued a memorandum freezing all federal grants. That memo, set to take effect on 28 January, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge, and the White House then rescinded it. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on the social-media platform X that Trump’s executive orders on federal funding would “remain in full force”. In response, the NSF froze its funds and cancelled a week’s worth of grant reviews, which are used to determine which projects are funded.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nTo more permanently halt the funding freeze, 22 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government and its agencies. Two federal judges have since temporarily blocked the funding freeze, hinting that it might be an overreach from the governmentthat lacks proper authority.\n\nThere is no clear timeline for how long the judges’ temporary holds will last, but even if they are lifted in an appeal, the NSF could have a hard time legally terminating grants, because their funds are appropriated by the US Congress, meaning they are protected by law, says Deborah Pearlstein, a specialist in law and public policy at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nThere is another area in which the NSF’s actions might butt up against the law. Since 1980, Congress has mandated that the agency should seek to broaden participation of people from under-represented groups, including women, in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. “The orders are illegal,” says an NSF employee. “The statutory framework of NSF is being violated.”\n\nThe NSF spokesperson did not respond to a query about concerns that Trump’s executive orders are at odds with the agency’s responsibilities, as codified in law.\n\nInside grant review\n\nThe NSF has not publicly shared details of how it is continuing to examine research grants and flag those in violation of Trump’s orders, but NSF employees shared documents with Nature clarifying the process.\n\nWhat Trump 2.0 means for science: the likely winners and losers\n\nAround 10,000 research grants have been flagged for review and distributed to various programme directors. Grants in one area of science are being distributed to directors in a separate area of science. For instance, the geosciences division is examining grants from the division of social, behavioural and economic sciences. Each grant is being reviewed independently by two staff members who have been instructed to indicate any potential violations of Trump’s orders. They will submit their reviews in a spreadsheet by 5 p.m. today.\n\nNature has seen the criteria for flagging grants, which call for programme officers to look for “broadening participation” language, foreign assistance, climate science, domestic energy and “discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI”.\n\n“To see ‘women’ and ‘woman’ and ‘people of colour’ showing up on a spreadsheet over and over and over and over — that was a gut punch,” says one NSF employee.",

          "title": "Can this revolutionary plastics-recycling plant help solve the pollution crisis?",
          "authors": "Mark Peplow",
          "abstract": "The world is miserable at recycling plastics. Currently, just 10–15% of the plastic waste we generate annually is recycled — with the rest incinerated, buried in landfill or dumped as litter1,2.\n\nA big part of the problem is that much of the waste is a dirty jumble of different plastics contaminated with food, inks and labels. It’s expensive to clean and sort this mess into streams of single-polymer, uncontaminated plastic — the kind that is generally needed for conventional ‘mechanical’ recycling, in which plastic is shredded, melted and re-formed into pellets, ready for new products.\n\nThat explains the excitement around a chemical plant that will start commercial operations this year in northeast England. In principle, it can take any kind of plastic waste, including mixed plastics deemed ‘unrecyclable’, and break it down into chemicals that are similar to those extracted from crude oil. With further processing, these chemicals can be turned back into fresh plastic. If successful, it could be a powerful example of a circular manufacturing process — in which plastic is used and reprocessed over and over again — potentially curbing the world’s dependence on fossil resources to make virgin plastics.\n\nHow to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work\n\nThe facility, near Redcar, uses a variation on a concept called chemical recycling, which breaks plastics apart into smaller chemical building blocks. Its main rival in this approach is pyrolysis: heating plastics to temperatures above 450 °C in a reactor without oxygen. But pyrolysis is energy-intensive and inefficient, with much of the plastic being turned into useless sooty char.\n\nBy contrast, the new plant uses water at high temperatures and pressures to break down plastic waste more gently and cleanly. Mura Technology, the London-based company behind the facility, says it is the first commercial-scale plant in the world to recycle plastic in this way. There’s a lot riding on its success — if it all works and runs profitably, it could trigger the launch of many more of these plants around the world.\n\nMura has declared the technology to be “revolutionary” because it “has the potential to help eliminate plastic waste, recycling all types of plastic to create a true circular economy”. Mura says that its process has lower carbon dioxide emissions and a higher tolerance for contaminated waste than does pyrolysis. It also emits roughly 80% less CO2 than burning the plastic in an incinerator to generate energy — a common way of dealing with waste.\n\nIf that makes it sound like a panacea for plastics recycling, think again. In practice, as Mura explains, the plant is currently picky about its diet of plastic waste, which must be shredded and sorted in ways similar to those used for mechanical recycling. And because, as with pyrolysis plants, not all of the facility’s products will be reborn as plastic, some critics say that the process shouldn’t count as recycling — an accusation that Mura rejects.\n\nThese practicalities raise questions about the future of plastics pollution and whether chemical recycling can live up to its promised potential. The idea is not a dud — but the real-life complications around the process make it less revolutionary than claimed.\n\nPlastic world\n\nPlastics pollution is a serious and growing problem. Recycling technologies already struggle to cope with today’s waste, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects1 plastic-waste production to balloon to more than one billion tonnes per year by 2060 (see ‘Where plastic waste goes’).\n\nSource: OECD\n\nMechanical recycling is the most common recycling route. Although the process often yields a material that is a little weaker than virgin plastic, it works well enough for pure streams of some plastics, such as the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in drinks bottles.\n\nBut other forms of plastic waste are much more challenging. Take flexible packaging and films, for example, a category that includes detritus such as grocery bags, bubble wrap and snack wrappers. These are typically made from various forms of polyethylene and polypropylene, part of a broad class of polymers called polyolefins, which make up two-thirds of all post-consumer plastic waste (see ‘Types of plastic’).\n\nSource: Plastics Europe\n\nThese materials might be combinations of several plastics — a pain to recycle. It can be extremely difficult to tease apart mixed plastics. If they are recycled, they often result in low-quality materials that might be suitable only for making rubbish bags, offering recyclers little financial incentive to accept such waste streams.\n\nThis is just one reason why about 40% of plastic waste is put in landfill instead, with another 25% incinerated for energy recovery. About 15% is abandoned as litter2.\n\nIt also helps to explain the surging enthusiasm for chemical recycling. Many researchers, companies and policymakers think that this approach could extract more value from tricky plastic waste and thus provide an incentive for recycling3.\n\nThe current most-used chemical recycling methods, according to data from market-intelligence company IDTechEx in Cambridge, UK, involve unpicking a plastic’s polymer chains to recover the constituent chemical building blocks, or monomers. This can be done with solvents or enzymes; IDTechEx terms the general approach ‘depolymerization’. However, these are expensive processes that have been commercialized for only a handful of plastics that have already been separated from other plastic waste.\n\nBy the end of this year, IDTechEx expects depolymerization to be overtaken by pyrolysis, a blunter method. Pyrolysis does not break plastic down into its monomers — instead, it produces a soup of hydrocarbons called pyrolysis oil, similar to crude oil. Some components of this oil then go through more petrochemical processing to generate specific plastic-feedstock chemicals such as ethene and propene, the most common monomers of polyolefins.\n\nThere are roughly 50 pyrolysis plants around the world, most in the European Union and the United States, with a combined processing capacity of about 266,000 tonnes per year, according to IDTechEx. That’s a tiny fraction of the plastic waste generated in these regions. However, many more pyrolysis plants are expected to come online by the end of this year.\n\nA plastics treaty is urgently needed, but getting it right will take time\n\nBut pyrolysis has a number of problems. First, some of the oil it produces is turned into fuel or other chemicals, rather than going to make new plastic, so that portion doesn’t help to reduce the amount of new plastic produced. Critics such as the Brussels-based campaign group Zero Waste Europe (ZWE) say that the approach should therefore be termed ‘chemical recovery’, rather than true chemical recycling of plastic (see go.nature.com/4hjfk7z).\n\nSecond, it’s an inefficient process. Up to 20% of the carbon from the input plastic becomes an unwanted sooty by-product called char, some is lost as CO2, and the pyrolysis oil can contain contaminants that must be removed before further use4.\n\nThird, despite their reputation for being able to feed on many kinds of mixed plastic, in practice, pyrolysis plants take in polyolefin plastic waste — and relatively clean waste at that. The reason is that this kind of waste yields a more commercially saleable pyrolysis oil that is relatively simple to drop into existing petrochemical processes, says James Kennedy, a technology analyst at IDTechEx. Different plastics, such as PET, could be pyrolysed — but they’d introduce oxygen atoms that would carry through to the pyrolysis-oil product and would have to be removed later. Meanwhile, dirtier waste tends to produce dirtier pyrolysis oil, which also has to be cleaned. To avoid that expense, pyrolysis plants still sort and clean plastics beforehand, often with the same pre-treatment steps used at mechanical recycling facilities, says Corinne Scown, a sustainability researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. Consequently, manufacturing plastic in this way costs more than mechanical recycling, and more than making virgin plastic from fossil oil.\n\nChemical recycling, but better?\n\nThat’s where Mura’s technology comes in. The method is known as hydrothermal liquefaction, but the secret sauce inside Mura’s stainless-steel reactor is not merely hot water. The process operates at more than 400 °C and 220 atmospheres of pressure, which means that the water is in a supercritical state — it can behave like both a liquid and a gas, dissolving oily polymer molecules and chopping them into pieces. “On the face of it, it’s quite promising. I think that there’s a lot of excitement. I’ve been to quite a few conferences where everyone’s talking about it,” says Kennedy.\n\nJust like pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction uses heat to break the strong carbon–carbon bonds that hold polymer chains together. This produces molecular fragments with an unpaired electron on each of the sundered carbons, called carbon radicals. During pyrolysis, these reactive radicals zoom around like a frenzied swarm of cannibalistic piranhas, tearing each other into smaller pieces. But in Mura’s hydrothermal process, the molten polymer is dispersed more evenly through supercritical water. This makes heat transfer more efficient, and ensures that the carbon radicals tend to sate their hunger for other atoms by plucking hydrogen from surrounding water molecules, forming more-stable hydrocarbons and avoiding char formation5.\n\nA new plastics recycling plant near Redcar, UK, which owners Mura say will start operating in 2025.Credit: Kim Walker/Mura Technology\n\nSupercritical fluids are already used in a wide variety of industrial processes, from purifying pharmaceuticals to decaffeinating coffee. Other companies are using hydrothermal liquefaction to convert biomass into fuels and to recycle cotton–polyester textiles.\n\nBut Mura says that this is the first time supercritical water has been applied to commercial-scale processing of waste plastic. For now, it doesn’t have much competition, although plenty of researchers are studying supercritical liquids to break down various polymers6.\n\nMura says that its process generates an output that is similar to pyrolysis oil, but with lower CO2 emissions, higher efficiency and a somewhat greater tolerance for contamination. Overall, Mura predicts that this will give its process an edge over pyrolysis, and thus boost recycling of mixed waste. “If this process is more tolerant to contamination, then that could put it at an advantage,” says Scown.\n\nBlack gold\n\nMura’s technology has been brewing for a long time. It originated with Thomas Maschmeyer, a chemist now at the University of Sydney in Australia. In the 1990s, when he was at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands, a company sought his advice about using supercritical liquids to process municipal waste. Although the process didn’t thrive, the concept stuck in his mind.\n\nYears later, in Australia, he and fellow chemist Len Humphreys designed a reactor that used supercritical water to transform waste biomass such as wood chippings and agricultural residues. The pair set up a company called Licella to develop that process, called catalytic hydrothermal reactor or Cat-HTR. Along with supercritical water, Cat-HTR can use catalysts to help remove oxygen atoms from woody polymers such as cellulose, producing an oily output7. In collaboration with Canadian forestry company Canfor, Licella has just finished building a facility in Prince George, Canada, that will turn forest waste into aviation fuel.\n\nIn 2016, an investor in Licella, Steve Mahon, suggested that researchers try feeding the reactor with waste plastic. The process worked — even without catalysts — and Mahon and Licella formed Mura to commercialize it as hydrothermal plastic recycling technology (Hydro-PRT). Mahon, now Mura’s chief executive, says that the process has evolved a lot since those early trials; much of the funding for development has come from petrochemical giants such as the multinational Dow, and the US technology and engineering company KBR. “Turning something that was a lab curiosity into an industrial process has been what we’ve spent the best part of US$200 million and seven or eight years doing,” he says.\n\nIt takes about 30 minutes for Mura’s reactor to turn a batch of plastic into the desired blend of hydrocarbon products, unlike pyrolysis, which can take many hours. After depressurization, these hydrocarbons are separated from the water and then distilled into four products: naphtha, two kinds of ‘gas oil’ and a ‘heavy residual oil’ (see ‘How to recycle plastics with superheated water’). Most of the contaminants from the plastic remain in the water — unlike in pyrolysis — which means that the reactor can tackle dirtier waste without defiling its products.\n\nSource: Mura Technology\n\nThe heavy residual oil can be used as an additive for asphalt. Naphtha and distillate gas oil are sent to Dow, which uses huge chemical reactors called steam crackers to convert the material into various products, including ethene and propene, the building blocks of new polymers. And the remainder goes to a Finnish plant, operated by oil-refining company Neste, where it goes through further refining to make various chemicals.\n\nJust as with pyrolysis, critics such as ZWE complain that some of the plant’s output won’t be reborn as recycled plastic. And even the naphtha that goes into Dow’s steam crackers is mixed with fossil-fuel-derived naphtha before its products go to make fresh plastic. Scown points out that the supply of recycled naphtha is tiny compared with the amount of fossil naphtha processed by petrochemical plants, so that kind of mixing is inevitable to use the recycled material in existing refineries.\n\n“From the outside, it looks like we are working towards more circularity. In reality, we are locking ourselves into keeping on using virgin plastic,” says Lauriane Veillard, a chemical-recycling policy officer at ZWE. Mura rejects ZWE’s argument that its process should be termed ‘chemical recovery’. It says that ‘chemical recycling’ refers to processes that break down waste into raw materials, which might then be used to make not only new plastics, but also other products.\n\nAlthough Hydro-PRT can chew up pretty much any kind of plastic, in practice, its diet will be restricted to waste that yields the hydrocarbon products that its customers want. “We’ve concentrated on polyolefins, because we get the best-quality product for a steam cracker,” says Mahon. This also means that Mura will use many of the same shredding and sorting steps used by pyrolysis plants and mechanical recyclers to tidy up its plastic feedstock.\n\nStill, the company insists that it will only reprocess plastic waste that has already been rejected during mechanical recycling, and would otherwise be destined for incineration or landfill. There’ll be plenty of that waste available for the facility, because a UK law requires all local authorities to collect plastic films and flexible packaging from households for recycling from April 2027.\n\nEnvironmental questions\n\nIs all this good for the environment? Stuart Coles, a sustainability researcher in the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) at the University of Warwick, UK, has carried out an independent life-cycle analysis (LCA) of Mura’s process, in a study funded by the government body Innovate UK8.\n\nIt found that Hydro-PRT emitted a little under half a tonne of CO2 per tonne of waste plastic. Much of that comes from the electricity used for separating and sorting the plastic waste, along with some electrical heating, so the emissions should decline as the UK electricity grid gets greener.\n\nThe emissions are much lower than incineration for energy recovery, which belches about 2.3 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of plastic, and they are less than half of the emissions associated with refining fossil oil to create virgin naphtha. But Hydro-PRT’s CO2 output is only slightly lower than the emissions from pyrolysis plants calculated by other studies, and actually a little higher than for mechanical recycling .\n\n“The overriding takeaway is that if you can mechanically recycle your material, then do that. If you can’t mechanically recycle it, then chemically recycle it in the way that is most appropriate for that material,” says Coles.",

Biological ageing is measured at a molecular level; people of the same chronological age can have faster or slower age-related decline depending on their health.\n\nThree to four months’ slowing of biological ageing sounds small, but this can translate to important public-health benefits such as a reduction in the prevalence of some age-related health conditions, says Bischoff-Ferrari at the University of Basel in Switzerland.\n\nThe study analysed data from the DO-HEALTH trial on the effects of supplements and exercise in older people, that took place across five European countries from 2012 to 2014. The researchers reviewed data on more than 700 people aged 70 or over who were given either a placebo or omega-3, vitamin D and exercise alone or in combination. All the participants were from Switzerland and around half were healthy, with no major chronic illnesses or disabilities.\n\nBlood samples taken from participants at the start and end of the study were analysed using four biological clocks. These measure the extent of biological ageing on the basis of additions and deletions of methyl groups to the DNA.\n\n“The use of multiple DNA methylation clocks is a strength, as different clocks capture distinct aspects of biological ageing,” says Luigi Fontana, a biogerontologist at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nStronger together\n\nOne of those clocks, called PhenoAge, showed that older people avoided several months of biological ageing over 3 years by taking 1 gram of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, derived from algae, with additive benefits from taking vitamin D (2,000 international units per day) and engaging in 30 minutes of exercise 3 times a week.

          "abstract": "Surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston transplanted a modified pig kidney into a living person for the first time in 2024.Credit: Massachusetts General Hospital\n\nThe first clinical trial testing whether pig kidneys can be safely transplanted into living people has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As part of the trial, which will begin later this year, kidneys from genetically modified pigs will be transplanted into people with chronic kidney disease whose organs no longer function independently.\n\nWill pigs solve the organ crisis? The future of animal-to-human transplants\n\nThe FDA’s green light will bring the experimental procedure a step closer to one day supplying organs to the thousands of people who are waiting for a donor organ. “The start of formal clinical trials is very exciting,” says Jay Fishman, a specialist in transplant infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\nAbout half a dozen people in the United States and China have received organs from genome-edited pigs — kidneys, hearts, liver and a thymus — but the surgeries were approved on compassionate grounds, meaning the patients were very sick and had no other options. Most recipients did not survive beyond a few months after the transplants for various reasons, including that they were too sick to cope with major surgery.\n\n“The humans who have received xenotransplants have made a tremendous contribution to our field,” Fishman says. But formal clinical trials are standardized, and can therefore produce important information, including crucial safety and efficacy data, to move the field forwards, he says.\n\nFirst trial\n\nSix individuals will initially be enrolled in the trial, according to United Therapeutics, the biotechnology firm, based in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, that is running the trial. The trial will include people with end-stage kidney disease, aged 55–70 years old, who are not eligible for conventional kidney transplantation for medical reasons or are not likely to get one in the next five years and will possibly die waiting. Patients will be closely monitored for about six months for serious adverse events, infectious diseases and signs of kidney damage, and then followed up with for the rest of their lives.\n\nFirst pig kidney transplant in a person: what it means for the future\n\nThe trial will assess efficacy by tracking how many participants — and transplanted kidneys — survive the procedure, and for how long. It will also measure how well the kidneys filter blood and will track changes in the participants’ quality of life.\n\nThe FDA has mandated pauses between patients to make sure there are no surprises, Fishman says. A monitoring committee will review safety and efficacy data for the first 6 participants, before deciding whether the trial should be expanded to up to 50 individuals.\n\nTrials will enable researchers to select people who are in better health than those first compassionate-use recipients to assess the transplant’s safety and efficacy, says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a surgeon and researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.\n\nThe success of this trial will pave the way for longer-term, larger clinical trials, says Wayne Hawthorne, a transplant surgeon at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nMohiuddin, who in 2022 led the first pig-heart transplant into a living person, says he is in the process of submitting a request to the FDA to start clinical trials, but adds that the heart is a more difficult organ to get approval for.\n\nAnother company, eGenesis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has also submitted a request to the FDA to launch a xenotransplant trial, says Fishman, who has advised both United Therapeutics and eGenesis on microbiology safety, and would be involved in an eGenesis trial should it be approved. In an e-mailed statement, eGenesis said that in December, it had received FDA approval to conduct three pig-kidney transplants under compassionate use. The company did not comment on the status of its clinical-trial application.\n\nModified pigs",

          "authors": "Emily Sohn",
          "abstract": "Credit: Iryna Veklich/Getty\n\nRelationships are central to the human experience. Over the course of a lifetime, most of us have, want, lose or think about them. But the study of romance, dating and relationships is not as romantic as it might sound. People are complicated; couples even more so. Funding is scarce, statistics are tricky and media reports tend to oversimplify findings with the unrealistic goal of providing clear advice for people who want to find a love match.\n\n“We’re doing research that we know touches the hearts of so many people from so many walks of life,” says evolutionary biologist Justin Garcia, executive director of Indiana University’s Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, which was established in 1947 to research issues around sexuality, gender and reproduction. “Whether that’s marriage, infidelity or romantic, sexual and relationship satisfaction, we can be talking about some of the most exciting and rewarding aspects of someone’s life and some of the most challenging and difficult ones. The power of romantic bonds across time and place is a great human unifier,” he says. Garcia’s latest research straddles the oddly separate worlds of relationship research and sex research, and includes work on consensual non-monogamy and distinctions between social and sexual monogamy.\n\nNature spoke to four scientists who study relationships, including Garcia. They shared what they love about studying love, what obstacles they face in the process — and how they navigate their own romantic lives.\n\nKENNETH TAN: Studying love across cultures\n\nPsychologist at Singapore Management University.\n\nI started becoming interested in thinking about relationships when I was doing my military service in Singapore. I enlisted at the age of 19, completed my service and started university at 21. It was a time when many young guys had relationship issues; their partners left them for other folks in university while we were away in the army. I gave a lot of advice and shared a lot of similar stories with my friends. We spent many late nights just talking.\n\nA decade of love: mapping the landscape of romantic love research through bibliometric analysi\n\nEarly in my career, I went abroad to the United States to do a three-month training programme, which exposed me to the scientific study of close relationships. I had a partner at the time, and was thinking, ‘How do people navigate long-distance relationships?’ In Singapore, it’s something that you never think about because it’s a small country, so there is no travelling for three hours to see someone. It was a new experience for me and made me wonder how people maintain relationships. A big focus of my work has been understanding commitment.\n\nI get questions from students and the public seeking personal advice about red flags, and how to get into — and out of — relationships and what to look for in a potential partner. They ask, ‘How many dates should I go on? Do I give this person a chance?’ It’s empowering to be asked, but it’s also challenging because you don’t want to give people the wrong answers. I try to tell students, ‘On average, this is what the work has shown, but everyone is different.’\n\nWhen we’re trying to publish our work in US and international journals, we get pushback if we only have a sample from Singapore. We’re often asked to show similarities and differences with other cultures, regardless of whether we have any hypothesis on whether they’re different. On the one hand, it makes you think, ‘They’re not requesting that for US samples, so why do they want it for an Asian sample?’ But on the other hand, I think that ultimately, having that diversity and collecting data from multiple places enriches the science.\n\nCome mate with me\n\nThe cross-cultural work is still fresh, and there’s a lot more discovery waiting to happen. These are exciting times to be researching relationships and singlehood. Currently, I’m just one of two researchers studying the psychology of relationships in Singapore. I think that there are two or three others in southeast Asia. I spent six years in the United States, and I definitely miss the huge research network there. One of my goals is to build up the field in Singapore. As the work grows, hopefully the media will include an empirical angle in stories as well.\n\nOne thing about commitment is that you start to think of your own relationship as special. A lot of times, when I tell my wife during an argument, ‘Oh, this is what the science says about relationships, and this might be happening to us,’ she’ll say things such as, ‘We’re beyond the science. We’re not your science.’\n\nJUSTIN GARCIA: People tell me things\n\nEvolutionary biologist and executive director of the Kinsey Institute, Bloomington, at Indiana University and scientific adviser to Match.com.\n\nMy interests have always been in the evolution of monogamy. I’m part sex researcher, part relationship researcher. I go back and forth between these two worlds, and people are often surprised to hear that they’re separate fields. In the human sciences, you’ll hear people talking about social monogamy, also called pair bonding, as a relationship structure. It’s different from sexual monogamy, which is fidelity or sexual exclusivity. My colleagues and I had a whole section in a recent paper about distinctions between social and sexual monogamy.\n\nIt can be hard to get funding to study people’s romantic and sexual lives. The federal agencies are often worried about the word ‘sex’ in the title or the abstract of a paper. A lot of relationship scientists also don’t use the word ‘love’ in their studies. In the 1970s, a US senator criticized relationship and sex research as absurd government spending. That is very much a part of the history of these fields.\n\nI came to the Kinsey Institute as a postdoc in 2011, and I have been scientific adviser to Match.com, the online dating service based in Dallas, Texas, since 2010. The late anthropologist Helen Fisher and I started a project with the company, called Singles in America. It’s an annual scientific study of more than 5,000 single people. We use a demographically representative sample to understand the attitudes and behaviours of more than 100 million single people — about one-third of the adult population in the United States. These are people who are moving in and out of romantic and sexual relationships at all stages of life. We’ve published a lot from that project over the years. The company doesn’t control what we publish, and its funding means that we avoid the challenge of getting federal grants. It has been a really rewarding collaboration.\n\nJustin Garcia at an event with American-German sex therapist ‘Dr Ruth’, Ruth Westheimer.Credit: Kinsey Institute Library & Special Collections.\n\nI’ll never forget the time that one of my senior colleagues on campus invited me for a coffee. She was a distinguished faculty member, and I thought, ‘Oh this is great, maybe it’s some kind of collaboration.’ I got there, and within two minutes, she took out her phone, turned it to face me and said, “Can you help me with my dating profile?”\n\nOne of the mistakes that she was making, and this happens a lot, was just thinking about what she was searching for. But courtship is about both searching and being found. You need a profile that someone can ask questions about, that they can engage with, that gives potential dates an opportunity to get to know you. So, they can say, ‘Oh, is that a picture of you hiking at Machu Picchu? I’ve always wanted to go there.’\n\nPeople have told me about challenges in their relationships. I often remind them that I’m not a sex or couples therapist. I’ve been asked, ‘Don’t you get exhausted? You’re at a cocktail party and you’ve heard about everyone’s marital issues.’ But I take it as an honour that someone is willing to share an intimate piece of their life with me. And I think — what can we learn from it?\n\nThe fun of the work is that it’s interdisciplinary. It’s about the body, our brains, how we communicate, where we live, our development. I think that knowing more about ourselves makes us appreciate our relationships and the power of love even more. The challenge is that everyone has opinions about what you’re asking and concluding. They want to know, ‘How could you say that, because that’s not what happened to my cousin Billy and his divorce?’\n\nSARAH STANTON: Steer clear of the love languages\n\nSocial psychologist and relationship researcher at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nI study romantic relationships and how to make them better. I also investigate how to improve relationship experiences for people who struggle with them, either because they’re uncomfortable with intimacy or because their worries get in the way of them enjoying those connections. And I explore how relationships affect short- and long-term health and well-being.\n\nLove: Neuroscience reveals all\n\nSometimes, the gap between the science and what’s written about it for the public is wide; findings often get misrepresented or overly simplified. People want to mention the five love languages as if they’re the solution to all relationship issues. The 5 Love Languages is a book first published in 1992 that assumes that each person has a preferred love language and that couples are more satisfied when partners speak one another’s preferred language. It’s such a bugbear of mine, because love languages are not formally based in science. They’re just some guy’s opinions. I am constantly being asked about them. Now I don’t even wait for it to be a question in my undergraduate classes. In lecture one, I say: “Disabuse yourself of this notion.”",

          "abstract": "Restrictions on offshore oil drilling in the United States are under threat.Credit: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nHigher greenhouse-gas emissions, fewer jobs, more expensive energy and dirtier air that kills more people: researchers have begun plugging US President Donald Trump’s energy and climate policies into their models, and the early results suggest far-reaching environmental, health and economic consequences.\n\nTrump, a Republican, began his second term on a promise to “drill, baby, drill”, vowing to make the United States rich again by promoting the development of oil and gas. To that end, Trump plans to roll back climate regulations, end clean-energy incentives and promote fossil fuels. It’s not clear that Trump will be able to accomplish his goals. But if he does, researchers’ models show that these policies are likely to have negative effects for many US residents. They also project that Trump’s policies will undermine efforts to rein in global warming, affecting people around the world.\n\n“Trump is going to make the job of meeting our climate goals a lot harder,” says Bill Hare, a physicist who heads Climate Analytics, a non-profit consultancy in Berlin.\n\nBumping up greenhouse gases\n\nTrump has vowed to roll back regulations put in place by his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from sources such as automobiles and power plants. Trump has also called for fossil-fuel development to be expedited, and for a halt to climate investments that Congress approved in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As things stand, those investments are set to pump more than US$1 trillion into programmes to cut emissions and develop green energy by 2032.\n\nAn initial analysis by Climate Analytics and the non-profit consortium Climate Action Tracker suggests that, by 2030, the Trump administration’s policies could raise cumulative US emissions by the equivalent of 2 billion to 4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide over what they would otherwise be; the size of the increase will depend mainly on the extent of cuts made to IRA spending. The upper end of that range is equivalent to four years of carbon emissions from Japan.\n\nHow five crucial elections in 2024 could shape climate action for decades\n\nOther groups have come up with similar numbers for 2030, and even higher emissions figures for subsequent years. For instance, modelling by the Rhodium Group, a research consultancy based in New York City, suggests that rolling back Biden’s regulations and repealing the IRA would raise annual US emissions in 2035 by the equivalent of around 1 billion tonnes of CO2.\n\nResearchers say it’s not yet clear how these changes will affect Earth’s climate. Climate actions and policies formulated so far by nations around the world are projected to result in 2.7 °C of warming by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker. The organization projects that the estimated 2 billion to 4 billion tonnes of emissions resulting from Trump’s policies could raise the global temperature by less than a tenth of a degree Celsius. But if these policies were continued into the future and the United States abandoned its climate goals, the increase could be a few tenths of a degree, which would be enough to push the world past the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C.\n\nRipple effects\n\nTrump’s policies would slow the shift from coal to cleaner fuels for generating electricity and would also slow sales of electric vehicles. The burning of more coal and petrol would mean more air pollution, which contributes to a host of diseases. As a result, a Trump administration rollback of current environmental and energy policies could lead to several thousand premature deaths a year by 2030, says Robbie Orvis, a senior director at Energy Innovation Policy and Technology, a think tank based in San Francisco, California, that modelled the effects of such policies.\n\nSuperfast Microsoft AI is first to predict air pollution for the whole world\n\nMoreover, researchers say that any gains in employment in the energy sector as a result of Trump’s policies would be more than offset by job losses and reduced economic growth across the rest of the economy. A broad repeal of current energy and climate policies could result in a net loss of nearly four million jobs by 2030, according to work by Orvis’s group.",

          "abstract": "Researchers think that for some tasks, generative AI tools can already do a better job than humans. Credit: Getty\n\nUsing artificial intelligence (AI) tools for processes such as preparing manuscripts, writing grant applications and peer review will become widely accepted within the next two years, suggests a survey of nearly 5,000 researchers in more than 70 countries by the publishing company Wiley.\n\nThe survey asked researchers how they are currently using generative AI tools — which include chatbots such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek — as well as how they feel about various potential applications of the technology. The results suggest that the majority of researchers see AI becoming central for scientific research and publishing (see ‘Acceptable use’). More than half of the respondents think that AI currently outperforms humans at more than 20 of the tasks given as example use cases, including reviewing large sets of papers, summarizing research findings, detecting errors in writing, checking for plagiarism and organizing citations. More half of the survey participants expect AI to become mainstream in 34 out of 43 use cases in the next two years.\n\nSource: ExplanAItions report, Wiley\n\n“What really stands out is the imminence of this,” says Sebastian Porsdam Mann at the University of Copenhagen, who studies the practicalities and ethics of using generative AI in research. “People that are in positions that will be affected by this — which is everyone, but to varying degrees — need to start” addressing this now, he adds.\n\nWiley, headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey, posted the survey findings online on 4 February. Josh Jarrett, senior vice-president and general manager of the publisher’s AI growth team, says he hopes they will serve as a road map for innovators and start-ups looking for opportunities to develop AI tools. “There's broad acceptance that AI is going to reshape the research field.”\n\nLimited uses\n\nThe survey polled 4,946 researchers worldwide, 27% of whom are early-career researchers. Perhaps surprisingly, says Jarrett, the results show that “people aren't really using these tools much in their day-to-day work”. Only 45% of the first wave of respondents (1,043 researchers) said that they had actually used AI to help with their research, and the most common uses they cited were translation, proofreading and editing manuscripts (see ‘Uses of AI’).\n\nAlthough 81% of these 1,043 respondents said they had used OpenAI’s ChatGPT for personal or professional purposes, only one-third had heard of other generative-AI tools such as Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s Copilot. However, there are clear differences across countries and disciplines, with researchers in China and Germany, as well as computer scientists, being the most likely to use AI in their work.\n\nSource: ExplanAItions report, Wiley\n\nThe majority of survey participants expressed interest in expanding their AI use. About 72% want to use AI for preparing manuscripts in the next two years — for tasks such as detecting errors in writing, plagiarism checks and organizing citations. Sixty-two per cent think that AI already outperforms humans in these tasks (see ‘Who does it better: humans or AI?’).\n\nAround 67% of respondents also expressed interest in using AI to handle large amounts of information, for example helping to review the literature, summarizing papers and processing data. Early-career researchers showed greater interest than did more senior colleagues in using AI for writing grant applications and finding potential collaborators. “These are both things that come easier with experience and seniority,” says Porsdam Mann. “Using AI will help even those things out a little bit.”\n\nHowever, researchers are less convinced about AI’s capabilities in more-complex tasks such as identifying gaps in the literature, choosing a journal to submit manuscripts to, recommending peer reviewers or suggesting relevant citations. Although 64% of respondents are open to using AI for these tasks in the next two years, the majority thinks that humans still outperform AI in these areas.\n\nWho does it better: humans or AI?\n\nResearchers think AI can already perform some tasks better than people.\n\nUse caseExamplesQ: Who currently does it better: humans or AI?Manuscript preparation Detecting errors/bias in own writingChecking for unintended plagiarismWriting assistance (e.g. copyediting, translation)FormattingPopulating citationsAI (62% of respondents)Handling informationReviewing a large number of studiesAI agent to monitor key new publicationsAutomated processing of unstructured data (e.g. cataloguing events in hours of video footage)Data visualizationAI (60%)Sharing findings‘Plain language’ summaries of article findingsKnowledge-management agent to help make information accessibleAI (58%)Increasing impactGenerating educational content based on a paperGenerating multimediaVideo abstract or “explainer” generatorHumans (51%)Enhancing research methods and enhancing collaborationWriting up documentationOptimizing experimental designIdentifying potential collaboratorsTools to optimize allocation of shared resourcesAdvanced simulationsHumans (58%)Peer reviewPeer reviewer recommendation tool based on article comparisonsAdapting reviewer feedback into standardized formatAutomated feedback to reviewersHumans (59%)\n\nSource: ExplanAItions report, Wiley\n\nObstacles and opportunities",

          "authors": "Felicity Nelson",
          "abstract": "Mice immediately bolt for shelter when they see the looming shadow of a bird, just as humans jump when they see a spider. But these instinctive reactions, which are controlled by the brainstem, can be suppressed if animals learn that a scary stimulus is harmless.\n\nIn Science today, neuroscientists reveal the precise regions of the brain that suppress fear responses in mice1 — a finding that might help scientists to develop strategies for treating post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety in people.\n\nThe study showed that two parts of the brain work together to learn to suppress fear. But, surprisingly, only one of these regions is involved in later recalling the learnt behaviour. “This is the first evidence of that mechanism,” says neuroscientist Pascal Carrive at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.\n\nIn the study, an expanding dark circle was used to imitate a swooping bird, and caused naive mice to run to a shelter. To teach the mice that this looming stimulus was not dangerous, a barrier was added to prevent the animals from hiding.\n\n“I like their behavioural model,” says Christina Perry, a behavioural neuroscientist at Macquarie University in Sydney. “It’s very simple,” she adds. The mice “don’t get eaten, so they learn that this fake predator is not, in fact, a threat”.\n\nAs the mice were learning to be bolder, the researchers switched specific types of neurons on or off using optogenetics — a well-established technique that allows neurons to be controlled with light.\n\nWhen researchers silenced the parts of the cerebral cortex that analyse visual stimuli (called the posterolateral higher visual areas), the mice did not learn to suppress fear and continued to try to escape from the fake bird — suggesting that this area of the brain is necessary for learning to suppress this fear reaction.\n\n‘Unexpected’ result\n\nHowever, mice already trained to overcome their fear could still enact the new, courageous behaviour when the posterolateral higher visual areas were switched off. This is because the memory was stored in a region near the centre of the brain called the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus, “an area of the brain that can inhibit others; it’s quite a strong control region”, says co-author Sonja Hofer, a systems neuroscientist at University College London (UCL).",

          "abstract": "Researchers in the social sciences are interested in the consequences of institutions, increasingly on a global scale. Institutions that may be negotiated between states can have consequences at a microlevel, as local populations adjust their expectations and ultimately even their behavior to take institutional rules into account. However, large-scale fine-grained analyses that test for the complex evidence of such institutions locally are rare. This article focuses on a key institution: International borders. Using computer vision techniques, we show that it is possible to produce a geographically specific, validated, and replicable way to characterize border legibility , by which we mean the ability to visually detect the presence of an international border in physical space. We develop and compare computer vision techniques to automatically estimate legibility scores for 627,656 imagery tiles from virtually every border in the world. We evaluate statistical and data-driven computer vision methods, finding that fine-tuning pretrained visual recognition models on a small set of human judgments allows us to produce local legibility scores globally that align well with human notions of legibility. Finally, we interpret these scores as useful approximations of states’ border orientations, a concept that prior literature has used to capture the visible investments states make in border areas to maintain jurisdictional authority territorially. We validate our measurement strategy using both human judgments and five nomological validation indicators.",

          "abstract": "For many countries in the Global South traditional poverty estimates are available only infrequently and at coarse spatial resolutions, if at all. This limits decision-makers’ and analysts’ ability to target humanitarian and development interventions and makes it difficult to study relationships between poverty and other natural and human phenomena at finer spatial scales. Advances in Earth observation and machine learning-based methods have proven capable of generating more granular estimates of relative asset wealth indices. They have been less successful in predicting the consumption-based poverty measures most commonly used by decision-makers, those tied to national and international poverty lines. For a study area including four countries in southern and eastern Africa, we pilot a two-step approach that combines Earth observation, accessible machine learning methods, and asset-based structural poverty measurement to address this gap. This structural poverty approach to machine learning-based poverty estimation preserves the interpretability and policy-relevance of consumption-based poverty measures, while allowing us to explain 72 to 78% of cluster-level variation in a pooled model and 40 to 54% even when predicting out-of-country.",

          "abstract": "Numerous uniquely human phenomena, from teaching to our most complex forms of cooperation, depend on our ability to tailor our communication to the knowledge and ignorance states of our social partners. Despite four decades of research into the “theory of mind” capacities of nonhuman primates, there remains no evidence that primates can communicate on the basis of their mental state attributions, to enable feats of coordination. Moreover, recent reevaluation of the experimental literature has questioned whether primates can represent others’ ignorance at all. The present preregistered study investigated whether bonobos are capable of attributing knowledge or ignorance about the location of a hidden food reward to a cooperative human partner, and utilizing this attribution to modify their communicative behavior in the service of coordination. Bonobos could receive a reward that they had watched being hidden under one of several cups, if their human partner could locate the reward. If bonobos can represent a partner’s ignorance and are motivated to communicate based on this mental state attribution, they should point more frequently, and more quickly, to the hidden food’s location when their partner is ignorant about that location than when he is knowledgeable. Bonobos indeed flexibly adapted the frequency and speed of their communication to their partner’s mental state. These findings suggest that apes can represent (and act on) others’ ignorance in some form, strategically and appropriately communicating to effectively coordinate with an ignorant partner and change his behavior.",

We use one trait, beauty, to infer how much parents’ physical characteristics transmit inequality across generations. Analyses of a large-scale longitudinal dataset in the United States, and a much smaller dataset of Chinese parents and children, show that increases in parents’ looks are associated with increases in their child’s looks. A large dataset of U.S. siblings shows a positive correlation of their beauty. The appropriate weighted average from the three samples shows that a one SD increase in ratings of both parents’ looks is associated with a 0.25 SD increase in their child’s. Coupling these estimates with those from large literatures measuring the impact of beauty on earnings and the intergenerational elasticity of income suggests that a one SD difference in parents’ looks is correlated with a 0.074 SD difference in their adult child’s earnings, about U.S. $2,170 annually.",

This “experience effect” contributes to the higher average wages that are found in big cities compared to the economy as a whole. Racial wage inequality is also higher in bigger cities than in the economy on average. We offer an explanation for this pattern, demonstrating that there is substantial racial inequality in the economic returns to work experience acquired in big cities. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 we find that each year of work experience in a big city increases Black and Latinx workers’ wages by about one quarter to half as much as White workers’ wages. A substantial amount of this inequality can be explained by further racial disparities in the benefits of high-skill work experience. This research identifies a heretofore unknown source of inequality that is distinctly urban in nature, and expands our knowledge of the challenges to reaching interracial wage equality.",

We also investigate the qualities teachers perceive top performers who are successful role models to have. We show that teachers associate a greater sense of learning autonomy and sense of being an example with top-performing girls compared to top-performing boys. Estimated effects are more pronounced among teachers with children and teachers in urban areas. Administrative data from a representative sample show limited observed differences between top-performing boys’ and girls’ educational outcomes that could justify the differences in teachers’ gender perceptions.

While many imaging and transcriptomic methods document tissue organization, discerning these patterns is challenging, especially when they involve multiple elements in complex arrangements. To address this challenge, we present Spatial Patterning Analysis of Cellular Ensembles (SPACE), an R package for analysis of high-plex spatial data. SPACE is compatible with any data collection modality that records values (i.e., categorical cell/structure types or quantitative expression levels) at fixed spatial coordinates (i.e., 2d pixels or 3d voxels). SPACE detects not only broad patterns of co-occurrence but also context-dependent associations, quantitative gradients and orientations, and other organizational complexities. Via a robust information theoretic framework, SPACE explores all possible ensembles of tissue elements—single elements, pairs, triplets, and so on—and ranks the most strongly patterned ensembles. For single images, rankings reflect differences from random assortment. For sets of images, rankings reflect differences across sample groups (e.g., genotypes, treatments, timepoints, etc.). Further tools then characterize the nature of each pattern for intuitive interpretation. We validate SPACE and demonstrate its advantages using murine lymph node images for which ground truth has been defined. We then detect new patterns across varied datasets, including tumors and tuberculosis granulomas.",

          "abstract": "Misregulation of the activity of GCN2, the kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates translation initiation factor eIF2α, has been implicated in several health disorders, underscoring the need to determine the mechanisms controlling GCN2 activation. During nutrient starvation, increased uncharged tRNA levels trigger GCN1 and GCN20 proteins to mediate the binding of uncharged tRNA to GCN2 to activate the kinase to phosphorylate eIF2α. Under constant conditions, activation of the Neurospora crassa homolog of GCN2, CPC-3, is controlled by the circadian clock. However, how the circadian clock controls the rhythmic activity of CPC-3 was not known. We found that the clock regulates CPC-3 and GCN1 interaction with ribosomes and show that these interactions are necessary for clock regulation of CPC-3 activity. CPC-3 activity rhythms, and the rhythmic interaction of CPC-3 and GCN1 with ribosomes, are abolished in a temperature-sensitive valyl-tRNA synthetase mutant ( un-3 ts ) that has high levels of uncharged tRNA Val at all times of the day. Disrupting the interaction between GCN1 and uncharged tRNA in the absence of GCN20 altered rhythmic CPC-3 activity, indicating that the clock controls the interaction between uncharged tRNA and GCN1. Together, these data support that circadian rhythms in mRNA translation through CPC-3 activity require rhythms in uncharged tRNA levels that drive the rhythmic interaction between CPC-3 and GCN1 with ribosomes. This regulation uncovers a fundamental mechanism to ensure temporal coordination between peak cellular energy levels and the energetically demanding process of mRNA translation.",

MAIT cells represent a large pre-expanded T cell subset in humans and are involved in both protective immunity and inflammatory immunopathology. However, what controls the functional heterogeneity of human MAIT cell responses is still largely unclear. Here, combining functional and transcriptomic analyses, we investigate how MAIT cell response programs are influenced by the cytokine milieu at the time of antigen recognition. Activation by MR1-presented antigen together with IL-12 induces intermediate levels of IFNγ and TNF, as well as a regulatory profile with substantial IL-10 production and elevated expression of TIM-3, LAG-3, and PD-1. Activation by the combination of antigen and IL-12 induces a c-MAF-dependent program required for IL-10 production. The MAIT cell-derived IL-10 mediates both autocrine and paracrine immune regulation. In contrast, coactivation of MAIT cells with IL-18 induces IL-17, GM-CSF, IFNγ, and TNF, without IL-10. Notably, IL-18 dominantly counteracts IL-10 expression. The activation states biased toward IL-10 or IL-17 production are reversible and do not represent stable subsets. Finally, MR1-restricted TCR-mediated activation without cytokine coactivation drives primarily granzyme B cytolytic arming. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that human MAIT cells adapt their functional effector response during antigen recognition to cytokine cues in the microenvironment, and identify programs biased toward either regulatory c-MAF-dependent IL-10 expression, or an inflammatory IL-17 and GM-CSF profile.",

EKODEs arise from linoleic acid reacting with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species present during inflammation. A hallmark of many LPO products is an electrophilic chemical functionality that can react with different biological nucleophiles to form adducts that impact a broad swath of physiologic processes. Here, we present the identification of reactivity patterns exhibited by the EKODE class of LPO products that arise due to the unique chemistry of the EKODE electrophiles, namely α, β-unsaturated epoxyketones of variable regiochemistry. Our initial investigations with models of the EKODE reactive core showed that surrogates of lysine did not react, and histidine nucleophiles formed reversible Michael adducts. However, when models of cysteine nucleophiles were tested, a unique reactivity profile emerged where rapid Michael addition was followed by slow rearrangement and epoxide opening at an unpredicted electrophilic site, affording what we postulated to be an advanced lipoxidation end product (ALE). After confirming the EKODE reactivity in model systems, we produced polyclonal antibodies of a stable epitope of the EKODE-based ALE and used these antibodies to investigate an approach for in vivo monitoring of inflammatory disease progression.",

          "abstract": "Air pollution from coal electricity generation is a major driver of poor air quality in India and its effects on human health have been extensively studied. Despite considerable evidence that the same pollution also reduces crop productivity, we lack similar quantitative assessments of coal electricity’s crop damages. Here, we estimate rice and wheat crop losses from coal generation’s nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions using a regression model that combines station-level electricity generation and wind direction, satellite-measured NO 2 , and its association with crop productivity. Coal emissions impact yields up to 100 km away from power stations. In parts of West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh heavily exposed to coal-linked NO 2 , annual yield losses exceed 10%, equivalent to approximately 6 y worth of average annual yield growth in both rice and wheat in India between 2011 and 2020. While station-specific crop damages (value of lost output) are almost always lower than mortality damages (monetized value of annual premature PM 2.5 -related deaths), crop damage intensity (crop damage per GWh of electricity generated) is frequently higher than mortality damage intensity (mortality damage/GWh). Rice damage intensity exceeds mortality damage intensity at 58, and wheat damage intensity at 35 of the 144 power stations studied. The stations associated with the largest crop losses differ from those associated with the highest mortality. Co-optimizing for crop gains and mortality reduction slightly increases and meaningfully changes the distribution of social benefits from reducing emissions, highlighting the importance of considering crop losses alongside health impacts when regulating coal electricity emissions in India.",

          "abstract": "Research investments in crop improvements, including by national and international agricultural research centers, have made significant contributions to raising yields of staple food crops in developing countries. Although mostly intended to improve food security and rural incomes, innovations in crop production also have major implications for the environment. Building on the latest productivity estimates from historical crop improvements in developing countries and using a gridded (0.25 degrees) equilibrium model of global agriculture, we assess the impacts of improved crop varieties on cropland use, threatened biodiversity, and terrestrial carbon stocks over 1961–2015. We replicate a historical baseline and produce a counterfactual scenario which shows the impact of omitting productivity improvements from these technologies. The results show that higher crop productivity generally lowered commodity prices, which reduced incentives to expand cropland except in those areas where productivity gains outweighed price declines. The net global effect of technology adoption was to limit conversion of natural habitat to agricultural use, although it did cause cropland to expand in some areas. We estimate that adoption of improved crop varieties in developing countries saved on net 16.03 [95% CI, 12.33 to 20.89] million hectares worldwide. With more natural habitat preserved, around 1,043 [95% CI, 616 to 1,503] threatened animal and plant species extinctions were avoided over this period. In addition, net land use savings from the improved crop varieties resulted in avoided terrestrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of around 5.35 [95% CI, 3.75 to 7.22] billion metric tons CO 2 equivalent retained in terrestrial carbon stocks.",

          "abstract": "Our understanding of how vision functions as primates actively navigate the real-world is remarkably sparse. As most data have been limited to chaired and typically head-restrained animals, the synergistic interactions of different motor actions/plans inherent to active sensing—e.g., eyes, head, posture, movement, etc.—on visual perception are largely unknown. To address this considerable gap in knowledge, we developed an innovative wireless head-mounted eye-tracking system that performs Chair-free Eye-Recording using Backpack mounted micROcontrollers (CEREBRO) for small mammals, such as marmoset monkeys. Because eye illumination and environment lighting change continuously in natural contexts, we developed a segmentation artificial neural network to perform robust pupil tracking in these conditions. Leveraging this innovative system to investigate active vision, we demonstrate that although freely moving marmosets exhibit frequent compensatory eye movements equivalent to other primates, including humans, the predictability of the visual behavior (gaze) is higher when animals are freely moving relative to when they are head-fixed. Moreover, despite increases in eye/head-motion during locomotion, gaze stabilization remains steady because of an increase in vestibularocular reflex gain during locomotion. These results demonstrate the efficient, dynamic visuo-motor mechanisms and related behaviors that enable stable, high-resolution foveal vision in primates as they explore the natural world.",

          "abstract": "A bilateral body plan is predominant throughout the animal kingdom. Bilaterality of amniote embryos becomes recognizable as midline morphogenesis begins at gastrulation, bisecting an embryonic field into the left and right sides, and left–right (LR) asymmetry patterning follows. While a series of laterality genes expressed after the LR compartmentalization has been extensively studied, the laterality patterning prior to and at the initiation of midline morphogenesis has remained unclear. Here, through a biophysical quantification in a high spatial and temporal resolution, applied to a chick model system, we show that a large-scale bilateral counterrotating cellular flow, termed “polonaise movements”, display LR asymmetries in early gastrulation. This cell movement starts prior to the formation of the primitive streak (PS) (the earliest midline structure) and the subsequent appearance of Hensen’s node (the LR organizer). The cellular flow speed and vorticity unravel the location and timing of the LR asymmetries. The bilateral flows displayed a Right dominance after 6 h since the start of cell movements. Mitotic arrest that diminishes PS formation resulted in changes in the bilateral flow pattern, but the Right dominance persisted. Our data indicate that the LR asymmetry in amniote gastrula becomes detectable earlier than suggested by current models, which assume that the asymmetric regulation of the laterality signals at the node leads to the LR patterning. More broadly, our results suggest that physical processes can play an unexpected but significant role in influencing LR laterality during embryonic development.",

          "abstract": "Peptides can bind to specific sites on larger proteins and thereby function as inhibitors and regulatory elements. Peptide fragments of larger proteins are particularly attractive for achieving these functions due to their inherent potential to form native-like binding interactions. Recently developed experimental approaches allow for high-throughput measurement of protein fragment inhibitory activity in living cells. However, it has thus far not been possible to predict de novo which of the many possible protein fragments bind to protein targets, let alone act as inhibitors. We have developed a computational method, FragFold, that employs AlphaFold to predict protein fragment binding to full-length proteins in a high-throughput manner. Applying FragFold to thousands of fragments tiling across diverse proteins revealed peaks of predicted binding along each protein sequence. Comparisons with experimental measurements establish that our approach is a sensitive predictor of fragment function: Evaluating inhibitory fragments from known protein–protein interaction interfaces, we find 87% are predicted by FragFold to bind in a native-like mode. Across full protein sequences, 68% of FragFold-predicted binding peaks match experimentally measured inhibitory peaks. Deep mutational scanning experiments support the predicted binding modes and uncover superior inhibitory peptides in high throughput. Further, FragFold is able to predict previously unknown protein binding modes, explaining prior genetic and biochemical data. The success rate of FragFold demonstrates that this computational approach should be broadly applicable for discovering inhibitory protein fragments across proteomes.",

Nine of the ten GAPs for Ras contain a C2 domain immediately proximal to their canonical GAP domain, and in RasGAP (p120GAP, p120RasGAP; RASA1 ) mutation of this domain is associated with vascular malformations in humans. Here, we show that the C2 domain of RasGAP is required for full catalytic activity toward Ras. Analyses of the RasGAP C2-GAP crystal structure, AlphaFold models, and sequence conservation reveal direct C2 domain interaction with the Ras allosteric lobe. This is achieved by an evolutionarily conserved surface centered around RasGAP residue R707, point mutation of which impairs the catalytic advantage conferred by the C2 domain in vitro. In mice, R707C mutation phenocopies the vascular and signaling defects resulting from constitutive disruption of the RASA1 gene. In SynGAP, mutation of the equivalent conserved C2 domain surface impairs catalytic activity. Our results indicate that the C2 domain is required to achieve full catalytic activity of GAPs for Ras.",

In such a context, knowing when and where megafauna find resources to balance their substantial energy requirements is critical for their management. Through an energyscape approach integrating abundance censuses, diet, and energy requirements, we investigated the prey consumption patterns of Mediterranean marine megafauna during the summer. We thereby shed light on a diverse guild of species composed of fishes, mammals, reptiles, and birds and estimated that 4.1 million individuals consume 1.6 million tons of prey each summer, pelagic cephalopods being the primary food resource and cetaceans and tunas being key players in the community. Spatial patterns in prey consumption reflected the diverse distribution and needs of the megafauna species and underlined the critical importance of the western Mediterranean for the megafauna community. Conservation strategies should prioritize spatial and biological diversity to safeguard megafauna and ecosystem functions across the Mediterranean basin.",

          "abstract": "L-thyroxine (L-T4) monotherapy is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism, administered daily to normalize TSH levels. Once absorbed, T4 is converted to T3 to alleviate most symptoms. However, this treatment abnormally elevates plasma T4 levels in over 50% of patients. Using L-T4-treated Thyroid Hormone (TH) Action Indicator mice, which express a T3-regulated luciferase (Luc) reporter, we examined whether these T4 elevations disrupt TH signaling. Hypothyroid mice exhibited reduced Luc expression across brain regions, and L-T4 treatment failed to restore T3 signaling uniformly. There was also variability in the activity of type 2 deiodinase (D2), the enzyme that generates most brain T3. Intracerebroventricular T4 administration achieved higher elevation of Luc expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus compared to the cortex, and studies on cultured cortical astrocytes and hypothalamic tanycytes revealed cell-type-specific responses to T4. In tanycytes, exposure to T4 sustained D2 activity, leading to progressive T3 signaling, whereas in astrocytes, T4 exposure triggered a drop in D2 activity, limiting T3 production through a ubiquitin-dependent, self-limiting mechanism. The sustained D2 activity in tanycytes was linked to rapid deubiquitination by USP33, as confirmed using a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) pan-inhibitor and USP33 knockout mice. In conclusion, the brain’s response to L-T4 treatment is heterogeneous, influenced by cell-specific regulation of D2-mediated T3 production. While cortical astrocytes exhibit limited T3 signaling due to D2 ubiquitination, tanycytes coexpressing USP33 amplify T3 signaling by rescuing ubiquitinated D2 from proteasomal degradation. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the limitations of L-T4 therapy and highlight the need for tailored approaches to managing hypothyroidism.",

Supramolecular attack particles (SMAPs) are one type of particle characterized by a cytotoxic core enriched in granzymes and perforin surrounded by a proteinaceous shell including thrombospondin (TSP)-1. TSP-4 was also detected in bulk analysis of SMAPs released by CTLs; however, it has not been investigated whether TSP-4 contributes to distinct SMAP types or the same SMAP type as TSP-1 and, if in the same type of SMAP, whether TSP-4 and TSP-1 cooperate or compete. Here, we observed that TSP-4 expression increased upon CD8 + T cell activation while, surprisingly, TSP-1 was down-regulated. Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy and Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy localized TSP-4 and TSP-1 in SMAP-containing multicore granules. Superresolution dSTORM revealed that TSP-4 and TSP-1 are usually enriched in the same SMAPs while particles with single-positive shells are rare. Retention Using Selective Hooks assays showed that TSP-4 localizes to the lytic granules faster than TSP-1 and promotes its accumulation therein. TSP-4 contributed to direct CTL-mediated killing, as previously shown for TSP-1. TSP-4 and TSP-1 were both required for latent SMAP-mediated cell killing, in which released SMAPs kill targets after removal of the CTLs. Of note, we found that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell culture supernatants suppressed expression of TSP-4 in CTL and latent SMAP-mediated killing. These results identify TSP-4 as a functionally important component of SMAPs and suggest that SMAPs may be targeted for immune suppression by CLL.",

By combining phosphoproteomic and biochemical assays, we identified Hsp90 as a direct target of Ptc2 at host CO 2 concentrations and Ssb1 as a Ptc2 target protein regardless of CO 2 levels in Candida albicans , the most prevalent human fungal pathogen. Ptc2 forms reversible condensates at elevated CO 2 , which enables the recruitment of Hsp90, but not Ssb1, to condensates, allowing efficient dephosphorylation. This process confers an enhanced susceptibility to caspofungin in vitro and during in vivo infection therapy. Importantly, we demonstrate this phenomenon in non-albicans Candida species. Sequential passages of C. albicans in mice with caspofungin treatment readily induce in vivo drug tolerance, causing therapeutic failure. These evolved strains display increased resistance to caspofungin under host concentrations of CO 2 but remain susceptible in air. Collectively, our study reveals a profound impact of host concentrations of CO 2 on antifungal drug susceptibility and connects this phenotype to therapeutic outcomes and highlights condensate formation as an efficient means that enables selective recruitment of substrates for certain signaling events.",

The emergence of multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant strains necessitates the development of novel and effective drugs. Accelerating the determination of mechanisms of action (MOAs) for these drugs is crucial for advancing TB treatment. This study introduces MycoBCP, a unique adaptation of bacterial cytological profiling (BCP) tailored to M. tuberculosis , utilizing the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) within BCP to overcome challenges posed by traditional image analysis techniques. Using MycoBCP, we analyzed the morphological effects of various antimicrobial compounds on M. tuberculosis , capturing broad patterns rather than relying on precise cell segmentation. This approach circumvented issues such as cell clumping and uneven staining, which are prevalent in M. tuberculosis . In a blind test, MycoBCP accurately identified the MOA for 96% of the compounds, with a single misclassification of rifabutin, which was incorrectly categorized as affecting translation rather than transcription. The similar morphologies resulting from transcription and translation inhibition indicate a need for further refinement to distinguish them more effectively. Application of MycoBCP to a series of antitubercular agents successfully identified known MOAs and revealed unique effects, demonstrating its utility in early drug discovery and development. Our findings underscore the potential of CNN-based BCP to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MOA determination, particularly for challenging pathogens like M. tuberculosis . MycoBCP represents a significant advancement in TB drug development, offering a robust and adaptable method for high-throughput screening of antimicrobial compounds.",

These tasks require the models to generalize on distributions different from those from training data—which is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach OOD generalization remains an open and underexplored question. We examine OOD generalization in settings where instances are generated according to hidden rules, including in-context learning with symbolic reasoning. Models are required to infer the hidden rules behind input prompts without any fine-tuning. We empirically examined the training dynamics of Transformers on a synthetic example and conducted extensive experiments on a variety of pretrained LLMs, focusing on a type of component known as induction heads. We found that OOD generalization and composition are tied together—models can learn rules by composing two self-attention layers, thereby achieving OOD generalization. Furthermore, a shared latent subspace in the embedding (or feature) space acts as a bridge for composition by aligning early layers and later layers, which we refer to as the common bridge representation hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Free-electron radiation, such as Cherenkov radiation and transition radiation, can generate light at arbitrary frequencies and is fundamental to diverse applications, ranging from electron microscopy, spectroscopy, lasers, to particle detectors. Generally, the features of free-electron radiation are stochastic when electrons interact with random media. Counterintuitively, here, we reveal a type of free-electron radiation that has both its intensity and directionality invariant to specific sorts of long-range structural randomness. Essentially, this invariance is enabled by the Brewster effect and the judiciously engineered phase coherence condition of emitted light, namely that the light induced by electron’s penetration through a layered aperiodic nanostructure is engineered to interfere constructively at the Brewster angle. As such, when each constituent layer with a random thickness fulfills this phase coherence condition, there is always the emergence of free-electron resonance transition radiation at the Brewster angle. At this resonant Brewster angle, we further find that the radiation intensity and directionality could be enhanced by orders of magnitude by readily increasing the interface number. The revealed resonance transition radiation via long-range Brewster randomness may offer a feasible route to explore more enticing photonic applications driven by free electrons, such as light sources at previously unreachable spectral regimes, optical frequency combs, particle detectors, and random lasers.",

In response, plants deploy distinct yet interconnected mechanisms to cope with these facets of salinity stress. In this investigation, we observed a substantial overlap in the salt (NaCl)-induced transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis roots with those triggered by osmotic stress or the plant stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), as anticipated. Notably, a specific cluster of genes responded uniquely to sodium (Na + ) ions and are not regulated by the known monovalent cation sensing mechanism MOCA1 . Surprisingly, expression of sodium-induced genes exhibited a negative correlation with the ABA response and preceded the activation of genes induced by the osmotic stress component of salt. Elevated exogenous ABA levels resulted in the complete abolition of sodium-induced responses. Consistently, the ABA insensitive snrk2.2/2.3 double mutant displayed prolonged sodium-induced gene expression, coupled with increased root cell damage and root swelling under high salinity conditions. Moreover, ABA biosynthesis and signaling mutants were unable to redirect root growth to avoid high sodium concentrations and had increased sodium accumulation in the shoot. In summary, our findings unveil an unexpected and pivotal role for ABA signaling in mitigating cellular damage induced by salinity stress and modulating sodium-induced responses in plant roots.",

Although most biofilms are stationary, Flavobacterium johnsoniae forms a motile spherical biofilm called a zorb, which is propelled by its base cells and contains a polysaccharide core. Here, we report the formation of spatially organized, motile, multispecies biofilms, designated “co-zorbs,” that are distinguished by a core–shell structure. F. johnsoniae forms zorbs whose cells collect other bacterial species and transport them to the zorb core, forming a co-zorb. Live imaging revealed that co-zorbs also form in zebrafish, thereby demonstrating a different type of bacterial movement in vivo. This finding opens different avenues for understanding community behaviors, the role of biofilms in bulk bacterial transport, and collective strategies for microbial success in various environments.",

These aqueous droplets exhibit distinct freezing mechanisms and thermodynamic requirements compared to bulk water often forming metastable supercooled water at subzero temperatures on the Celsius scale (&lt;273 K) prior to crystallization. Here, we report on a real-time spectroscopic investigation combined with simultaneous visualizations of single aqueous droplet freezing events inside a cryogenically cooled ultrasonic levitation chamber with the ultimate goal of probing the molecular structure evolution and stages of ice formation. The observed droplet freezing follows a pseudoheterogeneous ice nucleation mechanism mimicking the process that occurs for atmospherically supercooled water droplets at the air–water interface. This proof-of-concept experimental setup allows future crystallization studies of homo- and heterogeneously doped aqueous droplets under simulated atmospheric environments—also in the presence of reactive trace gases, thus untangling dynamic molecular interactions and chemical reactions, which are of fundamental interest to low-temperature atmospheric chemistry delineating with ice nucleation mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Disinfectants are essential tools for controlling infectious diseases and maintaining sterile conditions in many medical and food-industry settings. Recent work revealed that a deficiency in the carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) confers pan-tolerance to killing by diverse disinfectant types through its interaction with the cAMP-CRP regulatory network. The present work characterized a pan-tolerance mutant obtained by enrichment using phenol as a lethal probe and an Escherichia coli PTS null mutant as a parental strain. The resulting super-pan-tolerant mutant, which harbored an F158C substitution in PheS, inhibited bacterial killing by multiple disinfectant classes with surprisingly little effect on antimicrobial lethality. The PheS substitution, which was expected to lower substrate recognition efficiency and result in deacylated tRNA phe occupying the ribosomal A site, activated relA expression and synthesis of ppGpp, even in the absence of disinfectant exposure. ppGpp, along with DksA, increased RpoS function by activating promoters of dsrA and iraP , two genes whose products increase the expression and stability of RpoS. Subsequently, RpoS upregulated the expression of genes encoding a universal stress protein (UspB) and an oxidative stress peroxidase (KatE), which preconditioned bacteria to better survive a variety of disinfectants. Disinfectant-mediated accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and bacterial killing were abolished/reduced by exogenous dimethyl sulfoxide and by a PheS F158C substitution up-regulating genes encoding ROS-detoxifying enzymes ( katE, sodA, oxyR, ahpC ). These data identify a pheS mutation-triggered, ppGpp-stimulated transcriptional regulatory cascade that negates biocide-mediated lethality, thereby tying the stringent response to protection from ROS-mediated biocide lethality.",

          "abstract": "Arousal refers to changes in brain-body state underpinning motivated behavior but lacks a proper definition and taxonomy. Neuroscience and psychology textbooks offer surprisingly different views on what arousal is, from a global brain-wide modulation of neuronal activity to a multidimensional construct, with specific brain-body patterns tuned to a given situation. The huge number of scientific articles mentioning arousal (~50,000) highlights the importance of the concept but also explains why such a vast literature has never been systematically reviewed so far. Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. We then ask whether domain-general arousal exists at the cortical level, and run meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature to reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a cortical network composed of the presupplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we find that activity in dysgranular insular area 7 (Jülich atlas), the region with the highest convergence across varieties of arousal, is also specifically associated with arousal. The domain-general arousal network might trigger the reorganization of large-scale brain networks—a global mechanism—resulting in a context-specific configuration—in line with the multidimensional view. Future taxonomies of arousal refining the alignment between concepts and data should include domain-general arousal as a central component.",

          "authors": "Marina Kniazeva, Gary Ruvkun",
          "abstract": "The Caenorhabditis elegans bZIP transcription factor ZIP-2 is activated by toxins or mutations that inhibit translational elongation. The zip-2 DNA-binding protein is encoded in a downstream main open reading frame (mORF), but under normal translation elongation conditions only an upstream overlapping oORF -1 frameshifted from mORF is translated. Mutations or toxins that slow translational elongation, but not inhibitors of translational initiation or termination, activate ZIP-2. An mORF initiation codon mutation does not disrupt the normal zip-2 response to translational elongation defects, suggesting that zip-2 activation does not depend on this ATG. An mORF early termination mutant can be activated by strong translation elongation inhibition, suggesting that translation initiated upstream on oORF +1 frameshifts when elongation is inhibited to the mORF reading frame downstream of the stop codon to activate a fused oORF/mORF ZIP-2 transcription factor. The protein and DNA sequences of zip-2 oORF and mORF are conserved across the Caenorhabditis , suggesting selection for particular codons sensitive to translational elongation defects. Mutations that disrupt the oORF initiation codon constitutively activate zip-2 , but not if the mORF initiation codon is also mutant, showing that zip-2 oORF competes with mORF for translational initiation. oORF initiation codon mutation-activated zip-2 slows C. elegans growth, and this slow growth is suppressed by a zip-2 null mutation. A zip-2 null mutant also strongly suppresses the growth arrest caused by translational elongation inhibitors. Thus, ZIP-2 is both a sensor of translational elongation attack, and a defense regulatory output via its activation of response genes.",

          "abstract": "In light of breakthroughs in superconductivity under high pressure, and considering that record critical temperatures (T c s) across various systems have been achieved under high pressure, the primary challenge for higher T c should no longer solely be to increase T c under extreme conditions but also to reduce, or ideally eliminate, the need for applied pressure in retaining pressure-induced or -enhanced superconductivity. The topological semiconductor Bi 0.5 Sb 1.5 Te 3 (BST) was chosen to demonstrate our approach to addressing this challenge and exploring its intriguing physics. Under pressures up to ~50 GPa, three superconducting phases (BST-I, -II, and -III) were observed. A superconducting phase in BST-I appears at ~4 GPa, without a structural transition, suggesting the possible topological nature of this phase. Using the pressure-quench protocol (PQP) recently developed by us, we successfully retained this pressure-induced phase at ambient pressure and revealed the bulk nature of the state. Significantly, this demonstrates recovery of a pressure-quenched sample from a diamond anvil cell at room temperature with the pressure-induced phase retained at ambient pressure. Other superconducting phases were retained in BST-II and -III at ambient pressure and subjected to thermal and temporal stability testing. Superconductivity was also found in BST with T c up to 10.2 K, the record for this compound series. While PQP maintains superconducting phases in BST at ambient pressure, both depressurization and PQP enhance its T c , possibly due to microstructures formed during these processes, offering an added avenue to raise T c . These findings are supported by our density-functional theory calculations.",

          "abstract": "Climate warming is increasing ocean stratification, which in turn should decrease the nutrient flux to the upper ocean. This may slow marine primary productivity, causing cascading effects throughout food webs. However, observing changes in upper ocean nutrients is challenging because surface concentrations are often below detection limits. We show that the nutricline depth, where nutrient concentrations reach well-detected levels, is tied to productivity and upper ocean nutrient availability. Next, we quantify nutricline depths from a global database of observed vertical nitrate and phosphate profiles to assess contemporary trends in global nutrient availability (1972–2022). We find strong evidence that the P-nutricline (phosphacline) is mostly deepening, especially throughout the southern hemisphere, but the N-nutricline (nitracline) remains mostly stable. Earth System Model (ESM) simulations support the hypothesis that reduced iron stress and increased nitrogen fixation buffer the nitracline, but not phosphacline, against increasing stratification. These contemporary trends are expected to continue in the coming decades, leading to increasing phosphorus but not nitrogen stress for marine phytoplankton, with important ramifications for ocean biogeochemistry and food web dynamics.",

The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer and plays a pivotal role in tumor suppression. RPRM is a target gene of p53 known to be involved in tumor suppression, but its molecular function has remained elusive. Here, we report that Reprimo (the protein product of RPRM ) is secreted and extrinsically induces apoptosis in recipient cells. We identified FAT1, FAT4, CELSR1, CELSR2, and CELSR3, members of the protocadherin family, as receptors for Reprimo. Subsequent analyses revealed that Reprimo acts upstream of the Hippo–YAP/TAZ–p73 axis and induces apoptosis by transactivating various proapoptotic genes. In vivo analyses further support the tumor-suppressive effects of secreted Reprimo. These findings identify the p53–Reprimo–Hippo–YAP/TAZ–p73 axis as an extrinsic apoptosis pathway that plays a crucial role in tumor suppression.

Performing the experiments as a function of temperature demonstrates that the G4 reshapes the underlying driving forces of protein folding.

          "abstract": "The seed is a landmark plant adaptation where the embryo is sheltered by a protective seed coat to facilitate dispersion. In Arabidopsis , the seed coat, derived from ovular integuments, plays a critical role in maintaining dormancy, ensuring germination occurs during a favorable season. Dormancy is enhanced by cold temperatures during seed development by affecting seed coat permeability through changes in apoplastic barriers. However, their localization and composition are poorly understood. This study identifies and investigates a polar barrier in the seed coat’s outer integument (oi1) cells. We present histological, biochemical, and genetic evidence showing that cold promotes polar seed coat lignification of the outer integument 1 (oi1) cells and suberization throughout the entire oi1 cell boundary. The polar oi1 barrier is regulated by the transcription factors MYB107 and MYB9. MYB107, in particular, is crucial for the lignified polar oi1 barrier formation under cold temperatures. The absence of the oi1 barrier in mutant seeds correlates with increased permeability and reduced dormancy. Our findings elucidate how temperature-induced modifications in seed coat composition regulate dormancy, highlighting the roles of suberin and lignin in this process.",

          "abstract": "Hemizygous genes, which are present on only one of the two homologous chromosomes of diploid organisms, have been mainly studied in the context of sex chromosomes and sex-linked genes. However, these genes can also occur on the autosomes of diploid plants due to structural variants (SVs), such as a deletion/insertion of one allele, and this phenomenon largely unexplored in plants. Here, we investigated the genomic and epigenomic landscapes of hemizygous genes across 22 genomes with varying propagation histories: eleven clonal lineages, seven outcrossed samples, and four inbred and putatively homozygous genomes. We identified SVs leading to genic hemizygosity. As expected, very few genes (0.01 to 1.2%) were hemizygous in the homozygous genomes, representing negative controls. Hemizygosity was appreciable among outcrossed lineages, averaging 8.7% of genes, but consistently elevated for the clonal samples at 13.8% genes, likely reflecting heterozygous SV accumulation during clonal propagation. Compared to diploid genes, hemizygous genes were more often situated in centromeric than telomeric regions and experienced weaker purifying selection. They also had reduced levels of expression, averaging ~20% of the expression levels of diploid genes, violating the evolutionary model of dosage compensation. We also detected higher DNA methylation levels in hemizygous genes and transposable elements, which may contribute to their reduced expression. Finally, expression profiles showed that hemizygous genes were more specifically expressed in contexts related to fruit development, organ differentiation, and stress responses. Overall, hemizygous genes accumulate in clonally propagated lineages and display distinct genetic and epigenetic features compared to diploid genes, shedding unique insights into genetic studies and breeding programs of clonal crops.",

          "abstract": "Human γD-crystallin, a monomeric protein abundant in the eye lens nucleus, must remain stably folded for an individual’s entire lifetime to avoid aggregation and protein deposition-associated cataract formation. γD-crystallin contains two homologous domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), which interact via a hydrophobic interface. Several familial mutations in the gamma crystallin gene are linked to congenital early-onset cataract, most of which affect the NTD. Some of these, including V75D and W42R, are known to populate intermediates under partially denaturing conditions possessing a natively folded CTD and a completely unfolded NTD. We employed hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe the structural and energetic features of variants of γD-crystallin under both native and partially denaturing conditions. For V75D and W42R, we identify a species under native conditions that retains partial structure in the NTD and is structurally and energetically distinct from the intermediate populated under partially denaturing conditions. Residues at the NTD–CTD interface play crucial roles in stabilizing this intermediate, and disruption of interface contacts either by amino acid substitution or partial denaturation permits direct observation of two intermediates simultaneously. These data suggest that the intermediate identified under native conditions is accessed from the native state and not on the folding pathway. The intermediate we have identified here exposes hydrophobic amino acids that are buried in both the folded full-length protein and in the protein’s stable isolated domains. Such nonnative exposure of a hydrophobic patch may play an important role in cataract formation.",

These groups—termed biofilms—can act as refuges from environmental disturbances and from biotic threats, including phages. Despite the ubiquity of temperate phages and bacterial biofilms, live propagation of temperate phages within biofilms has not been characterized on cellular spatial scales. Here, we leverage several approaches to track temperate phages and distinguish between lytic and lysogenic host infections. We determine that lysogeny within Escherichia coli biofilms initially occurs within a predictable region of cell group packing architecture on the biofilm periphery. Because lysogens are generally found on the periphery of large cell groups, where lytic viral infections also reduce local biofilm structural integrity, lysogens are predisposed to disperse into the passing liquid and are overrepresented in downstream biofilms formed from the dispersal pool of the original biofilm-phage system. Comparing our results with those for virulent phages reveals that temperate phages have unique advantages in propagating over long spatial and time scales within and among bacterial biofilms.",

          "abstract": "While the release of sterile males has been highly successful in suppressing some pest populations, it is impractical for many species due to the males disappearing after a single generation, necessitating large, repeated releases to maintain sufficient impact. Synthetic gene drives promise more efficient approaches since they can increase in frequency from rare, yet this also allows them to spread across a landscape, which may not always be desired. Between these two extremes are selectively neutral genetic constructs which persist at the frequency they are released, offering the potential for efficient suppression that remains localized. One way to achieve this would be to have perfect balance, at all construct frequencies, between gene drive increasing frequency and selection decreasing it. Here, we describe a way to closely approximate this balance using a toxin–antidote genetic construct that causes recessive lethality or sterility, encodes a genomic editor that makes dominant lethal or sterile edits in the genome, and provides protection against the action or consequences of the editing. Computer modeling shows that this design can be 100-fold more efficient than sterile males, increasing to 1,000-fold when released alongside a genetic booster. We describe designs for CRISPR-based molecular construction, including options that avoid using recoded genes as antidotes.",

          "abstract": "Inhibiting the androgen receptor (AR) is effective for treatment of advanced prostate cancers because of their AR-dependent luminal epithelial cell identity. Tumors progress during therapy to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by restoring AR signaling and maintaining luminal identity or by converting through lineage plasticity to a neuroendocrine (NE) identity or double-negative CRPC (DNPC) lacking luminal or NE identities. Here, we show that DNPC cells express genes defining basal, club, and hillock epithelial cells from benign prostate. We identified KLF5 as a regulator of genes defining this mixed basal, club, and hillock cell identity in DNPC models. KLF5-mediated upregulation of RARG uncovered a DNPC sensitivity to growth inhibition by retinoic acid receptor agonists, which down-regulated KLF5 and up-regulated AR. These findings offer CRPC classifications based on prostate epithelial cell identities and nominate KLF5 and RARG as therapeutic targets for CRPC displaying a mixed basal, club, and hillock identity.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how time perception adapts to cognitive demands remains a significant challenge. In some contexts, the brain encodes time categorically (as “long” or “short”), while in others, it encodes precise time intervals on a continuous scale. Although the ventral premotor cortex (VPC) is known for its role in complex temporal processes, such as speech, its specific involvement in time estimation remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated how the VPC processes temporal information during a time interval comparison task (TICT) and a time interval categorization task (TCT) in primates. We found a notable heterogeneity in neuronal responses associated with time perception across both tasks. While most neurons responded during time interval presentation, a smaller subset retained this information during the working memory periods. Population-level analysis revealed distinct dynamics between tasks: In the TICT, population activity exhibited a linear and parametric relationship with interval duration, whereas in the TCT, neuronal activity diverged into two distinct dynamics corresponding to the interval categories. During delay periods, these categorical or parametric representations remained consistent within each task context. This contextual shift underscores the VPC’s adaptive role in interval estimation and highlights how temporal representations are modulated by cognitive demands.",

          "abstract": "The two-line hybrid rice system, a cutting-edge hybrid rice breeding technology, has greatly boosted global food security. In thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines, the critical sterility-inducing temperature (CSIT; the temperature at which TGMS lines change from male fertile to complete male sterile) acts as a key threshold. We recently uncovered that thermo-sensitive genic male sterility 5 ( tms5 ), a sterile locus presenting in over 95% of TGMS lines, leads to the overaccumulation of 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (cP)-ΔCCA-tRNAs and a deficiency of mature tRNAs, which underlies the molecular mechanism of tms5 -mediated TGMS. However, there are a few reports on the regulatory mechanism controlling CSIT. Here, we identified a suppressor of tms5 , an amino acid substitution (T552I) in the rice Rqc2 (ribosome-associated quality control 2), increases the CSIT in tms5 lines through its C-terminal alanine and threonine modification (CATylation) activity. This substitution alters tRNA selectivity, leading to the recruitment of different tRNAs to the A-site of ribosome and CATylation rate by OsRqc2 during ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), a process that rescues stalled ribosomes and degrades abnormal nascent chains during translational elongation. Further, the mutation restores the levels of mature tRNA-Ser/Ile to increase the CSIT of tms5 lines. Our findings reveal the origin of overaccumulated cP-ΔCCA-tRNAs in tms5 lines, further deepening our understanding of the regulatory network in governing CSIT of TGMS lines containing tms5.",

          "abstract": "Plant cytokinesis requires coordination between the actin cytoskeleton, microtubules, and membranes to guide division plane formation and cell plate expansion; how these regulatory factors are coordinated remains unknown. The actin cytoskeleton assembly is controlled by several actin nucleation factors, such as the SCAR/WAVE complex, which regulates actin nucleation and branching through the activation of the ARP2/3 complex. The activity of these actin regulatory proteins is likely influenced by interactions with specific membranes; however, the molecular basis and the biological relevance of SCAR–membrane interactions are also unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the ER–PM tethering protein VAP27-1 directly interacts with SCAR2 at the ER membrane and that they colocalize to guide cell plate orientation during cell division. In the root meristem, both VAP27-1 and SCAR2 exhibit polarized localization at the cell plates, where the interaction between ER and PM is abundant. VAP27-1 recruits SCAR2 to the cell division plane, where there is a high concentration of actin filaments. In the vap27-1346 mutant, the densities of cortical ER, SCAR2, and consequently actin filaments are significantly reduced at the cell division plane, affecting cell plate orientation, cell division, and root development. A similar phenomenon is also observed in the scar1234 mutant, suggesting that VAP27 and SCAR proteins regulate cell division through a similar pathway. In conclusion, our data reveal a plant-specific function of VAP27-regulated ER–PM interaction and advance our understanding of plant ER–PM contact site and its role in cell division.",

          "abstract": "In most eukaryotic organisms, cells that rely on continuous cell division employ the enzyme telomerase which replenishes chromosome termini through the addition of telomeric repeats. In budding yeast, the telomerase holoenzyme is composed of a catalytic core associated with two regulatory subunits, Est1 and Est3. The Est1 protein binds a telomere-specific RPA-like complex to recruit telomerase to chromosome ends. However, the regulatory function of the Est3 subunit has remained elusive. We report here that an interaction between Est3 and the canonical RPA complex is required for in vivo telomerase function, as revealed by mutations in RPA2 that confer an Est (Ever shorter telomeres) phenotype, characteristic of a defect in the telomerase pathway. Binding between RPA and telomerase, which is supported by compensatory charge-swap mutations in EST3 and RPA2 , utilizes a surface on Est3 that is structurally analogous to an interface on the human TPP1 protein that is required for telomerase processivity. Mutations in a subset of conserved DNA contact residues in RPA also result in short telomeres and senescence, which we show is due to a requirement for DNA binding after RPA interacts with telomerase. We propose that once RPA forms a complex with telomerase, RPA utilizes a subset of DNA-binding domains to stabilize the interaction between the telomerase active site and telomeric substrates, thereby facilitating enzyme processivity. These results, combined with prior observations, show that yeast telomerase interacts with two different high-affinity ssDNA-binding complexes, indicating that management of single-stranded DNA is integral to effective telomerase function.",

We then examine the 14 C record of the past 2000 y in each of 18 watersheds where we find peaks ranging from ~800 to 770 CE to after European contact, with the majority, in the interior of the continent, declining ~1080 to 1300 CE.

Increasing evidence suggests that ACC can also act independently of ethylene to regulate various aspects of plant growth and development. Here, we explore the effects of ACC on Arabidopsis thaliana root growth and the mechanisms by which it acts. ACC inhibits growth of the primary root in Arabidopsis seedlings when ethylene signaling is blocked, which becomes evident after 36 h of treatment with ACC. This reduced root growth is in part the result of suppressed cell proliferation in the root meristem resulting from altered expression of a key regulator of stem cell niche activity, WOX5. ACC also promotes lateral root (LR) development, in contrast to ethylene, which inhibits LR formation. Transcriptomic analysis of roots revealed no significant changes in gene expression after 45 min or 4 h of ACC treatment, but longer treatment times revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes, including the downregulation of the expression of a small group of phylogenetically related CLE peptides. Reduced expression of these group 1 CLEs in response to ACC leads to the activation of a transcription factor, LBD18, which promotes LR development. These results suggest that ACC acts to modulate multiple aspects of Arabidopsis root growth independently of ethylene via distinct transcriptional effects in the root meristem and LR precursor cells.",

Here, we present the first comprehensive metatranscriptomic study of RNA viruses in Lake Nam Co, a high-altitude alkaline saline lake on the Tibetan Plateau. Using a combination of sequence- and structure-based homology searches, we identified 742 RNA virus species, including 383 novel genus-level groups and 84 novel family-level groups exclusively found in Lake Nam Co. These findings significantly expand the known diversity of the Orthornavirae , uncovering evolutionary adaptations such as permutated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motifs and distinct RNA secondary structures. Notably, 14 additional RNA virus families potentially infecting prokaryotes were predicted, broadening the known host range of RNA viruses and questioning the traditional assumption that RNA viruses predominantly target eukaryotes. The presence of auxiliary metabolic genes in viral genomes suggested that RNA viruses (families f . 0102 and Nam-Co_family_51) exploit host energy production mechanisms in energy-limited alpine lakes. Low nucleotide diversity, single nucleotide polymorphism frequencies, and pN/pS ratios indicate strong purifying selection in Nam Co viral populations. Our findings offer insights into RNA virus evolution and ecology, highlighting the importance of extreme environments in uncovering hidden viral diversity and further shed light into their potential ecological implications, particularly in the context of climate change.",

Although the biosynthetic pathways of ginkgolides have been partly uncovered, the mechanism regulating their biosynthesis is still largely unknown. Here, using multiomic and genetic analyses, we report the identification of a transcription factor, named ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH GINKGOLIDE BIOSYNTHESIS (GbEAG), as a critical regulator of ginkgolide biosynthesis. GbEAG is highly expressed in the roots of G. biloba, and its expression is significantly induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Ginkgolide content was significantly increased in roots by overexpressing GbEAG using a “cut-dip-regeneration” system. GbEAG positively regulates ginkgolide biosynthesis by directly binding to the GCC-boxes in the promoter regions of genes involved in the biosynthesis of ginkgolides, such as ISOPENTENYL DIPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE ( GbIDI ) and CYTOCHROME P450 7005C3 ( GbCYP7005C3 ). GbEAG mediates the jasmonic acid (JA)-activated ginkgolide synthesis through its direct interaction with the JASMONATE ZINC-FINGER INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM DOMAIN 3 (GbJAZ3) repressor. Importantly, we also found that the central light-response regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (GbHY5) mediates light induction of ginkgolide biosynthesis by binding to the G-box in the GbEAG promoter. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the coordinated regulation of ginkgolide biosynthesis via JA and light signals, with GbEAG as a central regulator in G. biloba, and shed light on the potential to develop ginkgolide-rich varieties through molecular breeding and gene editing.",

Here, we investigate four MIPs in a rodent malaria parasite for their role in transmission to and from the mosquito. We show by single and double gene deletions that SPM1 and TrxL1, MIPs associated with subpellicular microtubules, are dispensable for transmission from the vertebrate host to the mosquito and back. In contrast, FAP20 and FAP52, MIPs associated with the axonemes of gametes, are essential for transmission to mosquitoes but only if both genes are deleted. In the absence of both FAP20 and FAP52, the B-tubule of the axoneme partly detaches from the A-tubule, resulting in the deficiency of axonemal beating and hence gamete formation and egress. Our data suggest that a high level of redundancy ensures microtubule stability in the transmissive stages of Plasmodium , which is important for parasite transmission.",

However, most animals also have PKSs that do not conform to the rules described in microbes, including a large family of enzymes that bridge fatty acid and polyketide metabolism, the animal FAS-like PKSs (AFPKs). Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structures of two AFPKs from sea slugs. While the AFPK resemble mammalian FASs, their chemical products mimic those of PKSs in complexity. How then does the architecture of AFPKs facilitate this structural complexity? Unexpectedly, chemical complexity is controlled not solely by the enzymatic domains but is aided by the dynamics of the acyl carrier protein (ACP), a shuttle that moves intermediates between these domains. We observed interactions between enzyme domains and the linker-ACP domain, which, when manipulated, altered the kinetic properties of the enzyme to change the resulting chemical products.

          "abstract": "The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, or floral transition, is a tightly regulated, energy-demanding process. In Arabidopsis , the interplay of light perception and circadian rhythms detects changes in photoperiod length, accelerating flowering under long days (LD). CONSTANS (CO), a transcription factor, upregulates FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in leaves during dusk. The FT protein then moves to the shoot apical meristem, triggering the floral transition. While light and circadian signals control CO protein levels, less is known about how the nutrients/energy sensing regulates the photoperiod pathway for flowering modulation in this process. In our study, we identify the contribution of the Regulatory-associated protein of target of rapamycin 1B (RAPTOR1B), a component of the nutrient-sensing TOR complex (TORC), in the induction of specific flowering genes under CO control. While transcription of CO remains unaffected in raptor1b mutants, a reduction in its protein levels at dusk is observed compared to the wild type. Remarkably, the mutant also exhibits compromised GIGANTEA (GI) protein levels, crucial for CO stabilization during dusk. Our results indicate that the interaction and colocalization of RAPTOR1B with GI in the nucleus might influence GI levels through an unknown posttranscriptional mechanism. Genetic crosses position RAPTOR1B upstream of CO and GI. This is supported by phenotypic and molecular analyses. Our findings demonstrate that RAPTOR1B, likely as part of TORC, contributes to the photoperiod pathway of the flowering network, ensuring the timely initiation of floral transition under LD conditions.",

          "abstract": "The global extinction crisis is intensifying rapidly, driven by habitat loss, overexploitation, climate change, invasive species, and disease. This unprecedented loss of species not only threatens ecological integrity but also undermines ecosystem services vital for human survival. In response, many countries have set ambitious conservation targets such as halting species extinctions, yet the necessary financial commitments to achieve this are rarely prescribed. Estimating costs can be achieved using an ensemble of spatially variable species-specific cost models for threat abatement activities. We employ this method to provide a cost assessment to halt extinctions for Australia’s priority terrestrial and freshwater species. We show that it will cost ~AUD15.6 billion/year for 30 y to halt extinctions for these 99 priority species (comparable to 1% of Australia’s GDP). The more ambitious objectives to move priority species down one threat category (~AUD103.7 billion/year) or remove from the threatened species list entirely (~AUD157.7 billion/year) would require considerably more investment. Regardless of what is spent, we found that 16 (16%) priority species could not be removed from the threatened species list due to extensive historical declines and pervasive, ongoing, unmanageable threats, such as climate change. But implementing these efforts could ensure conservation benefits for over 43% of all nationally listed nonmarine threatened species. Adequate funding is crucial for meeting government commitments and requires both government leadership and private sector investment.",

Developing antibody drugs with broad-spectrum and high efficiency is a long-term task. It is promising but challenging to develop therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) through in vitro evolution based on antigen–antibody binding interactions. From an early B cell antibody repertoire, we isolated antibody 8G3 that retains its nonregressive neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1 and various other strains in vitro. 8G3 protected ACE2 transgenic mice from BA.1 and WA1/2020 virus infection without adverse clinical manifestations and completely cleared viral load in the lungs. Similar to most IGHV3–53 antibodies, the binding sites of 8G3 and ACE2 largely overlap, enabling competition with ACE2 for binding to RBD. By comprehensively considering the binding free energy changes of the antigen–antibody complexes, the biological environment of their interactions, and the evolutionary direction of the antibodies, we were able to select 50 mutants. Among them, 11 were validated by experiments showing better neutralizing activities. Further, a combination of four mutations were identified in 8G3 that increased its neutralization potency against JN.1, the latest Omicron mutant, by approximately 1,500-fold, and one of the mutations led to an improvement in activity against multiple variants to a certain extent. Together, we established a procedure of rapid selection of neutralizing antibodies with potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity. Our results provide a reference for engineering neutralizing antibodies against future SARS-CoV-2 variants and even other pandemic viruses.",

Loving-kindness meditation (LKM), a specific subtype of meditative practice, involves focusing one’s attention on thoughts of well-being for oneself and others. Meditation has been proven to be beneficial in a variety of settings, including therapeutic applications, but the neural activity underlying meditative practices and their positive effects are not well understood. It has been difficult to understand the contribution of deep limbic structures given the difficulty of studying neural activity directly in the human brain. Here, we leverage a unique patient population, epilepsy patients chronically implanted with responsive neurostimulation devices that allow chronic, invasive electrophysiology recording to investigate the physiological correlates of LKM in the amygdala and hippocampus of novice meditators. We find that LKM-associated changes in physiological activity were specific to periodic, but not aperiodic, features of neural activity. LKM was associated with an increase in γ (30 to 55 Hz) power and an alternation in the duration of β (13 to 30 Hz) and γ oscillatory bursts in both the amygdala and hippocampus, two regions associated with mood disorders. These findings reveal the nature of LKM-induced modulation of limbic activity in first-time meditators.",

          "abstract": "Perception and action are inherently entangled: our world view is shaped by how we explore our environment through complex and variable self-motion. Even when fixating stable stimuli, our eyes undergo small, involuntary movements. Fixational eye movements (FEM) render a stable world jittery on our retinae, which can be expected to harm neural coding. Yet, empirical evidence suggests that FEM help rather than harm human perception of fine detail. Here, we elucidate this paradox by uncovering under which conditions FEM improve or impair retinal coding and human acuity. We combine theory and experiment: model accuracy is directly compared to that of healthy human subjects in a visual acuity task. Acuity is modeled by applying an ideal Bayesian classifier to simulations of retinal spiking activity in the presence of FEM. In addition, empirical FEM are monitored using high-resolution eye-tracking by an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope. FEM introduce variability in retinal ganglion cell activity, but they also effectively preprocess inputs to facilitate retinal information encoding. Based on an interplay of these mechanisms, our model predicts a relation between visual acuity, FEM amplitude, and single-trial stimulus size that quantitatively accounts for experimental observations and captures the beneficial effect of FEM. Moreover, we observe that while human subjects’ FEM statistics vary with stimulus size, our model suggests that subjects’ FEM amplitude remains within a near-optimal range, where acuity is enhanced compared to much larger or smaller amplitudes. Overall, our findings indicate that perception benefits from action even at the fine spatiotemporal scale of FEM.",

          "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) are large intracellular macromolecular assemblies that play a critical role in cell polarization and migration. Talin serves as a direct connection between integrin receptor and actomyosin cytoskeleton within FAs. Talin contains three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) that engage discreetly during the development of FAs, thus acting as a critical player in FA initiation and maturation. However, the molecular basis of the ABS–F-actin interactions remains unknown. Here, we explore interactions of ABSs with F-actin to understand the multivalent behavior of talin. Particularly, the cryo-EM structure of the F-actin–ABS3 complex at 2.9 Å shows ABS3 spanning through two actin monomers along the filament axis, each occupied by the R13 rod subdomain and the DD domain. The dimerization of ABS3 occurs through the DD domain where both protomers interact on the actin surface, and the dimerization of talin to the actin surface is necessary for the engagement to F-actin. The R13 helical bundle is distorted upon binding to F-actin and releases the H1 helix from the rest of the bundle. This phenomenon has also been observed with other tension-sensing proteins like vinculin and α-catenin, highlighting that unfolding is relevant for its force sensing activity. On the contrary, ABS2 (R4R8 subdomains), which is thought to be critical for the maintenance of mature FAs, had multiple F-actin-binding regions within ABS2 and the binding likely occurred by these subdomains running through the surface of F-actin, thus strengthening the interactions upon the maturation of FAs.",

          "abstract": "HflX is a highly conserved ribosome-associated GTPase implicated in rescuing stalled ribosomes and mediating antibiotic resistance in several bacteria, including macrolide-lincosamide antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria. Mycobacterial HflXs carry a distinct N-terminal extension (NTE) and a small insertion, as compared to their eubacterial homologs. Here, we present several high-resolution cryo-EM structures of mycobacterial HflX in complex with the 70S ribosome and its 50S subunit, with and without antibiotics. These structures reveal a distinct mechanism for HflX-mediated ribosome splitting and antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria. Our findings indicate that the NTE of mycobacterial HflX induces persistent disordering of multiple 23S rRNA helices, facilitating the dissociation of the 70S ribosome and generating an inactive pool of 50S subunits. During this process, HflX undergoes a large conformational change that stabilizes its NTE. Mycobacterial HflX also acts as an anti-association factor by binding to predissociated 50S subunits. Our structures show that a mycobacteria-specific insertion in HflX reaches far into the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), such that it would overlap with the ribosome-bound macrolide antibiotics. However, in the presence of antibiotics, this insertion retracts, adjusts around, and interacts with the antibiotic molecules. These results suggest that mycobacterial HflX is agnostic to antibiotic presence in the PTC. It mediates antibiotic resistance by splitting antibiotic-stalled 70S ribosomes and inactivating the resulting 50S subunits.",

          "abstract": "Mec1 plays an essential role in both the DNA damage response and glucose starvation–induced autophagy. We recently reported that Mec1 regulates glucose starvation–induced autophagy through its direct binding to Atg13. However, the role of Mec1’s kinase activity in autophagy remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the kinase activity of Mec1 is required for glucose starvation–induced autophagy by regulating the phagophore assembly site (PAS) recruitment of Atg9 vesicles. Mechanistic and functional analyses identified Atg9 as a direct phosphorylation substrate of Mec1, with phosphorylation occurring at the S35, T203, and T243 sites. Mutations at these sites reduce the association of Atg9 with Atg17, Atg23, and Atg27, thereby impairing the PAS recruitment of Atg9 vesicles. Notably, we found that the Mec1–Atg13 binding is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation of Atg9 by Mec1. Furthermore, Mec1-mediated phosphorylation of Atg9 is also crucial for the PAS recruitment of Atg9 vesicles in response to DNA damage. We thus propose that Mec1’s kinase activity regulates the PAS recruitment of Atg9 vesicles by phosphorylating Atg9 in response to energy stress and DNA damage.",

However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power due to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations reveal a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, they appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude to those measured geodetically, thereby providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations.",

In obese mice lacking the endothelial adrenomedullin receptor, insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide–synthase activation and skeletal muscle perfusion were increased. Treating mice with adrenomedullin mimicked the effect of obesity and induced endothelial and systemic insulin resistance. Endothelial loss or blockade of the adrenomedullin receptor improved obesity-induced insulin resistance.

Here, we developed an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and revealed substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection.

          "abstract": "In many species with sex chromosomes, the Y is a tiny chromosome. However, the dioecious plant Silene latifolia has a giant ~550-megabase Y chromosome, which has remained unsequenced so far. We used a long- and short-read hybrid approach to obtain a high-quality male genome. Comparative analysis of the sex chromosomes with their homologs in outgroups showed that the Y is highly rearranged and degenerated. Recombination suppression between X and Y extended in several steps and triggered a massive accumulation of repeats on the Y as well as in the nonrecombining pericentromeric region of the X, leading to giant sex chromosomes. Using sex phenotype mutants, we identified candidate sex-determining genes on the Y in locations consistent with their favoring recombination suppression events 11 and 5 million years ago.",

          "abstract": "Antarctica is a vital component of Earth’s climate system, influencing global sea level, ocean circulation, and planetary albedo. Major knowledge gaps in critical processes—spanning the atmosphere, ocean, ice sheets, underlying beds, ice shelves, and sea ice—create uncertainties in future projections, hindering climate adaptation and risk assessments of ice intervention strategies. Antarctica’s ice sheet could contribute 28 centimeters to sea level by 2100, and potentially more if we surpass warming thresholds that trigger instabilities and rapid retreat. We review recent advances in understanding the changing stability of the ice sheet margins and identify key processes that require further research. Progress requires high-resolution satellite data, targeted field campaigns, improved modeling, and refined theory. Increased investment and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to uncovering Antarctica’s hidden processes and reducing uncertainties in future projections.",

To test hypotheses about their evolution, we sequenced the genome of Silene latifolia , in which giant heteromorphic sex chromosomes were first discovered in 1923. It has long been known that the Y chromosome consists mainly of a male-specific region that does not recombine with the X chromosome and carries the sex-determining genes and genes with other male functions. However, only with a whole Y chromosome assembly can candidate genes be validated experimentally and their locations determined and related to the suppression of recombination. We describe the genomic changes as the ancestral chromosome evolved into the current XY pair, testing ideas about the evolution of large nonrecombining regions and the mechanisms that created the present recombination pattern.",

Here, we report that dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control engages a retrograde (mitonuclear) signaling program that impairs cellular identity and maturity in β-cells, hepatocytes, and brown adipocytes. Targeted deficiency throughout the mitochondrial quality control pathway, including genome integrity, dynamics, or turnover, impaired the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, activating the mitochondrial integrated stress response, eliciting chromatin remodeling, and promoting cellular immaturity rather than apoptosis to yield metabolic dysfunction. Indeed, pharmacologic blockade of the integrated stress response in vivo restored β-cell identity following loss of mitochondrial quality control. Targeting mitochondrial retrograde signaling may therefore be promising in the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders.",

Although recent studies have suggested that phononic bandgaps complement the mantis shrimp’s defensive suite, direct experimental evidence for this mechanism has remained elusive. In this work, we explored the phononic properties of the mantis shrimp’s dactyl club using laser ultrasonic techniques and numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that the dactyl club’s periodic region functions as a dispersive, high-quality graded system, exhibiting Bloch harmonics, flat dispersion branches, ultraslow wave modes, and wide Bragg bandgaps in the lower megahertz range. These features effectively shield the shrimp from harmful high-frequency stress waves generated by cavitation bubble collapse events during impact.",

Evolutionary histories and functional ecology are well understood only for vertebrates, whereas research on invertebrates is largely limited to species descriptions and some studies on environmental tolerances. Knowledge on Antarctic vegetation cover showcases the challenges of characterizing population trends for most groups. Recent community-level microbial studies have provided insights into the functioning of life at its limits. Overall, biotic interactions remain largely unknown across all groups, restricted to basic information on trophic level placement. Insufficient knowledge of many groups limits the understanding of ecological processes on the continent. Remedies for the current situation rely on identifying the caveats of each ecological discipline and finding targeted solutions.

Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law.

In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.",

Animals can adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions, but the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We found that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning; instead, the learned behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over escape responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses.",

We elucidated a structural pathway of enzyme activation through cryo-EM analysis of PI3KC3-C1. The inactive conformation of the VPS15 pseudokinase stabilizes the inactive conformation, sequestering its N -myristate in the N-lobe of the pseudokinase. Upon activation, the myristate is liberated such that the VPS34 lipid kinase catalyzes PI3P production on membranes. The VPS15 pseudokinase domain binds tightly to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and stabilizes a web of interactions to autoinhibit the cytosolic complex and to promote the activation upon membrane binding. These findings show in atomistic detail how the VPS34 lipid kinase is activated in the context of a complete PI3K complex.",

This metabolic switch increased citrate-dependent histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferase KAT2A-ACLY interactions, at TEX signature genes while reducing acetate-dependent histone acetylation, dependent on p300-ACSS2 complexes, at effector and memory T cell genes. Nuclear ACSS2 overexpression or ACLY inhibition prevented TEX differentiation and enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses.

Previous assessments of temperature-related mortality, however, lack a comprehensive analysis of distinct impacts of temperature change across different timescales and characteristics. Using a longitudinal survey of 27,233 elderly Chinese citizens from 2005 to 2018, we establish connections between rising temperatures, temperature variability, and extreme heat with increased mortality risk, assessed through four annual metrics that combine temperature and humidity. The intensity and prolonged duration of extreme heat are found to have the greatest impact on mortality risk. Furthermore, by identifying heterogeneous impacts based on location, sex, age, obesity, income, and diet, we reveal the pathways through which temperature metrics are likely to influence mortality risk. Our study highlights the compound effects of rising temperatures for elderly populations, and it could be expanded to other countries and regions experiencing similar challenges due to an aging population experiencing warming conditions.",

Antimicrobial peptides are a potential solution to combat bacterial resistance, but the design of self-assembled nanopeptides with dual functions of cell penetration and antibacterial properties to combat intracellular bacteria remains a challenge. Here, we propose a strategy to develop self-assembled nanopeptides with dual functions through the chimerization of self-assembled core, hydrophobic motif, and cell-permeable unit. The optimal nanopeptides, F3FT and N3FT, exhibited potent antibacterial activity and excellent biocompatibility. Crucially, F3FT and N3FT are able to efficiently penetrate cells and eliminate intracellular bacteria and sniping inflammation. Moreover, F3FT and N3FT kill bacteria mainly by disrupting bacterial cell membranes and inducing excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species. F3FT and N3FT have exhibited good safety and potent therapeutic potential in vivo. This scheme of constructing nanopeptides through multifunctional domains design provides a paradigm for dealing with escalating of intracellular bacteria and antimicrobial resistance.",

Here, we propose a compact reconfigurable neuron design using the intrinsic dynamics of a NbO 2 -based spiking unit and excellent tunability in an electrochemical memory (ECRAM) to emulate the fast-slow dynamics in a bio-plausible neuron. The resistance of the ECRAM was effective in tuning the temporal dynamics of the membrane potential, contributing to flexible reconfiguration of various bio-plausible firing modes, such as phasic and burst spiking, and exhibiting adaptive spiking behaviors in changing environment. We used the bio-plausible neuron model to build spiking neural networks with bursting neurons and demonstrated improved classification accuracies over simplified models, showing great promises for use in more bio-plausible neuromorphic computing systems.",

Although Bayesian inference serves as an abstract framework of cortical computation, precisely mapping concrete instantiations of computational models to biology under real-world tasks is necessary to produce falsifiable neural models. On the basis of a recent generative model, recursive cortical networks, that demonstrated excellent performance on vision benchmarks, we derive a theoretical cortical microcircuit by placing the requirements of the computational model within biological constraints. The derived model suggests precise algorithmic roles for the columnar and laminar feed-forward, feedback, and lateral connections, the thalamic pathway, blobs and interblobs, and the innate lineage-specific interlaminar connectivity within cortical columns. The model also explains several visual phenomena, including the subjective contour effect and neon-color spreading effect, with circuit-level precision. Our model and methodology provides a path forward in understanding cortical and thalamic computations.",

Although nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods such as t -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t -SNE) have been developed, their implementation in simple biological circuits remains unclear. Here, we develop a biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithm compatible with t -SNE, which uses a simple three-layer feedforward network mimicking the Drosophila olfactory circuit. The proposed learning rule, described as three-factor Hebbian plasticity, is effective for datasets such as entangled rings and MNIST, comparable to t -SNE. We further show that the algorithm could be working in olfactory circuits in Drosophila by analyzing the multiple experimental data in previous studies. We lastly suggest that the algorithm is also beneficial for association learning between inputs and rewards, allowing the generalization of these associations to other inputs not yet associated with rewards.",

DMS is a particle method that uses quantum mechanically derived interaction potentials to simulate molecular collisions within a flow field. Since these interaction potentials are the only modeling inputs used in the simulation, all flow features can solely be attributed to the ab initio potential energy surfaces. Hence, providing a comparison of a hypersonic ground test and numerical data anchored to quantum mechanics. The fundamental nature of DMS is leveraged to investigate molecular level mechanisms prevalent in the flow, and comparisons with lower fidelity simulations are presented to highlight the role of these first principles calculations as benchmark solutions.",

Despite the presence of LD-loaded macrophages in many tissues, including the brain, their contribution to neurodegenerative disorders remains elusive. This study investigated the role of lipid metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by assessing the contribution of LD-loaded brain macrophages, including microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs), in an AD mouse model. Particularly, BAMs and activated CD11c + microglia localized near β amyloid (Aβ) plaques exhibited a pronounced lipid-associated gene signature and a high LD load. Having observed that elevated intracellular LD content correlated inversely with microglial phagocytic activities, we subsequently inhibited LD formation specifically in CX3CR1 + brain macrophages using an inducible APP-KI/ Fit2 i Δ M φ transgenic mouse model. We demonstrated that reducing LD content in microglia and CX3CR1 + BAMs remarkably improved their phagocytic ability. Furthermore, lowering microglial LDs consistently enhanced their efferocytosis capacities and notably reduced Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma. Therefore, mitigating LD accumulation in brain macrophages provides perspectives for AD treatment.",

Two hallmarks of efficiency, Menzerath’s law and Zipf’s law of abbreviation, predict that longer sequences will consist of shorter elements and more frequent elements will be shorter, respectively. Here, we assessed the evidence for both laws in cetaceans by analyzing vocal sequences from 16 baleen and toothed whale species and comparing them to 51 human languages. Eleven whale species exhibit Menzerath’s law, sometimes with greater effect sizes than human speech. Two of the five whale species with categorized element types exhibit Zipf’s law of abbreviation. On average, whales also tend to shorten elements and intervals toward the end of sequences, although this varies by species. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the vocalizations of many cetacean species have undergone compression for increased efficiency in time.",

          "abstract": "Cells sense and integrate multiple signals to coordinate a response. A receptor-kinase signaling pathway for plant stomatal development shares components with the immunity pathway. The mechanism ensuring their signal specificities remains unclear. Using chemical genetics, here, we report the identification of a small molecule, kC9, that triggers excessive stomatal differentiation by inhibiting the canonical ERECTA pathway. kC9 binds to and inhibits the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK6, perturbing its substrate interaction. Notably, activation of immune signaling by a bacterial flagellin peptide nullified kC9’s effects on stomatal development. This cross-regulation depends on the immune receptor FLS2 (FLAGELLIN SENSING 2) and occurs even in the absence of kC9 if the ERECTA family receptor population becomes suboptimal. Proliferating stomatal lineage cells are vulnerable to this immune signal penetration. Our findings suggest that the signal specificity between development and immunity can be ensured by mitogen-activated protein kinase homeostasis, reflecting the availability of upstream receptors, thereby providing an unanticipated view on signal specificity.",

          "abstract": "Metamorphosis is an important way for insects to adapt to the environment. In this process, larval tissue destruction regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and adult tissue reconstruction regulated by insulin-like peptides (ILPs) occur simultaneously, but the detailed mechanism is still unclear. Here, the results of succinylome, subcellular localization, and protein interaction analysis show that non-succinylated insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) localizes in the cytoplasm, binds to insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2-like), and degrades it. When the metamorphosis is initiated, 20E up-regulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A ( Cpt1a ) through transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), thus increasing the level of IDE succinylation on K179. Succinylated IDE translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus, combined with ecdysone receptor to promote 20E signaling pathway, causing larval tissue destruction, while IGF-2-like was released to promote adult tissue proliferation. That is, succinylation alters subcellular localization of IDE so that it can bind to different target proteins and act as a hub of metamorphosis.",

          "abstract": "Nucleosomes at promoters of active genes are marked by specific histone post-translational modifications and histone variants. These features are thought to promote the formation and maintenance of an “open” chromatin environment that is suitable for transcription. However, recent reports have drawn conflicting conclusions about whether these histone modifications depend on active transcription. To further interrogate this relationship, we inhibited transcription initiation using triptolide, which triggered degradation of RNA polymerase II, and examined the impact on histone modifications. Transcription initiation was not required for either hormone-induced or steady-state active histone modifications at transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. Rather, blocking transcription initiation increased the levels of histone acetylation and H2AZ incorporation at active TSSs. P300 activity was dispensable for this effect, but inhibition of histone deacetylases masked the increased acetylation. Together, our results demonstrate that active histone modifications occur independently of transcription.

          "abstract": "The collisionless plasmas in space and astrophysical environments are intrinsically multiscale in nature, behaving as conducting fluids at macroscales and kinetically at microscales comparable to ion and/or electron gyroradii. A fundamental question in understanding the plasma dynamics is how energy is transported and dissipated across scales. Here, we present spacecraft measurements in the terrestrial foreshock, a region upstream of the bow shock where the solar wind population coexists with the reflected ions. In this region, the fluid-scale, ultralow-frequency waves resonate with the reflected ions to modify the velocity distributions, which in turn cause the growth of the ion-scale, magnetosonic-whistler waves. The latter waves then resonate with the electrons, and the accelerated electrons contribute to the excitation of electron-scale, high-frequency whistler waves. These observations demonstrate that the chain of wave-particle resonances is an efficient mechanism for cross-scale energy transfer, which could redistribute the kinetic energy and accelerate the particles upstream of the shocks.",

          "abstract": "The mechanism for neurological deficits from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is unclear. In a series of 150 patients with CO poisoning, we found marked elevations of blood-borne inflammatory filamentous (F-) actin–coated microparticles (MPs), neutrophil activation, and a 90% reduction in the normal level of plasma gelsolin (pGSN), a protein capable of lysing F-actin–coated MPs. This led to studies in a murine model where the same events occur and cause neuroinflammation with cognitive dysfunction. All events are recapitulated when F-actin MPs are injected intravenously, which establishes a blood-to-brain-to-blood inflammatory cycle that persists for weeks. All changes, including cognitive dysfunction, can be abrogated by an injection of human recombinant pGSN within 2 weeks after CO poisoning. These findings demonstrate that CO-induced neurological injury has an inflammatory etiology. Because of MP-mediated communications between the brain and systemic circulation, CO-induced cognitive deficits may be reversible with a pharmaceutical intervention.",

In low-CO 2 scenarios (1.5° and 2°C warming pathways), the suppressive effect of sulfate deposition on wetland methane emissions largely diminishes by 2100 due to clean air policies, with resulting emission increases (7 ± 2 Tg a −1 ) being 35 and 22% of total wetland emission changes.

Furthermore, most systems have carrier mean free paths l mfp shorter than their spin moiré lattice constant a spin , inhibiting miniband formation. Here, we discover that the layered magnetic semimetal EuAg 4 Sb 2 overcomes these challenges by forming an interface with J ~ 100 milli–electron volts transferred between a Eu triangular lattice and anionic Ag 2 Sb bilayers hosting a two-dimensional electron band in the ballistic regime ( l mfp &gt;&gt; a spin ). The system realizes an SMS with a spin commensurate with the Fermi momentum, leading to a marked quenching of the transport response from miniband formation.

Besides, materials require combinations of performance such as load bearing and energy dissipation. However, improving one performance of a material often sacrifices another performance, making it difficult to create materials with optimal performance profiles. Here we report a liquid-infused porous piezoelectric scaffold (LIPPS) that simultaneously enhances its load-bearing and energy dissipation capability under cyclic loading. For example, after 12 million loading cycles, LIPPS increases its modulus by 3600% and hysteresis by 3000%. From a CT study, this behavior is attributed to the self-recoverable mineralization under mechanical loading. Moreover, LIPPS shows a reprogrammable stiffness distribution based on the loading distribution, which enables the material to generate multiple shapes by self-folding. Our findings can contribute toward unprecedented opportunities in soft robotics, vehicles, infrastructure, and tissue engineering and contribute to the new paradigm of material selection with improved resilience and sustainability.",

Dinoflagellates play pivotal roles in marine ecosystems, particularly as major contributors of harmful algal blooms. Despite vital roles of cysts in blooming cycles and dinoflagellate ecology, the molecular processes controlling cyst dormancy have largely remained unexplored due to technological difficulties. Using DinoSL as a dinoflagellates-specific mRNA “hook” and SMRT sequencing, we analyzed metatranscriptomes of sediment-buried dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. The data show that most major metabolic and regulatory pathways, except photosynthesis, were transcriptionally active. This suggests the crucial importance of broad metabolic pathways in sustaining cyst viability and germination potential. Further expression analyses of 11 genes (relevant to autophagy and phytohormone gibberellin), lysosome/autolysosome staining, and germination experiments revealed vital roles of autophagy in energy generation, nutrient recycling, and of phytohormones abscisic acid/gibberellin in modulating dormancy/germination of resting cysts.

Both scaffolds can independently recruit PCM proteins, but both are required for proper centrosome assembly, with the Cnn scaffold providing mechanical strength, and the TACC scaffold concentrating centriole and centrosome proteins. Recruiting Spd-2 to synthetic beads injected into early embryos reconstitutes key aspects of mitotic centrosome assembly on the bead surface, and this depends on Spd-2’s ability to recruit Polo and Aurora A.

Mechanistic models fit under a Bayesian framework, which enabled joint inference from serological and molecular data, showed that common vampire bats maintain BIV independently of the now assumed fruit bat reservoir through immune waning and seasonal transmission pulses. A large-scale vampire bat cull targeting rabies incidentally halved BIV transmission, confirming vampire bats as maintenance hosts.

However, achieving a rapid update rate with submicrometer precision remains a challenge for FMCW LIDARs. Here, we present such a LIDAR with a sub–10-nanometer precision and a 24.6-kilohertz update rate by combining a broadband Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser with a silicon nitride soliton microcomb. An ultrahigh-frequency chirp rate up to 320 petahertz per second is linearized by a 50-gigahertz microcomb to reach this performance. Our theoretical analysis also contributes to resolving the challenge of FMCW velocity measurements with nonlinear frequency sweeps and enables us to realize velocity measurement with an uncertainty below 0.4 millimeter per second.

Here, we use Titan’s measured departure from its expected rotation state to infer k 2 /Q and its boundary layer dissipation parameter K/C s . Over the likely range of ocean and ice shell thicknesses, we infer a K / C s of 6.3 × 10 −14 s −1 to 2.4 × 10 −10 s −1 , a k 2 /Q of 0.058 to 0.12, and a minimum dissipation factor Q ≈ 5 . Titan’s dissipation parameters are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the Moon’s and suggest an interior with a low effective viscosity. Titan’s dissipation rate implies that its eccentricity and inclination are damping rapidly, consistent with an excitation within the last ~350 Myr.

Here, we developed a down-converting near-infrared IIb (NIR-IIb; 1500 to 1700 nanometers) luminescent, pure NaErF 4 @NaYF 4 rare-earth nanoparticle (pEr) as vaccine carriers. The pEr nanoparticles were coated with three layers of cross-linked biocompatible polymers (pEr-P 3 ; ~55 nanometers) and conjugated to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. Upon subcutaneous injection of the pEr-P 3 -RBD nanovaccine in mice, in vivo NIR-IIb imaging revealed active vaccine trafficking and migration to lymph nodes through lymphatic vessels. Two doses of the adjuvant-free vaccine elicited long-lasting (&gt;7 months) high titers of serum viral neutralization antibody and anti-RBD immunoglobulin G, along with robust RBD-specific germinal center B cells and T follicular helper cells. We devised in vivo NIR-II molecular imaging of RBD-specific cells in lymph nodes, opening noninvasive assessments of vaccine-elicited immune responses longitudinally.",

The peptides generated by our pipeline have lower similarity and identity than those of other reported methodologies. Among the 40 peptides synthesized for an experimental validation, 25 exhibit either antibacterial or antifungal activity. AMP-29 shows selective antifungal activity against Candida glabrata and in vivo antifungal efficacy in a murine skin infection model.

In this work, we present real-time in situ electrical monitoring of the full rotation dynamics of a single aromatic chain covalently embedded in graphene electrodes with single-event resolution. We reveal that the dynamic process of phenyl ring rotations at low temperature is dominated by quantum rotation tunneling rather than the quasi-free rotation process. The emergent complexity of different intramolecular rotations in a single aromatic molecule is demonstrated, including the alternating unidirectional rotation with multi-, single-, and half-circle delays driven by inelastic electron tunneling, which has not been previously adequately considered at the macroscopic level. This work builds a bridge between macroscopic and microscopic worlds and improves our understanding of structure-activity relationships, potentially bringing different functions to ordinary materials.",

Analysis of cod otoliths recovered during archaeological excavations of Icelandic fish processing sites revealed that cod in the 10th to 12th centuries were 25% larger and up to 300% older than modern, despite slower density-dependent growth rates attributed to the sixfold increase in abundance. Fishing mortality came to dominate a time-invariant natural mortality rate and other population characteristics after the 14th century, with minimal evidence of environmental effects at the century scale. Despite the absence of catch records and surveys, biological reference points based on pristine fish populations are now possible where otolith collections are available.",

These von Willebrand factor–bound platelets specifically recruit neutrophils in a manner that is dependent on platelet-activated α IIb β 3 , neutrophil SLC44A2, and endothelial P-selectin. The interaction of SLC44A2 with activated α IIb β 3 promotes formation of prothrombotic neutrophil extracellular traps.

Our simulations, which inject up to 400 million tons of dust into the stratosphere, show marked disruptions in climate, atmospheric chemistry, and global photosynthesis. Global mean temperatures are projected to drop by 4°C, and global precipitation decreases by 15% in our simulations. The largest relative reductions in global terrestrial and marine net primary productivity reach 36 and 25%, respectively.

It establishes that CO 2 adsorption is the rate-determining step regardless of cation type or surface structure. Density functional theory calculations show that electron transfer occurs to a solvated CO 2 -cation complex. A more positive potential of zero charge enhances CO 2 R activity only on Au with similar surface coordination. The symmetry factor (β) of the rate-determining step varies with surface structure and cation identity, with density functional theory calculations indicating β’s sensitivity to surface and double-layer structures. These findings emphasize the importance of both surface and double-layer structures in understanding cation effects on CO 2 R.",

Imp and Syp bind a highly overlapping set of conserved mRNAs encoding proteins involved in neurodevelopment. We identify transcripts differentially occupied by Imp/Syp over time, featuring a network of known and previously unknown candidate temporal regulators that are post-transcriptionally regulated by Imp/Syp. Furthermore, the physical and coevolutionary relationships between Imp and Syp binding sites reveal a combinatorial, rather than competitive, mode of molecular interplay.

We discovered that restoration of mTOR signaling was the early dominant driver of resistance to Akt inhibition. Mechanistically, this can be achieved through molecular alterations, resulting in loss of negative regulators of mTOR. Unexpectedly, we discovered that this was dominated by restoration of mTOR signaling through the nutrient sensing arm. This can be achieved by loss of the components of the GATOR/KICSTOR complexes or through cellular processes, leading to the recycling of amino acids.

In this study, we use magmatic iron meteorites to reconstruct the MVE inventory of the earliest inner [noncarbonaceous (NC)] and outer [carbonaceous (CC)] Solar System planetesimals. We show that several NC and CC iron meteorite parent bodies (IMPBs) exhibit chondrite-like MVE abundances, indicating that “first-generation” inner Solar System planetesimals were remarkably MVE rich. Consistent with isotopic signatures of MVEs in Earth and Mars, these planetesimals made a substantial contribution to the MVE inventories of terrestrial planets. Variations in MVE abundances among IMPBs, particularly the two volatile-depleted NC and CC IMPBs (IVA and IVB), reflect secondary volatile loss after disruption of their parent bodies. Consequently, MVE depletion in terrestrial planets is more closely linked to the protracted history of MVE loss during planetesimal collisions rather than incomplete condensation or MVE loss during planetesimal differentiation.",

Here, we reveal that Arabidopsis KNL1 regulates SAC silencing through the direct recruitment of type one protein phosphatase (TOPP) to kinetochores. We show that KNL1 interacts with all nine TOPPs via a conserved RVSF motif in its N terminus, and this interaction is required for the proper localization of TOPPs to kinetochores during mitosis. Disrupting KNL1-TOPP interaction leads to persistent SAC activation, resulting in a severe metaphase arrest and defects in plant growth and development.

          "abstract": "Over past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across physics communities, as it offers a new paradigm beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial based on conflicting numeric results. In our work, we demonstrate that an anomalous logarithmic behavior in the entanglement entropy (EE) persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. On the basis of quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE on SU( N ) DQCP spin models, we show that for a series of N smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists, which implies that previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when N ≥ N c with an N c we evaluate to lie between 7 and 8, DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory.",

          "abstract": "The DNA damage response in mycobacteria is controlled by the heterodimeric transcription factor PafBC, a member of the WYL domain–containing protein family. It has been shown that PafBC induces transcription of its regulon by reprogramming the housekeeping RNA polymerase holoenzyme to recognize PafBC-dependent promoters through sigma adaptation. However, the mechanism by which DNA damage is sensed and translated into PafBC activation has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the binding of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to the WYL domains of PafBC activates the transcription factor. Our cryo–electron microscopy structure of full-length PafBC in its active conformation, bound to the transcription initiation complex, reveals a previously unknown mode of interaction between the ssDNA and the WYL domains. Using biochemical experiments, we show that short ssDNA fragments bind to PafBC dynamically, resulting in deactivation as ssDNA levels decrease postrepair. Our findings shed light on the mechanism linking DNA damage to PafBC activation and expand our understanding of WYL domain–containing proteins.",
