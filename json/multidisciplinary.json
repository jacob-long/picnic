          "abstract": "N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory neurotransmission throughout the brain1. As obligate heterotetramers, their activation requires the binding of both glycine and glutamate2. Although recent structural studies have provided insights into endogenous receptors from select brain regions3, most previous work has relied on recombinant receptors and engineered constructs, which limits our understanding of native NMDARs across the whole brain. Here we identify and resolve ten distinct native NMDAR assemblies from the whole-brain tissue of female C57BL/6 mice using immunoaffinity purification, single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. Analyses of the GluN1–GluN2A(S1), GluN1–GluN2A(S2), GluN1–GluN2A(S3), GluN1–GluN2B, GluN1–GluN2A–GluN2B(S1), GluN1–GluN2A–GluN2B(S2), GluN1–GluN2A–GluNX(S1), GluN1–GluN2A–GluNX(S2), GluN1–GluN2B–GluNX and GluN1–GluNX structures reveal that GluN2A is the most prevalent subunit across assemblies. Moreover, the substantial conformational flexibility observed in the GluN2A amino-terminal domain may explain its fast kinetics and dominant role in gating. Dynamic movements of S-ketamine were also captured at the channel vestibule, as was pore dilation in both the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of a native GluN1–GluN2B receptor. The latter observation represents a previously unknown fully open state of NMDAR. Our large collection of heterogeneous NMDAR structures from whole brain reveals previously unrecognized properties of conformational diversity and channel dilation.",

          "abstract": "The exceptionally low-energy isomeric transition in 229Th at around 148.4 nm (refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6) offers a unique opportunity for coherent nuclear control and the realization of a nuclear clock7,8. Recent advances, most notably the incorporation of large ensembles of 229Th nuclei in transparent crystals6,9,10,11 and the development of pulsed vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lasers12,13,14, have enabled initial laser spectroscopy of this transition15,16,17. However, the lack of an intense, narrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation8,18. Here we introduce and report a continuous-wave (CW) laser at 148.4 nm, generated by means of four-wave mixing (FWM)19 in cadmium vapour. The source delivers more than 100 nW of power with a projected linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength tunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth over all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm (refs. 12,13,14,20). We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique that places a stringent upper bound on FWM-induced phase noise, thereby supporting the feasibility of sub-hertz VUV linewidths. Our work addresses the central challenge towards a 229Th-based nuclear clock and establishes a widely tunable, ultranarrow-linewidth laser platform for potential applications across quantum information science21,22,23,24, condensed-matter physics25 and high-resolution VUV spectroscopy26.",

          "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) makes use of the principles of quantum mechanics to enable provably secure communication1,2. One substantial challenge persists in building large-scale QKD networks with many clients over long communication distances3. Although quantum relays continue to pose practical difficulties4, existing trusted-node networks5,6,7,8,9, point-to-multipoint networks10,11 and wavelength-multiplexed entanglement networks12,13 encounter issues such as reliance on trusted intermediaries or limited distances. Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) provides a compelling architecture that can overcome those issues while enhancing communication distance14. Although long-distance point-to-point TF-QKD has been achieved15,16,17,18,19,20,21, realizing large-scale networks requires scalable quantum devices. Here we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of an integrated-photonics TF-QKD network with exceptional scalability and reliability. This network includes 20 independent client-side QKD transmitter chips with one server-side optical microcomb chip. The microcomb generates a broad range of ultralow-noise coherent frequency combs with Hz-level linewidths, which serve as seeds and references for all client chips. Each client chip regenerates ultralow-noise light phase-locked to microcombs and prepares quantum keys. We sequentially implement pairwise QKD across 20 client chips through ten wavelength-multiplexed channels, with each surpassing the repeaterless bound at 370 km in spooled fibre, achieving a networking capability (client pairs × communication distance) of 3,700 km. We further demonstrate the wafer-scale reproducibility of both server-side microcomb chips and client-side QKD transmitter chips, together establishing system-level scalability. Combining mass-manufacturability, cost-effectiveness and high scalability of integrated photonics with long-distance quantum communication represents a viable path to large-scale quantum networks.",

          "abstract": "Inhibitory receptors like PD-1 and CTLA-4 contribute to T cell dysfunction in cancer1,2,3. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking the interactions in trans of these receptors with their ligands on cancer cells or in the tumour microenvironment lead to clinical responses in some but not all types of cancer. Signalling lymphocytic activation molecule 6 (SLAMF6, also known as Ly108) is a homotypic receptor preferentially expressed on progenitor or stem-like exhausted T (Tpex) cells, but not on terminally exhausted T (Tex) cells, as demonstrated in mouse models4,5,6,7,8,9. In contrast to Tex cells, Tpex cells retain the capacity for functional restoration after immune checkpoint blockade10,11,12. The role of SLAMF6 in T cells remains ambiguous, as it has both activating and inhibitory effects, complicating its evaluation as a therapeutic target. Here we find that SLAMF6 was triggered in cis by homotypic interactions at the T cell surface. These interactions elicited inhibitory effects that suppressed activation of T cells and limited anti-tumour immunity, independently of SLAMF6 expression on tumour cells. mAbs against human SLAMF6 with a robust ability to disrupt the cis interactions strongly augmented T cell activation, reduced the proportions of exhausted T cells and inhibited tumour growth in vivo. Collectively, these findings show that SLAMF6 functions exclusively as a T cell inhibitory receptor, which is triggered by cis homotypic interactions. They also position SLAMF6 as a promising target for therapies aimed at enhancing anti-tumour immunity, regardless of SLAMF6 expression on tumour cells.",

Fear memory and extinction are underpinned by neural representations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) 1–7 , but the contribution of non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes, to these processes remains unresolved. Here, using in vivo calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging and causal astrocyte manipulations, we find that BLA astrocytes dynamically track fear state and support fear memory retrieval and extinction. By combining astrocyte manipulations with in vivo BLA neuronal Ca 2+ imaging and electrophysiological recordings, we show that astrocyte Ca 2+ signalling enables neuronal encoding of fear memory retrieval and extinction, and readout through a BLA–prefrontal circuit. Our findings reveal a key role for astrocytes in the generation and adaptation of fear-state-related neural representations, revising neurocentric models of critical amygdala-mediated adaptive functions.",

          "abstract": "Identifying a catalyst class to optimize the enantioselectivity of a new reaction, either involving a different combination of known substrate types or an entirely unfamiliar class of compounds, is a formidable challenge. Statistical models trained on a reported set of reactions can help predict out-of-sample transformations1–5 but often face two challenges: (1) only sparse data are available i.e., limited information on catalyst–substrate interactions, and (2) simple stereoelectronic parameters may fail to describe mechanistically complex transformations.6,7 Here we report a descriptor generation strategy that accounts for changes in the enantiodetermining step with catalyst or substrate identity, allowing us to model reactions involving distinct ligand and substrate types. As validating case studies, we collected data on enantioselective nickel-catalyzed C(sp3)-couplings8 and trained statistical models with features extracted from the transition states and intermediates proposed to be involved in asymmetric induction. These models allow for the optimization of poorly performing examples reported in a substrate scope and are applicable to unseen ligands and reaction partners. This approach offers the opportunity to streamline catalyst and reaction development, quantitatively transferring knowledge learned on sparse data to novel chemical spaces.",

          "abstract": "Mpox, caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV; Orthopoxvirus monkeypox ), is on the rise in West and Central Africa 1–3 . African rodents, especially squirrels, are suspected to be involved in MPXV emergence, but no evidence of a direct transmission to humans or non-human primates has been established 4–9 . Here we describe an outbreak of MPXV in a group of wild sooty mangabeys ( Cercocebus atys ) in Taï National Park (Côte d’Ivoire). The outbreak affected one-third of the group, killing four infants. To track its origin, we analysed rodents and wildlife carcasses from the region. We identified a MPXV-infected fire-footed rope squirrel ( Funisciurus pyrropus ), found dead 3 km from the mangabey territory 12 weeks before the outbreak. MPXV genomes from the squirrel and the mangabey were nearly identical. A video record from 2014 showed a mangabey from this group eating the same squirrel species and diet metabarcoding of faecal samples collected from mangabeys before the outbreak identified two samples containing fire-footed rope squirrel DNA. One of these samples was also the first positive for MPXV. This represents a rare case of direct detection of interspecies transmission. Our findings indicate that rope squirrels were the source of the MPXV outbreak in mangabeys. Because squirrels and non-human primates are hunted, traded and consumed by humans in West and Central Africa 10,11 , exposure to these animals probably represents risk for zoonotic transmission of MPXV.",

          "abstract": "Lymphoedema is a chronic debilitating disease caused by impaired lymphatic drainage and is characterized by tissue swelling, fat expansion, inflammation and fibrosis1,2. However, the exact mechanisms that drive lymphoedema are poorly understood. Although lymphatic vessels are known to transport cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the systemic circulation3, the importance of impaired lymphatic drainage for cholesterol clearance in humans and its relevance to lymphoedema remain unknown. Here we show that lymphatic drainage insufficiency in human lymphoedema leads to excessive cholesterol accumulation in the lymphoedematous dermal tissue and around lymphatic vessels. Cholesterol deposition resulted in dermal adipose tissue remodelling, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and dysfunction, progressing to death and dermal fibrosis. Surgical intervention improved lymphatic drainage and reduced cholesterol deposition. Using two mouse models that reproduce features of human lymphoedema, we demonstrated that tissue swelling and dermal adipose tissue remodelling were ameliorated by the cholesterol-depleting agent cyclodextrin. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that cyclodextrin restored lymphatic drainage by promoting the regeneration of lymphatic vessels. This study unravels the role of impaired cholesterol clearance in driving lymphoedema and identifies tissue cholesterol as a promising therapeutic target for this currently incurable disease.",

          "abstract": "Protecting qubits from noise is essential for building reliable quantum computers. Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum information non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes. These modes form a shared fermionic state whose occupation—either even or odd—defines the fermionic parity that encodes the qubit1. Notably, this parity can only be accessed by a measurement that couples two Majoranas to each other. A promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain1, implemented in quantum dots coupled using superconductors2. Even the minimal two-site chain hosts a pair of Majorana modes, often called ‘poor man’s Majoranas’, which are spatially separated but offer limited protection compared with longer chains3,4,5. Here we introduce a measurement technique that reads out their parity through quantum capacitance. Our method couples two Majoranas and resolves their parity in real time, visible as random telegraph switching with lifetimes exceeding a millisecond. Simultaneous charge sensing confirms that the two parity states are charge neutral and remain indistinguishable to a probe that does not couple the modes. These results establish the essential readout step for time-domain control of Majorana qubits, resolving a long-standing experimental challenge.",

          "abstract": "Orthosteric inhibitors block enzyme active sites and prevent substrates from binding 1 . Enhancing their specificity through substrate dependence seems inherently unlikely, as their mechanism hinges on direct competition rather than selective recognition. Here we show that a molecular glue mechanism unexpectedly imparts substrate-dependent potency to CSN5i-3, an orthosteric inhibitor of the COP9 signalosome (CSN). We first confirm that CSN5i-3 inhibits CSN, which catalyses NEDD8 (N8) deconjugation from the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, by occupying the active site of its catalytic subunit, CSN5, and directly competing with the iso-peptide bond substrate. Notably, the orthosteric inhibitor binds free CSN with only micromolar affinity, yet achieves nanomolar potency in blocking its deneddylase activity. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the enzyme–substrate–inhibitor complex reveal that active site-engaged CSN5i-3 occludes the substrate iso-peptide linkage while simultaneously extending an N8-binding exosite of CSN5, acting as a molecular glue to cement the N8–CSN5 interaction. The cooperativity of this trimolecular CSN5i-3–N8–CSN5 assembly, in turn, sequesters CSN5i-3 at its binding site, conferring high potency to the orthosteric inhibitor despite its low affinity for the free enzyme. Together, our findings highlight the modest affinity requirements of molecule glues for individual target proteins and establish orthosteric molecular glue inhibitors as a new class of substrate-dependent enzyme antagonists.",

Although the tuning of neurons in other areas of this system is unstable—evidenced, for example, by the change in the spatial tuning of hippocampal place cells3 across days4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11—the stability of the neuronal code that underlies the sense of direction remains unclear. Here, by longitudinally tracking the activity of the same HD cells in the post-subiculum of freely moving mice, we show stability and plasticity at two levels. Although the population structure remained highly conserved across environments and over time, subtle shifts in population coherence encoded environment identity. In addition, the HD system established a distinct, environment-specific alignment between its internal representation and external landmarks, which persisted for weeks, even after a single exposure. These findings suggest that the HD system forms long-lasting orientation memories that are anchored to specific environments.",

Striatal dopamine release signals the reward-predictive value of cues1,2, probably contributing to motivation3,4, but it is unclear how dopamine incorporates an animal’s ongoing trajectory for effective behavioural guidance. Here we demonstrate that cue-evoked striatal dopamine release in mice encodes bidirectional trajectory errors reflecting the relationship between the speed and direction of ongoing movement relative to optimal goal trajectories. Trajectory error signals could be computed from locomotion or visual flow, and were independent from simultaneous dopamine increases reflecting learned cue value. Joint trajectory error and cue-value encoding were reproduced by the reward prediction error term in a standard reinforcement learning algorithm with mixed sensorimotor inputs. However, these two signals had distinct state space requirements, suggesting that they could arise from a common reinforcement learning algorithm with distinct neural inputs. Striatum-wide multifibre array measurements resolved overlapping, yet temporally and anatomically separable, representations of trajectory error and cue value, indicating how functionally distinct dopamine signals for motivation and guidance are multiplexed across striatal regions to facilitate goal-directed behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Aluminium comprises over 8% of Earth’s crust and is the most abundant metallic constituent1. Historically, aluminium catalysis has predominantly exploited the inherent Lewis acidity associated with its stable +III oxidation state2. Owing to its uniquely low electronegativity (1.61)—the lowest among p-block elements—and the absence of an inert-pair effect, aluminium presents formidable intrinsic challenges for engaging in catalytic redox transformations. Here we report the redox catalytic capability of a low-valent aluminium species, carbazolylaluminylene3, which carries out a complete Al(I)/Al(III) catalytic cycle encompassing oxidative addition, double insertion, intramolecular isomerization and reductive elimination—fundamental mechanistic steps conventionally exclusive to transition-metal catalysis. Leveraging this Al(I)/Al(III) redox cycle, we achieve highly efficient and regioselective Reppe cyclotrimerization of alkynes4,5, producing diverse benzene derivatives with a turnover number of up to 2,290. Through X-ray crystallographic and quantum chemical analyses, we elucidate how the dynamic nitrogen geometry within the carbazolyl ligand framework precisely modulates the aluminium coordination environment, thereby facilitating the catalytic cycle. This work fundamentally advances the conceptual understanding of main-group redox catalysis. It further sets a compelling precedent for future catalyst design and sustainable synthetic methodologies centred on aluminium redox transformations.",

However, PeLEDs still underperform compared with organic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with an EQE of about 40% because of insufficient charge confinement and defect-caused non-radiative recombination on the film surface. Here we report a spontaneously formed 3D/2D vertically oriented perovskite heterojunction by means of a simple one-step spin-coating method, which could effectively confine the charge carriers and shift the radiation zone away from the defect-rich surface region. Notably, the 2D perovskite on top exhibits a wrinkled surface morphology, which offers up to 45.4% light extraction efficiency. The resulting PeLEDs achieved an EQE of 42.9% for the green emission (certified 42.3%). Our work sheds light on the strategies for fabricating high-efficiency PeLEDs in the future.",

          "abstract": "Caribbean reefs have experienced major human-driven changes to their coral and fish communities 1–4 , yet how these changes have affected trophic dynamics remains poorly understood owing to challenges in reconstructing the trophic structure of pre-human-impact reefs. Advances in fossil-bound protein nitrogen isotope ( 15 N/ 14 N) analysis now enable the reconstruction of ancient trophic dynamics 5,6 , as the 15 N to  14 N ratio reflects an animal’s trophic position 7 . Here we apply this method to modern and prehistoric (7,000-year-old) fish otoliths (ear stones) and corals from Caribbean Panama and the Dominican Republic, focusing on fishes occupying low to middle trophic levels. We find that although the trophic level typically declined in high-trophic-level fishes over time, it increased or remained unchanged in low-trophic-level fishes, indicating that modern food chains are 60–70% shorter than on the prehistoric reefs in both Panama and the Dominican Republic. Furthermore, across all trophic groups, we observed a marked reduction in dietary variation, with a 20–70% lower trophic range on the modern reefs compared to the prehistoric reefs. This pattern is best explained by less dietary specialization in modern reefs, consistent with less ecological complexity than in prehistoric reefs. These differences document and quantify the trophic simplification that has occurred on modern Caribbean reefs, a change that may increase their vulnerability to ecosystem collapse.",

          "abstract": "Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the first relativistic quantum field theory, describes light–matter interactions at a fundamental level and is one of the pillars of the Standard Model (SM). Through the extraordinary precision of QED, the SM predicts the energy levels of simple systems such as the hydrogen atom with up to 13 significant digits 1 , making hydrogen spectroscopy an ideal test bed. The consistency of physical constants extracted from different transitions in hydrogen using QED, such as the proton charge radius r p , constitutes a test of the theory. However, values of r p from recent measurements 2–7 of atomic hydrogen are partly discrepant with each other and with a more precise value from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen 8,9 . This prevents a test of QED at the level of experimental uncertainties. Here we present a measurement of the 2S–6P transition in atomic hydrogen with sufficient precision to distinguish between the discrepant values of r p and enable rigorous testing of QED and the SM overall. Our result ν 2S–6P = 730,690,248,610.79(48) kHz gives a value of r p = 0.8406(15) fm at least 2.5-fold more precise than from other atomic hydrogen determinations and in excellent agreement with the muonic value. The SM prediction of the transition frequency (730,690,248,610.79(23) kHz) is in excellent agreement with our result, testing the SM to 0.7 parts per trillion (ppt) and, specifically, bound-state QED corrections to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), their most precise test so far.",

          "abstract": "The spin supersolid—a magnetic analogue of the supersolid that simultaneously exhibits solid and superfluid orders—has emerged as a promising sub-Kelvin refrigerant with strong low-energy fluctuations and associated entropic effects1. However, the stringent prerequisites have so far confined its presence to certain magnetic insulators. Here we report the discovery of a metallic spin supersolid in a rare-earth compound EuCo2Al9 (ECA), which is a good metal with excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. The high-spin Eu2+ ions form a three-dimensional lattice with stacked triangular layers, in which the spin-supersolid state is stabilized through a mechanism involving both Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) and dipolar couplings. Neutron diffraction shows microscopic evidence of spin supersolidity, demonstrating the coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane spin orders in this alloy. Our RKKY–dipolar model successfully captures the metallic spin-supersolid Y and V phases in ECA, along with the 1/3 magnetization plateau. The observed nonclassical magnetization behaviours within these phases point to significant quantum fluctuations, probably enhanced by the conduction electrons. The resistivity measurements provide a transport probe for the spin-supersolid transitions, because of scattering of conduction electrons from local moments. Through the adiabatic demagnetization process, ECA achieves ultralow cooling to 106 mK, exhibiting a giant magnetocaloric effect that manifests sharp anomalies in the magnetic Grüneisen ratio. ECA emerges as one of the first metallic spin supersolids, combining low cooling temperature, large magnetic entropy and ultrahigh thermal conductivity for high-performance sub-Kelvin refrigeration.",

          "abstract": "Ancient DNA studies revealed that, in Europe from 6500 to 4000 bce, descendants of western Anatolian farmers mixed with local hunter-gatherers resulting in 70–100% ancestry turnover1, then steppe ancestry spread with the Corded Ware complex 3000–2500 bce2. Here we document an exception in the wetland, riverine and coastal areas of the Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany, using genome-wide data from 112 people 8500–1700 bce. A distinctive population with high (approximately 50%) hunter-gatherer ancestry persisted 3,000 years later than in most European regions, reflecting incorporation of female individuals of Early European Farmer ancestry into local communities. In the western Netherlands, the arrival of the Corded Ware complex was also exceptional: lowland individuals from settlements adopting Corded Ware pottery had hardly any steppe ancestry, despite a Y-chromosome characteristic of people associated with the early Corded Ware complex. These distinctive patterns may reflect the specific ecology that they inhabited, which was not amenable to full adoption of the early Neolithic type of farming introduced with Linearbandkeramik3, and resulted in distinct communities where transfer of ideas was accompanied by little gene flow. This changed with the formation of Lower Rhine–Meuse Bell Beaker users by fusion of local people (13–18%) and Corded Ware associated migrants of both sexes. Their subsequent expansion then had a disruptive impact across a much wider part of northwestern Europe, especially in Great Britain where they were the main source of a 90–100% replacement of local Neolithic ancestry.",

A key feature of polyatomic molecules is the presence of parity-doublet states. These structures, which generically arise from the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom afforded by polyatomic molecules, are a powerful feature to pursue diverse quantum science applications7. Linear triatomic molecules contain ℓ-type parity-doublet states in the vibrational bending mode, which are predicted to exhibit robust coherence properties. Here we report optically trapped CaOH molecules prepared in ℓ-type parity-doublet states and realize a bare qubit coherence time of \\({T}_{2}^{* }=0.8(2)\\,{\\rm{s}}\\), which is longer than the 0.36 s lifetime of the bending mode10,11. We suppress differential Stark shifts by cancelling ambient electric fields using molecular spectroscopy and characterize parity-dependent trap shifts, which are found to limit the coherence time. The parity-doublet coherence times achieved in this work are a defining milestone for the use of polyatomic molecules in quantum science.",

Here we identify a sleep function for peripheral macrophage-like cells (haemocytes) in the Drosophila circulation, showing that haemocytes track to the brain during sleep and take up lipids accumulated in cortex glia due to wake-associated oxidative damage. Through a screen of phagocytic receptors expressed in haemocytes, we discovered that knockdown of eater —a member of the Nimrod receptor family—reduces sleep. Loss of eater also disrupts haemocyte localization to the brain and lipid uptake, which results in increased brain levels of acetyl-CoA and acetylated proteins, including mitochondrial proteins PGC1α and DRP1. Dysregulation of mitochondria, reflected in high oxidation and reduced NAD + , is accompanied by impaired memory and lifespan. Thus, peripheral blood cells, which we suggest are precursors of mammalian microglia, perform a daily function of sleep to maintain brain function and fitness.",

After initial lesion recognition by XPC in global genome repair or by stalled RNA polymerases in transcription-coupled repair, a lesion and surrounding DNA duplex are unwound by TFIIH, which includes the ATPases XPB and XPD, and additional NER factors XPA, XPF, XPG and RPA, to form a DNA bubble2 comprising around 27 nucleotides. The double strand–single strand (ds-ss) junction-specific endonucleases XPF and XPG cleave DNA on the 5′ and 3′ sides of the lesion, respectively. Here we report the functional steps and atomic structures of the ATPase-driven and lesion-dependent DNA bubble formation and arrangement of the complete NER factors for dual incision. The unwinding of nearly 30 base pairs of DNA depends mainly on the double strand DNA translocase XPB and the duplex dividers XPA and XPF. XPD binds the lesion strand with XPF at the 5′ ds-ss junction. XPF cuts the lesion strand only after XPG binds the 3′ ds-ss junction. The ERCC1 subunit of XPF facilitates DNA strand separation and recruitment of RPA to the non-lesion strand. These findings provide insights on the causes of human diseases and potential targets for enhancing chemotherapeutic efficacy.",

          "abstract": "Human experience intertwines continuity, the seamless flow of events, with segmentation, the spontaneous partitioning of experience into discrete units. Despite their cognitive significance, it is unclear whether these processes operate independently or share a common mechanism. Here we explored this question by examining the link between serial dependence (SD)—the tendency to align perceptions with prior decisions—and the impact of event boundaries, prompted by contextual shifts, on memory. Considering a Bayesian perspective that associates SD with predictions, and segmentation with prediction errors, a common mechanism may govern both processes. Across three experiments (N = 816), we tested how contextual changes affect SD and segmentation-related memory effects. The results indicate that both processes are context-sensitive. Contextual boundaries can reduce SD even in the absence of sensory change, and boundaries modulate memory in ways consistent with event segmentation. Yet, across experiments we observed dissociable patterns of boundary effects on SD and memory, which are slightly more consistent with distinct contextual influences on perception and memory than with a single unified predictive system. Boundary effects on SD and memory did not covary across participants, but given the low within-participant reliability of these measures, this absence of correlation cannot be taken as strong evidence for independence. Overall, our findings show that both SD and memory are shaped by context, but clarifying whether they reflect a shared or partly distinct mechanism will require further research.",

          "abstract": "To discern speech or appreciate music, the human auditory system detects how pitch changes over time (pitch motion). Here, using psychophysics, computational modelling, functional neuroimaging and analysis of recorded speech, we ask whether humans can detect pitch motion using computations analogous to those used by the visual system. We adapted stimuli from studies of vision to create novel auditory correlated noise stimuli that elicited robust pitch motion percepts. In psychophysical experiments, we discovered that humans can judge pitch direction from spectrotemporal intensity correlations. Robust sensitivity to negative spectrotemporal correlations is a direct analogue of illusory ‘reverse-phi’ motion in vision, constituting a new auditory illusion. Functional MRI measurements in auditory cortex supported the hypothesis that human auditory processing may employ pitch direction opponency. Linking lab findings to real-world perception, we analysed recordings of English and Mandarin speech and found that pitch direction was signalled by both positive and negative spectrotemporal correlations, suggesting that sensitivity to both types confers ecological benefits. This work reveals how motion detection algorithms sensitive to local correlations are deployed by the central nervous system across disparate modalities (vision and audition) and dimensions (space and frequency).",

Various centres of ruminant domestication and diffusion routes of agropastoralism have been identified. The area between the northern and central Zagros Mountains on the Iranian Plateau is a cradle for goat domestication and eastward spread of agropastoralism. However, the early exploitation of ruminant milk by pastoral communities in the Zagros remains insufficiently studied. Here we show residues of caprine dairy products that were detected from the analysis of lipid residues in pottery vessels and protein residues in human dental calculus. These results, combined with the faunal spectra and radiocarbon analyses directly on the dairy residues, show that sheep and goat dairy products were widely exploited in the Zagros from the seventh millennium BC. This pattern parallels the contemporaneous exploitation of cattle milk in Anatolia. Neolithic communities in both regions reveal similarly complex dynamics of early ruminant milk use, marking the emergence of independent yet synchronous trajectories in the diffusion of agropastoral lifeways.",

Our findings reveal that episodes of reduced NPP around the 70s–100s, 360s–380s, and 470s–560s CE likely contributed to the westward and southward migration of nomadic people from their homelands in northwestern China and Mongolia. Although prolonged multidecadal periods of climate-induced low NPP served as tipping points for agricultural and pastoral subsistence systems, the inherent mobility of nomadic communities not only enabled them to adapt to adverse environmental conditions but also facilitated a widespread dispersal of ethnic groups.",

          "abstract": "The expansion of commodity agriculture into tropical forests leads to major social–ecological impacts. Yet little is known about where and how the capitalized actors driving this expansion interact with smallholders, particularly where smallholders live inside the forest. Two alternative outcomes of their interactions on deforestation are plausible: accelerated deforestation as all actors compete for land (i.e., land rush hypothesis) or, alternatively, slower deforestation as actors hinder each other’s expansion (i.e., competition hypothesis). We test these hypotheses for two global deforestation hotspots: the Dry Chaco and the Chiquitano Forests (together nearly 1 million km 2 ), using a land-systems representation that captures spatially overlapping land-use actors. We integrate satellite-based forest-loss time series with an independent reconstruction of land-system change from 2000 to 2023 in a Bayesian regression framework. This reveals three key findings: First, capitalized agriculture has expanded mainly over areas used by forest-dependent smallholders and Indigenous communities, indicating strongly intensifying land competition. Second, where forest-dwelling smallholders persist, their presence can mitigate deforestation pressure from expanding commodity frontiers. Third, the presence of either forest-dwelling smallholders or conservation areas maintains forest cover, but their combined presence does not amplify the protection effect. Overall, our findings show that interactions between agribusinesses and smallholders are key factors that shape the social–ecological outcomes of frontier expansion in the tropics. Accounting for land-system overlaps in research and policymaking on frontiers can therefore improve efforts to safeguard forests while supporting traditional livelihoods, especially in contested, rapidly changing landscapes.",

In Brazil, improving dengue forecasting became a priority in response to the unprecedented increase in cases, which surpassed the total of the previous decade and expanded to new regions. The Infodengue-Mosqlimate consortium launched the Infodengue-Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge 2024 (IMDC24), or Dengue Forecast Sprint, bringing together six international teams provided with cases and climate covariates data to generate actionable forecasts for 2024 and 2025 seasons in five diverse Brazilian states, leveraging advanced machine learning and classical statistical models. This paper outlines the structure and findings of the IMDC24. The performance of the models varied between years and locations, and no single model consistently excelled, especially during 2024’s unprecedentedly large season. This performance variability highlighted the need for ensemble approaches. The ensemble models developed are presented as the main results of this collaborative development. As intended, the ensemble models have been adopted by Brazilian public health authorities to help with planning and response to the forecasted 2025 dengue epidemics across the country.",

          "abstract": "Expectations can shape perception and potentially lead to self-fulfilling prophecies such as placebo effects that persist or grow over time. Nonetheless, whether and how unreinforced and unconditioned social cues (i.e., suggestions about future experiences that have not been reinforced with reward or punishment) can create and sustain such effects is unknown. We conducted a set of experiments in which participants (N = 111) experienced stimuli eliciting somatic pain (heat), vicarious pain (videos of others in pain), and cognitive effort (a mental-rotation task), at three intensity levels each. Before each stimulus, participants viewed a social cue that ostensibly indicated ratings from 10 other participants but was in fact randomized to a high or low mean aversiveness level independent of actual stimulus intensity. Across all tasks, participants’ expectations and experience ratings shifted in line with the cues, with high-aversive cues leading to higher perceived aversiveness. Computational modeling and behavioral analysis revealed lower learning rates for prediction errors inconsistent with the trial’s cue value (e.g., better than expected for high-aversive cues) and higher learning rates for prediction errors consistent with the cue value (e.g., worse than expected for high-aversive cues). These findings reveal a confirmation bias in learning: people update more when outcomes align with expectations. Combined with expectation effects on perception, this bias helps sustain social cue effects. Together, these mechanisms show how social information can shape perception and learning, giving rise to self-fulfilling prophecies.",

          "abstract": "Pluralistic ignorance—the systematic misperception of others’ attitudes—can entrench suboptimal norms, yet its dynamics remain poorly understood. We develop a mathematical model of the coevolution of actions, private attitudes, and beliefs about others, with societal tightness as a central parameter. Our framework integrates theories of spirals of silence, preference falsification, and cultural mismatch into a single dynamic system capturing the effects of material payoffs, cognitive forces, and social influence. The model shows that pluralistic ignorance can arise from lags between attitude change and belief updating, even without silence or deception. Dynamics unfold faster in loose cultures and slower in tight ones: loose societies display sharp but transient peaks of pluralistic ignorance, while tight societies sustain slower, persistent mismatches. Both can experience cultural evolutionary mismatch but through distinct pathways—internalized norm adherence in loose cultures vs. conformity pressure in tight ones. These mechanisms may help explain global patterns where private support exceeds perceived support, such as climate action, women’s rights, and abortion attitudes. Interventions must therefore be culturally tailored: accelerating attitude change through highlighting benefits is effective in loose cultures, whereas lowering expression costs (via anonymity or legal protections) empowers norm entrepreneurs in tight cultures. Our framework identifies policy levers and clarifies when apparent opinion stability conceals underlying shifts, offering insights for democratic societies navigating rapid social change.",

          "abstract": "First impressions often hinge on visible cues, leading people to infer the trustworthiness of strangers from their appearance and dress. While religiosity is generally associated with greater perceived trustworthiness, little is known about how visible religious markers, such as clothing and grooming styles, shape trust judgments in Muslim-majority societies, where such signals are widespread and easily recognizable. We examine this question using a large-scale vignette experiment embedded in a nationally representative face-to-face survey in Turkey. By experimentally varying profile characteristics, we identify the causal effect of a Muslim headscarf or beard on perceived trustworthiness. Contrary to expectations, individuals displaying these religious badges are generally viewed as less trustworthy than otherwise identical profiles, even by highly religious respondents. Mediation analyses show that these effects arise because religious badges signal multiple attributes, not only religiosity but also political orientation and physical attractiveness—and that these inferred meanings differ by gender: women’s headscarves and men’s beards prompt distinct patterns of inference. These findings show that visible religious markers shape trust judgments through multivalent social inferences rather than perceived piety alone. The results highlight how observers draw on broader social and political associations when interpreting religious markers, providing evidence on how public expressions of religion affect everyday trust judgments.",

          "abstract": "Function diversity, the range of tasks individuals perform, and specialization, the distribution of function abundances, are fundamental to complex adaptive systems. In the absence of overarching principles, these properties have appeared domain-specific. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification and specialization of functions across disparate systems, including bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. We find that the number of functions grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents from 0.35 to 0.57, consistent with Heaps’ law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic scaling. To explain these empirical findings, we generalize the Yule-Simon model by introducing two key parameters: a diversification parameter that characterizes how existing functions inhibit the creation of new ones and a specialization parameter that describes how a function’s attractiveness depends on its abundance. Our model enables cross-system comparisons, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas. The analysis suggests that what drives the creation of new functions depends on the system’s goals and structure: federal agencies tend to ensure comprehensive coverage of necessary functions; cities tend to slow the creation of new occupations as existing ones expand; and cells occupy an intermediate position. Once functions are introduced, their growth follows a remarkably universal pattern across all systems.",

An extensive literature in welfare economics addresses the matter. Nevertheless, economists have often simplified policy analysis by assuming that individuals have homogeneous, consequentialist, and self-centered preferences. Individuals may hold heterogeneous private and distributional preferences. To enhance policy analysis, economists should specify social welfare functions that express the richness and variety of actual personal preferences. The possibilities are vast. I focus on preferences for equity. There has been much controversy regarding interpretation of equity, a term that public discourse has used in vague and conflicting ways. Specifying social welfare functions that formally express different interpretations of equity will not eliminate disagreements, but it should clarify concepts and reduce the inconsistencies that afflict verbal communication.",

          "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a key question for researchers and authorities was to understand the psychological motivations that sustained public engagement in protective behavior such as physical distancing and hygienic protection. While feelings of threat were rampant during the pandemic, theories of health psychology have highlighted appraisals related to the ability to cope (e.g., the feeling of being able to adhere cost-effectively to government advice) and argued that coping appraisals are superior predictors of motivations to protect the self against risks. In this study, we conducted a massive population-based comparison of the association between, on the one hand, threat appraisals and coping appraisals and, on the other hand, protection against actual infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. We built a unique Danish data infrastructure that links surveys of ~8% of the adult population (N = 386,633) with the individual results of the 123 million COVID-19 tests performed during 22 mo of the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for a comprehensive range of sociodemographic measures and employing panel data to bolster internal validity, we observe that stronger coping appraisals are consistently associated with lower individual probability of COVID-19 infection risk. We find no consistent evidence of a similar association for threat appraisals. Threat appraisals rather seem to index individual feelings of infection exposure. As appeals to fear also have unintended negative consequences (including anxiety, fatigue, and stigmatization), the findings offer strong support for relying on coping-oriented public health policy and communication in future societal crises in the domain of health and beyond.",

Here, we characterize the antibody responses of naturally infected wild dromedary camels in Tunisia, a MERS-CoV-endemic region. Plasma antibodies from nine camels exhibited variable neutralizing activity, generally increasing with age, and were largely autologous, with minimal cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. From a VHH antibody library derived from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a single camel (D17), we identified 34 unique sequences with previously unreported germline origins and unusually long complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. Eight representative VHHs, expressed as human Fc fusions, displayed high-affinity binding to the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) and broad neutralization to RBD mutants (IC 50 : 1.05 to 9.55 ng/mL). Crystal structural analysis revealed distinct neutralization mechanisms: VHH-227 fully blocked DPP4 binding, achieving complete neutralization, while VHH-T71, with partial neutralization (~80%), targeted the RBD core subdomain. This study provides comprehensive characterization of wild dromedary antibody responses, identifying novel nanobodies (Nbs) with broad and potent neutralization to naturally occurring RBD mutants. These findings offer insights into camel immunity and highlight promising candidates for MERS-CoV prophylactic and therapeutic development.",

Although its anti-inflammatory effects have been demonstrated in various disease models, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies suggest that ultrasound promotes anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) signaling in the spleen. However, the upstream events initiating this response have not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that abdominal ultrasound activates afferent vagal fibers and suppress systemic inflammation. In a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia, abdominal ultrasound significantly reduced plasma TNF-α levels. This anti-inflammatory effect was attenuated by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDVx) or afferent vagal blockade. Electrophysiological recordings revealed increased cervical vagus nerve activity during ultrasound stimulation, which was eliminated by intraperitoneal lidocaine, confirming activation of abdominal sensory afferents. Furthermore, abdominal ultrasound induced c-Fos expression in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), consistent with central activation via vagal afferent input. These findings provide direct mechanistic evidence that abdominal ultrasound stimulates afferent vagal pathways.",

          "abstract": "The self-assembly of matter into ordered structures is ubiquitous throughout nature and engineered systems. Programming a material’s macroscopic properties via molecular-level structural control is a grand scientific challenge, requiring methods for inverse design that can design a targeted molecule to achieve a given self-assembled structure. One model system that serves as a common proving ground for inverse design algorithms is block copolymers. In these systems, self-consistent field-theory (SCFT) provides a robust thermodynamic model for predicting self-assembly for a given molecular sequence. This work presents a computational algorithm which learns the reverse translation, allowing a target structure to be achieved by varying molecular sequence. The algorithm is based on development of an adjoint solution of the SCFT equations allowing incorporation of automatic differentiation. The power of this algorithm is demonstrated by inverse designing polymer sequences to yield equilibrium structures, resolving the long-standing dilemma of navigating the combinatorial explosion of sequence possibilities offered by complex copolymer designs. The inverse designed sequences show that the algorithm learns to modulate unfavorable block interactions to stabilize these complex morphologies. By learning how to program self-assembly at the molecular-level using only a thermodynamic model, this work opens the door to similar computational inverse design across other soft matter systems.",

          "abstract": "In natural environments, bacteria often encounter low concentrations of nutrient mixtures that are continuously replenished by physical processes such as fluid flow. Studying bacterial physiology under such conditions is experimentally challenging because it is difficult to maintain steady, low nutrient concentrations with rapid renewal. Most studies on nutrient limitation have used approaches such as the chemostat, which rely on long renewal times to sustain low concentrations. We developed a Millifluidic Continuous Culture Device (MCCD), inspired by microfluidics, that enables bacterial cultivation in nutrient mixtures at low micromolar concentrations with rapid renewal driven by fluid flow. Unlike microfluidic systems, the MCCD retains sufficient culture volume to support batch-scale ‘omic analyses. Using the MCCD, we cultured Escherichia coli in a mixture of amino acids and nucleobases at three concentration ranges spanning a fivefold difference in growth rates. Surprisingly, at the lowest concentration range, cells exhibited proteomic signatures of iron limitation despite equal total ferrous iron across conditions. Uptake experiments with labeled iron–histidine and iron–cysteine complexes confirmed that amino acids facilitated ferrous iron acquisition. Under continuous flow, siderophores were washed out, rendering this pathway ineffective and revealing a previously unrecognized mechanism of iron acquisition via soluble ferrous iron–amino acid complexes. These findings highlight the importance of studying bacterial physiology at low nutrient concentrations and also suggest a broader role for other organic substrates capable of complexing iron as potential iron sources in environments with rapid renewal.",

However, their global-scale sensitivity and vulnerability to climate impacts remain poorly understood. Here, we apply the safe climatic space framework to assess how changes in core climatic drivers of grazing suitability, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed, will reshape global grassland-based grazing systems. Our analysis projects a net decline of 36 to 50% of areas in climate suitability for grazing by 2100, accompanied by inter- and intracontinental shift of grazing suitability. These changes are expected to negatively affect 110 to 140 million pastoralists and 1.4 to 1.6 billion livestock, with particularly severe impacts in Africa. We further show that 51 to 81% of these impacted populations reside in countries with low income, serious hunger, severe gender inequality, and high political fragility. Our study implies that future climate change will threaten grazing suitability across large portions of Earth, endangering the livelihoods of numerous communities and potentially triggering widespread socioeconomic consequences.",

          "abstract": "Even though in vivo rodent studies have been instrumental in investigating sex-specific differences in cardiac health, function, and pathology, they fall short in providing a fast and flexible platform for investigating sex differences of cardiac anisotropic monolayer in isolation. In vitro platforms offer an accessible and more controlled alternative to dissect and study the mechanisms by which male and female cardiac tissue sheets differ from one another. Here, we have shown on an in vitro heart-on-a-chip platform, primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes can serve as a viable model showing sex chromosome-driven characteristics when presented with identical experimental conditions. With controlled experimental conditions, the self-assembly of isolated cardiomyocytes resulted in morphological differences in the structure of the contractile apparatus. More importantly, the assembly of cardiac cells into confluent monolayers had a sex chromosome-driven divergence in both structure and the corresponding function. This work reports the characterization of the difference between sex-specific neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in in vitro culture. Thus, this offers an avenue to investigate sex-based variations in cardiac function that are otherwise difficult to study.",

          "abstract": "Ependymomas (EPN) are rare central nervous system tumors that account for approximately 10% of intracranial tumors in children and 4% in adults. Despite their clinical and molecular heterogeneity, spanning supratentorial, posterior fossa, and spinal subtypes, treatment remains limited to surgery and radiotherapy, with chemotherapy offering minimal benefit. Here, we performed transcriptomic analysis of 370 human ependymoma samples and identified two distinct molecular subgroups: EPN-E1 and EPN-E2. The EPN-E1 cluster is enriched for supratentorial tumors harboring ZFTA-RELA fusions (ZFTA-RELA fus ), which occur in over 70% of cases and are associated with poor prognosis. To identify targeted therapies for this aggressive subtype, we validated a ZFTA-RELA fus mouse model that recapitulates the human EPN-E1 transcriptome and used it for target discovery. Through Kinome Regularization, a machine learning-driven polypharmacology approach, we identified MERTK as a critical regulator of tumor cell viability. Genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of Mertk reduced cell growth ex vivo, and treatment with a clinical-grade MERTK inhibitor significantly suppressed tumor proliferation in vivo. Both human EPN-E1 tumors and ZFTA-RELA fus mouse tumors exhibited elevated expression of MERTK and its ligand GAS6, and MERTK inhibition led to suppression of pro-survival signaling pathways including MEK/ERK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase/Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase) and PI3K/AKT (Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase/Protein Kinase B). Notably, over 80% of genes upregulated in ZFTA-RELA fus tumors were downregulated following MERTK inhibition, indicating a strong dependency on this pathway for tumor maintenance. These findings define a signaling vulnerability in ZFTA-RELA-driven ependymomas and support the clinical development of MERTK-targeted therapies for patients with the high-risk EPN-E1 subtype.",

          "abstract": "Previous experimental reports of long-range interactions in ionic liquids (ILs) stand in contradiction with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. To provide insights into the literature discrepancies regarding the experimental ranges of electrostatic screening, claimed with orders of magnitude larger, the interactions between pairs of mica and borosilicate surfaces confining ILs are investigated by two complementary advanced Surface Force Apparatuses. Regardless of differences in confinement geometries (crossed-cylinders, sphere-flat), radii of curvature (cm-mm), and measurement techniques (stepwise versus continuous approach), two ever present force regimes are evidenced. At small surface separations, oscillatory forces reflect IL structuration and layering, while outside this gap, the interaction is monotonic repulsive. In both regimes the spatial extent and force magnitude depend critically on motion conditions, as demonstrated by achieving velocities as low as 9 pm/s with equilibration times up to 90 s. At large separations, fast surface displacements generate long-range interactions (over tens of ion size) creating the illusion of anomalous underscreening, whereas increasingly slow ones shrink both magnitude and range of the repulsion with decay-lengths converging ultimately to a screening length consistent with Poisson–Boltzmann theory with finite ion sizes. The transition from apparent long-range to short-range screening unfolds over nearly two orders of magnitude in time, revealing slow relaxation dynamics reminiscent of aging phenomena. These findings definitely resolve a decade-old controversy on force measurements and reveal rich out-of-equilibrium dynamics. The hydrodynamic contribution to the net force is admittedly crucial to be reduced especially when relaxations span decades in time, but approaching thermodynamic equilibrium during measurements proves essential.",

Loss of PTEN causes hyperactivation of both mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Recent studies have shown that this dual hyperactivation is required for the neuropathology observed in PTEN -deficient human stem cell–derived neural cells. However, the molecular effectors that integrate these synergistic signals remain unknown. Here, we identify the actin-regulating ARP2/3 complex as a critical point of convergence downstream of mTORC1 and mTORC2. We show that concurrent hyperactivation of both complexes drives increased filamentous actin and elevated levels of the ARP2/3 complex subunits in PTEN -deficient human neural precursors (NPs) and neurons. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ARP2/3 is sufficient to rescue multiple disease-relevant phenotypes, including NP hyperproliferation, neuronal hypertrophy, and electrical hyperactivity, without affecting the upstream mTORC1 or mTORC2 hyperactivation. Together, these findings reveal the PTEN –mTOR–ARP2/3 signaling axis as a core mechanism of neuropathology and highlight ARP2/3 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for PTEN -related neurodevelopmental disorders.",

          "abstract": "The kinase MAPKAPK2 regulates cell survival, proliferation, and death, and is upregulated in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) where it is associated with tumor growth and progression. However, how it regulates tumor progression in conjunction with other signaling pathways, such as MEK/ERK, remains elusive. Solid tumors are often subjected to metabolic stress, notably glucose deprivation. Here, we demonstrate that MAPKAPK2 protein levels in CRC regulate cell fate decision during stress conditions, such as glucose deprivation and therapeutic treatment. While MAPKAPK2 expression is a limiting factor for CRC growth in vitro, depleting MAPKAPK2 or inhibiting its activity pharmacologically provides a survival advantage to CRC cells under glucose limiting conditions. Subjecting CRC cells to low glucose resulted in an ERK1/2-mediated decline in MAPKAPK2 to promote survival. Additionally, cells with reduced MAPKAPK2 activity were less sensitive to trametinib under glucose limiting conditions. Utilizing transcriptomic profiling, we found that glucose deprivation and MAPKAPK2 depletion activate pathways associated with survival during metabolic stress. This relationship was also observed in CRC patients (TCGA), where tumors with low MAPKAPK2 expression had higher ERK1/2 activation and upregulated stress-induced pathways, leading to poor survival. Finally, MAPKAPK2 modulated growth of CRC organoids, subcutaneous tumors, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and reduced MAPKAPK2 levels decreased efficacy of trametinib, in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this study identifies an interrelationship between MEK/ERK and p38/MAPKAPK2 signaling pathways during glucose deprivation to support cell survival and features MAPKAPK2 loss as a possible mechanism leading to reduced efficacy of trametinib-based anticancer therapy and poor patient outcomes in CRC.",

          "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that shares clinical features with multiple sclerosis (MS) but typically manifests with more severe symptoms. The presence of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies targeting aquaporin-4 (AQP4) channels on astrocytes serves as a highly specific biomarker that distinguishes NMOSD from MS. Unlike MS, NMOSD is characterized by profound astrocytic destruction and exhibits a distinct response to therapies. Notably, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) effective in MS, including natalizumab, interferon-β, and fingolimod, not only fail to benefit NMOSD patients but may also exacerbate disease progression. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying this immunomodulator-induced exacerbation, however, remain not yet fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that natalizumab alleviated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) while exacerbating the autoimmune astrocytopathy in an “EAE-NMOSD” mouse model, a phenomenon associated with a reduction in actively proliferating astrocytes. Through molecular and signaling pathway analyses, we identify that endothelial-derived vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) activates astrocytes via integrin α4 signaling, thereby mitigating astrocytopathy in NMOSD-like mice. Furthermore, astrocyte-specific integrin α4 deficiency exacerbates astrocytopathy, and notably, natalizumab-induced disease exacerbation does not occur in integrin α4-conditional knockout (CKO) mice. Finally, pharmacological activation of astrocytes rescues natalizumab-induced damage and ameliorates demyelination in NMOSD-like mice. Collectively, our findings provide mechanistic gaps regarding the clinical phenomenon underlying natalizumab-induced NMOSD exacerbation and suggest astrocyte-targeted therapeutic strategies as a potential intervention for NMOSD.",

Biomolecular sequence combinatorics leads to a large variety of proteins and nucleic acids which can interact to form a diversity of dense liquid (“condensate”) phases. The relationship between sequence design and the diversity of the resultant phases is therefore of interest. Here, we explore this question using the DNA nanostar system which permits the creation of multiphase condensate droplets through sequence engineering of the sticky end bonds that drive particle–particle attraction. We explore the theoretical limits of nanostar phase diversity, then experimentally demonstrate the ability to create nine distinct, nonadhering nanostar phases that do not share components. We further study how different thermal histories affect the morphology and dynamics of such a highly diverse condensate system. We particularly show that a rapid temperature quench leads to the formation of a densely packed 2-D layer of droplets that is transiently stabilized by caging effects enabled by the phase diversity, leading to glassy dynamics such as slow coarsening and dynamic heterogeneity. Generally, our work provides experimental insight into the thermodynamics of phase separation of complex mixtures and demonstrates the rational engineering of complex, long-range, multiphase droplet structures.",

Here, we use simulations, theory, and experiments to study how adding stochasticity to agent motion can reduce traffic jams and help agents travel more quickly to prescribed goals. A computational approach reveals the collective behavior. Above a critical noise level, large jams do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the swarm’s goal attainment rate, which allows us to solve for the agent density and noise level that maximize the goals reached. Robotic experiments corroborate the behaviors observed in our simulated and theoretical results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally efficient than a planner, motivating further research into robust, decentralized navigation methods for crowded environments.

Here, we combined detailed histopathological analysis with spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to generate a developmental atlas of human cerebellar BG. Histology revealed that BG emerge around 11 postconception weeks (PCW), initially serving as a scaffold for Purkinje cells (PCs) migrating into the PC layer of the cerebellar cortex. Following the establishment of a multilayered PC arrangement, BG form a distinct parallel layer separated from the PCs by the lamina dissecans (LD), with both layers merging in the third trimester. This developmental sequence challenges earlier studies that suggested BG appear late in the third trimester. Comparative histology in mice, ferrets, and marmosets indicates that this trilaminar organization, including the LD, is likely unique to humans. Integration of spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomic datasets identified an ASCL1 + PTF1A + ventricular zone progenitor cluster giving rise to BG, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Pseudotime analyses delineated three gliogenic lineages and revealed two temporally and transcriptionally distinct BG populations, emerging at 11–12PCW and 17PCW, suggesting multiphasic BG ontogeny. Together, these multimodal data link cellular lineage, spatial organization, and molecular identity of human cerebellar glia, providing a framework for future studies on the role of BG in cerebellar function and their potential contributions to vulnerability in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

          "abstract": "The fundamental limitation of water oxidation in alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) lies in the progressive depletion of dynamic active sites and rapid dissipation of local active ion concentration, a critical thermodynamic constraint that conventional electrochemical strategies struggle to overcome. Here, we propose a magnetic field–enhanced AWE (ME-AWE) strategy that enables in-situ directional enrichment of local active iron ions near the anode, thus breaking the concentration limit and boosting the coverage of dynamic iron active sites without elevating bulk impurity levels. Laboratory-scale three-electrode experiments confirm improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics by the magnetically induced optimization of iron incorporation dynamics and the increase in the coverage of dynamic iron active sites. A multiphysics model coupling magnetic field, fluid flow, mass transport, and electrochemical reaction is developed to spatially interpret the mechanism, revealing that the magnetic modulation enables OER kinetics at 0.3 ppm iron equivalent to those at tenfold higher concentration without a magnetic field. Guided by mechanistic insights, an industry-scale ME-AWE device is designed and implemented, achieving a 24.9% increase in hydrogen output at 1.8 V. Techno-economic analysis demonstrates that the ME-AWE strategy enables a 10.6% reduction in total AWE capital cost for large-scale hydrogen production plants using off-grid wind power. Built with existing industrial infrastructure, this ME-AWE strategy offers a scalable and low-cost solution for improving AWE efficiency and advancing impurity-assisted catalysis in green hydrogen production.",

Sinorhizobium meliloti, whose plant hosts Medicago truncatula and Medicago sativa express ca. 600 NCR peptides during root nodule development, possesses a symbiotically essential BacA Sm protein that imports certain NCR peptides into the cytoplasm. This import permits proteolytic degradation of the NCR peptides, thereby protecting the endocytosed bacteria from their antimicrobial peptide-like lethality, while also allowing certain NCR peptides to undergo their symbiotically critical interactions with cytoplasmic components, for example heme-sequestration in the case of NCR247. Our study employed 54 S. meliloti bacA Sm missense mutants (35 to cysteine and 19 to glycine) that we tested for protein production, ability to establish a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, and their susceptibility to killing by higher levels of the NCR247 and the Bac7(1-35) peptides. We also used the Single Cysteine Accessibility Method to make topological inferences. Our detailed genetic, biochemical, structural, and physiological analyses have revealed that BacA Sm and SbmAhomodimers function as finely tuned transporters, whose structures can be relatively easily disrupted by single amino acid changes. Our finding that several mutations that differentially separate nitrogen-fixation, NCR247 import, and Bac7(1-35) import map to the lining of the peptide-binding cavity suggests a molecular explanation underlying the paradoxical observation that SbmA/BacAs from pathogens can fully replace BacA Sm , whereas BacAs from other rhizobia cannot.",

Linking the nutrient composition of &gt;2,800 aquatic species with &gt;2 million fishmeal and farmed fish transactions in international aquatic food trade between 2015 and 2019, we examined aquaculture’s nutritional flows and distributional equity. We found that aquaculture provided adequate intakes for nearly a quarter of a million individuals, on average, across 14 key nutrients, and for up to 2.7 billion individuals for several nutrients, such as Vitamin B 12 . The vast majority of these nutrients (76.8%) were domestically retained, contributing to the nutritional security of producer countries. With most internationally traded nutrients originating from nutritionally vulnerable countries (57.7% for fishmeal and 66.3% for farmed aquatic foods), rethinking existing distribution policies with nutrition as the primary objective may help unlock the full potential of aquaculture to eliminate hunger and malnutrition.",

          "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the prevailing cause of age-associated dementia worldwide. Current standard of care relies on antibody-based immunotherapy. However, antibody-based approaches carry risks for patients, and their effects on cognition are marginal. Increasing evidence suggests that T cells contribute to AD onset and progression. Unlike the cytotoxic effects of CD8 + cells, CD4 + T cells capable of regulating inflammation show promise in reducing pathology and improving cognitive outcomes in mouse models of AD and in aging. Here, we sought to exploit the beneficial properties of CD4 + T cells while circumventing the need for TCR and peptide–MHC antigen discovery, thereby providing a potential universal therapeutic approach. To achieve this, we engineered CD4 + T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting fibrillar forms of aggregated amyloid-β. Our findings demonstrate that optimized CAR-T cells can alter amyloid deposition in the dura and reduce parenchymal pathology in the brain. Furthermore, we observed that CAR-T treatment promotes the expansion and recruitment of endogenous CD4 + T cells into the brain parenchyma and leptomeninges. In summary, we established the feasibility of amyloid plaque–specific CAR-T cells as a potential therapeutic avenue for AD. These findings highlight the potential of CD4 + CAR-T therapy not only to modify amyloid pathology but also to reshape the immune landscape of the CNS, paving the way for future development of cellular immunotherapies for neurodegenerative disease.",

          "abstract": "Animals must balance behavioral goals with the energetic costs of movement. How such trade-offs are implemented algorithmically during natural behavior, and how they adapt to changing energetic constraints, remains poorly understood. Here we show that larval zebrafish adjust their motor strategies during prey hunting to minimize energy expenditure. Using high-speed video tracking and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we quantified the energy costs (in Joules) of different movement types across three developmental stages. While the structure of discrete movement types (“bouts”) remained stable with age, their selection probabilities changed depending on their energetic cost, such that more expensive bouts were always used less frequently. This relationship was conserved across development despite shifts in the relative costs of different bouts. A reinforcement learning model trained to catch prey while minimizing energy use reproduced this relationship, demonstrating that it is an energetically optimal strategy. Furthermore, when fish were reared in a high-viscosity environment that altered energetic costs, they readapted their movement probabilities to preserve the same energy-based control rule, demonstrating active optimization rather than a predetermined developmental program. These findings reveal how goal-directed animals can dynamically regulate movement selection to minimize energetic costs, even under changing environmental and biomechanical conditions. Our results provide a quantitative link between biomechanics, development, behavior, and computational control theory in a freely moving animal.",

          "abstract": "Turbulence, left unforced, evolves under its own dynamics, invading surrounding quiescent fluid as it decays. A ubiquitous and familiar phenomenon, this fundamental aspect of turbulence has resisted the marriage of principled theory and experiment with no universal law yet capturing its evolution. Conventional flow chamber experiments have been hampered by boundary effects or strong mean flows that obscure the intrinsic dynamics of relaxation to quiescence. To circumvent these limitations, we create a spatially localized blob of turbulence using eight converging vortex generators focused at the center of a water tank, and observe its decay and expansion over decades in time using particle image velocimetry with logarithmic time sampling. The blob initially expands and decays until it reaches the walls of the tank and eventually transitions to a second regime of approximately spatially uniform decay. We interpret the turbulent dynamics as an interplay of nonlinear diffusion with associated steep fronts separating the turbulent and quiescent regions, and nonlinear decay, as described by the Kolmogorov–Barenblatt equation. We find direct evidence for this model within the expansion phase and decay phases of our turbulent blob and use it to account for the detailed behavior we observe. Our work provides a detailed spatially resolved narrative for the behavior of turbulence once the forcing is removed, and demonstrates unexpectedly that the turbulent cascade leaves an indelible footprint far into the decay process.",

Analyses of kidney graft biopsies identified calcium signaling pathways and mTOR as a key regulator of MS-induced NK cell activation. Two experimental models were developed to mimic the pathological condition: in vitro cocultures of human NK cells with allogeneic microvascular endothelial cells and a murine heart transplantation model. These models showed that while calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) alone had a limited impact, combining CNI with mTOR inhibitors (mTORinh) synergistically reduced NK cell activation and endothelial damage. In a pilot clinical study involving 50 renal transplant recipients with MS-associated NK cell–mediated microvascular inflammation, patients who tolerated mTORinh introduced on top of CNI at diagnosis demonstrated reduced MVI lesions and improved graft survival compared to a historical cohort left on CNI and mycophenolate mofetil.

          "abstract": "More than 100 historically, archaeologically and ethnographically attested numerical notations have been used over the past 5,000 y; however, because most of those systems are no longer used, experimental investigation is challenging. Prior research often assumes, rather than demonstrates, the inferiority of notations like Roman numerals. Gradience is a principle whereby the length of numeral phrases correlates with the magnitude of the numbers being represented. In general, but inconsistently, larger numbers require more signs, just as larger sets of abstract dot patterns occupy more space. This study compares the gradience of 13 numerical notations varying in phylogenetic family, linguistic family, and structural properties, using two indices, inversion (how often N + 1 requires fewer signs than N) and jitter (the mean length difference between successive numbers). Place value systems are highly gradient; i.e., their length indexes numerical magnitude more accurately than other systems. The relationship between the structural properties of notations and the two indices of jitter and inversion is complex. Next, a cultural-evolutionary analysis compares the older additive Roman numerals to the eventually predominant subtractive variant (e.g., XIX = 19). Subtractive Roman numerals are more concise and have a lower jitter than additive ones, but at the cost of a significantly higher inversion ratio. This analysis permits the evaluation of cultural-evolutionary hypotheses grounded in the representational properties of attested notations, even when cognitive tests are not feasible. Several avenues for future experimental investigation using attested or constructed notations of varying properties are proposed.",

Here, we report a universal strategy to dope electrolytes such that the ion transport can be unipolar by incorporating electroactive polymers within hydrogels that interact discriminately with one type of ion via redox and binding mechanisms, leaving the counterions mobile. This transforms the system into an active, selective conductor that directs ion flow with high precision. We demonstrate the generality of this strategy using a wide range of electroactive polymers and ions. Particularly, we use emeraldine base and leucoemeraldine base, derived from polyaniline to create both n-type and p-type conductors with high ion selectivity.

          "abstract": "From shifting visual scenes to tactile deformations and fluid motion, animals interpret patterns of sensory flow around their body to construct internal models and produce adaptive behavior. Understanding how such transformations are encoded in the brain remains incomplete. To tackle this question, we leverage the lateral line of larval zebrafish as a tractable system sensitive to fluid motion and used to steer navigation, feed, and avoid predators. By presenting stimuli of either direction to neuromasts along the body, we mapped hindbrain responses via high-resolution calcium imaging. Our findings challenge the notion that central lateral line processing lacks topographic structure by revealing a simple, yet powerful principle centered on an egocentric spatial framework: the direction and location of local flow motions are encoded in reference to the animal’s center-of-mass. Brainstem neurons that encode flow toward the center-of-mass broadly project to form bilateral connections onto reticulospinal neurons that coordinate forward locomotion while those that encode flow away from the center-of-mass displayed a more selective and unilateral projection profile to command neurons eliciting turns. This simple representation enables the brain to register complex flow patterns and provides a robust basis for behavioral action selection. Our finding represents a shift from purely somatotopic encoding toward an integrative representation of axial position and directionality along the horizontal plane combined, revealing a central principle for encoding spatiodirectional cues. This study advances our understanding of how complex mechanosensory inputs select appropriate motor outputs via simple egocentric neural maps in the hindbrain.",

          "abstract": "Stratospheric CH 4 oxidation represents both an important sink in the global CH 4 budget and a major source of stratospheric water vapor and hydrogen radicals, exerting strong influences on global climate and ozone chemistry. Yet, the magnitude of stratospheric CH 4 chemical loss remains highly uncertain, with previous estimates largely relying on chemistry-climate models (CCMs). Here, we present an observationally based estimate of stratospheric CH 4 loss ( L STR ), derived from the CH 4 diabatic flux across the isentropic surface fitted to the tropical tropopause, using satellite measurements of CH 4 concentration, temperature, and radiative heating rates for 2007–2010. We obtain an L STR of 49.8 ± 7.8 Tg/y, compared with 38.1 Tg/y estimated from reanalysis, and 25.7 Tg/y (range: 19.6 to 35.9 Tg/y) derived from CCMs, indicating that both reanalysis and CCMs systematically underestimate stratospheric CH 4 loss. We show that discrepancies in global CH 4 diabatic fluxes from the reanalysis and CCMs, when compared with observations, are mainly driven by biases in CH 4 concentrations and further enhanced by errors in temperature and radiative heating. Substituting our observational estimate for the model-based stratospheric loss in the bottom-up global CH 4 budget reduces the reported imbalance for the 2000s from 23 to 3 Tg/y, bringing it into close agreement with the 5 Tg/y (range: −4 to 13 Tg/y) imbalance inferred from top-down estimates. These findings highlight the critical role of observational constraints on L STR in reconciling the global CH 4 budget.

Transition metal catalysts are prized for these transformations because their reactivity and selectivity can be tuned via judicious selection of the metal and ligand. Although enzymes offer analogous opportunities for tuning via protein engineering, their application to cross-coupling remains limited, as nature relies on alternative paradigms for building molecular complexity. Here, we report the cross-coupling of alkyl halides and benzylic carboxylic acids using an engineered flavin-dependent lactate monooxygenase—a photoenzyme. The enzyme achieves this feat by exploiting the redox versatility of the flavin cofactor. Stoichiometric experiments, ultrafast spectroscopy, and computational studies support a mechanism in which photoexcited flavin quinone initiates the reaction via oxidative decarboxylation to generate a benzylic radical. The resulting flavin semiquinone can reduce the alkyl halide to form a second organic radical within the protein active site, which rapidly engages in C(sp 3 )–C(sp 3 ) bond formation. A variant was engineered to control the stereochemical outcome of this radical–radical coupling event, highlighting the ability of the protein to alter the energetic barrier for a mechanistic step that is traditionally understood to be near barrierless. This work demonstrates that the scope for nonnative reaction mechanisms in biocatalysis far exceeds previously established bounds and has potential to solve a variety of reactivity challenges in cross-coupling chemistry.",

Channel activation requires both intracellular Ca 2+ and the signaling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ), yet the molecular basis of this dual regulation has remained unclear. Using gating molecular-dynamics simulations and structure-guided electrophysiology, we show that PIP 2 and Ca 2+ cooperatively gate TMEM16A through an allosterically coupled electrostatic network centered on the α4 helix. Specific PIP 2 headgroup phosphate interactions are essential for coupling Ca 2+ binding to channel opening, while the PIP 2 acyl chains engage hydrophobic surfaces of the helix to stabilize the open conformation. Disrupting either component of this lipid–protein interface reduces apparent PIP 2 affinity and impairs activation, whereas long-chain PIP 2 fully restores wild-type activity. These interactions act in concert with Ca 2+ -dependent structural rearrangements that widen the conduction pathway and enable Cl − permeation. Our findings establish that both the headgroup phosphates and acyl chains of PIP 2 play indispensable and complementary roles in TMEM16A gating. This mechanism defines a cooperative lipid–ion activation process that provides a general framework for understanding phosphoinositide regulation of ion channels and offers opportunities for structure-based design of TMEM16A modulators.",

          "abstract": "How thousands of microtubules (MTs) and molecular motors self-organize into spindles remains poorly understood. By combining static, nanometer-resolution, large-scale electron tomography reconstructions and dynamic, optical-resolution, polarized light microscopy, we test an active liquid crystal continuum theory of mitotic spindles in human tissue culture cells. At micron length scales, probed by optical microscopy, the continuum theory accurately captures spindle morphology and fluctuation spectra, indicating that local interactions-polymerization, alignment, diffusion, and polar transport-govern the collective behaviors of MTs in human mitotic spindles. Electron tomography data enables tests of the continuum theory at submicron scales, revealing that chromosome-attached kinetochore microtubules (KMTs) show distinctive lateral organization not explained by the coarse-grained theory, while the non-KMTs that make up the bulk of the spindle follow the theory down to ∼300 nm length scales. At length scales below ∼300 nm, fluctuations arising from the intrinsic discreteness of the microtubule ensemble dominate over the collective correlations predicted from the continuum theory. Taken together, these findings show that an active liquid-crystal theory can quantitatively capture the self-organization of human mitotic spindles on long length scales and provides a means to measure the spindle’s material properties, while also pointing to the existence of additional processes contributing to the behaviors of KMTs.",

          "abstract": "In the central region of the human retina, the high-acuity foveola is notable for its dense packing of green (M) and red (L) cones and absence of blue (S) cones. To identify mechanisms that pattern cones in the foveola, we examined human fetal retinas and differentiated retinal organoids. During development, sparse S-opsin-expressing cones are initially observed in the foveola. Later in fetal development, the foveola contains a mix of cones that either coexpress S- and M/L-opsins or exclusively express M/L-opsin. In adults, only M/L cones are present. Two signaling pathway regulators are highly and continuously expressed in the central retina: Cytochrome P450 26 subfamily A member 1 (CYP26A1), which degrades retinoic acid (RA) and Deiodinase 2 (DIO2), which promotes thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. Both CYP26A1 mutant organoids and high RA conditions increased the number of S cones and reduced the number of M/L cones in retinal organoids. In contrast, sustained TH signaling promoted the generation of M/L-opsin-expressing cones and induced M/L-opsin expression in S-opsin-expressing cones, showing that cone fate is plastic. Our data suggest that CYP26A1 degrades RA to specify M/L cones and limit S cones and that continuous DIO2 expression sustains high levels of TH to transition S-opsin-expressing cones into M/L cone fate, resulting in the foveola containing only M/L cones. Given the vulnerability of the foveola in macular degeneration and other retinal disorders, these findings provide a mechanistic framework for engineering organoids for therapeutic applications.",

          "abstract": "Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) plays a central role in glycogen metabolism. While the structure and regulation of mammalian GPs have been extensively studied, the corresponding mechanisms in gut bacterial GPs remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate GPs from Escherichia coli ( Ec GP), Segatella copri ( Sc GP), and Dorea longicatena ( Dl GP), which represent three phylogenetic clades of GPs, using enzymatic assays, cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and X-ray crystallography. We find that Sc GP forms a unique pentamer that undergoes adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent assembly into a dimer-of-pentamer, which inhibits activity by restricting substrate access to the catalytic site. Ec GP exists in equilibrium among monomers, dimers, and tetramers, with AMP promoting tetramer dissociation and enhancing catalytic efficiency. In contrast, Dl GP remains predominantly monomeric and is unresponsive to AMP. These findings uncover structural and regulatory diversity among gut bacterial GPs. Notably, the oligomeric states of GPs modulate substrate accessibility and enzyme activation, suggesting a distinct mode of allosteric regulation beyond the canonical T-to-R transition model. Because bacterial GPs contribute to the generation of glucose, their regulation may influence the composition of gut-derived metabolites that affect host glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Our study provides mechanistic insight into the structural and functional diversity of gut bacterial GPs and lays a foundation for future exploration of microbiome-mediated metabolic interactions.",

          "abstract": "Hydrogen hydrates (HH) are a unique class of materials composed of hydrogen molecules confined within crystalline water frameworks. Among their multiple phases, the filled ice structures, particularly the cubic C2 phase, exhibit exceptionally strong host–guest interactions due to ultra-short H 2 -H 2 O distances and a 1:1 stoichiometry leading to two interpenetrated identical diamond-like sublattices, one comprised of water molecules, the other of hydrogen molecules. At high pressures, nuclear-quantum effects involving both hydrogen molecules and the water lattice become dominant, giving rise to a dual-lattice quantum system. In this work, we explore the sequence of pressure- and temperature-driven phase transitions in HH, focusing on the interplay between molecular rotation, orientational ordering, lattice symmetry breaking, and hydrogen bond symmetrization. Using a combination of computational modeling based on classical and path-integral molecular dynamics, quantum embedding, and high pressure experiments, including Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction at low temperatures and high pressures, we identify signatures of quantum-induced ordering and structural transformations in the C2 phase. Our findings reveal that orientational ordering in HH occurs at much lower pressures than in solid hydrogen, by inducing structural changes in the water network and enhancing the coupling of water and hydrogen dynamics. This work provides insights into the quantum behavior of hydrogen under extreme mechanochemical confinement and establishes hydrogen-filled ices as a promising platform for the design of hydrogen-rich quantum materials.",

          "abstract": "Parasitic castration is a widespread strategy where parasites hijack host reproductive resources, yet the key molecular mechanisms driving this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we reported that parasitization by the parasitic wasp Cotesia vestalis triggers apoptosis-mediated castration in the larval testes of its lepidopteran host, Plutella xylotella . Such a phenomenon was mediated by CvBV_22-9 , a testis-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) encoded by Cotesia vestalis bracovirus (CvBV), a domesticated virus endogenized in the wasp. Similarly, a homolog of CvBV_22-9, encoded by the Microplitis manilae bracovirus, is involved in testis castration by inducing apoptosis in parasitized fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda . Mechanistically, CvBV_22-9 binds to a cell cycle checkpoint protein, Rad9A, but does not alter its tyrosine phosphorylation level. Crucially, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of Rad9A causes embryonic lethality and severe testis defects. Validation in Drosophila melanogaster shows that testis-specific expression of CvBV_22-9 or Rad9A knockdown induces apoptosis, while combined targeting synergistically enhances this effect, suggesting a conserved function of both proteins in insects. Our study uncovers a regulatory mechanism where a parasitoid wasp deploys a domesticated viral PTP that functions as a pseudophosphatase to induce Rad9A-mediated apoptosis and disrupt host testis development and spermatogenesis. This mechanism highlights a sophisticated strategy of host exploitation by parasitoid wasps, providing insights for the biocontrol of lepidopteran pests.",

We show that the coupling strength can be modulated reversibly via electrical bias or chemical redox control, enabling dynamic tuning of electromagnetic field enhancement in the ENZ layer with a modulation depth exceeding 90%.

This property is especially valuable when drops are viscous, a case where we expect super-repellency to minimize the friction associated with viscosity. Here, we report that viscous droplets on highly repellent inclines can have two modes of descent, depending on the way they are deposited: either they run at the fast speed expected for pearls or they are 30 to 60 times quicker, which defines a super-fast regime of motion. We show that this effect relies on the tenuousness of the contact with the substrate. Consequently, this contact can be dynamically “erased” by the insertion of a cushion of air, which makes droplets glide at a speed both high and independent of their viscosity. We characterize these lubricating films (thickness and onset of appearance) and finally show that super-fast pearls initiated on a superhydrophobic (SH) surface can maintain their velocity and shape even on a hydrophilic solid.",

Rodlets further assemble to form dense films where they are bundled and densely aligned, contributing to the hydrophobicity of the mycelium surface. The mechanism of this dense film formation is completely unknown. Here, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to directly observe the structural dynamics of rodlet bundling and subsequent film formation by hydrophobin RolA from the industrial fungus Aspergillus oryzae at a single-fibril level, and we revealed the film-formation mechanism. Rodlet elongation occurred at both ends and was discontinuous, alternating between periods when rodlets could elongate (growth state) and could not elongate (pause state). This suggests an equilibrium of two distinct structural states at the rodlet ends. We also identified a pathway, termed “surface-catalyzed elongation,” in which elongation is promoted by lateral interactions between bundled rodlets. Surface-catalyzed elongation decreased the energy barrier of both structural switching between growth and pause states and elongation at rodlet ends, doubling the elongation rate in bundled rodlets. The rodlet surface could be considered as a catalyst for the elongation of neighboring rodlets. Surface-catalyzed elongation could contribute to rodlet bundling, whereby rodlets tend to form oriented domain structures; our Monte Carlo simulations confirmed this. The concept we propose here provides a clear explanation of the mechanism by which rodlets form a dense coat on the cell surface.",

Underlying this ability is our understanding of how radiation is produced: Whenever an electric charge is accelerated, it radiates. Or, at least, this is how it has been hitherto universally thought. Here, we prove that quantum mechanically electric charges can be accelerated without radiating. The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple (once one knows what to do), but its reasons are deep: It relies on the fact that quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act on them, via the Aharonov–Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here is just the tip of an iceberg–it implies the need to reconsider the basic understanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far beyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation.",

Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in quantum chemistry, correlated materials, atomic physics, molecular dynamics, and quantum sensing.",

Here, we apply this strategy at the whole organism scale, establishing a predictive model of commitment to metamorphosis in Drosophila . At this critical point in animal development, the larva stops feeding and proceeds to take on the adult form. The neuroendocrine circuits governing commitment to metamorphosis assess the growth and patterning programs, eventually triggering the production of systemic hormones that terminate growth and initiate metamorphosis. Previous studies of these circuits relied on relatively static genetic perturbations and starvation experiments. Here, we take advantage of optogenetic approaches in Drosophila to flexibly perturb a key signaling node within the endocrine gland in otherwise undisturbed larvae. We used this approach to infer parameters in a compact mathematical model and demonstrate that it makes accurate predictions of larval commitment to metamorphosis.

Many studies represent this structure using static networks, where each link represents a permanent connection between two nodes. However, real interactions are generally not time-invariant and are often not pairwise. Recently, progress has been made in modeling higher-order interactions using hypergraphs, where a link may connect more than two individuals. Here, we study cooperation on temporal hypergraphs, capturing the time-varying, higher-order interactions seen in empirical systems. We find that temporal hypergraphs can promote cooperation compared with static networks, and the latter may even underestimate the cooperation-boosting effects of constrained, local interactions. We further show that cooperation can be facilitated by temporal hypergraphs with sparse components and higher-order interactions. Importantly, when the size of group interactions (hyperedges) is comparable to the population size, relatively small hyperedge sizes best facilitate cooperation. Synthetic and empirical hypergraphs alike affirm our findings, illuminating how temporal, higher-order interactions profoundly shape the evolution of cooperation.",

          "abstract": "The potential role of haplodiploid sex determination in promoting the evolution of altruism and eusociality has been the subject of intense debate for over 50 y. Different theoretical models have suggested that haplodiploidy influences relatedness in a way that either does or does not make it easier for altruism to evolve. This debate over the “haplodiploidy hypothesis” can only be resolved with a decisive empirical test that controls for potential phylogenetic bias. Here we critically examine the current state of evidence for an adaptive link between haplodiploidy and eusociality, applying phylogenetically informed methods to ensure that statistical tests reflect independent evolutionary transitions. Using data from 5,678 species, across all major insect orders, we find no evidence that haplodiploidy favors an increased rate of eusocial evolution. We show that this result is robust to: a) different analytical approaches; b) alternative ways of defining both eusociality and haplodiploidy; and c) uncertainty in eusociality assignments. Our analyses suggest that previously reported associations between haplodiploidy and eusociality are likely to have been artifacts, false-positive results primarily driven by a high transition rate to eusociality within the Hymenoptera. This high transition rate could be explained by any factor associated with that group, such as parental care, monogamy, or the possession of a powerful sting.",

          "abstract": "Samples collected from the carbonaceous near-Earth asteroid Bennu and delivered to Earth by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission contain organic molecules relevant to prebiotic chemistry. Stable isotopic measurements of extraterrestrial soluble organic matter provide critical insights into the formation pathways and alteration histories of such molecules, which hold significance for understanding the origins of life. We leverage state-of-the-art techniques for picomolar-scale isotopic analyses of amino acids in samples of Bennu and, for comparison, the carbonaceous meteorite Murchison. We report intramolecular δ 13 C values for glycine, which have not previously been measured in extraterrestrial materials; molecular-averaged δ 13 C values for amino acids, aldehydes, and ketones; and δ 15 N values for glycine, β-alanine, and D/L-glutamic acid. Intramolecular carbon isotope patterns of glycine in Bennu contrast with those in Murchison, suggesting distinct formation pathways. We explore several formation mechanisms and hypothesize that the observed glycine in Murchison formed dominantly by a Strecker-like synthesis under aqueous conditions, whereas the glycine currently found in Bennu may have formed mainly by modified radical–radical reactions in primordial ices at the cold, outer reaches of the early Solar System and retained its isotopic values throughout accretion and multiple episodes of aqueous alteration. This hypothesis is supported by the highly 15 N-enriched δ 15 N values in Bennu amino acids (+170 to 277‰). Differences in the δ 15 N values of D- and L-glutamic acid (Δ = 87‰) in Bennu affirm published reports of enantiomeric differences in meteoritic amino acids and challenge the assumption of isotopic uniformity between amino acid chiral pairs.",

Our data showed that COVID-19-induced pulmonary hypoxia triggered systemic hypoxia and markedly augmented VEGF expression levels in the retina and plasma. High VEGF levels altered vascular structures and functions in the retina, resulting in neovascularization, vascular disorganization, and increased leakiness. We deployed a terminology of coviretinopathy to accurately describe these COVID-19-induced pathological changes in the retina. Consequently, blocking VEGF by a specific neutralizing antibody (VEGF blockade) completely ablated the COVID-19-associated vascular changes in the retina.

We here engineer megakaryocytes encapsulating oncolytic adenovirus type 5 (M-Ad5) to produce oncolytic platelets in vivo by leveraging the thrombopoiesis process. Upon intravenous administration, M-Ad5 travels through the lungs, where it can release OVs-harbored therapeutic platelets into circulation under pulmonary turbulence microenvironments. Under the shelter of platelets, OVs resist inactivation by neutralizing antibodies and actively target widespread noninjectable cancer lesions. Intravenous infusion of M-Ad5 to mice with A549 lung cancer could significantly inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival. In multiple mouse tumor models, M-Ad5 induced a robust antitumor immune response by reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and potentiated the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors by recruiting more immune cells. We demonstrated that M-Ad5 in combination with PDL1 inhibitors activated tumor antigen-specific CD8 + T cells and memory T cells, thereby suppressing the growth of CT26 colorectal cancer metastasis, and preventing postsurgical B16F10 cancer recurrence and metastatic spread, as well as providing long-term immune protection against the rechallenged tumors.",

          "abstract": "Growth factor receptor signaling is a critical component of tissue growth, homeostasis, and wound healing. However, receptor desensitization limits the use of exogenous growth factors as a restorative agent therapeutically. An example of this is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the corneal epithelium. Despite laboratory data indicating that EGFR activity accelerates corneal re-epithelialization in mice and rabbits, the clinical administration of EGF to damaged corneal epithelium has limited impact due to the attenuated signaling that occurs following sustained growth factor administration. We hypothesized that inhibition of receptor desensitization would prolong receptor activity and enhance tissue homeostasis. Having previously identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase, c-Cbl, as a key negative regulator of EGFR signaling in the corneal epithelium, we have developed a class of small molecule inhibitors of EGFR binding to CBL family proteins using virtual screening with experimental validation. Through multiple rounds of structural optimization, we have identified compound 3-120. This compound was designed to compete with phosphotyrosine 1045 of the EGFR for binding to c-Cbl. Compound 3-120 binds to c-Cbl with an ~10-fold higher affinity than phosphoEGFR, reduces EGFR ubiquitylation by 40%, and increases the magnitude of ligand-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation by 30 to 40%. Ultimately, this compound can enhance the restoration of corneal epithelial debridement wounds. Thus, compound 3-120 is an antagonist that specifically disrupts EGFR ubiquitylation to sustain receptor signaling.",

We demonstrate that the nsP2 protein of Sindbis virus (SINV), the prototype alphavirus, functions as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Using a SINV mutant (2V) that prevents cleavage at the nsP2–nsP3 junction, we show that proper proteolytic processing to release mature nsP2 is essential for efficient viral replication in mosquitoes with intact RNAi pathways. Replication defects in the 2V mutant were rescued in Dicer-2 ( Dcr-2 ) null mutant mosquitoes or by expressing the mature nsP2 protein. Biochemical assays revealed that recombinant nsP2 directly binds double-stranded RNA and inhibits Dicer-mediated processing into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Furthermore, mosquitoes infected with the 2V mutant exhibited higher ratios of virus-derived siRNAs per viral RNA compared to wild-type infections, confirming that mature nsP2 suppresses the RNAi response. Our findings provide compelling evidence that nsP2 antagonizes RNA silencing in mosquito vectors, representing a critical adaptation that facilitates alphavirus replication.",

However, the molecular mechanisms controlling gustatory decisions in mosquitoes are largely unknown. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel, Painless1 (Pain1), is an intriguing candidate for participating in Ae. aegypti taste since pain1 transcripts are detected in gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). The Drosophila homolog, painless ( pain ) is also expressed in GRNs, where it is required for sensing allyl-isothiocyanate. Here, to identify additional gustatory roles for pain homologs, we first focused on Drosophila pain , which is widely expressed in multiple GRN classes. We demonstrated that pain mutations eliminated gustatory attraction to low fatty acids levels, repulsion to high levels, and fatty acid-induced action potentials. The attraction and repulsion depended on pain expression in different GRN classes. In contrast to Drosophila , when Aedes contacts fatty acids, they induce gustatory rejection only. Aedes pain1 is expressed in taste organs, and is required for gustatory avoidance of fatty acids, and for fatty acid-induced action potentials. Given that Pain homologs are found in insects but not vertebrates, Pain1 represents an intriguing target for developing repellents to diminish biting, and transmission of infectious agents by mosquito disease vectors.",

We use a combinatorial analysis of NMR and MS/MS with an updated bioinformatic pipeline to pair MSDIN genes to leaderless peptides in Amanita phalloides , a European species spreading in California. Leaderless MSDIN transcripts are expressed several orders of magnitude more than most canonical MSDINs, with significantly higher expression in invasive populations.

          "abstract": "Munc13-1 is a key protein involved in priming synaptic vesicles for rapid release at the presynaptic plasma membrane. It was previously revealed that Munc13-1 cycles between at least two alternate conformations, an upright (open) molecular conformation organized as a trimer and a lateral (closed) conformation organized as a hexagon. Munc13 binds PI(4,5)P 2 , a plasma membrane phospholipid essential for vesicle docking and fusion. We report that Munc13 is recruited to PI(4,5)P 2 domains induced by a Syntaxin-1A juxta-membrane peptide in supported bilayers. Statistical analysis of the copy numbers of Munc13 within the domains suggests that Munc13 exists in clusters of three molecules, i.e., it assembles into trimers. The trimeric clusters disappear with engineered interface mutations disrupting the upright trimers in cryo-EM as well as reconstituted vesicle priming suggesting the trimers observed on bilayers are identical to the upright trimer structures. These upright trimers can also be identified by cryo-electron tomography on vesicles containing PI(4,5)P 2 and Syntaxin-1A. Clusters of 3 or more Munc13 trimers forming on PI(4,5)P 2 domains efficiently capture phosphatidylserine-containing small unilamellar vesicles via their C 2 C domains, as shown by the effect of mutations that disrupt synaptic vesicle binding in synapses. We propose a two-step model for vesicle priming: i) synaptic vesicles are captured by clusters of upright trimers of Munc13 that self-assemble within PI(4,5)P 2 enriched domains; ii) these trimers transition into lateral hexamers when vesicles have bound and the transition would be promoted when the closed conformation of Munc13 is stabilized by diacylglycerol binding, resulting from Ca 2+ -dependent hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P 2 .",

In this study, we propose a unified deep learning framework for lysine PTM site identification that integrates sequence representations derived from a protein language model with atom-level three-dimensional structural features. This framework can be consistently applied to multiple lysine PTM types using a shared modeling strategy. As an application, we used the model to predict potential PTM site on human C-type lectin domain family 12 member A (hCLEC12A) and evaluated their functional relevance through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations indicate that the predicted lysine residues influence the stability and binding behavior of the hCLEC12A-antibody 50C1 complex.

A two-step, ancient whole genome triplication (paleohexaploidization) occurred at approximately the same time as the evolutionary innovation and adaptive radiation of the family during the middle Eocene. Despite its importance, the consequences of this triplication have yet to be tracked in context of the Asteraceae genome evolution. To do so, we applied a synteny oriented phylogenomic analysis of 23 Asterales genomes. We identified 16 genomic groups that date back to the common diploid ancestor of all Asteraceae. Each group underwent triplication, resulting in 48 genomic blocks (16 × 3) that collectively represent the ancestral Asteraceae genome, excluding the early-diverging lineages which do not share the second step. We then analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of the 48 genomic blocks across the Asteraceae phylogeny. We found that modern Asteraceae genomes are genetic mosaics of three progenitor genomes, shaped by genomic exchanges, chromosomal rearrangements, and gene fractionation. One hundred fifty-seven genes retained three paleohexaploid-derived syntenic paralogs across most Asteraceae species. Transcription factors and auxin-related genes are significantly overrepresented in these triplets, and expression of the paleohexaploidy paralogs is spatiotemporally differentiated. These genes are involved in the development of floral capitula, a remarkable morphological innovation of the family. The discovery of the 157 triplicated genes can direct further study to understand the evolutionary innovation, and the synteny-phylogenomic framework provides a comparative framework to characterize newly sequenced Asteraceae genomes.",

These mechanisms are fundamental to plant sexual reproduction and offer valuable insight into the molecular basis of cell–cell communication and self-recognition more broadly. Here, we leverage an independent evolution of SI in the lineage containing Phlox (Polemoniaceae) to identify the gene causing self-pollen recognition which we name Phlox drummondii Pistil Identity Receptor Kinase ( PdPIRK ). Recognition of self-pollen associates with a single genomic region containing the Phlox S -locus. We generate predictions regarding how S -loci must function and evolve to identify a single candidate gene within this S -associated region. This gene, PdPIRK , is highly and specifically expressed in the pistil and has exceptionally high polymorphism maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, two hallmarks of self-pollen recognition genes. Functional validation with gene silencing confirms that PdPIRK is necessary for self-incompatibility, and we further demonstrate allele-specific activity, confirming its role in self-pollen recognition per se. PdPIRK encodes a G-type lectin receptor-like kinase, which is a member of the same gene family as SRK , the gene controlling self-pollen recognition in the distantly related Brassicaceae.

Locally, forests tend to buffer temperatures, cooling in warm conditions and warming in cold ones. In regions that naturally support dense forest cover, trees contribute to global cooling primarily through carbon uptake, with some offsetting from albedo-related warming. By enhancing rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, and cloud formation, forests also influence the hydrological cycle, lowering flood risks in humid regions but often reducing downstream water availability, especially in drier climates. Collectively, these interacting processes show that the greatest climate benefits occur where forests are native, highlighting their importance for both climate adaptation and mitigation.",

Increased neuronal activity during early demyelination exacerbates myelin damage, whereas reducing neuronal activity mitigates myelin swelling in both zebrafish and mice.

          "abstract": "New particle formation (NPF) represents a major source of tropospheric fine aerosols. A common viewpoint is that NPF hinges thermodynamically on the volatility of condensing species and is unfavorable at high temperatures. From an intensive field campaign, we observed frequent NPF events during a heat wave. Size-resolved chemical composition of nanoparticles down to 3 nanometers was first measured, unraveling a dominant presence of carboxylic acids. Our work uncovers a spontaneous mechanism to produce supramolecular nanoparticles through self-assembly of organic acids. This discovery explains not only the unexpected NPF at high temperatures but also its ubiquitous occurrence under diverse atmospheric conditions. As global warming leads to more frequent and intense heat waves, our findings open avenues for assessing the impacts of aerosols on cloud formation, public health, and climate.",

We used synthetic coevolution to engineer new interactions between naïve surfaces, simulating the de novo formation of protein complexes. We isolated seven distinct structural families of protein Z-domain complexes and found that synthetic complexes explore multiple shallow energy wells through ratchet-like docking modes, whereas complexes formed by natural binding sites converged in a deep energy well with a relatively fixed geometry. Epistasis analysis of a machine learning–estimated fitness landscape revealed “seed” contacts between binding partners that anchored the earliest stages of encounter complex formation. Our results suggest that “silent” surfaces have a shallower energy landscape than natural binding sites, disfavoring tight binding, likely owing to evolutionary counterselection.",

We evaluate the effectiveness of this large-scale conservation action by assessing fish communities across mainstem habitats before and after the ban (2018 to 2023). The seven-decadal biodiversity loss was halted with improvements in fish biomass, body condition, species diversity, and initial recovery of threatened species. Eliminating fishing pressure was likely key to this recovery, in addition to actions targeting water quality improvement, hydrological and riparian habitat restoration, and vessel traffic reduction.

Here, we report a methyltransferase, OVERACHIEVER, that methylates the peptidyl transferase center of the 25 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Residue m 3 U2952 promotes functional tSpm binding to a specific site connecting the P-site transfer RNA (tRNA) with rRNA residues in the peptidyl transferase center. This interaction enhances the translation of SACLs but inhibits that of LHW.

Etv3 deficiency exacerbated TLR7-driven systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)–like disease, supporting the reported genetic association of human ETV3 with SLE. Etv3-deficient migDCs up-regulated multiple costimulatory molecules, including OX40 ligand (OX40L/TNFSF4), whose blockade partially rescued the T reg cell abnormalities.

These appressoria develop semipermeable cell walls and accumulate osmolytes internally to create turgor by osmosis. Although melanin is known to be important for turgor generation, the mechanism underlying wall semipermeability remains unclear. By using reverse genetics, we identified that the enzymes PKS2 and PBG13 are required for forming the semipermeable barrier in fungi causing anthracnose and rice blast diseases. These enzymes synthesize 3,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid polymers that are essential for pathogenicity. These polymers reduce cell wall permeability and generate turgor, independently of melanization. Our findings uncover a mechanism of fungal turgor generation, linking enzyme function to pathogen penetration and disease potential, presenting new targets for disease control.",

We identified a poxvirus effector, myxoma virus M3.1, which elicited an antiviral nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) response. NF-κB was unleashed by an ETI pathway that sensed M3.1 attack of two antiviral complexes: zinc finger antiviral protein and TBK1. NF-κΒ activation occurred because the proteins inhibited by M3.1—N4BP1, ZC3H12A, and TBK1—are negative regulators of NF-κB.

Designed with sustainability in mind, the system operates solvent-free and remains compatible with aqueous environments while overcoming one of the field’s greatest hurdles: the controlled extraction and transfer of stored heat.

Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we uncover ILF3 as an RNA binding protein connecting cytoplasmic mRNA decay and transcription during TA and show that it is required for a range of TA substrates. ILF3 is enriched at adapting genes’ RNAs, and its artificial recruitment through dCas13 promotes gene expression. Using tiling oligonucleotide screens, we identify trigger RNA fragments that activate adapting genes when introduced into cells.

          "abstract": "Efficient heat dissipation is fundamentally limited by intrinsic scattering mechanisms that cap the thermal conductivity of metallic materials such as copper to ~400 watts per meter-kelvin. Here we report the experimental realization of single-crystalline θ-phase tantalum nitride (θ-TaN), a metastable transition metal nitride predicted to overcome this limitation. We measured a room-temperature thermal conductivity of ~1100 watts per meter-kelvin, nearly three times that of copper. Synchrotron-based inelastic x-ray scattering revealed a distinctive phonon band structure with a large acoustic-optical gap and phonon bunching, which suppress phonon-phonon scattering. Ultrafast optical spectroscopy confirmed exceptionally weak electron-phonon coupling and validated first-principles calculations. These findings redefine the thermal transport limits of metallic materials and open new opportunities for advancing thermal management in electronics and power systems.",

          "abstract": "Environmental adaptation often involves a shift in energy utilization toward mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, which requires carnitine. Besides dietary sources of animal origin, carnitine biosynthesis from trimethyllysine (TML) is essential, particularly for those who consume plant-based diets; however, its molecular regulation and physiological role remain elusive. Here, we identify SLC25A45 as a mitochondrial TML carrier that controls carnitine biosynthesis and fuel switching. SLC25A45 deficiency decreased the carnitine pool and impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, shifting reliance to carbohydrate metabolism. Slc25a45 -deficient mice were cold-intolerant and resistant to lipid mobilization by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), rendering them resistant to adipose tissue loss. Our study suggests that mitochondria serve as a regulatory checkpoint in fuel switching, with implications for metabolic adaptation and the efficacy of GLP-1RA–based anti-obesity therapy.",

Here, we reported the prospective associations of five dietary patterns with mortality and life expectancy in 103,649 UK Biobank participants.

Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010, Alternate Mediterranean Diet (AMED), healthful Plant-based Diet Index (hPDI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, and Diabetes Risk Reduction Diet (DRRD) were associated with lower all-cause mortality and longer life expectancy, with DRRD showing slightly stronger associations than hPDI. Compared with the bottom quintile, achieving the top quintile of dietary scores was associated with 1.9 to 3.0 years of life gained at 45 years in men and 1.5 to 2.3 years in women. The life gained was longest in DRRD for males and AMED for females. The significant associations remained when accounting for genetic susceptibility. Our findings underscore the advantages of healthy dietary patterns in prolonging life expectancy, regardless of longevity genes.",

          "abstract": "Optimizing organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance requires navigating the high-dimensional, interdependent processing parameters governing bulk heterojunction morphology. To address this, we have constructed a standardized database integrating donor/acceptor pairs, nine key fabrication parameters, and device efficiencies, consolidating over a decade of experimental results. Leveraging this resource, we developed a three-tiered machine learning framework using gradient boosting regression trees. The strategy progresses from single-parameter baseline models to stage-combined models that capture intraprocess synergies, culminating in a global nine-parameter optimization model. This final model achieves a Pearson correlation of &gt;0.9 and a success rate of &gt;80% in identifying optimal multiparameter configurations. Validation on 78 external systems, each containing a previously unseen donor or acceptor, demonstrates robust generalization with &gt;75% accuracy in predicting the optimal or secondary condition for individual parameters. This work establishes a practical, data-driven framework for accelerating the rational optimization of OPV photoactive layers.",

Presynaptic diacylglycerol (DAG), Ca 2+ , and Ca 2+ -calmodulin signaling converge on the essential synaptic vesicle (SV) priming protein Munc13-1 via its regulatory C 1 , C 2 B, and CaM-binding domains. Using brainstem-specific heterozygous mice expressing a DAG-binding-deficient Munc13-1 variant (Munc13-1 H567K ), we compared synaptic transmission in situ at glutamatergic calyx of Held synapses carrying either a single Munc13-1 H567K or a single Munc13-1 wt allele. Munc13-1 H567K/− synapses show enhanced initial strength but impaired steady-state release and slower recovery from depression. These deficits result from an increased initial abundance of fully primed SVs and a loss of activity-dependent acceleration of SV priming. Posttetanic potentiation (PTP) is strongly reduced in Munc13-1 H567K/− synapses and either increased or attenuated by C 2 B mutations that enhance or weaken Ca 2+ -phospholipid binding. Our data identify Munc13-1 as a target of presynaptic TrkB–phospholipase C–γ signaling and demonstrate that C 1 and C 2 B domain-dependent regulation of Munc13-1 determines synaptic strength and shapes short-term plasticity and PTP.",

We show that VapC36 interacts with cognate and noncognate antitoxins. We demonstrate that serX is degraded in vitro by VapC36. We show that VapC36 binds copper, which enhances its ribonuclease activity. Furthermore, we report that deletion of vapBC36 or vapC36 enhances the susceptibility of M. tuberculosis upon exposure to copper in vitro. Compared to the wild-type strain, Δ BC36 was attenuated for growth in guinea pigs. However, deletion of either vapC36 or vapBC36 did not affect M. tuberculosis growth in mice. Compared to the wild-type strain, the in vivo susceptibility of Δ C36 and Δ BC36 strains was increased in copper-fed mice.

          "abstract": "Biogenic amines are fundamental for physiological homeostasis and behavioral control in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Monoamine neurotransmitters released in target brain regions conjointly regulate adaptive learning and plasticity. However, our understanding of these multianalyte mechanisms remains nascent, in part due to limitations in measurement technology. Here, during associative conditioning in honey bees, we concurrently tracked subsecond fluctuations in octopamine, tyramine, dopamine, and serotonin in the antennal lobe, where plasticity influences odorant representations. By repeatedly pairing an odorant with subsequent sucrose delivery, we observed individual differences in the conditioned response to odor, which occurred after a variable number of pairings (learners) or not at all (non-learners). The distinction between learners and non-learners was reflected in neurotransmitter responses across experimental conditions. The speed of learning, the number of pairings prior to a proboscis extension reflex, could be predicted from monoamine opponent signaling (octopamine-tyramine), from both the first presentation of the odorant alone, prior to any pairing with sucrose, and the first conditioned response to the odorant, coming after a number of sucrose pairings. These results suggest that monoamine signaling phenotypes may relate directly to the now widely reported socially relevant genetic differences in honey bee learning.",

          "abstract": "Anode-free sodium batteries (AFSBs) with near-theoretical energy density hold great promise for next-generation sustainable energy storage systems. However, their practical implementation is impeded by the low operating rate threshold (&lt;1 milliampere per square centimeter) and poor cycling stability, owing to dendritic sodium (Na) growth. Here, a high-rate and durable AFSB is successfully realized via a spatially anion-confined electrolyte strategy. Specifically, positively charged nanoparticles are introduced into the electrolyte to selectively anchor anions, generating localized contact ion pair–dominated solvation to facilitate rapid Na + desolvation at electrode interface and form an anion-derived solid electrolyte interphase. Meanwhile, rapid ion transport in the bulk electrolyte is maintained by the solvent-separated ion pair solvation structure in the nanoparticle periphery. These factors conjointly enable flat and dense Na deposition at high current densities. Consequently, an energy-type Na(Ni 1/3 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 )O 2 ||Al full cell exhibits an energy density of 415.6 watt-hour per kilogram cathode+anode even at 1 C (2.1 milliamperes per square centimeter) with 70.2% capacity retention over 400 cycles. A power-type Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ||Al cell achieves a trebled operation current density compared to the state-of-the-art AFSBs, exhibiting an unprecedented 5-C rate (3.8 milliamperes per square centimeter) with 70.0% capacity retention over 1400 cycles. This strategy presents a potentially universal approach for high-rate alkali metal batteries.",

          "abstract": "The genetic mechanisms of ~90% of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)–associated variants residing in noncoding DNA remain poorly understood. To address this, we developed a deep learning framework that integrates bulk histone modification data with single-cell open chromatin profiles to evaluate the regulatory potential of noncoding variants. This model identified 1457 silencer and 3084 enhancer AD-associated variants in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, classifying gene loci as silencer-only (SL), enhancer-only (EN), or dual-function (ENSL). EN loci predominantly regulate housekeeping metabolic processes, SL loci (including MS4A6A and HLA-D ) are linked to immune responses (with ~70% substantially up-regulated in AD microglia), while ENSL loci are implicated in neurofibrillary tangle assembly. Our model achieves robust power in assessing the impact of regulatory variants, with ~70% directional concordance with experimental results. It identified rs636317 as a putative causal silencer variant, distinguishing it from a neutral variant located 11 base pairs away. This study advances understanding of the AD-associated regulatory landscape and provides a framework for ascertaining noncoding variants in AD pathogenesis.",

Clinical data reveal significant down-regulation of Elovl6 in colon cancer tissues, with low expression levels correlating with unfavorable patient prognosis. We demonstrate that Elovl6 exerts potent tumor-suppressive effects, significantly inhibiting cellular proliferation in vitro and attenuating tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, it maintains intestinal microbial homeostasis by preventing the expansion of opportunistic pathogens while simultaneously orchestrating metabolic reprogramming through modulation of phospholipid biosynthesis pathways. Notably, we find that stearic acid, a key Elovl6-derived metabolite, promotes mitochondrial fusion by stabilizing mitofusin 1 protein. These findings not only position Elovl6 as a promising therapeutic target but also suggest that dietary supplementation with stearic acid could represent a viable strategy for CRC prevention and treatment.",

Using programmable optical ring vortices (Laguerre-Gaussian beams), we assemble and rotate colloidal clusters with certain particle numbers, whose induced hydrodynamic flows apply switchable in-plane and out-of-plane torques on target particles. Torque control is achieved via two mechanisms: (i) reversing the handedness of circular polarization to break rotational symmetry and (ii) displacing optical ring vortices and modulating cluster rotation speed. These complementary controls provide robust, high-resolution torques tuned in arbitrary directions. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate full three-dimensional orientation control of a single cell.

The experimental probe is the combination of a scanning nanobeam with precession electron diffraction, which offers the collection of kinematic diffraction intensity from a local area at the nanometer scale. With a precalculated, sample- and geometry-specific structure factor–based correction, the linear fitting of diffraction intensities allows the determination of the Debye-Waller factor and, thus, temperature with a precision of 10 −4 square angstrom per °C. Using graphene as a model material, this work reveals the influence of sample tilt, lattice thermal expansion, and sample thickness on Debye-Waller factor and offers a route to improving the measurement precision along with spatial resolution.

Here, we find gas vortex effects in butterfly wings that can prolong molecular residence time and apply this bioinspired mechanism to gas sensor design to resolve this trade-off. We establish a universal design rule: Periodic microcavities with diameter-to-height ratios of 1 to 1.33 generate centralized vortices that prolong molecular residence time by 85% and optimize mass transfer efficiency, as validated through computational fluid dynamics, fluorescence tracking, and Sherwood number analysis. This geometric principle enables metal oxide (ZnO, In 2 O 3 , Co 3 O 4 , and WO 3 ) sensors to achieve ultralow detection limits (0.8 to 30 parts per billion) while maintaining long-period stability. A four-channel microsensor array leveraging vortex-enhanced microstructures enables real-time profiling of human breath biomarkers.

Targeting allosteric sites can increase specificity, reduce toxicity, and allow fine-tuning of activity; however, most allosteric sites in enzymes are unmapped. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental allosteric map of the Src protein kinase. We quantify the effects of more than 50,000 single and double amino acid substitutions on activity and abundance and use thermodynamic modeling to disentangle changes in fold stability and catalysis. The comprehensive energy landscape reveals that allostery across the kinase domain is extensive, directionally biased, and modulated by its regulatory domains. Inhibitory—but not activating—allosteric mutations show a strong distance-dependent decay away from the active site. Using the map, we identify multiple potentially druggable allosteric sites not previously reported in Src or other kinases.

The present study investigated MBV-directed epigenetic modification in myeloid precursors as a potential explanation for their prolonged immunomodulatory effects. Flow cytometry and ATAC sequencing studies show that MBV are internalized by myeloid cell progenitors in the bone marrow and in macrophages after terminal differentiation. This internalization is coincident with epigenetic changes that are associated with modulation of macrophage responses to inflammatory stimuli. Furthermore, MBV treatment differentially alters chromatin accessibility as a function of cell differentiation state (i.e., myeloid progenitor versus macrophage).

Instead, heterogeneous copolymerization of 1,8-DHN with catechol or tannic acid yields materials with physicochemical properties more consistent with natural extracts. This is also supported by their enhanced antioxidant and dye/metal adsorption properties.

To gain further insight into the events that drive longitudinal growth, we combined BONCAT-based labeling of synthesized proteins with high-resolution imaging and determined that the in-series addition of sarcomeres is mediated by a process that involves transverse splitting at the Z-lines of preexisting sarcomeres.

However, recent studies suggest that the “older” indirect corticospinal pathways, mediated by spinal premotor interneurons (PreM-INs), also contribute, highlighting the need to clarify their functional differences. Here, we recorded neuronal activity from PreM-INs and CM cells in macaques during a precision grip task to compare their roles in generating hand muscle activity. Our results show that PreM-INs exert stronger facilitation across a broader set of muscles, promoting synergistic coactivation, whereas CM cells provide more selective facilitation, enabling control of relatively individual muscles. Decomposition analysis further revealed that these systems correspond to different control modes—synergy-based and individual-based control—balancing stability and flexibility. These findings redefine our understanding of primate dexterous hand control as emerging from the cooperative integration of evolutionarily distinct premotoneuronal systems.",

          "abstract": "Across metazoans, the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathway is assumed to promote organ growth. We found that genes within the IIS pathway evolved opposite roles in organ growth across wing-dimorphic insects, playing opposite roles in regulating the developmental switch between short and long wings. In the firebug, the InR-Chico-PI3K-PDK1-Tsc1/2-TORC1 cascade redirects the switch from short to long wings by inactivating IIS, whereas in the planthopper, the InR-Chico-PI3K-Akt-FoxO cascade redirects this same switch by activating IIS. Activation or inactivation of IIS results in low ecdysteroid titers in both species by regulating different genes within the ecdysteroid biosynthesis pathway, which in turn induces long wing development. Our findings reveal a negative relationship between IIS and organ growth and a mechanism for how a hormone pathway can translate opposing IIS activities into the same developmental switch across species.",

          "abstract": "The phenylpropanoid pathway is essential for plant development and environmental adaptation, producing metabolites such as flavonoids, lignin, and salicylic acid. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) catalyzes the first committed step in this pathway and has long been viewed as a cytoplasmic enzyme. Here, we reveal that PAL responds to elevated flavonoid levels in Arabidopsis by undergoing phosphorylation and relocating to the nucleus. Nuclear sequestration of PAL reduces its cytoplasmic abundance and enzymatic activity, resulting in rapid suppression of phenylpropanoid metabolic flux. In parallel, nuclear-localized PAL interacts with the transcription factor TT8, disrupting MBW complex formation and down-regulating flavonoid biosynthetic genes. This dual mechanism enables PAL to act as a metabolic feedback regulator that dynamically adjusts flavonoid production in response to internal metabolic states. Our findings redefine PAL as both a biosynthetic enzyme and a responsive integrator of cellular metabolic status, establishing a previously unknown paradigm for feedback control in plant specialized metabolism.",

Here, we report a step-confined heteroprecursor supply (sc-HPS) strategy for growth of crystalline germanium (c-Ge) QDs at predefined step edges within planar ultrathin silicon nanowire (SiNW) channels, eliminating the need for high-resolution lithography. Unlike conventional in-plane solid-liquid-solid growth using a uniform amorphous silicon precursor, sc-HPS uses a spatially confined amorphous germanium (a-Ge) layer defined by oblique patterning of a SiO 2 /a-Ge stack. This restricts Ge supply to a narrow strip along the step edge, enabling nucleation and tunable QD diameters of ~25 to 150 nm, sandwiched between two epitaxially connected SiNWs. The SiNW/Ge-QD/SiNW heterostructure forms a Si/Ge interface that provides three-dimensional hole confinement. Single-hole transistors fabricated from these structures exhibit clear Coulomb oscillations and well-defined Coulomb diamonds up to 50 K, demonstrating single-hole charging behavior. This scalable and lithography-free approach enables previously unexplored opportunities in hole-based quantum devices and nanoelectronic architectures.",

Second-order fluctuations indicate event clustering. These observations contradict periodic or quasiperiodic recurrence models. Comparisons with paleoseismic data from other tectonic settings and realistic synthetic catalogs confirm the robustness and broad applicability of these findings.

Here we show that larval deep-sea fishes have “hybrid” photoreceptors, expressing cone-specific genes in rod-like cells. Through development, they either retain these rod-like cones (in Maurolicus mucronatus ) or transition to true rods expressing rod-specific genes and transcription factors (in Vinciguerria mabahiss and Benthosema pterotum ). Unlike most marine fish larvae, which inhabit brightly lit waters, deep-sea fish larvae experience deeper and dimmer environments. By combining rod-like morphology with cone-like molecular machinery, hybrid photoreceptors likely maximize visual performance under such conditions. Consistently, spectral maxima predictions and environmental light estimations suggest tuning to the prevailing light environment throughout life.

Central to programming these shape transformations is the spatial alignment of microscale liquid crystal mesogens. Existing 4D printing methods for LCEs are constrained by the alignment of mesogens within 2D planes, thereby limiting the range of achievable deformation. This work presents a robotic direct-ink-writing conformal 4D printing technology that enables deposition of LCEs onto complex, nonplanar 3D substrates. An algorithm is developed to generate printing paths, point normals, and control codes to guide the motion of a six-axis robotic arm. Conformal printing is demonstrated on various surfaces with different printing paths, and the resulting shape-changing behaviors are studied to highlight the unlocked design space. Integration with 3D scanning further allows printing onto substrates with unknown geometries, such as egg surfaces, which enables applications in on-demand protective coatings and structural repair.",

We, unexpectedly, found that CBX7 formed a methylation-dependent transcriptional complex, which induced gene transcription by binding to cytokine gene promoters. CBX7 translocated to the cytosol and formed a methylation-dependent signaling complex with c-Raf, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), and casein kinase-2 (CK2)–α to generate and sustain extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling. CBX7 is an allergen-inducible gene. Genetic and pharmacologic interventions established an essential role for CBX7 for the production of cytokines by mouse and asthmatic patient lymphoid cells, and for the induction of allergic asthma in multiple mouse models. RNA sequencing demonstrated a large-scale loss and gain in gene transcription in Cbx7 −/− T cells. The top down-regulated pathways included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, asthma, and T helper cell differentiation. CBX7 induction of the transcriptional activation complex and methylation of the ERK1/2 signalosome was specific for lymphoid cells as they were absent in epithelial cells.

Modifying the postbuckling configurations or their snapping transitions would greatly expand design possibilities, yet general principles for controlling elastic instabilities are lacking. Here, we show that adding a partial cut, or slit, to a flexible beam enables precise control of postbuckling behavior: Under compression, slit-beams first buckle and then snap, leading to tristability within the hysteretic regime. A truss model explains these phenomena by uncovering the interplay of geometric and slit-induced nonlinearities. Leveraging these insights, we realize multislit beams with programmable behavior, unlocking a vast design space featuring giant hysteresis, quadstability, multistep snapping, tristability at zero compression, and compression-induced snapping between left- and right-buckled states. Our strategy is general, simple to design and implement, and enables mechanical metamaterials and devices with advanced memory and sequential behavior.",

We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics.

The neuronal membrane–associated periodic skeleton (MPS), an actin spectrin–based cytoskeletal lattice, is known to restrict clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in axons, but its broader role in other neuronal compartments and endocytic pathways remains unclear. Here, we show that all four major endocytic pathways—CME, caveolin-, flotillin-, and fast endophilin–mediated endocytosis—are spatially gated by the MPS and occur exclusively within MPS-free “clearing” zones throughout all neuronal compartments. Disrupting the MPS broadly enhances both basal and ligand-induced endocytosis. We also identify a previously unknown feedback loop in which ligand-triggered endocytosis activates extracellular signal–regulated kinase signaling, promoting protease-mediated spectrin cleavage and MPS disruption, which in turn facilitates further endocytosis. Furthermore, the MPS limits amyloid precursor protein endocytosis, thereby suppressing Aβ42 production and linking MPS integrity to neurodegeneration.

          "abstract": "Entangled quantum states are essential ingredients for many quantum technologies, but they must be validated before they are used. As a full characterization is prohibitively resource intensive, recent work has focused on developing methods to efficiently extract a few parameters of interest, in a so-called verification framework. Most existing approaches are based on preparing an ensemble of nominally identical and independently distributed (IID) quantum states and then measuring each copy of the ensemble. However, this leaves no states left for the intended quantum tasks and the IID assumptions do not always hold experimentally. To overcome these challenges, we experimentally implement quantum state certification (QSC), which measures only a subset of the ensemble, certifying the fidelity of multiple copies of the remaining states. We use active optical switches to randomly sample from sources of two-photon Bell states and three-photon GHZ (Greenberger-Horn-Zeilinger) states, reporting statistically sound fidelities in real time without destroying the entire ensemble. In addition, our QSC protocol removes the assumption that the states are identically distributed (but still assumes independent copies); can achieve close N −1 scaling, in the number of states measured N ; and can be implemented in a device-independent manner. Together, these benefits make our QSC protocol suitable for benchmarking large-scale quantum computing devices and deployed quantum communication setups relying on entanglement in both standard and adversarial situations.",

          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by α-synuclein accumulation and dopaminergic neuron degeneration, with dopamine (DA) oxidation emerging as a key pathological driver. However, the mechanisms underlying this neurotoxic process remain unclear. Using PD patient-derived and CRISPR-engineered induced pluripotent stem cell midbrain dopaminergic neurons lacking DJ-1, we identified defective sequestration of cytosolic DA into synaptic vesicles, which culminated in DA oxidation and α-synuclein pathology. In-depth proteomics, state-of-the-art imaging, and ultrasensitive DA probes uncovered that decreased vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) protein and function impaired vesicular DA uptake, resulting in reduced vesicle availability and abnormal vesicle morphology. Furthermore, VMAT2 activity and vesicle endocytosis are processes dependent on adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), which is notably reduced in DJ-1–deficient dopaminergic neurons. ATP supplementation restored vesicular function and alleviated DA-related pathologies in mutant dopaminergic neurons. This study reveals an ATP-sensitive mechanism that regulates DA homeostasis through VMAT2 and vesicle dynamics in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, highlighting enhanced DA sequestration as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD.",

          "abstract": "The alarming rates of deaths due to opioid overdose present an urgent need for safer opioid analgesics. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of opioid receptors (ORs) offer a promising approach to enhance opioid efficacy while reducing risks of overdose. In this study, we unveil the selective mechanism of PAM modulation of the OR family through structure elucidation of the δ-opioid receptor and μ-opioid receptor (μOR) bound to orthosteric agonists and PAMs BMS986187 (BMS187) and BMS986122 (BMS122). In addition, we uncovered an unexpected but conserved allosteric site across the transmembrane helices TM2 to TM4 of ORs, occupied by BMS187 but not BMS122. Leveraging these structural insights, we designed 9-(5-(4-chlorophenyl)furan-2-yl)-3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-3,4,5,6,7,9-hexahydro-1 H -xanthene-1,8(2 H )-dione (MPAM-15), whose αβ cooperativity factor is 33-fold higher than BMS122 and threefold higher than BMS187, indicating markedly stronger positive allosterism. Animal studies demonstrate that MPAM-15 shows excellent brain penetration and enhances morphine-induced antinociception without exacerbating respiratory depression or constipation. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that MPAM-15 promotes and stabilizes the conformational equilibrium of μOR toward the canonical active state, providing a mechanistic basis for its enhanced allosteric potency. These discoveries substantially advance our understanding of OR allosteric mechanism and pave the way for the structure-based development of allosteric opioid analgesics.",

This study reveals a reciprocal regulatory relationship between TOPPs and ethylene insensitive 2 (EIN2)–mediated ethylene signaling. We identified that ethylene can induce TOPPs ’ expression, and topp1/4/5 mutants exhibited partial ethylene insensitivity with reduced EIN3 protein. Mechanistically, TOPPs function upstream of EIN2 and interact with its carboxyl-terminal domain (CEND) to dephosphorylate the S655 residue. This site-specific dephosphorylation promotes EIN2 stability and EIN2 CEND nuclear accumulation, thereby activating ethylene responses. Notably, EIN2 S655A -YFP/ein2-5 plants displayed constitutive ethylene responses and improved salt tolerance. Further investigation showed that EIN3/EIN3 like 1 (EIL1) activates TOPPs ’ expression by binding to their promoters, amplifying ethylene signaling accordingly. Together, our finding establishes TOPPs as key regulators in ethylene signaling and reveal a dephosphorylation switch mechanism governing EIN2 function, providing critical insight into how EIN2 posttranslational modifications mediate plant stress adaptation.",

Although chemical gradients are known to drive diffusiophoretic migration of colloids, these nonequilibrium forces have largely been ignored in porous media flows. Under typical subsurface conditions, flow velocities within preferential pathways exceed phoretic velocities by orders of magnitude, suggesting that diffusiophoresis would be limited to stagnant pockets. Here, using microfluidic experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling, we show that even moderate solute gradients, typical of natural mixing, can markedly alter colloid transport. We uncover a previously overlooked effect: cross-streamline phoretic migration within preferential flow pathways, which changes macroscopic dispersion by orders of magnitude and suppresses the impact of geometric disorder on transport. Our findings challenge classical models of colloid transport, highlighting the broad implications of solute gradients for technological, biomedical, and environmental applications.",

However, these boundary states are restricted to specific fixed dimensions, so they hardly facilitate cross-dimensional energy and information transport. Here, we fabricate a unique 3D photonic antiferromagnetic topological insulator with net zero magnetization that can simultaneously support different-dimensional hinge states and unpaired surface Dirac cones on neighboring facets. Owing to the chiral anomaly present in a finite-size sample, the gapless surface Dirac cone, neighbored by facets with surface Dirac masses of opposite signs, is further converted, exhibiting 2D planar one-way propagation. In conjunction with 1D hinge states, we experimentally observe a closed chiral loop for nonreciprocal hinge–surface transport across dimensions in topological photonics, similar to that theoretically proposed in 3D quantum anomalous Hall materials. Our findings enrich the chiral boundary features of 3D magnetic topological insulators and offer a topological strategy for exploring ideal cross-dimensional devices.",

Here, we investigated how circHomer1 , a brain-enriched circular RNA derived from the Homer1 gene, affects hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Our results demonstrate that circHomer1 plays a vital role in mediating the dendritic targeting of messenger RNAs that encode postsynaptic proteins by acting as a molecular bridge between the motor protein Kinesin 1 and core components of neuronal ribonucleoprotein granules, including Fused in Sarcoma and Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, at dendrites. This interaction influences synaptic function, the structural morphology of dendritic spines, and hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory.

Mechanistically, thymic involution is driven by several factors, including hormonal modifications and chronic inflammation, leading to functional changes in the hematopoietic and stromal compartments. These progressive changes alter the cross-talk between developing T cells and thymic epithelial cells, which is pivotal for thymic function. Promising strategies to counteract thymic involution and rejuvenate immune T cell function have been recently identified. This review summarizes key insights into the underlying mechanisms of thymic involution and discusses current and emerging rejuvenation strategies to restore thymic function.

Electrophysiology shows that ivermectin activates GlyR even with strychnine present. Structures with both ligands reveal intermediate states featuring a desensitized TMD and an ECD between closed and desensitized conformations, providing insights into domain cooperativity and ligand efficacy. Molecular dynamics simulations show how ivermectin affects strychnine dynamics.
