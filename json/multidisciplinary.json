          "abstract": "The quantum-mechanical nuclear-shell structure determines the stability and limits of the existence of the heaviest nuclides with large proton numbers Z ≳ 100 (refs. 1–3 ). Shell effects also affect the sizes and shapes of atomic nuclei, as shown by laser spectroscopy studies in lighter nuclides 4 . However, experimental information on the charge radii and the nuclear moments of the heavy actinide elements, which link the heaviest naturally abundant nuclides with artificially produced superheavy elements, is sparse 5 . Here we present laser spectroscopy measurements along the fermium ( Z = 100) isotopic chain and an extension of data in the nobelium isotopic chain ( Z = 102) across a key region. Multiple production schemes and different advanced techniques were applied to determine the isotope shifts in atomic transitions, from which changes in the nuclear mean-square charge radii were extracted. A range of nuclear models based on energy density functionals reproduce well the observed smooth evolution of the nuclear size. Both the remarkable consistency of model prediction and the similarity of predictions for different isotopes suggest a transition to a regime in which shell effects have a diminished effect on the size compared with lighter nuclei.",

          "abstract": "Sleep is integral to cardiovascular health1,2. Yet, the circuits that connect cardiovascular pathology and sleep are incompletely understood. It remains unclear whether cardiac injury influences sleep and whether sleep-mediated neural outputs contribute to heart healing and inflammation. Here we report that in humans and mice, monocytes are actively recruited to the brain after myocardial infarction (MI) to augment sleep, which suppresses sympathetic outflow to the heart, limiting inflammation and promoting healing. After MI, microglia rapidly recruit circulating monocytes to the brain’s thalamic lateral posterior nucleus (LPN) via the choroid plexus, where they are reprogrammed to generate tumour necrosis factor (TNF). In the thalamic LPN, monocytic TNF engages Tnfrsf1a-expressing glutamatergic neurons to increase slow wave sleep pressure and abundance. Disrupting sleep after MI worsens cardiac function, decreases heart rate variability and causes spontaneous ventricular tachycardia. After MI, disrupting or curtailing sleep by manipulating glutamatergic TNF signalling in the thalamic LPN increases cardiac sympathetic input which signals through the β2-adrenergic receptor of macrophages to promote a chemotactic signature that increases monocyte influx. Poor sleep in the weeks following acute coronary syndrome increases susceptibility to secondary cardiovascular events and reduces the heart’s functional recovery. In parallel, insufficient sleep in humans reprogrammes β2-adrenergic receptor-expressing monocytes towards a chemotactic phenotype, enhancing their migratory capacity. Collectively, our data uncover cardiogenic regulation of sleep after heart injury, which restricts cardiac sympathetic input, limiting inflammation and damage.",

          "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in the tumour suppressor APC are an initial step in intestinal tumorigenesis 1,2 . APC -mutant intestinal stem cells outcompete their wild-type neighbours through the secretion of Wnt antagonists, which accelerates the fixation and subsequent rapid clonal expansion of mutants 3–5 . Reports of polyclonal intestinal tumours in human patients and mouse models appear at odds with this process 6,7 . Here we combine multicolour lineage tracing with chemical mutagenesis in mice to show that a large proportion of intestinal tumours have a multiancestral origin. Polyclonal tumours retain a structure comprising subclones with distinct Apc mutations and transcriptional states, driven predominantly by differences in KRAS and MYC signalling. These pathway-level changes are accompanied by profound differences in cancer stem cell phenotypes. Of note, these findings are confirmed by introducing an oncogenic Kras mutation that results in predominantly monoclonal tumour formation. Further, polyclonal tumours have accelerated growth dynamics, suggesting a link between polyclonality and tumour progression. Together, these findings demonstrate the role of interclonal interactions in promoting tumorigenesis through non-cell autonomous pathways that are dependent on the differential activation of oncogenic pathways between clones.",

          "abstract": "Additive manufacturing is an expanding multidisciplinary field encompassing applications including medical devices1, aerospace components2, microfabrication strategies3,4 and artificial organs5. Among additive manufacturing approaches, light-based printing technologies, including two-photon polymerization6, projection micro stereolithography7,8 and volumetric printing9,10,11,12,13,14, have garnered significant attention due to their speed, resolution or potential applications for biofabrication. Here we introduce dynamic interface printing, a new 3D printing approach that leverages an acoustically modulated, constrained air–liquid boundary to rapidly generate centimetre-scale 3D structures within tens of seconds. Unlike volumetric approaches, this process eliminates the need for intricate feedback systems, specialized chemistry or complex optics while maintaining rapid printing speeds. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique across a broad array of materials and intricate geometries, including those that would be impossible to print with conventional layer-by-layer methods. In doing so, we demonstrate the rapid fabrication of complex structures in situ, overprinting, structural parallelization and biofabrication utility. Moreover, we show that the formation of surface waves at the air–liquid boundary enables enhanced mass transport, improves material flexibility and permits 3D particle patterning. We, therefore, anticipate that this approach will be invaluable for applications where high-resolution, scalable throughput and biocompatible printing is required.",

Yet, despite this region having a large influence on the subsequent development of Europe and Asia, questions remain regarding its hunter-gatherer past and its formation of expansionist mobile steppe societies 3–5 . Here we present new genome-wide data for 131 individuals from 38 archaeological sites spanning 6,000 years. We find a strong genetic differentiation between populations north and south of the Caucasus mountains during the Mesolithic, with Eastern hunter-gatherer ancestry 4,6 in the north, and a distinct Caucasus hunter-gatherer ancestry 7 with increasing East Anatolian farmer admixture in the south. During the subsequent Eneolithic period, we observe the formation of the characteristic West Eurasian steppe ancestry and heightened interaction between the mountain and steppe regions, facilitated by technological developments of the Maykop cultural complex 8 . By contrast, the peak of pastoralist activities and territorial expansions during the Early and Middle Bronze Age is characterized by long-term genetic stability. The Late Bronze Age marks another period of gene flow from multiple distinct sources that coincides with a decline of steppe cultures, followed by a transformation and absorption of the steppe ancestry into highland populations.",

In March 2024, clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) virus was first detected in dairy cattle in the U.S., with subsequent detection in numerous states2, leading to over a dozen confirmed human cases3,4. In this study, we employed the ferret model, a well-characterized species that permits concurrent investigation of viral pathogenicity and transmissibility5 in the evaluation of A/Texas/37/2024 (TX/37) A(H5N1) virus isolated from a dairy farm worker in Texas6. Here, we show that the virus has a remarkable ability for robust systemic infection in ferrets, leading to high levels of virus shedding and spread to naïve contacts. Ferrets inoculated with TX/37 rapidly exhibited a severe and fatal infection, characterized by viremia and extrapulmonary spread. The virus efficiently transmitted in a direct contact setting and was capable of indirect transmission via fomites. Airborne transmission was corroborated by the detection of infectious virus shed into the air by infected animals, albeit at lower levels compared to the highly transmissible human seasonal and swine-origin H1 subtype strains. Our results show that despite maintaining an avian-like receptor binding specificity, TX/37 displays heightened virulence, transmissibility, and airborne shedding relative to other clade 2.3.4.4b virus isolated prior to the 2024 cattle outbreaks7, underscoring the need for continued public health vigilance.",

          "abstract": "Anurans are characterized by a biphasic life cycle, with an aquatic larval (tadpole) stage followed by an adult (frog) stage, both connected through the metamorphic period in which drastic morphological and physiological changes occur1. Extant tadpoles exhibit great morphological diversity and ecological relevance2, but their absence in the pre-Cretaceous fossil record (older than 145 million years) makes their origins and early evolution enigmatic. This contrasts with the postmetamorphic anuran fossil record that dates back to the Early Jurassic and with closely related species in the Late Triassic (around 217–213 million years ago (Ma))3. Here we report a late-stage tadpole of the stem-anuran Notobatrachus degiustoi from the Middle Jurassic of Patagonia (around 168–161 Ma). This finding has dual importance because it represents the oldest-known tadpole and, to our knowledge, the first stem-anuran larva. Its exquisite preservation, including soft tissues, shows features associated with the filter-feeding mechanism characteristic of extant tadpoles4,5. Notably, both N. degiustoi tadpole and adult reached a large size, demonstrating that tadpole gigantism occurred among stem-anurans. This new discovery reveals that a biphasic life cycle, with filter-feeding tadpoles inhabiting aquatic ephemeral environments, was already present in the early evolutionary history of stem-anurans and has remained stable for at least 161 million years.",

          "abstract": "Approximately 3.4 million patients worldwide are diagnosed each year with cancers that harbor pathogenic mutations in one of three RAS proto-oncogenes (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS)1,2. These mutations impair the GTPase activity of RAS, leading to activation of downstream signaling and proliferation3-6. Long-standing efforts to restore the hydrolase activity of RAS mutants have been unsuccessful, extinguishing any consideration towards a viable therapeutic strategy7. Here we show that tri-complex inhibitors, that is, molecular glues with the ability to recruit cyclophilin A (CYPA) to the active state of RAS have a dual mechanism of action: not only do they prevent activated RAS from binding to its effectors, but, unexpectedly, they also stimulate GTP hydrolysis. Drug-bound CYPA complexes modulate residues in the switch II motif of RAS to coordinate the nucleophilic attack on the ɣ phosphate of GTP, in a mutation-specific manner. RAS mutants most sensitive to stimulation of GTPase activity were more susceptible to treatment compared to mutants whose hydrolysis could not be enhanced, suggesting that pharmacologic stimulation of hydrolysis potentiates the therapeutic effects of tri-complex inhibitors for specific RAS mutants. This study lays the foundation for developing a new class of therapeutics that inhibit cancer growth by stimulating mutant GTPase activity.",

          "abstract": "Although coronaviruses use diverse receptors, the characterization of coronaviruses with unknown receptors has been impeded by a lack of infection models1,2. Here we introduce a strategy to engineer functional customized viral receptors (CVRs). The modular design relies on building artificial receptor scaffolds comprising various modules and generating specific virus-binding domains. We identify key factors for CVRs to functionally mimic native receptors by facilitating spike proteolytic cleavage, membrane fusion, pseudovirus entry and propagation for various coronaviruses. We delineate functional SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding sites for CVR design and reveal the mechanism of cell entry promoted by the N-terminal domain-targeting S2L20-CVR. We generated CVR-expressing cells for 12 representative coronaviruses from 6 subgenera, most of which lack known receptors, and show that a pan-sarbecovirus CVR supports propagation of a propagation-competent HKU3 pseudovirus and of authentic RsHuB2019A3. Using an HKU5-specific CVR, we successfully rescued wild-type and ZsGreen-HiBiT-incorporated HKU5-1 (LMH03f) and isolated a HKU5 strain from bat samples. Our study demonstrates the potential of the CVR strategy for establishing native receptor-independent infection models, providing a tool for studying viruses that lack known susceptible target cells.",

          "abstract": "Lytic cell death culminates in plasma membrane rupture (PMR), which releases large intracellular molecules to augment the inflammatory response. PMR is mediated by the effector membrane protein ninjurin-1 (NINJ1)1, which polymerises and ruptures the membrane via its hydrophilic face1–4. How NINJ1 is restrained under steady-state conditions to ensure cell survival remains a mystery. Here we describe the molecular underpinnings of NINJ1 inhibition. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we determined the structure of inactive-state mouse NINJ1 bound to a newly-developed nanobody, Nb538. Inactive NINJ1 forms a face-to-face homodimer by adopting a 3-helix conformation with unkinked transmembrane helix 1 (TM1), in contrast to the 4-helix TM1-kinked active conformation2–4. Accordingly, endogenous NINJ1 from primary macrophages is a dimer under steady-state conditions. Inactive dimers sequester the PMR-inducing hydrophilic face of NINJ1 and occlude the binding site for kinked TM1 from neighbouring activated NINJ1 molecules. Mutagenesis studies in cells show that destabilisation of inactive face-to-face dimers leads to NINJ1-mediated cell death, whereas stabilisation of face-to-face dimers inhibits NINJ1 activity. Moreover, destabilising mutations prompt spontaneous TM1 kink formation, a hallmark of NINJ1 activation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that dimeric NINJ1 is autoinhibited in trans to prevent unprovoked PMR and cell death.",

          "abstract": "The circadian rhythm of the immune system helps to protect against pathogens1,2,3; however, the role of circadian rhythms in immune homeostasis is less well understood. Innate T cells are tissue-resident lymphocytes with key roles in tissue homeostasis4,5,6,7. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing, a molecular-clock reporter and genetic manipulations to show that innate IL-17-producing T cells—including γδ T cells, invariant natural killer T cells and mucosal-associated invariant T cells—are enriched for molecular-clock genes compared with their IFNγ-producing counterparts. We reveal that IL-17-producing γδ (γδ17) T cells, in particular, rely on the molecular clock to maintain adipose tissue homeostasis, and exhibit a robust circadian rhythm for RORγt and IL-17A across adipose depots, which peaks at night. In mice, loss of the molecular clock in the CD45 compartment (Bmal1∆Vav1) affects the production of IL-17 by adipose γδ17 T cells, but not cytokine production by αβ or IFNγ-producing γδ (γδIFNγ) T cells. Circadian IL-17 is essential for de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue, and mice with an adipocyte-specific deficiency in IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) have defects in de novo lipogenesis. Whole-body metabolic analysis in vivo shows that Il17a−/−Il17f−/− mice (which lack expression of IL-17A and IL-17F) have defects in their circadian rhythm for de novo lipogenesis, which results in disruptions to their whole-body metabolic rhythm and core-body-temperature rhythm. This study identifies a crucial role for IL-17 in whole-body metabolic homeostasis and shows that de novo lipogenesis is a major target of IL-17.",

This was combined with 48 matched single-nucleus RNA sequencing samples and 22 matched co-detection by indexing (CODEX) samples. To describe tumour structures and habitats, we defined ‘tumour microregions’ as spatially distinct cancer cell clusters separated by stromal components. They varied in size and density among cancer types, with the largest microregions observed in metastatic samples. We further grouped microregions with shared genetic alterations into ‘spatial subclones’. Thirty five tumour sections exhibited subclonal structures. Spatial subclones with distinct copy number variations and mutations displayed differential oncogenic activities. We identified increased metabolic activity at the centre and increased antigen presentation along the leading edges of microregions. We also observed variable T cell infiltrations within microregions and macrophages predominantly residing at tumour boundaries. We reconstructed 3D tumour structures by co-registering 48 serial ST sections from 16 samples, which provided insights into the spatial organization and heterogeneity of tumours. Additionally, using an unsupervised deep-learning algorithm and integrating ST and CODEX data, we identified both immune hot and cold neighbourhoods and enhanced immune exhaustion markers surrounding the 3D subclones. These findings contribute to the understanding of spatial tumour evolution through interactions with the local microenvironment in 2D and 3D space, providing valuable insights into tumour biology.",

          "abstract": "Cancer driver mutations often show distinct temporal acquisition patterns, but the biological basis for this, if any, remains unknown. RAS mutations occur invariably late in the course of acute myeloid leukaemia, upon progression or relapsed/refractory disease1,2,3,4,5,6. Here, by using human leukaemogenesis models, we first show that RAS mutations are obligatory late events that need to succeed earlier cooperating mutations. We provide the mechanistic explanation for this in a requirement for mutant RAS to specifically transform committed progenitors of the myelomonocytic lineage (granulocyte–monocyte progenitors) harbouring previously acquired driver mutations, showing that advanced leukaemic clones can originate from a different cell type in the haematopoietic hierarchy than ancestral clones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RAS-mutant leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) give rise to monocytic disease, as observed frequently in patients with poor responses to treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. We show that this is because RAS-mutant LSCs, in contrast to RAS-wild-type LSCs, have altered BCL2 family gene expression and are resistant to venetoclax, driving clinical resistance and relapse with monocytic features. Our findings demonstrate that a specific genetic driver shapes the non-genetic cellular hierarchy of acute myeloid leukaemia by imposing a specific LSC target cell restriction and critically affects therapeutic outcomes in patients.",

Although this is traditionally achieved through continuous direct observations1,2, an alternative solution leverages irreversible genetic changes, such as naturally occurring mutations, to create indelible marks that enables retrospective temporal ordering3,4,5. Using a multipurpose, single-cell CRISPR platform, we developed a molecular clock approach to record the timing of cellular events and clonality in vivo, with incorporation of cell state and lineage information. Using this approach, we uncovered precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during mouse embryonic development, unconventional developmental relationships between cell types and new epithelial progenitor states by their unique genetic histories. Analysis of mouse adenomas, coupled to multiomic and single-cell profiling of human precancers, with clonal analysis of 418 human polyps, demonstrated the occurrence of polyclonal initiation in 15–30% of colonic precancers, showing their origins from multiple normal founders.

Here, we characterized A/Texas/37/2024 (huTX37-H5N1), a virus isolated from the eyes of an infected farm worker who developed conjunctivitis5. huTX37-H5N1 replicated efficiently in primary human alveolar epithelial cells, but less efficiently in corneal epithelial cells. Despite causing mild disease in the infected worker, huTX37-H5N1 was lethal in mice and ferrets and spread systemically with high titres in respiratory and non-respiratory organs. Importantly, in four independent experiments in ferrets, huTX37-H5N1 transmitted via respiratory droplets in 17%–33% of transmission pairs and five of six exposed ferrets that became infected died. PB2-631L (encoded by bovine isolates), promoted influenza polymerase activity in human cells, suggesting a role in mammalian adaptation like that of PB2-627K (encoded by huTX37-H5N1). Additionally, bovine HPAI H5N1 viruses were found to be susceptible to polymerase inhibitors both in vitro and in mice. Thus, HPAI H5N1 virus derived from dairy cattle transmits by respiratory droplets in mammals without prior adaptation and causes lethal disease in animal models.",

It is highly desired yet very challenging to assemble MXene flakes into macroscopic high-performance materials in a scalable manner. Here we demonstrate a scalable strategy to fabricate high-performance MXene films by roll-to-roll-assisted blade coating (RBC) integrated with sequential bridging, providing good photothermal conversion and osteogenesis efficiency under near-infrared irradiation. MXene flakes were first bridged with silk sericin by hydrogen bonding and then assembled into macroscopic films using a continuous RBC process, followed by ionic bridging to freeze their aligned structure. The resultant large-scale MXene films with strong interlayer interactions are highly aligned and densified, exhibiting high tensile strength (755 MPa), toughness (17.4 MJ m−3) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding capacity (78,000 dB cm2 g−1), as well as good ambient stability, photothermal conversion and bone regeneration performance. The proposed strategy not only paves a feasible way for realizing the practical applications of MXene in the fields of flexible EMI shielding materials and bone tissue engineering but also provides an avenue for the high-performance and scalable assembly of other two-dimensional flakes.",

The optimal superconducting transition temperature is about 200 mK in both cases and constitutes about 1–2% of the effective Fermi temperature; the latter is comparable to the value in high-temperature cuprate superconductors12 and suggests strong pairing. The superconductor borders on two distinct metals below and above half-band filling; it undergoes a continuous transition to a correlated insulator by tuning the external displacement field.

Genomic and clinical data support a model of polyclonal-to-monoclonal transition, with monoclonal lesions representing a more advanced stage. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed extensive intercellular interactions in early polyclonal lesions, but there was significant loss of interactions during monoclonal transition.

          "abstract": "How the olfactory system detects and distinguishes odorants with diverse physicochemical properties and molecular configurations remains poorly understood. Vertebrate animals perceive odours through G protein-coupled odorant receptors (ORs)1. In humans, around 400 ORs enable the sense of smell. The OR family comprises two main classes: class I ORs are tuned to carboxylic acids whereas class II ORs, which represent most of the human repertoire, respond to a wide variety of odorants2. A fundamental challenge in understanding olfaction is the inability to visualize odorant binding to ORs. Here we uncover molecular properties of odorant–OR interactions by using engineered ORs crafted using a consensus protein design strategy3. Because such consensus ORs (consORs) are derived from the 17 major subfamilies of human ORs, they provide a template for modelling individual native ORs with high sequence and structural homology. The biochemical tractability of consORs enabled the determination of four cryogenic electron microscopy structures of distinct consORs with specific ligand recognition properties. The structure of a class I consOR, consOR51, showed high structural similarity to the native human receptor OR51E2 and generated a homology model of a related member of the human OR51 family with high predictive power. Structures of three class II consORs revealed distinct modes of odorant-binding and activation mechanisms between class I and class II ORs. Thus, the structures of consORs lay the groundwork for understanding molecular recognition of odorants by the OR superfamily.",

How aberrant dosage of X-linked genes impairs FGC development in humans remains poorly understood. FGCs of patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS), who have an extra X chromosome, provide natural models for addressing this issue3. Here we demonstrate that most human FGCs in KS are arrested at an early stage, characterized by the upregulation of genes related to pluripotency, the WNT pathway and the TGF-β pathway, along with the downregulation of genes involved in FGC differentiation. The limited KS FGCs that are capable of reaching the late stage remain relatively naive. X chromosomes are not inactivated and the dosage of X-linked genes is excessive in KS FGCs. X-linked genes dominate the differentially expressed genes and are enriched in critical biological processes associated with the developmental delay of KS FGCs. Moreover, aberrant interactions between Sertoli cells and FGCs disrupt the migration of late FGCs to the basement membrane in KS. Notably, inhibition of the TGF-β pathway improves the differentiation of KS FGCs. Our findings elucidate how the extra X chromosome impairs the development of male FGCs and reveal the initial molecular events preceding germ cell loss in KS.",

          "abstract": "Softening of the transverse optical (TO) phonon, which could trigger ferroelectric phase transition, can usually be achieved by enhancing the long-range Coulomb interaction over the short-range bonding force1, for example, by increasing the Born effective charges2. However, it suffers from depolarization effects3,4 as the induced ferroelectricity is suppressed on size reduction of the host materials towards high-density nanoscale electronics. Here, we present an alternative route to drive the TO phonon softening by showing that the abnormal soft TO phonon in rocksalt-structured ultrawide-bandgap BeO (ref. 5) is mainly induced by a substantial reduction in the short-range bonding interaction due to the Be–O bond stretching caused by an electron cloud-overlap-induced Coulomb repulsion between two adjacent oxygen ions that are arranged octahedrally around an extremely small Be ion. We further demonstrate the emergence of robust ferroelectricity in strain-induced perovskite BaZrO3 and ultrathin HfO2 and ZrO2 films6,7 grown epitaxially on lattice-mismatched SiO2/Si substrate arising from the softening of the TO phonon driven by a reduction in the short-range bonding strength of biaxial strain-induced stretching bonds. These findings shed light on developing a unified theory for ferroelectricity enhancement in ultrathin films free from depolarization fields by tailoring chemical bonds using ionic radius differences, strains, doping and lattice distortions.",

How the CNS retains such responsiveness while maintaining an immunologically unique status remains an outstanding conundrum. In searching for molecular cues that derive from the CNS and allow its direct communication with the immune system, we discovered an endogenous repertoire of CNS-derived regulatory self-peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecules at the CNS borders. During homeostasis, these regulatory self-peptides were found to be bound to MHC II molecules throughout the path of lymphatic drainage from the brain to its surrounding meninges and its draining cervical lymph nodes. With neuroinflammatory disease, however, the presentation of regulatory self-peptides diminished. Upon boosting the presentation of these regulatory self-peptides, a population of suppressor CD4+ T cells was expanded, controlling CNS autoimmunity in a CTLA-4 and TGFβ dependent manner. This unexpected discovery of CNS-derived autoimmune self-peptides may be the molecular key adapting the CNS to maintain continuous dialogue with the immune system while balancing overt autoreactivity. This sheds new light on how we conceptually think about and therapeutically target neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.",

Recent studies of antigenic variation in vivo have focused near exclusively on parasites in the bloodstream6,7,8, but research has shown that many, if not most, parasites reside in the interstitial spaces of tissues9,10,11,12,13. We sought to explore the dynamics of antigenic variation in extravascular parasite populations using VSG-seq7, a high-throughput sequencing approach for profiling VSGs expressed in populations of T. brucei. Here we show that tissues, not the blood, are the primary reservoir of antigenic diversity during both needle- and tsetse bite-initiated T. brucei infections, with more than 75% of VSGs found exclusively within extravascular spaces. We found that this increased diversity is correlated with slower parasite clearance in tissue spaces. Together, these data support a model in which the slower immune response in extravascular spaces provides more time to generate the antigenic diversity needed to maintain a chronic infection.

However, the processes of englacial water accumulation, storage and ultimate release remain poorly constrained. Here we show that a noticeable amount of the summertime meltwater mass is temporally buffered along the entire GrIS periphery, peaking in July and gradually reducing thereafter. Our results arise from quantifying the spatiotemporal behaviour of the total mass of water leaving the GrIS by analysing bedrock elastic deformation measured by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations. The buffered meltwater causes a subsidence of the bedrock close to GNSS stations of at most approximately 5 mm during the melt season. Regionally, the duration of meltwater storage ranges from 4.5 weeks in the southeast to 9 weeks elsewhere. We also show that the meltwater runoff modelled from regional climate models may contain systematic errors, requiring further scaling of up to about 20% for the warmest years. These results reveal a high potential for GNSS data to constrain poorly known hydrological processes in Greenland, forming the basis for improved projections of future GrIS melt behaviour and the associated sea-level rise 6 .",

We estimate that an area of 215 million hectares—an area greater than the entire country of Mexico—has potential for natural forest regeneration, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration potential of 23.4 Gt C (range, 21.1–25.7 Gt) over 30 years.

Here, to quantify dynamics of long-term stem cell engraftment, we sequenced genomes from 2,824 single-cell-derived haematopoietic colonies of ten donor–recipient pairs taken 9–31 years after HLA-matched sibling HCT 3 . With younger donors (18–47 years at transplant), 5,000–30,000 stem cells had engrafted and were still contributing to haematopoiesis at the time of sampling; estimates were tenfold lower with older donors (50–66 years). Engrafted cells made multilineage contributions to myeloid, B lymphoid and T lymphoid populations, although individual clones often showed biases towards one or other mature cell type. Recipients had lower clonal diversity than matched donors, equivalent to around 10–15 years of additional ageing, arising from up to 25-fold greater expansion of stem cell clones. A transplant-related population bottleneck could not explain these differences; instead, phylogenetic trees evinced two distinct modes of HCT-specific selection. In pruning selection, cell divisions underpinning recipient-enriched clonal expansions had occurred in the donor, preceding transplant—their selective advantage derived from preferential mobilization, collection, survival ex vivo or initial homing. In growth selection, cell divisions underpinning clonal expansion occurred in the recipient’s marrow after engraftment, most pronounced in clones with multiple driver mutations. Uprooting stem cells from their native environment and transplanting them to foreign soil exaggerates selective pressures, distorting and accelerating the loss of clonal diversity compared to the unperturbed haematopoiesis of donors.",

          "abstract": "Leptin is an adipose tissue hormone that maintains homeostatic control of adipose tissue mass by regulating the activity of specific neural populations controlling appetite and metabolism 1 . Leptin regulates food intake by inhibiting orexigenic agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons and activating anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons 2 . However, whereas AGRP neurons regulate food intake on a rapid time scale, acute activation of POMC neurons has only a minimal effect 3–5 . This has raised the possibility that there is a heretofore unidentified leptin-regulated neural population that rapidly suppresses appetite. Here we report the discovery of a new population of leptin-target neurons expressing basonuclin 2 ( Bnc2 ) in the arcuate nucleus that acutely suppress appetite by directly inhibiting AGRP neurons. Opposite to the effect of AGRP activation, BNC2 neuronal activation elicited a place preference indicative of positive valence in hungry but not fed mice. The activity of BNC2 neurons is modulated by leptin, sensory food cues and nutritional status. Finally, deleting leptin receptors in BNC2 neurons caused marked hyperphagia and obesity, similar to that observed in a leptin receptor knockout in AGRP neurons. These data indicate that BNC2-expressing neurons are a key component of the neural circuit that maintains energy balance, thus filling an important gap in our understanding of the regulation of food intake and leptin action.",

          "abstract": "As cancers progress, they become increasingly aggressive—metastatic tumours are less responsive to first-line therapies than primary tumours, they acquire resistance to successive therapies and eventually cause death1,2. Mutations are largely conserved between primary and metastatic tumours from the same patients, suggesting that non-genetic phenotypic plasticity has a major role in cancer progression and therapy resistance3,4,5. However, we lack an understanding of metastatic cell states and the mechanisms by which they transition. Here, in a cohort of biospecimen trios from same-patient normal colon, primary and metastatic colorectal cancer, we show that, although primary tumours largely adopt LGR5+ intestinal stem-like states, metastases display progressive plasticity. Cancer cells lose intestinal cell identities and reprogram into a highly conserved fetal progenitor state before undergoing non-canonical differentiation into divergent squamous and neuroendocrine-like states, a process that is exacerbated in metastasis and by chemotherapy and is associated with poor patient survival. Using matched patient-derived organoids, we demonstrate that metastatic cells exhibit greater cell-autonomous multilineage differentiation potential in response to microenvironment cues compared with their intestinal lineage-restricted primary tumour counterparts. We identify PROX1 as a repressor of non-intestinal lineage in the fetal progenitor state, and show that downregulation of PROX1 licenses non-canonical reprogramming.",

          "abstract": "Prokaryotic anti-phage immune systems use TIR and cGAS-like enzymes to produce 1′′-3′-glycocyclic ADP-ribose (1′′-3′-gcADPR) and cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) and cyclic trinucleotide (CTN) signalling molecules, respectively, which limit phage replication1,2,3. However, how phages neutralize these distinct and common systems is largely unclear. Here we show that the Thoeris anti-defence proteins Tad14 and Tad25 both achieve anti-cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling system (anti-CBASS) activity by simultaneously sequestering CBASS cyclic oligonucleotides. Apart from binding to the Thoeris signals 1′′-3′-gcADPR and 1′′-2′-gcADPR, Tad1 also binds to numerous CBASS CDNs and CTNs with high affinity, inhibiting CBASS systems that use these molecules in vivo and in vitro. The hexameric Tad1 has six binding sites for CDNs or gcADPR, which are independent of the two high-affinity binding sites for CTNs. Tad2 forms a tetramer that also sequesters various CDNs in addition to gcADPR molecules, using distinct binding sites to simultaneously bind to these signals. Thus, Tad1 and Tad2 are both two-pronged inhibitors that, alongside anti-CBASS protein 2 (Acb26,7,8), establish a paradigm of phage proteins that use distinct binding sites to flexibly sequester a considerable breadth of cyclic nucleotides.",

Here we analysed 38 ancient genomes and found 4 distinct population ancestries in the aurochs—European, Southwest Asian, North Asian and South Asian—each of which has dynamic trajectories that have responded to changes in climate and human influence. Similarly to Homo heidelbergensis, aurochsen first entered Europe around 650 thousand years ago2, but early populations left only trace ancestry, with both North Asian and European B. primigenius genomes coalescing during the most recent glaciation. North Asian and European populations then appear separated until mixing after the climate amelioration of the early Holocene. European aurochsen endured the more severe bottleneck during the Last Glacial Maximum, retreating to southern refugia before recolonizing from Iberia. Domestication involved the capture of a small number of individuals from the Southwest Asian aurochs population, followed by early and pervasive male-mediated admixture involving each ancestral strain of aurochs after domestic stocks dispersed beyond their cradle of origin.",

A substantial and expanding category of 3D-printing processes — sometimes called digital light manufacturing — uses patterns of light projected onto a liquid resin to trigger the liquid to solidify at defined positions, thereby forming solid structures in desired shapes. The ultimate goal is to develop these processes to rapidly print features at microscopic scales using a range of materials, with excellent surface finishes and at sizes suitable for industrial applications (potentially up to a scale of many centimetres). However, practical issues limit the speeds of current processes, and the quality of the resulting objects is reduced by the scattering, refraction and absorption of the light patterns in the liquid. Writing in Nature, Vidler and colleagues1 report a 3D-printing strategy that could solve these problems.",

Ferroelectrics are a promising option; these materials have an intrinsic polarization that can take one of two values (corresponding to the 1 and 0 bits), and an electric field can switch between them. But ferroelectric polarization tends to disappear when these materials are very thin, which is a problem in the constant march towards miniaturization1.

However, in 1990, researchers identified a key genetic determinant of inherited breast cancer risk1, which fired the starting gun for what turned out to be a four-year race to identify the underlying gene. This was achieved when Miki et al., in a 1994 paper in Science2, described a previously unknown gene in which affected individuals in high-risk families carried deleterious mutations. The work provided strong evidence that this was indeed the BRCA1 gene.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to augment humans, researchers have studied human–AI systems involving different tasks, systems and populations. Despite such a large body of work, we lack a broad conceptual understanding of when combinations of humans and AI are better than either alone. Here we addressed this question by conducting a preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis of 106 experimental studies reporting 370 effect sizes. We searched an interdisciplinary set of databases (the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, the Web of Science and the Association for Information Systems eLibrary) for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2023. Each study was required to include an original human-participants experiment that evaluated the performance of humans alone, AI alone and human–AI combinations. First, we found that, on average, human–AI combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or AI alone (Hedges’ g = −0.23; 95% confidence interval, −0.39 to −0.07). Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed AI alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when AI outperformed humans alone, we found losses. Limitations of the evidence assessed here include possible publication bias and variations in the study designs analysed. Overall, these findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human–AI collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human–AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Childhood poverty increases the likelihood of adult poverty. However, past research offers conflicting accounts of cross-national variation in the strength of—and mechanisms underpinning—the intergenerational persistence of poverty. Here the authors investigate differences in intergenerational poverty in the United States, Australia, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom using administrative- and survey-based panel datasets. Intergenerational poverty is decomposed into family background effects, mediation effects, tax and transfer insurance effects and a residual poverty penalty. The intergenerational persistence of poverty is 0.43 in the United States (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.40–0.46; P < 0.001), compared with 0.16 in the United Kingdom (95% CI = 0.07–0.25; P < 0.001) and 0.08 in Denmark (95% CI = 0.08–0.08; P < 0.001). The US disadvantage is not channelled through family background, mediators, neighbourhood effects or racial or ethnic discrimination. Instead, the United States has comparatively weak tax and transfer insurance effects and a more severe residual poverty penalty. If the United States were to adopt the tax and transfer insurance effects of its peer countries, its intergenerational poverty persistence could decrease by more than one-third.",

          "abstract": "People often rely on numeric metrics to make decisions and form judgments. Numbers can be difficult to process, leading to their underutilization, but they are also uniquely suited to making comparisons. Do people decide differently when some dimensions of a choice are quantified and others are not? We explore this question across 21 preregistered experiments (8 in the main text, N = 9,303; 13 in supplement, N = 13,936) involving managerial, policy, and consumer decisions. Participants face choices that involve tradeoffs (e.g., choosing between employees, one of whom has a higher likelihood of advancement but lower likelihood of retention), and we randomize which dimension of each tradeoff is presented numerically and which is presented qualitatively (using verbal estimates, discrete visualizations, or continuous visualizations). We show that people systematically shift their preferences toward options that dominate on tradeoff dimensions conveyed numerically—a pattern we dub “quantification fixation.” Further, we show that quantification fixation has financial consequences—it emerges in incentive-compatible hiring tasks and in charitable donation decisions. We identify one key mechanism that underlies quantification fixation and moderates its strength: When making comparative judgments, which are essential to tradeoff decisions, numeric information is more fluent than non-numeric information. Our findings suggest that when we count, we change what counts.",

          "abstract": "To understand human learning and progress, it is crucial to understand curiosity. But how consistent is curiosity’s conception and assessment across scientific research disciplines? We present the results of a large collaborative project assessing the correspondence between curiosity measures in personality psychology and cognitive science. A total of 820 participants completed 15 personality trait measures and 9 cognitive tasks that tested multiple aspects of information demand. We show that shared variance across the cognitive tasks was captured by a dimension reflecting directed (uncertainty-driven) versus random (stochasticity-driven) exploration and individual differences along this axis were significantly and consistently predicted by personality traits. However, the personality metrics that best predicted information demand were not the central curiosity traits of openness to experience, deprivation sensitivity, and joyous exploration, but instead included more peripheral curiosity traits (need for cognition, thrill seeking, and stress tolerance) and measures not traditionally associated with curiosity (extraversion and behavioral inhibition). The results suggest that the umbrella term “curiosity” reflects a constellation of cognitive and emotional processes, only some of which are shared between personality measures and cognitive tasks. The results reflect the distinct methods that are used in these fields, indicating a need for caution in comparing results across fields and for future interdisciplinary collaborations to strengthen our emerging understanding of curiosity.",

Using multiple high-frequency datasets on spending, commuting, migration, and housing, we provide global evidence that remote work has dispersed economic activity away from city centers. We label this the “Donut Effect,” which is much larger and more persistent in cities with high levels of remote work. Using detailed household microdata from the United States, we show that three-fifths of households that left city centers in big cities moved to the suburbs of the same city. This is likely explained by the rise of hybrid work, in which employees still commute to the office a few days a week. The enduring popularity of hybrid work into 2024 suggests that the Donut Effect will persist while also leaving broader metropolitan areas intact.",

          "abstract": "A country’s national income broadly depends on the quantity and quality of workers and capital. But how well these factors are managed within and between firms may be a key determinant of a country’s productivity and its GDP. Although social scientists have long studied the role of management practices in shaping business performance, their primary tool has been individual case studies. While useful for theory-building, such qualitative work is hard to scale and quantify. We present a large, scalable dataset measuring structured management practices at the business level across multiple countries. We measure practices related to performance monitoring, target-setting, and human resources. We document a set of key stylized facts, which we label “the international empirics of management”. In all countries, firms with more structured practices tend to also have superior economic performance: they are larger in scale, are more profitable, have higher labor productivity and are more likely to export. This consistency was not obvious ex-ante, and being able to quantify these relationships is valuable. We also document significant variation in practices across and within countries, which is important in explaining differences in the wealth of nations. The positive relationship between firm size and structured management practices is stronger in countries with more open and free markets, suggesting that stronger competition may allow firms with more structured management practices to grow larger, thereby potentially raising aggregate national income.",

Using this platform, we performed a speed-dating experiment where we aligned or misaligned the facial smiles of participants in real time with face transformation algorithms. Even though participants remained totally unaware that their faces were being manipulated, aligning their smiles causally enhanced the romantic attraction they felt toward each other, compared to unaligned scenarios. Manipulations also influenced how participants synchronized and vocally reacted to each other. This paradigm causally manipulates the emergence of romantic attraction in free social interactions. Moreover, our methodology opens the possibility to perform causal inferences during free social interactions.",

          "abstract": "How are societal stereotypes transmitted to individual-level group preferences? We propose that exposure to a stereotype, regardless of whether one agrees with it, can shape how one experiences and learns from interactions with members of the stereotyped group, such that it induces individual-level prejudice—a process involving the interplay of semantic knowledge and instrumental learning. In a series of experiments, participants interacted with players from two groups, described with either positive or negative stereotypes, in a reinforcement learning (RL) task presented as a money-sharing game. Although players’ actual sharing rates were equated between groups, participants formed more positive reward associations with players from positively stereotyped than negatively stereotyped groups. This effect persisted even when stereotypes were described as unreliable and participants were instructed to ignore them. Computational modeling revealed that this preference was due to stereotype effects on priors regarding group members’ behavior as well as the learning rates through which reward associations were updated in response to player feedback. We then show that these stereotype-induced preferences, once formed, spread unwittingly to others who observe these interactions, illustrating a pathway through which stereotypes may be transmitted and propagated between society and individuals. By identifying a mechanism through which stereotype knowledge can bypass explicit beliefs to induce prejudice, via the interplay of semantic and instrumental learning processes, these findings illuminate the impact of stereotype messages on the formation and propagation of individual-level prejudice.",

          "abstract": "Do political practitioners have good intuitions about how to persuade the public? Longstanding theories that political elites’ messages have large effects on public opinion and the large sums spent to secure some practitioners’ messaging advice suggest they should. However, findings regarding the surprising limits of expert forecasts in other domains suggest they may not. In this paper, we evaluate how well political practitioners can predict which messages are most persuasive. We measured the effects of N = 172 messages about 21 political issues using a large-sample survey experiment ( N = 67 , 215 respondent-message observations). We then asked both political practitioners ( N = 1 , 524 practitioners, N = 22 , 763 predictions) and laypeople ( N = 21 , 247 respondents, N = 63 , 442 predictions) to predict the efficacy of these messages. The practitioners we surveyed ranged widely in their experience and expertise with persuasive message design. We find that: (a) political practitioners and laypeople both performed barely better than chance at predicting persuasive effects; (b) once accounting for laypeople’s inflated expectations about the average size of effects, practitioners did not predict meaningfully better than laypeople; (c) these results held even for self-identified issue experts and highly experienced practitioners; and (d) practitioners’ experience, expertise, information environment, and demographics did not meaningfully explain variation in their accuracy. Our findings have theoretical implications for understanding the conditions likely to produce meaningful elite influence on public opinion as well as practical implications for practitioners.",

          "abstract": "The hippocampus is a brain region that is essential for the initial encoding of episodic memories. However, the consolidation of these memories is thought to occur in the neocortex, under guidance of the hippocampus, over the course of days and weeks. Communication between the hippocampus and the neocortex during hippocampal sharp wave-ripple oscillations is believed to be critical for this memory consolidation process. Yet, the synaptic and circuit basis of this communication between brain areas is largely unclear. To address this problem, we perform in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the frontal neocortex and local field potential recordings in CA1 of head-fixed mice exposed to a virtual-reality environment. In mice trained in a goal-directed spatial task, we observe a depolarization in frontal principal neurons during hippocampal ripple oscillations. Both this ripple-associated depolarization and goal-directed task performance can be disrupted by chemogenetic inactivation of somatostatin-positive (SOM + ) interneurons. In untrained mice, a ripple-associated depolarization is not observed, but it emerges when frontal parvalbumin-positive (PV + ) interneurons are inactivated. These results support a model where SOM + interneurons inhibit PV + interneurons during hippocampal activity, thereby acting as a disinhibitory gate for hippocampal inputs to neocortical principal neurons during learning.",

          "abstract": "Amino acids are present in all known life, so identifying the environmental conditions under which they can be synthesized constrains where life on Earth might have formed and where life might be found on other planetary bodies. All known abiotic amino acid syntheses require ammonia, which is only produced in reducing and neutral atmospheres. Here, we demonstrate that the Fe-bearing hydroxide mineral ferroan brucite [Fe 0.33 ,Mg 0.67 (OH) 2 ] can mediate the reaction of nitrate and glyoxylate to form glycine, the simplest amino acid used in life. Up to 97% of this glycine was detected only after acid digestion of the mineral, demonstrating that it had been strongly partitioned to the mineral. The dicarboxylic amino acid 3-hydroxy aspartate was also detected, which suggests that reactants underwent a mechanism that simultaneously produced mono- and dicarboxylic amino acids. Nitrate can be produced in both neutral and oxidizing atmospheres, so reductive amination of nitrate and glyoxylate on a ferroan brucite surface expands origins of life scenarios. First, it expands the environmental conditions in which life’s precursors could form to include oxidizing atmospheres. Second, it demonstrates the ability of ferroan brucite, an abundant, secondary mineral in serpentinizing systems where olivine is partly hydrated, to mediate reductive amination. Finally, the results demonstrate the need to consider mineral-bound products when analyzing samples for abiotic amino acid synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Humans are widely exposed to semivolatile organic contaminants in indoor environments. Many contaminants have long lifetimes following partitioning to the large surface reservoirs present indoors, which leads to long exposure times to gas-phase oxidants and multiphase chemistry. Studies have shown selective multiphase oxidation of organics on indoor surfaces, but the presence of hydroxyl radicals with nonselective reactivity and evidence of multiphase OH radical reactivity toward common indoor contaminants indicates that there may be additional unknown transformation chemistry indoors. We screened genuine indoor samples for 60 OH radical oxidation products of the common plasticizer and endocrine-disrupting contaminant bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) identified in laboratory experiments using nontargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry. At least 30 and 10 of these products are observed in indoor dust and DEHP films exposed to ambient indoor conditions, respectively, indicating that multiphase OH reactions occur indoors. Using the PROTEX model and a multimedia indoor chemical fate model, we demonstrate that these products have long indoor lifetimes and cause a higher potential for human exposure than DEHP. Some of these products are more active endocrine disruptors than DEHP itself, but most have unknown toxicities. Coexposure to all oxidation products will likely have an additive effect, leading to higher human health risks from indoor organic contaminants than previously thought. Due to the nonselective reactivity of OH radicals, it is likely that most indoor contaminants follow similar chemistry, and further study is needed to understand the prevalence and human health implications of such multiphase chemistry.",

          "abstract": "Microplastic is globally regarded as an important factor impacting biogeochemical cycles, yet our understanding of such influences is limited by the uncertainties of intricate microbial processes. By multiomics analysis, coupled with soil chemodiversity characterization and microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), we investigated how microbial responses to microplastics impacted soil carbon cycling in a long-term field experiment. We showed that biodegradable microplastics promoted soil organic carbon accrual by an average of 2.47%, while nondegradable microplastics inhibited it by 17.4%, as a consequence of the virus–bacteria coadaptations to the microplastics disturbance. In the relevant functional pathways, nondegradable microplastics significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) enhanced the abundance and transcriptional activity related to complex carbohydrate metabolism, whereas biodegradable microplastics significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) promoted functions involved in amino acid metabolism and glycolysis. Accordingly, viral lysis enhanced in nondegradable microplastics treatments to introduce more complex organic compounds to soil dissolved organic matters, thus benefiting the oligotrophs with high carbon metabolic capabilities in exploitation competition. In contrast, biodegradable microplastics enriched viral auxiliary metabolic genes of carbon metabolism through “piggyback-the-winner” strategy, conferring to dominant copiotrophs, enhanced substrate utilization capabilities. These virus–host interactions were also demonstrated in the corresponding soil plastisphere, which would alter microbial resource allocation and metabolism via CUE, affecting carbon storage consequently. Overall, our results underscore the importance of viral–host interactions in understanding the microplastics-dependent carbon storage in the soil ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "Changes driven by both unanticipated human activities and management actions are creating wicked management landscapes in freshwater and marine ecosystems that require new approaches to support decision-making. By linking a predictive model of nutrient- and temperature-driven bottom hypoxia with observed commercial fishery harvest data from Lake Erie (United States–Canada) over the past century (1928–2022) and climate projections (2030–2099), we show how simple, yet robust models and routine monitoring data can be used to identify tradeoffs associated with nutrient management and guide decision-making in even the largest of aquatic ecosystems now and in the future. Our approach enabled us to assess planned nutrient load reduction targets designed to mitigate nutrient-driven hypoxia and show why they appear overly restrictive based on current fishery needs, indicating tradeoffs between water quality and fisheries management goals. At the same time, our temperature results show that projected climate change impacts on hypoxic extent will require more stringent nutrient regulations in the future. Beyond providing a rare example of bottom hypoxia driving changes in fishery harvests at an ecosystem scale, our study illustrates the need for adaptive ecosystem–based management, which can be informed by simple predictive models that can be readily applied over long time periods, account for tradeoffs across multiple management sectors (e.g., water quality, fisheries), and address ecosystem nonstationarity (e.g., climate change impacts on management targets). Such approaches will be critical for maintaining valued ecosystem services in the many aquatic systems worldwide that are vulnerable to multiple drivers of environmental change.",

          "abstract": "Elucidating details of biology’s selective uptake and trafficking of rare earth elements, particularly the lanthanides, has the potential to inspire sustainable biomolecular separations of these essential metals for myriad modern technologies. Here, we biochemically and structurally characterize Methylobacterium ( Methylorubrum ) extorquens LanD, a periplasmic protein from a bacterial gene cluster for lanthanide uptake. This protein provides only four ligands at its surface-exposed lanthanide-binding site, allowing for metal-centered protein dimerization that favors the largest lanthanide, La III . However, the monomer prefers Nd III and Sm III , which are disfavored lanthanides for cellular utilization. Structure-guided mutagenesis of a metal-ligand and an outer-sphere residue weakens metal binding to the LanD monomer and enhances dimerization for Pr III and Nd III by 100-fold. Selective dimerization enriches high-value Pr III and Nd III relative to low-value La III and Ce III in an all-aqueous process, achieving higher separation factors than lanmodulins and comparable or better separation factors than common industrial extractants. Finally, we show that LanD interacts with lanmodulin (LanM), a previously characterized periplasmic protein that shares LanD’s preference for Nd III and Sm III . Our results suggest that LanD’s unusual metal-binding site transfers less-desirable lanthanides to LanM to siphon them away from the pathway for cytosolic import. The properties of LanD show how relatively weak chelators can achieve high selectivity, and they form the basis for the design of protein dimers for separation of adjacent lanthanide pairs and other metal ions.",

However, almost all previous observational and modeling studies have focused on the zonal mean two-dimensional AMOC feature, while recent progress in the understanding of modern AMOC reveals a more complicated three-dimensional structure, with NADW penetrating from the subpolar North Atlantic to lower latitude through different pathways. Here, combining 231 Pa/ 230 Th reconstructions and model simulations, we uncover a significant change in the three-dimensional structure of the glacial AMOC. Specifically, the mid-latitude eastern pathway (EP), located east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and transporting about half of the PD NADW from the subpolar gyre to the subtropical gyre, experienced substantial intensification during the LGM. A greater portion of the GNAIW was transported in the eastern basin during the LGM compared to NADW at the PD, resulting in opposite 231 Pa/ 230 Th changes between eastern and western basins during the LGM. Furthermore, in contrast to the wind-steering mechanism of EP at PD, the intensified LGM EP was caused primarily by the rim current forced by the basin-scale open-ocean convection over the subpolar North Atlantic. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for three-dimensional oceanographic changes to achieve more accurate reconstructions of past AMOC.",

          "abstract": "One of the first organizing processes during animal development is the assembly of embryonic cells into epithelia. Common features unite epithelialization across select bilaterians, however, we know less about the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive epithelial emergence in early branching nonbilaterians. In sea anemones, epithelia emerge both during embryonic development and after cell aggregation of dissociated tissues. Although adhesion is required to keep cells together, it is not clear whether cell polarization plays a role as epithelia emerge from disordered aggregates. Here, we use the embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to investigate the evolutionary origins of epithelial development. We demonstrate that lateral cell polarization is essential for epithelial organization in both embryos and aggregates. With disrupted lateral polarization, cell contact in the aggregate is not sufficient to trigger epithelialization and further tissue development. Specifically, knockdown of the conserved lateral polarity and tumor suppressor protein Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) disrupts epithelia in developing embryos and impairs the capacity of dissociated cells to epithelialize from aggregates. In contrast to other systems, cells in Nematostella lgl knockdown embryos do not undergo excessive proliferation. Cells with reduced Lgl levels lose their columnar shape and proper positioning of their mitotic spindles and basal bodies. Due to misoriented divisions and aberrant shapes, cells arrange nonuniformly without forming a monolayer. Together our data show that, in Nematostella, Lgl drives epithelialization in embryos and cell aggregates through its effect on cell shape and organelle localization.",

In this study, we revealed that patient-derived WDR4 mutation leads to temporal and cell-type-specific neural degeneration, and directly causes neural developmental disorders in mice. Mechanistically, WDR4 point mutation disrupts the interaction between WDR4 and METTL1 and accelerates METTL1 protein degradation. We further uncovered that impaired tRNA m 7 G modification caused by Wdr4 mutation decreases the mRNA translation of genes involved in mTOR pathway, leading to elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, and increases neural cell apoptosis. Importantly, treatment with stress-attenuating drug Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) significantly decreases neural cell death and improves neural functions of the Wdr4 mutated mice. Moreover, adeno-associated virus mediated transduction of wild-type WDR4 restores METTL1 protein level and tRNA m 7 G modification in the mouse brain, and achieves long-lasting therapeutic effect in Wdr4 mutated mice. Most importantly, we further demonstrated that both TUDCA treatment and WDR4 restoration significantly improve the survival and functions of human iPSCs-derived neuron stem cells that harbor the patient’s WDR4 mutation. Overall, our study uncovers molecular insights underlying WDR4 mutation in the pathogenesis of neural diseases and develops two promising therapeutic strategies for treatment of neural diseases caused by impaired tRNA modifications.",

          "abstract": "Active systems of self-propelled agents, e.g., birds, fish, and bacteria, can organize their collective motion into myriad autonomous behaviors. Ubiquitous in nature and across length scales, such phenomena are also amenable to artificial settings, e.g., where brainless self-propelled robots orchestrate their movements into spatial-temporal patterns via the application of external cues or when confined within flexible boundaries. Like their natural counterparts, these approaches typically require many units to initiate collective motion, so controlling the ensuing dynamics is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple mechanism that leverages nonlinear elasticity to tame near-diffusive motile particles in forming structures capable of directed motion and other emergent behaviors. Our elasto-active system comprises two centimeter-sized self-propelled microbots connected with elastic beams. These microbots exert forces that suffice to buckle the beam and set the structure in motion. We first rationalize the physics of the interaction between the beam and the microbots. Then we use reduced-order models to predict the interactions of our elasto-active structures with boundaries, e.g., walls and constrictions, and demonstrate how they can exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors such as maze navigation. These findings demonstrate that allowing and understanding changes in body morphology can enhance the capabilities of active matter systems and enable the design of robotic materials capable of space exploration, adaptation, and complex interactions with their surrounding environment.",

In this report, we confirmed in a guinea pig model of shigellosis that both S. flexneri 5a and S. sonnei induced local hemorrhages and we demonstrated that Shigella reached CD31+/CD34+ blood vessels located in the mucosa during the late stages of infection, and further disseminated in the bloodstream. These results confirmed the exposure of Shigella to plasma components during its virulence cycle. We demonstrated that all the tested Shigella strains survived plasma exposure in vitro, and we showed that Serine Protease Autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs) contribute to Shigella dissemination within the colonic mucosa and in the bloodstream. We have confirmed that SPATEs are expressed and secreted in poorly oxygenated environments encountered by Shigella during late infection stages. We further demonstrated that SPATEs promoted Shigella survival in plasma, by cleaving complement component 3 (C3), thereby impairing the complement system activation. We have shown here that the ability of Shigella to survive plasma exposure is a key factor in its virulence, both within primary foci and systemically.",

          "abstract": "How can a single protein domain encode a conformational landscape with multiple stably folded states, and how do those states interconvert? Here, we use real-time and relaxation-dispersion NMR to characterize the conformational landscape of the circadian rhythm protein KaiB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides . Unique among known natural metamorphic proteins, this KaiB variant spontaneously interconverts between two monomeric states: the “Ground” and “Fold-switched” (FS) states. KaiB in its FS state interacts with multiple binding partners, including the central KaiC protein, to regulate circadian rhythms. We find that KaiB itself takes hours to interconvert between the Ground and FS state, underscoring the ability of a single-sequence to encode the slow process needed for function. We reveal the rate-limiting step between the Ground and FS state is the cis–trans isomerization of three prolines in the fold-switching region by demonstrating interconversion acceleration by the prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A. The interconversion proceeds through a “partially disordered” (PD) state, where the C-terminal half becomes disordered while the N-terminal half remains stably folded. We found two additional properties of KaiB’s landscape. First, the Ground state experiences cold denaturation: At 4 °C, the PD state becomes the majorly populated state. Second, the Ground state exchanges with a fourth state, the “Enigma” state, on the millisecond-timescale. We combine AlphaFold2-based predictions and NMR chemical shift predictions to predict this Enigma state is a beta-strand register shift that relieves buried charged residues, and support this structure experimentally. These results provide mechanistic insight into how evolution can design a single-sequence that achieves specific timing needed for its function.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling storage lipid accumulation will inform strategies to enhance seed oil quality and quantity in crop plants. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor (WRI1 TF) is a central regulator of lipid biosynthesis. We characterized the genome-wide binding profile of soybean (Gm)WRI1 and show that the TF directly regulates genes encoding numerous enzymes and proteins in the fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthetic pathways. GmWRI1 binds primarily to regions downstream of target gene transcription start sites. We showed that GmWRI1-bound regions are enriched for the canonical WRI1 DNA binding element, the ACTIVATOR of Spomin::LUC1/WRI1 (AW) Box (CNTNGNNNNNNNCG), and another DNA motif, the CNC Box (CNCCNCC). Functional assays showed that both DNA elements mediate transcriptional activation by GmWRI1. We also show that GmWRI1 works in concert with other TFs to establish a regulatory state that promotes fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. In particular, comparison of genes targeted directly by GmWRI1 and by GmLEC1, a central regulator of the maturation phase of seed development, reveals that the two TFs act in a positive feedback subcircuit to control fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Together, our results provide unique insights into the genetic circuitry in which GmWRI1 participates to regulate storage lipid accumulation during seed development.",

However, the realization of this promise is hindered by the unavailability of generalizable ground-truth information, data incompleteness and heterogeneity, and the lack of generalization to multiple cohorts. We present here a data-driven approach to identify clinical states that we implement for 585 critical care patients with suspected pneumonia recruited by the SCRIPT study, which we compare to and integrate with 9,918 pneumonia patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. We extract and curate from their structured EHRs a primary set of clinical features (53 and 59 features for SCRIPT and MIMIC-IV, respectively), including disease severity scores, vital signs, and so on, at various degrees of completeness. We aggregate irregular time series into daily frequency, resulting in 12,495 and 94,684 patient-day pairs for SCRIPT and MIMIC, respectively. We define a “common-sense” ground truth that we then use in a semisupervised pipeline to optimize choices for data preprocessing, and reduce the feature space to four principal components. We describe and validate an ensemble-based clustering method that enables us to robustly identify five clinical states, and use a Gaussian mixture model to quantify uncertainty in cluster assignment. Demonstrating the clinical relevance of the identified states, we find that three states are strongly associated with disease outcomes (dying vs. recovering), while the other two reflect disease etiology. The outcome associated clinical states provide significantly increased discrimination of mortality rates over standard approaches.",

          "abstract": "The precise control of flowering time is of utmost importance for crop adaptation to varying environmental conditions and consequently determines grain yield and plant fitness. Soybean E2 , the homolog of Arabidopsis GIGANTEA , is a major locus contributing to high-latitude adaptation and is involved in photoperiod sensitivity. However, due to major effects of E2 , additional genetic loci controlling soybean flowering and adaptation have historically been masked and difficult to identify. Here, by eliminating the effect of E2 , we identified a Tof9 locus controlling flowering in which ZEITLUPE 2 ( ZTL2 ) is the causal gene. ZTL2 encodes an F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase with homology to Arabidopsis ZEITLUPE and is shown to play a key role in the soybean photoperiodic flowering pathway. ZTL2 physically interacts with E2 to mediate its degradation. Intriguingly, ZTL2 and FKF1, both belong to the F-box-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase family, exhibit opposite roles in regulating soybean flowering. ZTL2 degrades E2, leading to early flowering, while FKF1 stabilizes E2, resulting in delayed flowering. The balance between ZTL2-mediated degradation and FKF1-mediated stabilization enables soybeans to finetune flowering time and maximize grain yield. Field-grown ztl2 mutants are taller, flower late, and have increased yield parameters. ZTL2 and FKF1b bear contrasting artificial-selection patterns to adapt to different latitudes. This antagonistic regulation is crucial for soybean adaptation to diverse ecological settings and allows plants to fine-tune their flowering time in response to photoperiod and latitudinal changes.",

          "abstract": "The biomechanical properties of cells and tissues play an important role in our fundamental understanding of the structures and functions of biological systems at both the cellular and subcellular levels. Recently, Brillouin microscopy, which offers a label-free spectroscopic means of assessing viscoelastic properties in vivo, has emerged as a powerful way to interrogate those properties on a microscopic level in living tissues. However, susceptibility to photodamage and photobleaching, particularly when high-intensity laser beams are used to induce Brillouin scattering, poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a transformative approach designed to mitigate photodamage in biological and biomedical studies, enabling nondestructive, label-free assessments of mechanical properties in live biological samples. By leveraging quantum-light-enhanced stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) imaging contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly elevated, thereby increasing sample viability and extending interrogation times without compromising the integrity of living samples. The tangible impact of this methodology is evidenced by a notable three-fold increase in sample viability observed after subjecting the samples to three hours of continuous squeezed-light illumination, surpassing the traditional coherent light-based approaches. The quantum-enhanced SBS imaging holds promise across diverse fields, such as cancer biology and neuroscience where preserving sample vitality is of paramount significance. By mitigating concerns regarding photodamage and photobleaching associated with high-intensity lasers, this technological breakthrough expands our horizons for exploring the mechanical properties of live biological systems, paving the way for an era of research and clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "Globally, ocean dumping of chemical waste is a common method of disposal and relies on the assumption that dilution, diffusion, and dispersion at ocean scales will mitigate human exposure and ecosystem impacts. In southern California, extensive dumping of agrochemical waste, particularly chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants such as DDT, via sewage outfalls and permitted offshore barging occurred for most of the last century. This study compiled a database of existing sediment and fish DDT measurements to examine how this unique legacy of regional ocean disposal translates into the contemporary contamination of the coastal ocean. We used spatiotemporal modeling to derive continuous estimates of sediment DDT contamination and show that the spatial signature of disposal (i.e., high loadings near historic dumping sites) is highly conserved in sediments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proximity of fish to areas of high sediment loadings explained over half of the variation in fish DDT concentrations. The relationship between sediment and fish contamination was mediated by ecological predictors (e.g., species, trophic ecology, habitat use), and the relative influence of each predictor was context-dependent, with habitat exhibiting greater importance in heavily contaminated areas. Thus, despite more than half a century since the cessation of industrial dumping in the region, local ecosystem contamination continues to mirror the spatial legacy of dumping, suggesting that sediment can serve as a robust predictor of fish contamination, and general ecological characteristics offer a predictive framework for unmeasured species or locations.",

          "abstract": "Electrochemical pH-swing strategies offer a promising avenue for cost-effective and energy-efficient carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture, surpassing the traditional thermally activated processes and humidity-sensitive techniques. The concept of elevating seawater’s alkalinity for scalable CO 2 capture without introducing additional chemical as reactant is particularly intriguing due to its minimal environmental impact. However, current commercial plants like chlor-alkali process or water electrolysis demand high thermodynamic voltages of 2.2 V and 1.23 V, respectively, for the production of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) from seawater. These high voltages are attributed to the asymmetric electrochemical reactions, where two completely different reactions take place at the anode and cathode. Here, we developed a symmetric electrochemical system for seawater alkalization based on a highly reversible and identical reaction taking place at the anode and cathode. We utilize hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, where the generated hydrogen is looped to the anode for hydrogen oxidation reaction. Theoretical calculations indicate an impressively low energy requirement ranging from 0.07 to 0.53 kWh/kg NaOH for established pH differences of 1.7 to 13.4. Experimentally, we achieved the alkalization with an energy consumption of 0.63 kWh/kg NaOH, which is only 38% of the theoretical energy requirements of the chlor-alkali process (1.64 kWh/kg NaOH). Further tests demonstrated the system’s potential of enduring high current densities (~20 mA/cm 2 ) and operating stability over an extended period (&gt;110 h), showing its potential for future applications. Notably, the CO 2 adsorption tests performed with alkalized seawater exhibited remarkably improved CO 2 capture dictated by the production of hydroxide compared to the pristine seawater.",

The first four directional groups occur during a ~40 kyr period based on available astrochronology and U-Pb geochronology. The coincidence of the initial major pulse of CAMP volcanism with the ETE points to short-lived volcanic winters albedo-induced by sulfate aerosols as a plausible key agent of the extinctions in the tropical continental realm, whereas looser correlations allow prolonged CO 2 emissions to contribute to more long-ranging effects in the marine realm via ocean acidification and longer-term warming.",

In this study, we validated that de novo DDX3X variants are enriched in female developmental delay (DD) patients and mainly affect the evolutionarily conserved amino acids based on a meta-analysis of 46,612 NDD trios. We generated a ddx3x deficient zebrafish allele, which exhibited reduced survival rate, DD, microcephaly, adaptation defects, anxiolytic behaviors, social interaction deficits, and impaired spatial recognitive memory. As revealed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing and biological validations, ddx3x deficiency leads to reduced neural stem cell pool, decreased total neuron number, and imbalanced differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which are responsible for the behavioral defects. Indeed, the supplementation of L-glutamate or glutamate receptor agonist ly404039 could partly rescue the adaptation and social deficits. Mechanistically, we reveal that the ddx3x deficiency attenuates the stability of the crebbp mRNA, which in turn causes downregulation of Notch signaling and defects in neurogenesis.

          "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. C. difficile proliferates and produces toxins that damage the colonic epithelium, leading to symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea to severe pseudomembranous colitis. The host’s innate response to CDI occurs in two phases: an early phase in which neutrophils reduce the bacterial load and a late phase involving repair mechanisms to restore epithelial integrity. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are crucial in protecting the gut from CDI. Previous studies have shown that ILC3-derived IL-22 is essential in the late phase of CDI for epithelial repair and maintaining an intestinal microbiota that competes with C. difficile , preventing its expansion. Our study finds that ILC3s also protect during the early stages of CDI by sustaining neutrophils through GM-CSF. Less neutrophil production, accumulation, and activation was evident in ILC3-deficient mice than in wild-type (WT) mice, which led to exacerbated symptoms, impaired pathogen clearance, a compromised epithelial barrier, and increased mortality. The adoptive transfer of ILC3s into ILC3-deficient mice restored neutrophil responses and improved disease outcomes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that GM-CSF production by ILC3s is crucial for neutrophil production and effective resistance during CDI. Using mice lacking NKp46 + ILC3s, we found that this subset significantly contributes to GM-CSF production in CDI. These findings highlight the critical role of the ILC3-neutrophil connection in early innate responses to CDI. Enhancing ILC3 production of GM-CSF could be a promising strategy for improving host defense against CDI and other enteric infections.",

This promise has led to increased interest in measuring EV proteins from both total EVs as well as brain-derived EVs in plasma. However, measuring cargo proteins in EVs has been challenging because EVs are present at low levels, and EV isolation methods are imperfect at separating EVs from free proteins. Thus, knowing whether a protein measured after EV isolation is truly inside EVs is difficult. In this study, we developed methods to measure whether a protein is inside EVs and quantify the ratio of a protein in EVs relative to total plasma. To achieve this, we combined a high-yield size-exclusion chromatography protocol with an optimized protease protection assay and Single Molecule Array (Simoa) digital enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) for ultrasensitive measurement of proteins inside EVs. We applied these methods to analyze α-synuclein and confirmed that a small fraction of the total plasma α-synuclein is inside EVs. Additionally, we developed a highly sensitive Simoa assay for phosphorylated α-synuclein (phosphorylated at the Ser129 residue). We found enrichment in the phosphorylated α-synuclein to total α-synuclein ratio inside EVs relative to outside EVs. Finally, we applied the methods we developed to measure total and phosphorylated α-synuclein inside EVs from Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia patient samples. This work provides a framework for determining the levels of proteins in EVs and represents an important step in the development of EV diagnostics for diseases of the brain, as well as other organs.",

Our findings highlight the significant impact that LNP composition and internal molecular mobility can have on key stages of LNP-based intracellular RNA delivery.",

          "abstract": "The female reproductive lifespan is highly dependent on egg quality, especially the presence of a normal number of chromosomes in an egg, known as euploidy. Mistakes in meiosis leading to egg aneuploidy are frequent in humans. Yet, knowledge of the precise genetic landscape that causes egg aneuploidy in women is limited, as phenotypic data on the frequency of human egg aneuploidy are difficult to obtain and therefore absent in public genetic datasets. Here, we identify genetic determinants of reproductive aging via egg aneuploidy in women using a biobank of individual maternal exomes linked with maternal age and embryonic aneuploidy data. Using the exome data, we identified 404 genes bearing variants enriched in individuals with pathologically elevated egg aneuploidy rates. Analysis of the gene ontology and protein–protein interaction network implicated genes encoding the kinesin protein family in egg aneuploidy. We interrogate the causal relationship of the human variants within candidate kinesin genes via experimental perturbations and demonstrate that motor domain variants increase aneuploidy in mouse oocytes. Finally, using a knock-in mouse model, we validate that a specific variant in kinesin KIF18A accelerates reproductive aging and diminishes fertility. These findings reveal additional functional mechanisms of reproductive aging and shed light on how genetic variation underlies individual heterogeneity in the female reproductive lifespan, which might be leveraged to predict reproductive longevity. Together, these results lay the groundwork for the noninvasive biomarkers for egg quality, a first step toward personalized fertility medicine.",

Upon activation, OAS-RNase L suppresses virus replication by promoting the decay of host and viral RNAs and inducing translational shutdown. However, whether OASs and RNase L are the only factors involved in this pathway remains unclear. Here, we develop CRISPR-Translate, a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening method that uses translation levels as a readout and identifies IRF2 as a key regulator of OAS3. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that IRF2 promotes basal expression of OAS3 in unstressed cells, allowing a rapid activation of RNase L following viral infection. Furthermore, IRF2 works in concert with the interferon response through STAT2 to further enhance OAS3 expression. We propose that IRF2-induced RNase L is critical in enabling cells to mount a rapid antiviral response immediately after viral infection, serving as the initial line of defense. This rapid response provides host cells the necessary time to activate additional antiviral signaling pathways, forming secondary defense waves.",

          "abstract": "Tough soft materials such as multiple network elastomers (MNE) or filled elastomers are typically stretchable and include significant energy dissipation mechanisms that prevent or delay crack growth. Yet most studies and fracture models focus on steady-state propagation and damage is assumed to be decoupled from the local stress and strain fields near the crack tip. We report an in situ spatial-temporally resolved 3D measurement of molecular damage in mechanophore-labeled MNE just before a crack propagates. This technique, complemented by digital image correlation, allows us to compare the spatial distribution of both damage and deformation in single network (SN) elastomers and in MNE. Compared to SN, MNE have a wide-spread damage in front of the crack and, surprisingly, delocalize strain concentration. A continuum model, where damage distribution is fully coupled to the crack tip fields, is proposed to explain these results. Additional measurements of time-dependent molecular damage during fixed grips relaxation in the presence of a crack reveal that the less localized damage distribution delays fracture initiation. The observations and exploratory modeling reveal the dynamic fracture mechanism of MNE, providing guidance for rational design of high-performance tough elastomers.",

          "abstract": "Killer meiotic drivers (KMDs) are selfish genetic elements that distort Mendelian inheritance by selectively killing meiotic products lacking the KMD element, thereby promoting their own propagation. Although KMDs have been found in diverse eukaryotes, only a limited number of them have been characterized at the molecular level, and their killing mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify that a gene previously deemed essential for cell survival in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a single-gene KMD. This gene, tdk1 , kills nearly all tdk1Δ progeny in a tdk1+ × tdk1Δ cross. By analyzing polymorphisms of tdk1 among natural strains, we identify a resistant haplotype, HT3. This haplotype lacks killing ability yet confers resistance to killing by the wild-type tdk1 . Proximity labeling experiments reveal an interaction between Tdk1, the protein product of tdk1 , and the epigenetic reader Bdf1. Interestingly, the nonkilling Tdk1-HT3 variant does not interact with Bdf1. Cryoelectron microscopy further elucidated the binding interface between Tdk1 and Bdf1, pinpointing mutations within Tdk1-HT3 that disrupt this interface. During sexual reproduction, Tdk1 forms stable Bdf1-binding nuclear foci in all spores after meiosis. These foci persist in germinated tdk1Δ progeny and impede chromosome segregation during mitosis by generating aberrant chromosomal adhesions. This study identifies a KMD that masquerades as an essential gene and reveals the molecular mechanism by which this KMD hijacks cellular machinery to execute killing. Additionally, we unveil that losing the hijacking ability is an evolutionary path for this single-gene KMD to evolve into a nonkilling resistant haplotype.",

          "abstract": "In sexual reproduction, selfish genetic elements known as killer meiotic drivers (KMDs) bias inheritance by eliminating gametes that do not carry them. The selective killing behavior of most KMDs can be explained by a toxin–antidote model, where a toxin harms all gametes while an antidote provides resistance to the toxin in carriers. This study investigates whether and how the KMD element tdk1 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe deploys this strategy. Intriguingly, tdk1 relies on a single protein product, Tdk1, for both killing and resistance. We show that Tdk1 exists in a nontoxic tetrameric form during vegetative growth and meiosis but transforms into a distinct toxic form in spores. This toxic form acquires the ability to interact with the histone reader Bdf1 and assembles into supramolecular foci that disrupt mitosis in noncarriers after spore germination. In contrast, Tdk1 synthesized during germination of carrier spores is nontoxic and acts as an antidote, dismantling the preformed toxic Tdk1 assemblies. Replacement of the N-terminal region of Tdk1 with a tetramer-forming peptide reveals its dual roles in imposing an autoinhibited tetrameric conformation and facilitating the assembly of supramolecular foci when autoinhibition is released. Moreover, we successfully reconstituted a functional KMD element by combining a construct that exclusively expresses Tdk1 during meiosis (“toxin-only”) with another construct that expresses Tdk1 specifically during germination (“antidote-only”). This work uncovers a remarkable example of a single protein employing structural duality to form a toxin–antidote pair, expanding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying toxin–antidote systems.",

These feathers have been observed to deploy passively during high angle of attack maneuvers and are suggested to play an aerodynamic role. However, there have been limited attempts to capture their underlying flow physics or assess the function of multiple covert rows. Here, we first identify two flow control mechanisms associated with a single covert-inspired flap and their location sensitivity: a pressure dam mechanism and a previously unidentified shear layer interaction mechanism. We then investigate the additivity of these mechanisms by deploying multiple rows of flaps. We find that aerodynamic benefits conferred by the shear layer interaction are additive, whereas benefits conferred by the pressure dam effect are not. Nevertheless, both mechanisms can be exploited simultaneously to maximize aerodynamic benefits and mitigate stall. In addition to wind tunnel experiments, we implement multiple rows of covert-inspired flaps on a bird-scale remote-controlled aircraft. Flight tests reveal passive deployment trends similar to those observed in bird flight and comparable aerodynamic benefits to wind tunnel experiments. These results indicate that we can enhance aircraft controllability using covert-inspired flaps and form insights into the aerodynamic role of covert feathers in avian flight.",

Our understanding of the large-scale dynamics of phytoplankton biomass has greatly benefited from, and is largely based on, satellite ocean color observations from which chlorophyll-a (Chla), a commonly used proxy for carbon biomass, can be estimated. However, ocean color satellites only measure a small portion of the surface ocean, meaning that subsurface phytoplankton biomass is not directly monitored. Chla is also an imperfect proxy for carbon biomass because cellular physiology drives large variations in their ratio. The global network of Biogeochemical (BGC)-Argo floats now makes it possible to complement satellite observations by addressing both these issues at once. In our study, we use ~100,000 water-column profiles from BGC-Argo to describe Earth’s phytoplankton carbon biomass and its spatiotemporal variability. We estimate the global stock of open ocean phytoplankton biomass at ~314 Tg C, half of which is present at depths not accessible through satellite detection. We also compare the seasonal cycles of carbon biomass stocks and surface Chla visible from space and find that surface Chla does not accurately identify the timing of the peak annual biomass in two-thirds of the ocean. Our study is a demonstration of global-scale, depth-resolved monitoring of Earth’s phytoplankton, which will be crucial for understanding future climate-related changes and the effects of geoengineering interventions if implemented.",

          "abstract": "Historically, economic growth has been closely coupled to carbon emissions responsible for climate change, but to stabilize global mean temperature, net-zero carbon emissions are necessary. Some economies have begun to reduce emissions while continuing to grow, but this decoupling is not fast enough to achieve global climate targets. Subnational climate actions seem to be crucial for the achievement of these targets. Here, we uncover the effectiveness of subnational efforts by estimating decoupling rates and CO2 emission intensities over the last three decades for over 1,500 subnational regions, encompassing 85% of global emissions, using global data on reported economic output and gridded production-based emissions. Thirty percent of regions with available data have fully decoupled, with higher-income and historically carbon-intensive regions exhibiting higher rates of decoupling and declining emission intensity. Countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development with greater spending on subnational climate actions show higher decoupling rates, as do subnational regions in EU countries where climate policies have been implemented, highlighting the effectiveness of subnational policies. Moreover, subnational analysis reveals greater variance of decoupling rates within national boundaries than between them and that countries with weaker governance typically show higher variance of decoupling within their borders. If recent rates of production-based carbon decoupling continue, less than half of subnational regions would reach net-zero before 2050, even when accounting for observed acceleration via socioeconomic development and assuming no interregional carbon leakage.",

It has also become of increasing practical importance over the last half-century as the energetic cost of digital devices has exploded. Importantly, real-world computers obey multiple physical constraints on how they work, which affects their thermodynamic properties. Moreover, many of these constraints apply to both naturally occurring computers, like brains or Eukaryotic cells, and digital systems. Most obviously, all such systems must finish their computation quickly, using as few degrees of freedom as possible. This means that they operate far from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, many computers, both digital and biological, are modular, hierarchical systems with strong constraints on the connectivity among their subsystems. Yet another example is that to simplify their design, digital computers are required to be periodic processes governed by a global clock. None of these constraints were considered in 20th-century analyses of the thermodynamics of computation. The new field of stochastic thermodynamics provides formal tools for analyzing systems subject to all of these constraints. We argue here that these tools may help us understand at a far deeper level just how the fundamental thermodynamic properties of physical systems are related to the computation they perform.",

          "abstract": "Selective attention relies on neural mechanisms that facilitate processing of behaviorally relevant sensory information while suppressing irrelevant information, consistently linked to alpha-band oscillations in human M/EEG studies. We analyzed cortical alpha responses from intracranial electrodes implanted in eight epilepsy patients, who performed a visual spatial attention task. Electrocorticographic data revealed a spatiotemporal dissociation between attention-modulated alpha desynchronization, associated with the enhancement of sensory processing, and alpha synchronization, associated with the suppression of sensory processing, during the cue-target interval. Dorsal intraparietal areas contralateral to the attended hemifield primarily exhibited a delayed and sustained alpha desynchronization, while ventrolateral extrastriatal areas ipsilateral to the attended hemifield primarily exhibited an earlier and sustained alpha synchronization. Analyses of cross-frequency coupling between alpha phase and broadband high-frequency activity (HFA) further revealed cross-frequency interactions along the visual hierarchy contralateral to the attended locations. Directionality analyses indicate that alpha phase in early and extrastriatal visual areas modulated HFA power in downstream visual areas, thus potentially facilitating the feedforward processing of an upcoming, spatially predictable target. In contrast, in areas ipsilateral to the attended locations, HFA power modulated local alpha phase in early and extrastriatal visual areas, with suppressed interareal interactions, potentially attenuating the processing of distractors. Our findings reveal divergent alpha-mediated neural mechanisms underlying target enhancement and distractor suppression during the deployment of spatial attention, reflecting enhanced functional connectivity at attended locations, while suppressed functional connectivity at unattended locations. The collective dynamics of these alpha-mediated neural mechanisms play complementary roles in the efficient gating of sensory information.",

COX15 variants impaired mitochondrial respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and led to reduced protein levels in HeLa cells. Oocyte-specific deletion of Cox15 led to impaired Fe 2+ and reactive oxygen species homeostasis that caused mitochondrial dysfunction and ultimately sensitized oocytes to ferroptosis. In addition, ferrostatin-1 (an inhibitor of ferroptosis) could rescue the oocyte ferroptosis phenotype in vitro and ex vivo.

We highlight 20 hotspot regions where terrestrial water storage exhibits strong nonstationarity, impacting 35% of the global population and 45% of the area covered by irrigated agriculture. Emerging long-term trends dominate the most often (48.2%), followed by seasonal shifts (32.8%) and changes in extremes (19%).

The patterns of nonstationarity and their dominant types differ across other water cycle components, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and gross primary production. These differences also manifest uniquely across hotspot regions, illustrating the intricate ways in which each component responds to climate change and human water management.

Pseudoaromatic dicarboxylic acids are promising alternatives with chemical structures similar to widely used petroleum-based aromatic dicarboxylic acids. However, their use in polyester synthesis has been limited due to production challenges. Here, we report the fermentative production of five pseudoaromatic dicarboxylic acids, including 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) and pyridine dicarboxylic acids (PDCAs: 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, and 2,6-PDCA), from glucose using five engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum strains. A platform C. glutamicum chassis strain was constructed by modulating the expression of nine genes involved in the synthesis and degradation pathways of precursor protocatechuate (PCA) and the glucose-uptake system. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the engineered strain against wild-type C. glutamicum identified iolE ( NCgl0160 ) as a target for PDC production. Optimized fed-batch fermentation conditions enabled the final engineered strain to produce 76.17 ± 1.24 g/L of PDC. Using this platform strain, we constructed 2,3-, 2,4-, and 2,5-PDCA-producing strains by modulating the expression of key enzymes. Additionally, we demonstrated a previously uncharacterized pathway for 2,3-PDCA biosynthesis. The engineered strains produced 2.79 ± 0.005 g/L of 2,3-PDCA, 494.26 ± 2.61 mg/L of 2,4-PDCA, and 1.42 ± 0.02 g/L of 2,5-PDCA through fed-batch fermentation. To complete the portfolio, we introduced the 2,6-PDCA biosynthetic pathway to an L-aspartate pathway–enhanced C. glutamicum strain, producing 15.01 ± 0.03 g/L of 2,6-PDCA in fed-batch fermentation.

          "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites invade and multiply inside red blood cells (RBCs), the most iron-rich compartment in humans. Like all cells, P. falciparum requires nutritional iron to support essential metabolic pathways, but the critical mechanisms of iron acquisition and trafficking during RBC infection have remained obscure. Parasites internalize and liberate massive amounts of heme during large-scale digestion of RBC hemoglobin within an acidic food vacuole (FV) but lack a heme oxygenase to release porphyrin-bound iron. Although most FV heme is sequestered into inert hemozoin crystals, prior studies indicate that trace heme escapes biomineralization and is susceptible to nonenzymatic degradation within the oxidizing FV environment to release labile iron. Parasites retain a homolog of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), a known mammalian iron transporter, but its role in P. falciparum iron acquisition has not been tested. Our phylogenetic studies indicate that P. falciparum DMT1 (PfDMT1) retains conserved molecular features critical for metal transport. We localized this protein to the FV membrane and defined its orientation in an export-competent topology. Conditional knockdown of PfDMT1 expression is lethal to parasites, which display broad cellular defects in iron-dependent functions, including impaired apicoplast biogenesis and mitochondrial polarization. Parasites are selectively rescued from partial PfDMT1 knockdown by supplementation with exogenous iron, but not other metals. These results support a cellular paradigm whereby PfDMT1 is the molecular gatekeeper to essential iron acquisition by blood-stage malaria parasites and suggest that therapeutic targeting of PfDMT1 may be a potent antimalarial strategy.",

          "abstract": "At the nearly pristine hydrothermal vents of the deep sea, highly endemic animals depend upon bacteria nourished by hydrothermal fluids that emerge as outflows from the seafloor. These animals are remarkable in tolerating extreme conditions, including high heat, toxic reduced sulfide, and low oxygen. Here, we test whether the extreme vent environment has selected for functionally similar species across the world’s deep ocean, despite well-established global geographic patterns of high phylogenetic distinctness. High functional redundancy in species pools within regions suggests that the extreme environments select for species with specific traits. Yet, some regions emerge as functional hotspots where species pools with distinct functional trait compositions may represent geological idiosyncrasies of the habitats. Moreover, many species are functionally unique, an outcome of low species richness in a system where the species pool is small at all scales. Given the high proportion of functionally unique species, simulated species extinctions indicate that species losses would rapidly translate to the elimination of functionally irreplaceable species and could tip vent systems to functional collapse. Ocean changes and human-induced threats are expected to significantly impact many vent species as human activities expand in the remote deep sea. The opportunity exists now to take precautionary actions to limit the rates of extinction now ubiquitous in more accessible areas of Earth.",

          "abstract": "Approximately half of mammalian genomes are occupied by retrotransposons, highly repetitive interspersed genetic elements expanded through the mechanism of reverse transcription. The evolution of this “retrobiome” involved a series of explosive amplifications, presumably associated with high mutation rates, interspersed with periods of silencing. A by-product of retrotransposon activity is the formation of processed pseudogenes (PPGs)—intron-less, promoter-less DNA copies of messenger RNA (mRNA). We examined the proportion of PPGs with varying degrees of deviation from their ancestor mRNAs as an indicator of the intensity of retrotranspositions at different times in the past. Our analysis revealed a high proportion of “young’’ (recently acquired) PPGs in the DNA of mice and rats, indicating significant retrobiome activity during the recent evolution of these species. The ongoing process of new PPG entries in mouse germ line DNA was confirmed by identifying diversity in PPG content within the single strain of mice, C57BL/6. In contrast, the highly abundant PPGs of the naked mole rat (NMR) exhibited substantial deviation from their mRNAs, with a near-complete lack of PPGs without mutations, indicative of the silencing of the retrobiome in the most recent evolutionary past, preceded by a period of high activity. This distinctive feature of the NMR genome was confirmed through the analysis of a broad range of mammalian species. The peculiar evolutionary dynamics of PPGs in the NMR, an organism with exceptional longevity and resistance to cancer, may reflect the role played by the retrobiome in aging and cancer.",

While hydrogels can approximate the viscoelasticity of native ECM, it remains challenging to recapitulate the rapid stress relaxation observed in many tissues without limiting the mechanical stability of the hydrogel. Here, we develop macroporous alginate hydrogels that have an order of magnitude increase in the rate of stress relaxation as compared to bulk hydrogels. The increased rate of stress relaxation occurs across a wide range of polymer molecular weights (MWs), which enables the use of high MW polymer for improved mechanical stability of the hydrogel. The rate of stress relaxation in macroporous hydrogels depends on the volume fraction of pores and the concentration of bovine serum albumin, which is added to the hydrogels to stabilize the macroporous structure during gelation. Relative to cell spheroids encapsulated in bulk hydrogels, spheroids in macroporous hydrogels have a significantly larger area and smaller circularity because of increased cell migration. A computational model provides a framework for the relationship between the macroporous architecture and morphogenesis of encapsulated spheroids that is consistent with experimental observations. Taken together, these findings elucidate the relationship between macroporous hydrogel architecture and stress relaxation and help to inform the design of macroporous hydrogels for materials-based cell therapies.",

We demonstrate by use of a “categorical Jacobian” calculation that ESM-2 stores statistics of coevolving residues, analogously to simpler modeling approaches like Markov Random Fields and Multivariate Gaussian models. We further investigated how ESM-2 “stores” information needed to predict contacts by comparing sequence masking strategies, and found that providing local windows of sequence information allowed ESM-2 to best recover predicted contacts. This suggests that pLMs predict contacts by storing motifs of pairwise contacts.

These organisms utilize macromolecules like peptides and proteins to facilitate the nucleation and growth of carbonate minerals, serving as an effective method for CO 2 sequestration. However, the precise mechanisms behind this process remain elusive. In this study, we report the use of sequence-defined peptoids, a class of peptidomimetics, to achieve the accelerated calcite step growth kinetics with the molecular level mechanistic understanding. By designing peptoids with hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, we systematically investigated the acceleration in step growth rate of calcite crystals using in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), varying peptoid sequences and concentrations, CaCO 3 supersaturations, and the ratio of Ca 2+ / HCO 3 − . Mechanistic studies using NMR, three-dimensional fast force mapping (3D FFM), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) were conducted to reveal the interactions of peptoids with Ca 2+ and HCO 3 − ions in solution, as well as the effect of peptoids on solvation and energetics of calcite crystal surface. Our results indicate the multiple roles of peptoid in facilitating HCO 3 − deprotonation, Ca 2+ desolvation, and the disruption of interfacial hydration layers of the calcite surface, which collectively contribute to a peptoid-induced acceleration of calcite growth. These findings provide guidelines for future design of sequence-specific biomimetic polymers as crystallization promoters, offering potential applications in environmental remediation (such as CO 2 sequestration), biomedical engineering, and energy storage where fast crystallization is preferred.",

In this study, we identify hyponatremia as an independent inducer of NETs release, a common clinical condition that disrupts sodium/calcium exchange within neutrophils. This disruption leads to an excess of intracellular calcium, subsequent elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the citrullination of histone H3, culminating in the activation of NETs-release pathways. Notably, under hyponatremic conditions, this mechanism is exacerbated during infectious states, leading to the deposition of NETs in the lungs and increasing the risk of life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Our findings underscore the critical role of sodium and calcium homeostasis in neutrophil functionality and provide insights into the pathogenesis of hyponatremia-associated diseases, highlighting potential therapeutic interventions targeting NETs dynamics.",

Specifically, we demonstrate via two microscopic models that LMR with a universal slope arises ubiquitously near ordered phases, provided the order parameter either i) has a finite wave-vector, or ii) has nodes on the Fermi surface. We elucidate the distinct physical mechanisms at play in these two scenarios and derive upper and lower bounds on the field range for which LMR is observed.

          "abstract": "Carboxysomes are protein microcompartments found in cyanobacteria, whose shell encapsulates rubisco at the heart of carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle. Carboxysomes are thought to locally concentrate CO 2 in the shell interior to improve rubisco efficiency through selective metabolite permeability, creating a concentrated catalytic center. However, permeability coefficients have not previously been determined for these gases, or for Calvin-cycle intermediates such as bicarbonate ( HCO 3 − ), 3-phosphoglycerate, or ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Starting from a high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a synthetic β -carboxysome shell, we perform unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics to track metabolite permeability across the shell. The synthetic carboxysome shell structure, lacking the bacterial microcompartment trimer proteins and encapsulation peptides, is found to have similar permeability coefficients for multiple metabolites, and is not selectively permeable to HCO 3 − relative to CO 2 . To resolve how these comparable permeabilities can be reconciled with the clear role of the carboxysome in the CO 2 -concentrating mechanism in cyanobacteria, complementary atomic-resolution Brownian Dynamics simulations estimate the mean first passage time for CO 2 assimilation in a crowded model carboxysome. Despite a relatively high CO 2 permeability of approximately 10 −2 cm/s across the carboxysome shell, the shell proteins reflect enough CO 2 back toward rubisco that 2,650 CO 2 molecules can be fixed by rubisco for every 1 CO 2 molecule that escapes under typical conditions. The permeabilities determined from all-atom molecular simulation are key inputs into flux modeling, and the insight gained into carbon fixation can facilitate the engineering of carboxysomes and other bacterial microcompartments for multiple applications.",

We found that, in addition to the foramina Magendie and Luschka for CSF flow toward the subarachnoid space and glymphatic system, CSF outflow could also occur along periaxonal spaces (termed “PAS pathway”) from the spinal cord to peripheral organs, such as the liver and pancreas. When interrogating the latter route, we found that serotonin, acting through 5-HT 2B receptors expressed in ependymocytes that line the central canal, triggered Ca 2+ signals to induce polymerization of F-actin, a cytoskeletal protein, to reduce the volume of ependymal cells. This paralleled an increased rate of PAS-mediated CSF redistribution toward peripheral organs. In the liver, CSF was received by hepatic stellate cells. CSF efflux toward peripheral organs through the PAS pathway represents a mechanism dynamically connecting the nervous system with the periphery. Our findings are compatible with the traditional theory of CSF efflux into the glymphatic system to clear metabolic waste from the cerebral parenchyma. Thus, we extend the knowledge of CSF flow and expand the understanding of connectivity between the CNS and peripheral organs.",

Studies in vitro and in anesthetized animals suggest that nonlinearities emerge in cells’ input–output (IO; activation) functions as network activity increases, yet how neurons transform inputs in vivo has been unclear. Here, we characterize cortical principal neurons’ activation functions in awake mice using two-photon optogenetics. We deliver fixed inputs at the soma while neurons’ activity varies with sensory stimuli. We find that responses to fixed optogenetic input are nearly unchanged as neurons are excited, reflecting a linear response regime above neurons’ resting point. In contrast, responses are dramatically attenuated by suppression. This attenuation is a powerful means to filter inputs arriving to suppressed cells, privileging other inputs arriving to excited neurons. These results have two major implications. First, somatic neural activation functions in vivo accord with the activation functions used in recent machine learning systems. Second, neurons’ IO functions can filter sensory inputs—not only do sensory stimuli change neurons’ spiking outputs, but these changes also affect responses to input, attenuating responses to some inputs while leaving others unchanged.",

While more sophisticated strategies for antibiotic discovery are being developed, target elucidation of new chemical entities remains challenging. In the postgenomic era, expression profiling can play an important role in mechanism-of-action (MOA) prediction by reporting on the cellular response to perturbation. However, the broad application of transcriptomics has yet to fulfill its promise of transforming target elucidation due to challenges in identifying the most relevant, direct responses to target inhibition. We developed an unbiased strategy for MOA prediction, called perturbation-specific transcriptional mapping (PerSpecTM), in which large-throughput expression profiling of wild-type or hypomorphic mutants, depleted for essential targets, enables a computational strategy to address this challenge. We applied PerSpecTM to perform reference-based MOA prediction based on the principle that similar perturbations, whether chemical or genetic, will elicit similar transcriptional responses. Using this approach, we elucidated the MOAs of three molecules with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by comparing their expression profiles to those of a reference set of antimicrobial compounds with known MOAs. We also show that transcriptional responses to small-molecule inhibition resemble those resulting from genetic depletion of essential targets by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) by PerSpecTM, demonstrating proof of concept that correlations between expression profiles of small-molecule and genetic perturbations can facilitate MOA prediction when no chemical entities exist to serve as a reference. Empowered by PerSpecTM, this work lays the foundation for an unbiased, readily scalable, systematic reference-based strategy for MOA elucidation that could transform antibiotic discovery efforts.",

In this article, we address this issue by reporting on an experimental investigation of cell proliferation on all time- and length-scales of the development of a model tissue, grown on collagen-coated glass or deformable substrates. Through extensive data analysis, we demonstrate the relation between mechanoresponse and probability for cell division, as a function of the local cell density. Motivated by these results, we construct a minimal model of cell division in tissue environment that can recover the data. By parameterizing the growth and the dividing phases of the cell cycle, and introducing such a proliferation model in dissipative particle dynamics simulations, we recover the mechanoresponsive, time-dependent density profiles in 2D tissues growing to macroscopic scales. The importance of separating the cell population into growing and dividing cells, each characterized by a particular time scale, is further emphasized by calculations of density profiles based on adapted Fisher–Kolmogorov equations. Together, these results show that the mechanoresponse on the level of a constitutive cell and its proliferation results in a matrix-sensitive active pressure. The latter evokes massive cooperative displacement of cells in the invading tissue and is a key factor for developing large-scale structures in the steady state.",

LC-MS/MS, bisulfite-sequencing, and high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the archaeal ribosome identified an RNA modification, N 4, N 4-dimethylcytidine (m 4 2 C), at the universally conserved C918 in the 16S rRNA helix 31 loop. Here, we characterize and structurally resolve a class of RNA methyltransferase that generates m 4 2 C whose function is critical for hyperthermophilic growth. m 4 2 C is synthesized by the activity of a unique family of RNA methyltransferase containing a Rossman-fold that targets only intact ribosomes. The phylogenetic distribution of the newly identified m 4 2 C synthase family implies that m 4 2 C is biologically relevant in each domain. Resistance of m 4 2 C to bisulfite-driven deamination suggests that efforts to capture m 5 C profiles via bisulfite sequencing are also capturing m 4 2 C.",

          "abstract": "Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are a major cause of non–small cell lung cancer. Among these structurally diverse alterations, exon 20 insertions represent a unique subset that rarely respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Therefore, there is a significant need to develop inhibitors that are active against this class of activating mutations. Here, we conducted biochemical analysis of the two most frequent exon 20 insertion variants, V769_D770insASV (insASV) and D770_N771insSVD (insSVD) to better understand their drug sensitivity and resistance. From kinetic studies, we found that EGFR insASV and insSVD are similarly active, but have lower K m, ATP values compared to the L858R variant, which contributes to their lack of sensitivity to 1st-3rd generation EGFR TKIs. Biochemical, structural, and cellular studies of a diverse panel of EGFR inhibitors revealed that the more recently developed compounds BAY-568, TAS6417, and TAK-788 inhibit EGFR insASV and insSVD in a mutant-selective manner, with BAY-568 being the most potent and selective versus wild-type (WT) EGFR. Cocrystal structures with WT EGFR reveal the binding modes of each of these inhibitors and of poziotinib, a potent but not mutantselective inhibitor, and together they define interactions shared by the mutant-selective agents. Collectively, our results show that these exon20 insertion variants are not inherently inhibitor resistant, rather they differ in their drug sensitivity from WT EGFR. However, they are similar to each other, indicating that a single inhibitor should be effective for several of the diverse exon 20 insertion variants.",

Mammalian cells are known to sense and respond to sterol status changes to maintain them within strict limits, a process associated with various human diseases. However, this process is not understood in oomycete pathogens, most of which are sterol auxotrophic and must obtain sterols from host plants. Here, we report that Phytophthora sojae SSRK1 (sterol-sensing receptor kinase 1) detects host sterols by coupling with elicitins, thereby controlling signaling and sterol absorption. Sterols are recruited by extracellular soluble elicitins, and these complexes then bind to SSRK1 to form trimolecular complexes. These complexes subsequently trigger downstream calcium influx, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, and transcriptome reprogramming through the receptor’s kinase activity. Our data demonstrate a unique sterol sensing pathway where elicitins and a transmembrane receptor kinase SSRK1 act as coreceptors for extracellular sterols. These findings also portray a sterol-based war between oomycetes and plants, providing a unique perspective on how a pathogen detects host signals during infection.",

          "abstract": "In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , exit from mitosis is coupled to spindle position to ensure successful genome partitioning between mother and daughter cells. This coupling occurs through a GTPase signaling cascade known as the mitotic exit network (MEN). The MEN senses spindle position via a Ras-like GTPase Tem1 which localizes to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs, yeast equivalent of centrosomes) during anaphase and signals to its effector protein kinase Cdc15. How Tem1 couples the status of spindle position to MEN activation is not fully understood. Here, we show that Cdc15 has a relatively weak preference for Tem1 GTP and Tem1’s nucleotide state does not change upon MEN activation. Instead, we find that Tem1’s nucleotide cycle establishes a localization-based concentration difference in the cell where only Tem1 GTP is recruited to the SPB, and spindle position regulates the MEN by controlling Tem1 localization to the SPB. SPB localization of Tem1 primarily functions to promote Tem1–Cdc15 interaction for MEN activation by increasing the effective concentration of Tem1. Consistent with this model, we demonstrate that artificially tethering Tem1 to the SPB or concentrating Tem1 in the cytoplasm with genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles could bypass the requirement of Tem1 GTP and correct spindle position for MEN activation. This localization/concentration-based GTPase signaling mechanism for Tem1 differs from the canonical Ras-like GTPase signaling paradigm and is likely relevant to other localization-based signaling scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Pregnant women are often prescribed or abuse opioid drugs. The placenta is likely the key to understanding how opioids cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. Maternal oxycodone (OXY) exposure of pregnant mice leads to disturbances in the layer of invasive parietal trophoblast giant cells (pTGC) that forms the interface between the placenta and uterus. These cells are analogous to extravillous trophoblasts of the human placenta. They are crucial to coordinating the metabolic needs of the conceptus with those of the mother and are primary participants in the placenta–brain axis. Their large nuclear size, however, has precluded both single-cell (sc) and single-nucleus (sn) RNA-seq analyses beyond embryonic day (E) 8.5. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of placentas from pregnant mice exposed to OXY with unexposed controls at E12.5, with particular emphasis on the pTGC. The nonfluidic Parse snRNA-seq approach permitted characterization of the nuclear transcriptomes of all the major placental cell lineages and their presumed progenitors at E12.5. OXY exposure had a negligible effect on components of the placental labyrinth, including the two syncytial cell layers, but caused transcriptomic changes consistent with metabolic stress throughout the spongiotrophoblast. Most notably, there was loss of the majority of pTGC, whose normal gene expression is consistent with elevated energy demand relating to biosynthesis of multiple secretory products, especially hormones, and endoduplication of DNA. This unusual sensitivity of pTGC presumably puts the pregnancy and future health of the offspring at particular risk to OXY exposure.",

Here, we introduce Adaptive CVgen, a universal adaptive sampling framework designed to tackle these issues. Our approach utilizes a set of collective variables (CVs) to comprehensively cover the system’s potential evolutionary phase space, generating diverse reaction coordinates to address the first challenge. Moreover, we integrate reinforcement learning strategies to dynamically adjust the generated reaction coordinates, thereby effectively balancing the exploration-exploitation dilemma. We apply this framework to sample the conformational space of six proteins transitioning from completely disordered states to folded states, as well as to model the chemical synthesis process of C60, achieving conformations that perfectly match the standard C60 structure. The results demonstrate Adaptive CVgen’s effectiveness in exploring new conformations and escaping local minima, achieving both sampling efficiency and exploration accuracy. This framework holds potential for extending to various related challenges, including protein folding dynamics, drug targeting, and complex chemical reactions, thereby opening promising avenues for application in these fields.",

          "abstract": "White matter (WM) abnormalities are an emerging feature of schizophrenia, yet the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. Disruption of ErbB signaling, which is essential for peripheral myelination, has been genetically associated with schizophrenia and WM lesions in schizophrenic patients. However, the roles of ErbB signaling in oligodendrocytes remain elusive. Here, we used an in vivo pan-ErbB inhibition strategy and demonstrated the functions of endogenous ErbB receptors in oligodendrocytes. Through analyses of the cellular, histological, biochemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological differences in mice with manipulated ErbB activities in oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages, we found that ErbB signaling regulates myelination and aerobic glycolysis in oligodendrocytes, and both functions are required for working memory. ErbB inhibition in oligodendrocytes at early differentiation stages induces hypomyelination by suppressing the myelinating capacity of newly formed oligodendrocytes. In contrast, ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes alters neither myelination nor oligodendrocyte numbers, but accelerates axonal conduction decline under energy stress. Mechanistically, ErbB inhibition attenuates K-Ras activities, leading to the reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase A that promotes aerobic glycolysis in mature oligodendrocytes. Supplementation of L-lactate restores axonal conduction and working memory capacity that are suppressed by ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes. These findings emphasize the indispensable roles of ErbB signaling in WM integrity and function and provide insights into the multifaceted contributions of WM abnormalities to cognitive impairment.",

          "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein to recognize and infect host cells by binding to the cell surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 receptor is composed of peptidase domain (PD), collectrin-like domain, transmembrane domain, and short cytoplasmic domain, and may exist as a dimer on cell surface. The RBD binding site is located atop of the ACE2 PD, but the involvement of other domains in virus infection is uncertain. We found that the ACE2 PD alone, whether anchored to cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor or attached to another surface protein, is fully functional as a receptor for spike-mediated cell fusion and virus infection. However, for ACE2 to function as the viral receptor, the RBD binding site must be positioned in close proximity to the cell membrane. Elevating the surface height of ACE2 using long and rigid protein spacers reduces or eliminates cell fusion and virus infection. Moreover, we found that the RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies, nanobodies, and de novo designed miniprotein binders, when present on cell surface, also act as viral receptors, facilitating cell fusion and virus infection. Our data demonstrate that RBD binding and close membrane proximity are essential properties for a receptor to effectively mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, we show that soluble RBD-binders can be engineered to make cells either susceptible or resistant to virus infection, which has significant implications for antiviral therapy and various virus-mediated applications.",

Mitigating this strain-induced loss in mechanical integrity is a significant challenge, especially in the development of active and shape-memory materials. We report the additive manufacturing of mechanical metamaterials made with a protein-based polymer that undergo a unique stiffening and strengthening behavior after shape recovery cycles. We utilize a bovine serum albumin-based polymer and show that cyclic tension and recovery experiments on the neat resin lead to a ~60% increase in the strength and stiffness of the material. This is attributed to the release of stored length in the protein mechanophores during plastic deformation that is preserved after the recovery cycle, thereby leading to a “strain learning” behavior. We perform compression experiments on three-dimensionally printed lattice metamaterials made from this protein-based polymer and find that, in certain lattices, the strain learning effect is not only preserved but amplified, causing up to a 2.5× increase in the stiffness of the recovered metamaterial. These protein–polymer strain learning metamaterials offer a unique platform for materials that can autonomously remodel after being deformed, mimicking the remodeling processes that occur in natural materials.",

First-principles searches are impeded by the computational complexity of solving the Eliashberg equations for large, complex crystal structures. Here, we adopt a simplified approach using electronic indicators previously established to be correlated with superconductivity in hydrides. This is used to study complex hydride structures, which are predicted to exhibit promisingly high critical temperatures for superconductivity. In particular, we propose three classes of hydrides inspired by the Fm 3 ¯ m RH 3 structures that exhibit strong hydrogen network connectivity, as defined through the electron localization function. The first class [RH 11 X 3 Y] is based on a Pm 3 ¯ m structure showing moderately high T c , where the T c estimate from electronic properties is compared with direct Eliashberg calculations and found to be surprisingly accurate. The second class of structures [(RH 11 ) 2 X 6 YZ] improves on this with promisingly high density of states with dominant hydrogen character at the Fermi energy, typically enhancing T c . The third class [(R 1 H 11 )(R 2 H 11 )X 6 YZ] improves the strong hydrogen network connectivity by introducing anisotropy in the hydrogen network through a specific doping pattern. These design principles and associated model structures provide flexibility to optimize both T c and the structural stability of complex hydrides.",

The resulting normal uterus cell atlas contains more than 167K cells, representing the lymphatic endothelium, blood endothelium, stromal, ciliated epithelium, unciliated epithelium, and immune cell populations. Focused analyses within each major cell type and comparisons with subtype labels from prior studies allowed us to document supporting evidence, resolve naming conflicts, and propose a consensus annotation system of 39 subtypes. We release their gene expression centroids, differentially expressed genes, and messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) patterns of literature-based markers as a shared community resource. We identify multiple potential progenitor cells: compartment-wide progenitors for each major cell type and potential cross-lineage multipotent stromal progenitors that may replenish the epithelial, stromal, and endothelial compartments. Furthermore, many cell types and subtypes exhibit shifts in cell number and transcriptomes across different phases of the menstrual cycle. Finally, comparisons between premenopausal, postpartum, and postmenopausal samples revealed substantial alterations in tissue composition, particularly in the proportions of stromal, endothelial, and immune cells.

Their unique ability to filter water, provide habitat, and contribute to nutrient cycling has remained underused in many parts of Europe following the destruction of vast oyster beds in the 19th and 20th centuries. The burgeoning field of oyster restoration for aquaculture has recognized the potential of these bivalves in promoting ecosystem resilience and enhancing biodiversity. Restoring oysters to previous levels requires the establishment of ecological baselines that ideally take into account the long-term changes of animal behavior as well as the surrounding environment prior to significant human intervention, an extremely challenging task. Archaeological shell middens are invaluable baseline archives and provide exclusive insights into past ecosystems. Here, we use demographic information from over 2,000 analyzed European oyster ( Ostrea edulis ) shells dating from ~5,660 to 2,600 cal BCE (calibrated years BCE), the largest archaeological growth rate dataset of mollusks yet. Through the analysis of size as well as ontogenetic age, we decouple anthropogenic from environmental impacts throughout Denmark. Our data show definitive influence of oyster size–age structure through human harvesting during the Mid-Holocene, with older oysters in the Mesolithic (mean: 4.9 y) than the Neolithic (mean: 3.7 y), irrespective of changes in growth rate. Furthermore, we present the metrics for long-term sustainable harvesting of oysters across environmental and socioeconomic transitions, providing demographic targets for current oyster restoration projects and valuable context in mitigating the impact of modern climatic change.",

However, the increasing cases of rat HEV infection in humans since 2018 challenged this dogma, posing increasing health threats. Herein, we investigated the underlying mechanisms dictating the zoonotic potentials of different HEV species and their possible cross-protection relationships. We found that rat HEV virus-like particles (HEV VLPs ) bound to human liver and intestinal cells/tissues with high efficiency. Moreover, rat HEV VLPs and infectious rat HEV particles penetrated the cell membrane and entered human target cells postbinding. In contrast, ferret HEV VLPs showed marginal cell binding and entry ability, bat HEV VLPs and avian HEV VLPs exhibited no binding and entry potency. Structure-based three-dimensional mapping identified that the surface spike domain of rat HEV is crucial for cell binding. Antigenic cartography indicated that rat HEV exhibited partial cross-reaction with HEV-A. Intriguingly, sera of HEV-A infected patients or human HEV vaccine Hecolin® immunized individuals provided partial cross-protection against the binding of rat HEV VLPs to human target cells. In summary, the interactions between the viral capsid and cellular receptor(s) regulate the distinct zoonotic potentials of different HEV species. The systematic characterization of antigenic cartography and serological cross-reactivity of different HEV species provide valuable insights for the development of species-specific diagnosis and protective vaccines against zoonotic HEV infection.",

For class Ia RNRs, the radical species is stored in a separate subunit (β2) from the subunit housing the active site (α2), requiring the formation of a short-lived α2β2 complex and long-range radical transfer (RT). RT occurs via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) over a long distance (~32-Å) and involves the formation and decay of multiple amino acid radical species. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy and a mechanism-based inhibitor 2′-azido-2′-deoxycytidine-5′-diphosphate (N 3 CDP) to trap a wild-type α2β2 complex of Escherichia coli class Ia RNR. We find that one α subunit has turned over and that the other is trapped, bound to β in a midturnover state. Instead of N 3 CDP in the active site, forward RT has resulted in N 2 loss, migration of the third nitrogen from the ribose C2′ to C3′ positions, and attachment of this nitrogen to the sulfur of cysteine-225. In this study, an inhibitor has been visualized as an adduct to an RNR. Additionally, this structure reveals the positions of PCET residues following forward RT, complementing the previous structure that depicted a preturnover PCET pathway and suggesting how PCET is gated at the α–β interface. This N 3 CDP-trapped structure is also of sufficient resolution (2.6 Å) to visualize water molecules, allowing us to evaluate the proposal that water molecules are proton acceptors and donors as part of the PCET process.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) moiré systems based on twisted bilayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides provide a promising platform to investigate emergent phenomena driven by strong electron–electron interactions in partially filled flat bands. A natural question arises: Is it possible to expand the 2D correlated moiré physics to one-dimensional (1D) that electron–electron correlation is expected to be further enhanced? This requires selectively doping of 1D moiré chain, which seems to be not within the grasp of today’s technology. Therefore, an experimental demonstration of the 1D moiré chain with partially filled electronic states remains absent. Here, we show that we can introduce 1D boundaries, separating two regions with different twist angles, in twisted bilayer WSe 2 (tWSe 2 ) by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and demonstrate that the electronic states of 1D moiré sites along the boundaries can be selectively filled. The strong localized charge states of correlated moiré electrons in the 1D moiré chain can be directly imaged and manipulated by combining a back-gate voltage with the STM bias voltage. Our results open the door for realizing new correlated electronic states of the 1D moiré chain in 2D systems.",

          "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a considerable threat to human health with a significant risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, currently, both the molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic treatment of IBD remain limited. In this report, using both systemic and intestinal epithelium-specific gene knockout mouse models, we demonstrate that FBXO22, a substrate receptor within the SKP1-Cullin 1-F-box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, plays an inhibitory role in the Azoxymethane / Dextran Sodium Sulfate–induced colorectal inflammatory responses and CRC. FBXO22 targets the serine 2448-phosphorylated form of mammalian mechanistic target of rapamycin (pS2448-mTOR) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This proteolytic targeting effect is established based on multiple lines of evidence including the results of colon tissue immunoblots, analysis of cultured cells with altered abundance of FBXO22 by depletion or overexpression, comparison of protein decay rate, effects on mTOR substrates S6K1 and 4E-BP1, analysis of protein–protein interactions, phosphor–peptide binding and competition, as well as reconstituted and cellular ubiquitination. Finally, we have shown that mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA) was able to alleviate the effects of fbxo22 deletion on colorectal inflammatory response and CRC. These RAPA effects are correlated with the ability of RAPA to inhibit pS2448-mTOR, pS6K1, and p4E-BP1. Collectively, our data support a suppressive role for FBXO22 in colorectal inflammation signaling and CRC initiation by targeting pS2448-mTOR for degradation.",

Comparing 2833 records for vegetation cover, past climate, biomass burning, and human population size across different phases of human occupation, we demonstrated that Indigenous population expansion and cultural fire use resulted in a 50% reduction in shrub cover, from approximately 30% from the early to mid-Holocene (12 to 6 thousand years ago) to 15% during the late to mid-Holocene (6 to 1 thousand years ago).

The results disentangle intricate circuits of splicing factor cross-regulation, reveal that the precise architecture of late-assembling U4/U6.U5 tri–small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes regulates splice site pairing, and discover an unprecedented division of labor among protein components of U1 snRNP for regulating exon definition and alternative 5′ splice site selection.

We report a study of perhaps the most notorious class of geometrically distorted molecules that contain π-bonds: anti-Bredt olefins (ABOs). ABOs have been known since 1924, and conventional wisdom maintains that ABOs are difficult or impossible to access. We provide a solution to this long-standing problem. Our study also highlights the strategic manipulation of compounds that display considerable distortion arising from the presence of geometrically constrained π-bonds.",

We present velocity-resolved kinetics measurements for catalytic hydrogen oxidation on palladium over a wide range of surface concentrations and at high temperatures. The rates exhibit a complex dependence on oxygen coverage and step density, which can be quantitatively explained by a density functional and transition-state theory–based kinetic model involving a cooperatively stabilized configuration of at least three oxygen atoms at steps. Here, two oxygen atoms recruit a third oxygen atom to a nearby binding site to produce an active configuration that is far more reactive than isolated oxygen atoms. Thus, hydrogen oxidation on palladium provides a clear example of how reactivity can be enhanced on a working catalyst.",

ILC2s expanded and produced IL-13 in the developing brain meninges. Loss of ILC2s or IL-13 signaling to interneurons decreased inhibitory, but not excitatory, cortical synapses.

We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) connects daughter cells across fenestrae, and as the cell plate matures, fenestrae contract, causing the plasma membrane (PM) to mold around constricted ER tubes. The ER’s presence prevents fenestrae fusion, forming plasmodesmata, whereas its absence results in closure. The ER-PM protein tethers MCTP3, MCTP4, and MCTP6 further stabilize nascent plasmodesmata during fenestrae contraction. Genetic deletion in Arabidopsis reduces plasmodesmata formation.

PBP2a can replace the transpeptidase activity of the endogenous and essential PBP2 but not that of PBP1, which is responsible for the distinctive native septal peptidoglycan architecture. Successful division without PBP1 activity requires the alternative division mode and is enabled by several possible chromosomal potentiator ( pot ) mutations.

These excitons, inherent to the reconstructed band structure, exhibit high oscillator strength. Most importantly, they inherit the linear polarization from BP, which allows light polarization to be used to select the dipole direction. Moreover, the dipole moment and resonance energy can be widely tuned by the thickness of the BP. Our results demonstrate a useful platform for exploring tunable correlated dipolar excitons.",

We report that Arabidopsis Decapping 5 (DCP5) functions as a multifunctional cytoplasmic osmosensor that senses and responds to extracellular hyperosmolarity. DCP5 harbors a plant-specific intramolecular crowding sensor (ICS) that undergoes conformational change and drives phase separation in response to osmotically intensified molecular crowding. Upon hyperosmolarity exposure, DCP5 rapidly and reversibly assembles to DCP5-enriched osmotic stress granules (DOSGs), which sequestrate plenty of mRNA and regulatory proteins, and thus adaptively reprograms both the translatome and transcriptome to facilitate plant osmotic stress adaptation. Our findings uncover a cytoplasmic osmosensing mechanism mediated by DCP5 with plant-specific molecular crowding sensitivity and suggest a stress sensory function for hyperosmotically induced stress granules.",

However, reported EC coolers have complex architectures and limited cooling temperature lift. In this work, we introduce a self-regenerative heat pump (SRHP) using a cascade of EC polymer film stacks, which have electrostrictive actuations in response to an electric field that are directed to realize efficient heat transfer, eliminating the need for additional transportive or regenerative mechanisms. The SRHP demonstrates a cooling of 8.8 kelvin below ambient temperature in 30 seconds and delivers a maximum specific cooling power of 1.52 watts per gram. The temperature lift of the SRHP is 14.2 kelvin. These results underscore the potential of the compact solid-state cooling mechanism to address the increasing need for localized thermal management.",

          "abstract": "We examined the impact of sugar exposure within 1000 days since conception on diabetes and hypertension, leveraging quasi-experimental variation from the end of the United Kingdom’s sugar rationing in September 1953. Rationing restricted sugar intake to levels within current dietary guidelines, yet consumption nearly doubled immediately post-rationing. Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35% and 20%, respectively, and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years. Protection was evident with in-utero exposure and increased with postnatal sugar restriction, especially after six months when solid foods likely began. In-utero sugar rationing alone accounted for about one third of the risk reduction.",

There is widespread concern that they do, but little systematic evidence that search engine algorithms, rather than user-expressed preferences, are driving current exposure to and engagement with unreliable information sources. Using two datasets totaling roughly 14 billion search engine result pages (SERPs) from Bing, the second most popular search engine in the U.S., we show that search exposes users to few unreliable information sources. The vast majority of engagement with unreliable information sources from search occurs when users are explicitly searching for information from those sites, despite those searches being an extremely small share of the overall search volume. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for user preference when examining engagement with unreliable sources from web search.",

          "abstract": "Supersonic turbulence occurs in many environments, particularly in astrophysics. In the crucial case of isothermal turbulence, the probability density function (PDF) of the logarithmic density, s , is well measured, but a theoretical understanding of the processes leading to this distribution remains elusive. We investigate these processes using Lagrangian tracer particles to track s and ds dt in direct numerical simulations, and we show that their evolution can be modeled as a stochastic differential process with time-correlated noise. The temporal correlation functions of s and ds dt decay exponentially, as predicted by the model, and the decay timescale is ≈ 1 / 6 the eddy turnover time. The behaviors of the conditional averages of ds dt and d 2 s dt 2 are also well explained by the model, which shows that the density PDF arises from a balance between stochastic compressions/expansions, which tend to broaden the PDF, and the acceleration/deceleration of shocks by density gradients, which tends to narrow it.",

In this work, we exploit the inherent confocal effect of second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy to acquire highly resolved three-dimensional (3D) images of the chiral nematic phase of CNCs in a label-free manner. An in-depth analysis revealed a direct link between the observed variations in SHG intensity and the pitch. The highly contrasted 3D images provided unprecedented detail into liquid crystal’s native structure. Local alignment, morphology, as well as the presence of defects are readily revealed, and a provisional framework relating the SHG response to the orientational distribution of CNC nanorods within the liquid crystal structure is presented. This paper illustrates the numerous benefits of using SHG microscopy for visualizing CNC chiral nematic systems directly in the suspension-liquid phase and paves the road for using SHG microscopy to characterize other types of aligned CNC structures, in wet and dry states.",

          "abstract": "Random noise in information processing systems is widely seen as detrimental to function. But despite the large trial-to-trial variability of neural activity, humans show a remarkable adaptability to conditions with uncertainty during goal-directed behavior. The origin of this cognitive ability, constitutive of general intelligence, remains elusive. Here, we show that moderate levels of computation noise in artificial neural networks promote zero-shot generalization for decision-making under uncertainty. Unlike networks featuring noise-free computations, but like human participants tested on similar decision problems (ranging from probabilistic reasoning to reversal learning), noisy networks exhibit behavioral hallmarks of optimal inference in uncertain conditions entirely unseen during training. Computation noise enables this cognitive ability jointly through “structural” regularization of network weights during training and “functional” regularization by shaping the stochastic dynamics of network activity after training. Together, these findings indicate that human cognition may ride on neural variability to support adaptive decisions under uncertainty without extensive experience or engineered sophistication.",

Here, we report the first atomic structure of mouse α-synuclein fibrils, which was solved in parallel by two independent teams. The structure shows striking similarity to MSA-amplified and PD-associated E46K fibrils. However, mouse α-synuclein fibrils display altered packing arrangements, reduced hydrophobicity, and heightened fragmentation sensitivity and evoke only weak immunological responses. Furthermore, mouse α-synuclein fibrils exhibit exacerbated pathological spread in neurons and humanized α-synuclein mice. These findings provide critical insights into the structural underpinnings of α-synuclein pathogenicity and emphasize a need to reassess the role of mouse α-synuclein fibrils in the development of related diagnostic probes and therapeutic interventions.",

Current intensified therapeutic protocols coincide with severe side effects, and no salvage therapy is available for primary therapy-resistant or relapsed patients. This highlights the need to identify new therapeutic targets in T-ALL. PSIP1, dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, is a dependency factor in KMT2A -rearranged myeloid leukemia. Nonetheless, loss-of-function mutations suggest a tumor suppressor role for PSIP1 in T-ALL. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of Psip1 accelerates T-ALL initiation in mice which we correlated with reduced H3K27me3 binding. Contrastingly, loss of PSIP1 impaired cell proliferation in several T-ALL cell lines. In cell lines, PSIP1 down-regulation leads to a reduction of COX20, an assembly factor of the cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria, and to a reduction in mitochondrial respiration. This indicates that PSIP1 can exert a dual role in the context of T-ALL, either as a tumor suppressor gene during tumor initiation or as a dependency factor in tumor maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma is a common aggressive cancer and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Here, we report an important in vivo role for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number during lung adenocarcinoma progression in the mouse. We found that lung tumors induced by KRAS G12D expression have increased mtDNA levels and enhanced mitochondrial respiration. To experimentally assess a possible causative role in tumor progression, we induced lung cancer in transgenic mice with a general increase in mtDNA copy number and found that they developed a larger tumor burden, whereas mtDNA depletion in tumor cells reduced tumor growth. Immune cell populations in the lung and cytokine levels in plasma were not affected by increased mtDNA levels. Analyses of large cancer databases indicate that mtDNA copy number is also important in human lung cancer. Our study thus reports experimental evidence for a tumor-intrinsic causative role for mtDNA in lung cancer progression, which could be exploited for development of future cancer therapies.",

Here, noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) is used to directly image polarons in Fe 2 O 3 at the single quasiparticle limit. A combination of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations shows that the mobility of electron polarons can be markedly increased by Ti doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that a transition from polaronic to metastable free-carrier states can play a key role in migration of electron polarons. In contrast, hole polarons are significantly less mobile, and their hopping is hampered further by trapping centers.",

Here, inspired by organic photovoltaic structures, we demonstrate a bio-artificial photosynthetic system based on the hybridization of polymer semiconductor films and bacteria. The study suggests that the polymer-based semiconductor film can efficiently drive the non-photosynthetic bacteria to convert CO 2 to acetate. By systematically characterizing the charge transport behavior of the bio-artificial photosynthetic system, the bulk-heterojunction structure and charge transport layers are proven to enhance the system performance markedly. The scalable floating artificial bio-leaf system can produce acetate to gram scale in a week. Notably, the semiconductor film is easy to recycle and maintains stable performance, showing good sustainable production capability of the system. A quasi–solid-state artificial bio-leaf is successfully prepared using agar to simulate the morphology and function of natural leaves. Last, the acetate production converted from CO 2 was used to grow yeast for food production, thus achieving a complete simulation of natural photosynthesis.",

Here, we demonstrate that 3.3 positive charges are translocated with the negatively charged substrate in each transport step. They can be assigned to three positively charged residues of the central substrate-binding site and two asparagine/arginine pairs. In this way, the membrane potential stimulates not only the ATP 4− export step, as a net −0.7 charge is transported, but also the ADP 3− import step, as a net +0.3 charge is transported with the electric field. These positive charge movements also inhibit the import of ATP and export of ADP in the presence of a membrane potential, allowing these nucleotides to be maintained at high concentrations in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix to drive the hydrolysis and synthesis of ATP, respectively. Thus, this is the mechanism by which the membrane potential drives adenine nucleotide exchange with high directional fluxes to fuel the cellular processes.",

Here, we used an invasive in vivo mechanistic approach to interrogate muscle insulin action while selectively manipulating the mitochondrial redox state in humans. To this end, we conducted insulin clamp studies combining intravenous infusion of a lipid overload with intake of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (mitoquinone). Under lipid overload, selective modulation of mitochondrial redox state by mitoquinone enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, mitoquinone did not affect canonical insulin signaling but augmented insulin-stimulated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation while reducing the mitochondrial oxidative burden under lipid oversupply. Complementary ex vivo studies in human muscle fibers exposed to high intracellular lipid levels revealed that mitoquinone improves features of mitochondrial bioenergetics, including diminished mitochondrial H 2 O 2 emission. These findings provide translational and mechanistic evidence implicating mitochondrial oxidants in the development of lipid-induced muscle insulin resistance in humans.",

The long-standing vision of lakes as solely respirators of the organic matter leaking from the soils has been challenged by evidence that inorganic carbon produced by weathering of the catchment bedrock could also support lake CO 2 emissions. How inorganic carbon inputs ultimately generate lake CO 2 outgassing remains a blind spot. We develop and introduce a calcite module in a coupled one-dimensional physical-biogeochemical model that we use to simulate the carbon cycle of the large Lake Geneva over the past 40 years. We mechanistically demonstrate how the so-far neglected process of calcite precipitation boosts net CO 2 emissions at the annual scale.

Biophysical analysis of the mechanical properties of the mutant cells revealed a markedly softened cell cortex in the poorly adherent state. Unexpectedly, in the highly adherent state, associated with a hyperstretched morphology with exaggerated focal adhesions and prominent high-strain stress fibers, they exhibited even higher cortical tension compared to control. Notably, misguidance of intracellular forces, frequently accompanied by stress-fiber rupture, culminated in the formation of tension- and contractility-induced macroapertures, which was instantly followed by excessive lamellipodial protrusion at the periphery, providing critical insights into mechanotransduction of mechanically stressed and highly adherent cells.",

In animal models, suppressing the NM II–NKX3-2–ADGRB3 pathway in T cells effectively suppressed tumor growth and improved the efficacy of the checkpoint-specific immunotherapy.

The incorporation of pyramid-based asymmetrical optical transmission (AOT) array to a transparent silver electrode suppresses the escaping of front sunlight without sacrificing the harvesting of albedo light. Parasitic absorption induced by the excitation of surface plasmons in an AOT electrode is further reduced by doping organic emitter in electron transport layer and capping high dielectric constant film to silver. The rear electrode achieves a front transmittance of 7% and a rear transmission of 86%.

Two families of cyclopentadienone derivatives were synthesized, featuring the inter-pyridyl main conductance channel and the inter-radical paths that are linear (FCF) or cross conjugated (PCP). Using a scanning tunneling microscope break junction technique, we find that the injection of mono- and diradicals in the PCP system unexpectedly decreases the conductance regarding the closed-shell analog, while that of FCF systems increases. Through-bond and through-space conductance mechanisms are found in the FCF and PCP series, respectively, and jointly modulate the overall charge transmission.

We find that the most stable structure of Bi 18 − consists of two Bi 8 cages linked by a Bi 2 dimer, where each atom is bonded to three neighboring atoms. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that each Bi uses its three 6 p electrons to form three covalent bonds with its neighbors, resulting in a Bi 18 − cluster without any dangling bonds. We find that the robust Bi 18 framework along with the totally delocalized unpaired electron is responsible for the surprising inertness of Bi 18 − toward O 2 .

This is characterized by the emergence of GrB + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the primary tumor. A more impressive effect of sequential treatment is observed in the lung where TAM depletion and increased CTLs are accompanied by near-complete abolition of metastases. This is due to (i) therapeutic reduction in Notch-dependent, prometastatic circulating factors released by the primary tumor, and (ii) elevated PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in lung metastases, rendering them profoundly sensitive to ICB.

We find a statistically significant potential for oversupply or undersupply of energy and anomalous heating/cooling demand depending on the ENSO state and the calendar month. Implications for financial securitization and the potential application of forecasts are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Scintillation materials convert high-energy radiation to optical light through a complex multistage process. The last stage of the process is spontaneous light emission, which usually governs and limits the scintillator emission rate and light yield. For decades, scintillator research focused on developing faster-emitting materials or external photonic coatings for improving light yields. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different approach: enhancing the scintillation rate and yield via the Purcell effect, utilizing optical environment engineering to boost spontaneous emission. This enhancement is universally applicable to any scintillating material and dopant when the material’s nanoscale geometry is engineered. We design a thin multilayer nanophotonic scintillator, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced scintillation with 50% enhancement in emission rate and 80% enhancement in light yield. The emission is robust to fabrication disorder, further highlighting its potential for x-ray applications. Our results show prospects for bridging nanophotonics and scintillator science toward reduced radiation dosage and increased resolution for high-energy particle detection.",

PLPs exhibit bioactivity in HD mouse striatal cells by successfully inhibiting mitochondrial destruction. PLP is notably resilient to in vitro enzyme, serum, and liver microsome stability assays, which render analogous control oligopeptides ineffective. PLP demonstrates a 2000-fold increase in circulation half-life compared to peptides, exhibiting an elimination half-life of 152 hours. In vivo efficacy studies in HD transgenic mice (R6/2) confirm the superior bioactivity of PLP compared to free peptide through behavioral and neuropathological analyses.

Our study shows that blocking the JAK2/STAT3 pathway enhances immunogenic efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib (Ali)–induced senescence by reducing immunosuppressive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) while preserving immunogenic SASP. Hypothesizing that SASP reprogramming with Ali and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Rux) will benefit cancer immunotherapy, we create nanoparticulate crystals (Ali-Rux) composed of Ali and Rux with a fully active pharmaceutical ingredient. Immunization with Ali-Rux–orchestrated senescent cells promotes stronger activation of antigen-presenting cells, enhancing antitumor immune surveillance. This approach remodels the TME by increasing CD8 + T cell and NK recruitment and activation while decreasing MDSCs. Combined with PD-L1 blockade, Ali-Rux elicits a durable antitumor immune response, suggesting the TME reshaping approach as a potential cancer immunotherapy.",

We used a heterostructure comprising SrSnO 3 /La:SrSnO 3 /GdScO 3 (110), and applied electrostatic gating, which allow us to effectively separate charge carriers in SrSnO 3 from dopants and achieve phonon-limited transport behavior in strain-stabilized tetragonal SrSnO 3 . This led to a modulation of carrier density from 10 18 to 10 20 cm −3 , with room temperature mobilities ranging from 40 to 140 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . The phonon-limited mobility, calculated from first principles, closely matched experimental results, suggesting that room temperature mobility could be further increased with higher electron density. In addition, the sample exhibited 85% optical transparency at a 300-nm wavelength. These findings highlight the potential of heterostructure design for transparent UWBG semiconductor applications, especially in DUV regime.",

Here, we report two cryo–electron microscopy structures of amyloid fibrils formed by H46R and G85R. These mutations lead to the formation of amyloid fibrils with unique structures distinct from those of the native fibril. The core of these fibrils features a serpentine arrangement with seven or eight β strands, secured by a hydrophobic cavity and a salt bridge between arginine-85 and aspartic acid–101 in the G85R fibril. We demonstrate that these mutant fibrils are notably more toxic and capable of promoting the aggregation of wild-type SOD1 more effectively, causing mitochondrial impairment and activating ferroptosis in cell cultures, compared to wild-type SOD1 fibrils.

We applied tTIS to the right HC-EC in either continuous or intermittent theta-burst stimulation patterns (cTBS or iTBS), compared to a control condition, during a virtual reality–based spatial navigation task and concomitant functional magnetic resonance imaging. iTBS improved spatial navigation performance, correlated with hippocampal activity modulation, and decreased grid cell–like activity in EC.

Herein, we describe a bioinspired strategy for fabricating gelated cell sheet–supported lactobacillus biofilms (GCS-LBs) for AV treatment. Compared with common planktonic probiotic formulations, probiotic biofilms forming on a robust GCS exhibit enhanced stress tolerance and better colonization capacity in the mouse vagina. Moreover, DNA nanodevices are decorated on the GCS and dynamically report the microenvironment change of biofilms for timely evaluating bacterium activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, GCS-LBs are used for treating AV in an Escherichia coli –infected mouse model, which shows enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared with conventional antibiotic or lactobacillus monotherapy. Overall, the GCS-LB shows promise as a potent multifunctional tool to combat bacterial infection.",

Computer-based individual behavioral tracking of worker bees with biallelic stop mutations in colonies revealed that the dsx gene is required for the rate and duration of group-supporting behavior that scales the relationship between bees and their work. General sensorimotor functions remained unaffected. Unexpectedly, unlike in other insects, the dsx gene is required for the neuronal wiring of the mushroom body in which the gene is spatially restricted expressed.

Nonetheless, despite the vast advancement of olefination methodologies, the broadly applicable stereoselective synthesis remained elusive for geminal bromofluoroalkenes before our work. In particular, the seemingly straightforward Wittig-type approach with interhalogenated phosphorus ylide has been unsuccessful because of the difficulty in the diastereoselective oxaphosphetane formation. Here, we describe a conceptually distinctive strategy, by which the stereoselectivity is gained via the selective decomposition of the oxaphosphetane intermediates. The suitably identified phosphorus(III) reagent and reaction medium enabled efficient kinetic differentiation, which was supported by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and density functional theory calculation. Through our method, the highly diastereoselective synthesis of geminal E -bromofluoroalkenes was accomplished in one step. Furthermore, the generality was demonstrated by accommodating a wide range of readily available carbonyl compounds, including ketones and pharmaceutical substrates.",

Here, we characterize five previously unreported polyketides (alderenes A to E) biosynthesized by sea slugs reaching exceptional densities (up to 9000 slugs per square meter) in Northern Hemisphere estuaries. Alderenes comprise only 0.1% of slug wet weight, yet rendered live slugs or dead flesh unpalatable to three co-occurring consumers, making a potential food resource unavailable and redirecting energy flow in critical nursery habitat. Alderenes also displaced infauna from the upper sediment of the mudflat but attracted ovipositing snails.

Activation of caspase-2 depends on the PIDDosome multi-protein complex, and priming of PIDD1 at extra centrosomes is necessary for pathway activation. Accordingly, loss of its centrosomal adapter, ANKRD26, allows for cell survival and unrestricted polyploidization in response to cytokinesis failure. Mechanistically, cell death is initiated upstream of mitochondria via caspase-2–mediated processing of the BCL2 family protein BID, driving BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Remarkably, BID-deficient cells enforce apoptosis by engaging p53-dependent proapoptotic transcriptional responses initiated by caspase-2. Consistently, BID and MDM2 act as shared caspase-2 substrates, with BID being kinetically favored.

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are frequent in cancer, yet their precise role in cancer progression remains debated. To functionally evaluate the impact of mtDNA variants on tumor growth and metastasis, we developed an enhanced cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) generation protocol and established isogenic human melanoma cybrid lines with wild-type mtDNA or pathogenic mtDNA mutations with partial or complete loss of mitochondrial oxidative function. Cybrids with homoplasmic levels of pathogenic mtDNA reliably established tumors despite dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation. However, these mtDNA variants disrupted spontaneous metastasis from primary tumors and reduced the abundance of circulating tumor cells. Migration and invasion of tumor cells were reduced, indicating that entry into circulation is a bottleneck for metastasis amid mtDNA dysfunction. Pathogenic mtDNA did not inhibit organ colonization following intravenous injection. In heteroplasmic cybrid tumors, single-cell analyses revealed selection against pathogenic mtDNA during melanoma growth. Collectively, these findings experimentally demonstrate that functional mtDNA is favored during melanoma growth and supports metastatic entry into the blood.",
