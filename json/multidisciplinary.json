          "abstract": "Prevailing frameworks to address planetary environmental challenges tend to focus on setting goals, targets, or boundaries to limit human harm to ecosystems or species. Here we propose an aspirational approach aimed at empowering people to shape a better future for all of life on Earth. We do this by building on the human development approach and its supporting metrics, especially the Human Development Index (HDI), a broadly influential framework that has contributed to decades of human progress by measuring and promoting people’s capabilities to lead the lives that they value. Rather than assessing the state or dynamics of the biosphere, we propose the Nature Relationship Index (NRI), which would focus on measuring the progress of nations towards delivering mutually beneficial relationships among people and the rest of the living world in terms that people widely understand and value. Through an open-ended process informed by expert consultation, international concept testing and indicator development, the NRI could help to incentivize progress towards a world in which humanity thrives together with the rest of life on Earth. We explore the challenges and opportunities of developing a robust NRI and invite broader participation to facilitate this development in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report.",

          "abstract": "The dendritic cell (DC)-initiated and sustained cancer immunity cycle is indispensable for effective endogenous and therapeutically mobilized antitumour T cell responses1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. This necessitates the continuous migration of antigen-carrying DCs from the tumour microenvironment (TME) to the tumour draining lymph nodes (tdLNs)7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Here, through longitudinal analysis of human and mouse tumours, we observed a progressive decrease in migratory conventional DCs (mig-cDCs) in the tdLNs during tumour progression. This decline compromised tumour-specific T cell priming and subsequent T cell supply to the TME. Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) and its substrate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as key modulators of DC migration. Advanced tumours disrupted cGMP synthesis in DCs to decrease their motility, while PDE5 perturbation preserved the cGMP pool to restore DC migration. Mechanistically, cGMP enhanced myosin-II activity through Rho-associated factors, extending the paradigm of cGMP-regulated amoeboid migration from Dictyostelium to mammalian immune cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 using sildenafil restored mig-cDC homing to late-stage tdLNs and sustained antitumour immunity in a DC-dependent manner. Our findings bridge fundamental DC interstitial motility to antitumour immunity, revealing that its disruption in chaotic TME promotes immune evasion, and its enhancement offers a promising direction for DC-centric immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "The Tweety homologues (TTYHs) constitute a family of eukaryotic membrane proteins that, on the basis of structural features, were recently proposed to contribute to lipid transfer between soluble carriers and cellular membranes 1 . However, in the absence of supporting data, this function was hypothetical. Here through pull-down of endogenous proteins, we identify APOE as the interaction partner of human TTYH2. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry assays showed that both proteins colocalize in endosomal compartments. Characterization of the specific interaction between APOE and TTYH2 through binding assays and structural studies enabled us to identify an epitope in an extended domain of TTYH2 that faces the endosomal lumen. Structures of complexes with APOE-containing lipoprotein particles revealed a binding mode that places lipids in a suitable position to facilitate their diffusion into the membrane. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed that lipid transfer is accelerated by TTYH2. Collectively, our findings indicate that TTYH2 has a role in the unloading of APOE-containing lipoproteins after they are endocytosed. These results define a new protein class that facilitates the extraction of lipids from and their insertion into cellular membranes. Although ubiquitous, this process could be of particular relevance in the brain, where APOE is involved in the transfer of lipids between astrocytes and neurons.",

          "abstract": "Tailoring magnetic ordering in solid-state materials is essential for emerging spintronics1,2. However, substitutional lattice doping in magnetic semiconductors is often constrained by the low solubility of magnetic elements3,4,5, limiting the maximum achievable doping concentration (for example, less than 5%) and ferromagnetic ordering temperature6. The intercalation of magnetic elements in layered two-dimensional atomic crystals (2DACs) without breaking in-plane covalent bonds offers an alternative approach to incorporate a much higher concentration of magnetic atoms (for example, up to 50%) beyond the typical solubility limit. However, commonly used chemical and electrochemical intercalation methods are largely confined to a few isolated examples so far. Here we report a general two-step intercalation and cation-exchange strategy to produce a library of highly ordered magnetic intercalation superlattices (MISLs) with tunable magnetic ordering. Monovalent transition-metal cations Cu+ and Ag+, divalent magnetic cations Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+, and trivalent rare-earth cations Eu3+ and Gd3+ have been successfully incorporated into group-VIB 2DACs, including MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2, and group-IVB, -VB, -IIIA, -IVA and -VA 2DACs, including TiS2, NbS2, NbSe2, TaS2, In2Se3, SnSe2, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. We show that these MISLs can be prepared with tunable concentrations of magnetic intercalants, enabling tailored magnetic ordering across a diverse array of functional 2DACs, including semiconductors, topological insulators, and superconductors. This work establishes a versatile material platform for both fundamental investigations and spintronics applications.",

          "abstract": "Postmitotic neurons have high levels of methylated cytosine and its oxidized intermediates such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine1. However, the functional relevance of these epigenetic modifications of DNA are poorly understood. Here we show that some cytidine analogues, such as cytarabine, cause DNA double-strand breaks during TET-mediated active 5-methylcytosine demethylation by interrupting TDG-dependent base excision repair. These double-strand breaks are frequently converted into deletions and translocations by DNA ligase 4. In vivo, Purkinje and Golgi cells in the cerebellum are the only neuronal populations that exhibit high levels of DNA damage due to cytarabine. In Purkinje cells, TET targets highly expressed gene bodies marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. Many of these genes control movement coordination, which explains the long-recognized cerebellar neurotoxicity of cytarabine2. We show that other cytidine analogues, such as gemcitabine, cause only single-strand breaks in neurons, which are repaired by DNA ligase 3 with minimal toxicity. Our findings uncover a mechanistic link between TET-mediated DNA demethylation, base excision repair and gene expression in neurons. The results also provide a rational explanation for the different neurotoxicity profiles of an important class of antineoplastic agents.",

          "abstract": "The brain represents sensory variables in the coordinated activity of neural populations, in which tuning curves of single neurons define the geometry of the population code 1,2 . Whether the same coding principle holds for dynamic cognitive variables remains unknown because internal cognitive processes unfold with a unique time course on single trials observed only in the irregular spiking of heterogeneous neural populations 3–8 . Here we show the existence of such a population code for the dynamics of choice formation in the primate premotor cortex. We developed an approach to simultaneously infer population dynamics and tuning functions of single neurons to the population state. Applied to spike data recorded during decision-making, our model revealed that populations of neurons encoded the same dynamic variable predicting choices, and heterogeneous firing rates resulted from the diverse tuning of single neurons to this decision variable. The inferred dynamics indicated an attractor mechanism for decision computation. Our results reveal a unifying geometric principle for neural encoding of sensory and dynamic cognitive variables.",

          "abstract": "All-solid-state batteries require advanced cathode designs to realize their potential for high energy density and economic viability1,2,3. Integrated all-in-one cathodes, which eliminate inactive conductive additives and heterogeneous interfaces, hold promise for substantial energy and stability gains but are hindered by materials lacking sufficient Li+/e− conductivity, mechanical robustness and structural stability4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we present Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4, a cost-effective halide material that overcomes these challenges. Leveraging reversible Fe2+/Fe3+ redox and rapid Li+/e− transport within its framework, Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 achieves an electrode energy density of 529.3 Wh kg−1 versus Li+/Li. Critically, Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 shows unique dynamic properties during cycling, including reversible local Fe migration and a brittle-to-ductile transition that confers self-healing behaviour. This enables exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 90% capacity retention for 3,000 cycles at a rate of 5 C. Integration of Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 with a nickel-rich layered oxide further increases the energy density to 725.6 Wh kg−1. By harnessing the advantageous dynamic mechanical and diffusion properties of all-in-one halides, this work establishes all-in-one halides as an avenue for energy-dense, durable cathodes in next-generation all-solid-state batteries.",

It has been predicted that linear dysprosium(III) compounds could deliver greater m J (the projection of the total angular momentum, J , on a quantization axis labelled z ) state splitting and therefore higher U eff and hysteresis temperatures 18–21 , but as lanthanide bonding is predominantly ionic 22,23 , so far dysprosium bis(amide) complexes have shown highly bent geometries that promote fast magnetic reversal 24,25 .

However, the precise impact of cancer-associated neurons and the communication channels at the nerve–cancer interface remain poorly understood. Previous cancer denervation models in rodents and humans have highlighted robust cancer dependency on nerves, but the underlying mechanisms that drive nerve-mediated cancer aggressivity remain unknown2,3. Here we show that cancer-associated neurons enhance cancer metabolic plasticity by transferring mitochondria to cancer cells. Breast cancer denervation and nerve–cancer coculture models confirmed that neurons significantly improve tumour energetics. Neurons cocultured with cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, resulting in increased mitochondrial mass and subsequent transfer of mitochondria to adjacent cancer cells. To precisely track the fate of recipient cells, we developed MitoTRACER, a reporter of cell-to-cell mitochondrial transfer that permanently labels recipient cancer cells and their progeny. Lineage tracing and fate mapping of cancer cells acquiring neuronal mitochondria in primary tumours revealed their selective enrichment at metastatic sites following dissemination. Collectively, our data highlight the enhanced metastatic capabilities of cancer cells that receive mitochondria from neurons in primary tumours, shedding new light on how the nervous system supports cancer metabolism and metastatic dissemination.",

However, established methods for time-resolved CPL (TRCPL) characterization have notable limitations 8–17 , generally requiring a compromise between sensitivity, accessible timescales and spectral information. This has limited the acquisition of in-depth photophysical insight necessary for materials development. Here we demonstrate a high-sensitivity (noise level of the order of 10 −4 ), broadband (about 400–900 nm), transient (nanosecond resolution, millisecond range) full-Stokes (CPL and linear polarizations) spectroscopy setup. The achieved combination of high-sensitivity, broad wavelength response and flexible time ranges represents a substantial advancement over previous TRCPL approaches. As a result, TRCPL measurements are shown to be applicable to hitherto inaccessible material systems and photophysical processes, including systems with low (10 −3 ) dissymmetry factors and luminescence pathways spanning nanosecond to millisecond time ranges. Finally, full-Stokes measurements allow tracking the temporal evolution of linear polarization components, of interest by themselves, but especially relevant in the context of controlling for associated CPL artefacts 18,19 in the time domain.",

Strategies that can rapidly introduce diverse vicinal substituents to readily available precursors would greatly benefit generation of analogues of bioactive compounds2, which, however, remain challenging to realize to date. The existing approaches for preparing vicinal difunctionalized arenes lack modularity, or regioselectivity, or generality. Here we report a nickel-catalyzed vicinal diborylation method that can directly install two chemically differentiated boryl groups in a regio- and site-selective manner using readily available aryl triflates or chlorides as substrates. This reaction operates under simple and mild conditions and is scalable. It also shows a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Given that each boryl group can be independently transformed into various functional groups, this method offers a modular, regioselective, and divergent approach to access diverse vicinal difunctionalized arenes, showing promise for constructing analogue libraries. The combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal a highly unusual reaction pathway, involving the formation of a dearomatized gem-diboryl species and 1,2-boron migration. The site- and regioselectivity of this reaction are proposed to be controlled by steric interactions of the boryl groups with the nickel catalyst. The mechanistic insights gained in this investigation could have broad implications on developing other boron-mediated functionalization reactions.",

          "abstract": "Aggregation pheromone, 4-vinylanisole (4VA), is specifically released by gregarious migratory locusts, and is crucial in forming locust swarms that cause destructive plagues1. Control of locust plagues relies heavily on the extensive application of chemical pesticides, which has led to severe environmental and health issues2. As pheromones are primary mediators of insect communication and behaviour3, exploring their biosynthesis can provide important cues to develop innovative behavioural regulators, potentially reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Here we resolve the biosynthesis of 4VA and behavioural responses of locusts when enzymes in the 4VA biosynthetic pathway are manipulated. The process initiates with phenylalanine derived from food plants and proceeds through three precursors: cinnamic acid, p-hydroxycinnamic acid and 4-vinylphenol (4VP). Notably, the conversion from 4VP to 4VA through methylation is unique to gregarious locusts. This step is catalysed by two crucial methyltransferases, 4VPMT1 and 4VPMT2. Guided by the X-ray co-crystal structure of 4VPMT2 bound with 4VP and S-adenosyl-l-methionine, we developed 4-nitrophenol as a substrate surrogate. We identified several chemicals that can block 4VA production by inhibiting the enzymatic activities of 4VPMT proteins, thereby suppressing locust aggregative behaviour. The findings uncover the chemical logic behind 4VA biosynthesis and pinpoint two crucial enzymes as novel targets for locust swarm management.",

Even so, heat and crosstalk from closely integrated control have the potential to degrade qubit performance, particularly for two-qubit entangling gates based on exchange coupling that are sensitive to electrical noise 11,12 . Here we benchmark silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-style electron spin qubits controlled by heterogeneously integrated cryo-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cryo-CMOS) circuits with a power density sufficiently low to enable scale-up. Demonstrating that cryo-CMOS can efficiently perform universal logic operations for spin qubits, we go on to show that milli-kelvin control has little impact on the performance of single- and two-qubit gates. Given the complexity of our sub-kelvin CMOS platform, with about 100,000 transistors, these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a ‘chiplet-style’ control architecture.",

Yet, the pathways from computer vision to surveillance continue to be contentious. Here we present an empirical account of the nature and extent of the surveillance AI pipeline, showing extensive evidence of the close relationship between the field of computer vision and surveillance. Through an analysis of computer-vision research papers and citing patents, we found that most of these documents enable the targeting of human bodies and body parts. Comparing the 1990s to the 2010s, we observed a fivefold increase in the number of these computer-vision papers linked to downstream surveillance-enabling patents. Additionally, our findings challenge the notion that only a few rogue entities enable surveillance. Rather, we found that the normalization of targeting humans permeates the field. This normalization is especially striking given patterns of obfuscation. We reveal obfuscating language that allows documents to avoid direct mention of targeting humans, for example, by normalizing the referring to of humans as ‘objects’ to be studied without special consideration. Our results indicate the extensive ties between computer-vision research and surveillance.",

Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms efficient hole transfer from P2EH-1V to the donor PM6. Devices based on P2EH-1V exhibit reduced non-radiative voltage losses of 0.20 eV without compromising charge-generation efficiency. We achieve a 17.9% efficiency for the organic bottom cell, with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 28.60 mA cm−2. Furthermore, we minimize interface recombination losses, enabling the perovskite top cell to achieve an impressive open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.37 V and a fill factor (FF) of 85.5%.

Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware 5–8 , but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modelled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities and may change their material properties with use 9–12 . Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot’s actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots’ materials, actuation or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.",

Aged a few million up to a few billion years, debris disks have lost their primordial gas, and their dust is produced by steady-state collisions between larger, rocky bodies1,2. Tens of debris disks, with sizes of tens, sometimes hundreds, of astronomical units have been resolved with high-spatial-resolution, high-contrast imagers at optical and near-infrared or (sub)millimetre interferometers3,4. They commonly show cavities, ring-like structures and gaps, which are often regarded as indirect signatures of the presence of planets that gravitationally interact with unseen planetesimals2,5. However, no planet responsible for these features has been detected yet, probably because of the limited sensitivity (typically 2–10 MJ) of high-contrast imaging instruments (see, for example, refs. 6,7,8,9) before the James Webb Space Telescope. Here we have used the unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope’s Mid-Infrared Instrument10,11 in the thermal infrared to search for such planets in the disk of the approximately 6.4-Myr-old star TWA 7. With its pole-on orientation, this three-ring debris disk is indeed ideally suited for such a detection. We unambiguously detected a source 1.5 arcsec from the star, which is best interpreted as a cold, sub-Jupiter-mass planet. Its estimated mass (about 0.3 MJ) and position (about 52 au, de-projected) can thoroughly account for the main disk structures.",

Genetic code expansion offers a general approach for ncAA encoding by reassigning stop codons as the ‘blank’ codon; however, it is not completely orthogonal to translation termination for cellular transcripts. Here, to generate more bona fide blank codons, we developed an RNA codon-expansion (RCE) strategy that introduces and decodes bioorthogonally assignable pseudouridine (Ψ) codons (ΨGA, ΨAA or ΨAG) on specified mRNA transcripts to incorporate ncAAs in mammalian cells. The RCE strategy comprises a programmable guide RNA4, an engineered decoder tRNA, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. We first developed the RCE(ΨGA) system, which incorporates functional ncAAs into proteins via the ΨGA codon, demonstrating a higher translatome-wide and proteomic specificity compared with the genetic code expansion system. We further expanded our strategy to produce the RCE(ΨAA) and RCE(ΨAG) systems, with all three Ψ codon:(Ψ codon)-tRNAPyl pairs exhibiting mutual orthogonality. Moreover, we demonstrated that the RCE system cooperates compatibly with the genetic code expansion strategy for dual ncAA encoding. In sum, the RCE method utilized Ψ as a post-transcriptional ‘letter’ to encode and decode RNA codons in specific mRNA transcripts, opening a new route for genetic alphabet expansion and site-specific ncAA incorporation in eukaryotic cells.",

Catalytic processes that convert plastic waste into valuable chemicals and fuels offer promising solutions2. Recycling or upcycling of real-life plastic mixtures is challenging owing to their diverse composition and structure3. Here we propose a product-oriented strategy leveraging the orthogonality in reactivities of different functional groups in plastic mixtures to yield valuable products. This approach involves identifying functional groups followed by converting a selective component in the mixture to valuable products. We use mixtures of polystyrene, polylactic acid, polyurethane, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as real-life plastics, to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The diverse physical and chemical properties of these components, which typically hinder direct recovery, offer opportunities for extraction and transformation with the proposed strategy. From a 20-g mixture of real-life plastics, including polystyrene foam, a polylactic acid straw, a polyurethane tube, a polycarbonate mask, a polyvinyl chloride bag, a polyethylene terephthalate bottle, a polyethylene dropper and a polypropylene bottle, we obtained more than 8 separate chemicals: 1.3 g of benzoic acid, 0.5 g of plasticizer, 0.7 g of alanine, 0.7 g of lactic acid, 1.4 g of aromatic amine salt, 2.1 g of bisphenol A, 2.0 g of terephthalic acid and 3.5 g of C3–C6 alkanes.

While extensive structural studies have been conducted on recombinant AMPARs and native calcium impermeable (CI)-AMPARs alongside their auxiliary proteins2-5, the molecular architecture of native calcium permeable (CP)-AMPARs has remained undefined. To elucidate the subunit composition, physiological architecture, and gating mechanisms of CP-AMPARs, here we present the first visualization of these receptors, immunoaffinity purified from rat cerebella, and resolve their structures using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results indicate that the predominant assembly consists of GluA1 and GluA4 subunits, with the GluA4 subunit occupying the B and D positions, while auxiliary subunits, including TARPs, are located at the B′/D′ positions and CNIHs or TARPs at the A′/C′ positions. Furthermore, we resolved the structure of the Noelin 1-GluA1/A4 complex, wherein Noelin 1 (Noe 1) specifically binds to the GluA4 subunit at the B and D positions. Notably, Noe 1 stabilizes the amino-terminal domain (ATD) layer without affecting receptor gating properties. Noe 1 contributes to AMPAR function by forming dimeric-AMPAR assemblies that likely engage in extracellular networks, clustering receptors within synaptic environments and modulating receptor responsiveness to synaptic inputs.",

          "abstract": "Mitotic onset is a critical transition for eukaryotic cell proliferation. The commonly held view of mitotic control is that the master regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), is first activated in the cytoplasm, at the centrosome, initiating mitosis 1–3 . Bistability in CDK activation ensures that the transition is irreversible, but how this unfolds in a spatially compartmentalized cell is unknown 4–8 . Here, using fission yeast, we show that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, and that the bistable responses differ markedly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a stronger response in the nucleus driving mitotic signal propagation from there to the cytoplasm. Abolishing cyclin–CDK localization to the centrosome led to activation occurring only in the nucleus, spatially uncoupling the nucleus and cytoplasm mitotically, suggesting that centrosomal cyclin–CDK acts as a ‘signal relayer’. We propose that the key mitotic regulatory system operates in the nucleus in proximity to DNA, which enables incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage to be effectively monitored to preserve genome integrity and to integrate ploidy within the CDK control network. This spatiotemporal regulatory framework establishes core principles for control of the onset of mitosis and highlights that the CDK control system operates within distinct regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm.",

Recently, our interferometry experiments with several ‘particle states’ reported flux periods of ΔΦ = (e/e*)Φ0 (with Φ0 the flux quantum) at moderate temperatures16. Here we report interference measurements of ‘particle–hole conjugated’ states at filling factors ν = 2/3, 3/5 and 4/7, which revealed unexpected flux periodicities of ΔΦ = ν−1Φ0. The measured shot-noise Fano factor (F) of the partitioned quasiparticles in each of the quantum point contacts of the interferometer was F = ν (ref. 17) rather than that of the elementary charge F = e*/e (refs. 18,19). These observations indicate that the interference of bunched (clustered) elementary quasiparticles occurred for coherent pairs, triples and quadruplets, respectively. A small metallic gate (top gate), deposited in the centre of the interferometer bulk, formed an antidot (or a dot) when charged, thus introducing local quasiparticles at the perimeter of the (anti)dot. Surprisingly, such charging led to a dissociation of the ‘bunched quasiparticles’ and, thus, recovered the conventional flux periodicity set by the elementary charge of the quasiparticles. However, the shot-noise Fano factor (of each quantum point contact) consistently remained at F = ν, possibly due to the neutral modes accompanying the conjugated states. The two observations—bunching and debunching (or dissociation)—were not expected by current theories. Similar effects may arise in Jain’s ‘particle states’ (at lower temperatures) and at even denominator fractional quantum Hall states20.",

We combine it with single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing analyses, human organotypic GBM cultures, in vivo cell-specific CRISPR–Cas9-driven genetic perturbations as well as human and mouse experimental systems to identify an annexin A1–formyl peptide receptor 1 (ANXA1–FPR1) bidirectional astrocyte–GBM communication pathway that limits tumour-specific immunity. FPR1 inhibits immunogenic necroptosis in tumour cells, and ANXA1 suppresses NF-κB and inflammasome activation in astrocytes. ANXA1 expression in astrocytes and FPR1 expression in cancer cells are associated with poor outcomes in individuals with GBM. The inactivation of astrocyte–glioma ANXA1–FPR1 signalling enhanced dendritic cell, T cell and macrophage responses, increasing infiltration by tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and limiting T cell exhaustion.

Using an unbiased screen, we identified drug candidates that modulate NO neuron activity and enhance motility in mouse colonic tissue ex vivo. We established a high-throughput strategy to define developmental programs driving the specification of NO neurons and found that inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) promotes their differentiation from precursors of the enteric nervous system. Transplantation of these neurons into NO-neuron-deficient mice led to robust engraftment and improved GI motility, offering a promising cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative GI disorders.

In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter, such as deconfined quark–gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions 2 or expanding quantum degenerate gases 3,4 . Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges 5,6 , levitons 7 and anyon statistics 8 . Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity 9 as the number of interacting particles increases 10 remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analysing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit at which the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet scattering experiments illustrate how coordinated behaviour emerges through interactions of only a few elementary constituents. Studying similar signatures in other physical platforms such as cold-atom simulators 4,11 or collections of anyonic excitations 8,12 may help identify emergence of exotic phases and, more broadly, advance understanding of matter engineering.",

But addressing many of the most destabilizing challenges of our time requires building resilient societies, not weapons.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States has suspended multiple foreign-aid programmes and taken steps to withdraw from the World Health Organization. Trump is proposing discretionary-budget increases of 13% for the defence department and 65% for homeland security.\n\nOther countries have likewise signalled a retreat from multilateral development. The United Kingdom plans to reduce its official development assistance from 0.7% of its gross national income to just 0.3% from 2027; France has cut its aid budget by 35%; and Germany’s incoming coalition plans to reduce humanitarian aid by 50%.\n\nTrump’s cuts to international aid are stifling Africa’s HIV research\n\nAt the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), countries pledged to mobilize US$1.3 trillion annually by 2035 to fund efforts to address climate change. Yet, without robust development support, many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will lack the institutional infrastructure to access, deploy or govern these funds effectively.\n\nIn global health, these cuts are coming as the consequences of previous reductions in aid are already being felt. A 70% decline in official development assistance to Africa since 2021 has contributed to a $220-million funding deficit for countries’ response to the mpox outbreak of the past few years.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the United States approved funding — which would eventually rise to more than $12 billion — for the rebuilding of western Europe. Known as the Marshall Plan, it was not merely an act of generosity. It was a calculated effort to rebuild economies, stabilize democracies and contain the spread of extremism.\n\nBuilding resilient societies abroad will similarly make people safer in their own nations today. No missile-defence system could have stopped the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, which destabilized economies and overwhelmed health systems, including in militarily powerful nations. Similarly, climate-related disasters, environmental degradation and lack of investment in education are driving armed conflict and contributing to a global rise in nationalist political movements.\n\nTrump blew up the global fight against AIDS. Can it recover?\n\nDevelopment must be reclaimed as a crucial means for sustaining long-term global and national security.\n\nThis means world leaders and societies recognizing that investments in public-health infrastructure, education and climate adaptation are not acts of charity or means to exert soft power, but essential strategic investments. It means treating development as a cornerstone of global security in national budgets and shielding development finance from short-term political pressures. This could be done, for instance, by codifying aid targets into law.\n\nSome countries, such as Sweden and Norway, have consistently upheld high levels of official development assistance through long-standing political consensus, even without legal mandates. But in many HICs, development assistance is often subject to cuts when domestic priorities shift or fiscal pressures mount.",

          "abstract": "The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first images, leaving astronomers in awe of the unprecedented capabilities of the observatory’s 3,200-megapixel digital camera — the largest in the world. The images were created from shots taken during a trial that started in April, when construction of the observatory’s Simonyi Survey Telescope was completed.\n\n“Wow. You want to observe the grandeur of the Universe? This is the way to observe it!” says astronomer Robert Williams, former head of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nMajor telescope hosts world’s largest digital camera: how it will transform astronomy\n\nOne image (pictured) shows the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula, in a region of the Milky Way that is dense with ionized hydrogen and with young and still-forming stars. The picture was created from 678 separate exposures taken by the Simonyi Survey Telescope in just over 7 hours. Each exposure was monochromatic and taken with one of four filters; they were combined to give the rich colours of the final product.\n\nThe Rubin Observatory, which sits on Cerro Pachón in the Andes Mountains in central Chile, is a US$810-million, US-led facility. The observatory has a very large field of view that will be able to cover the entire southern sky every three to four nights. Other telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, are more sensitive to tiny details but take in only one small section of the sky at a time.\n\nThe latest images were put together mainly for aesthetic impact and to showcase how the observatory’s digital camera can scan large swathes of sky with high sensitivity and in a short time. As such, they are quite different from the types of ‘data product’ that astronomers around the world will use for research purposes, says Sandrine Thomas, a deputy director for the observatory’s construction, who is based in Tucson, Arizona. And yet, the images are a reminder of what drives astronomers in the first place. “We go into astronomy because we like to look at the sky — and at the beauty of it,” she says.",

          "abstract": "Using large language models to speed up or automate peer review ignores the fact that these models lack the unique perspectives of real reviewers.Credit: Peshkova/Getty\n\nTime is a precious commodity for research scientists. As students, we develop skills for managing our time, which we hone throughout our careers as responsibilities change. We are often quick to adopt new technologies that lighten the load. From statistical software and digital typesetting to online literature searches and high-throughput data collection, technology helps us to do more, faster. Yet some aspects of our jobs seem resistant to automation: reading the literature, drafting manuscripts and engaging in peer review, for example.\n\nAdvances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the past few years hint at the possibility of automating these time-consuming tasks. Proposals for adopting AI into scientific processes have run the gamut from generating hypotheses and collecting data to performing analyses, writing papers, conducting review, detecting errors and evaluating the reliability of published work. Some have even suggested that AI could do PhD-level research or operate as a fully autonomous scientist.\n\nThree AI-powered steps to faster, smarter peer review\n\nAs researchers who study how digital information technologies affect society, we find ourselves grappling with whether and how to adopt AI into our research workflows. We face the same time pressures as everyone else, but ethical concerns — and questions of accuracy — loom large. AI-use policies continue to shift as journals and funders struggle to keep pace. Prominent researchers, including AI experts, have already run into trouble.\n\nThese are all important, practical matters. But a deeper issue lurks beneath the surface. The reason these aspects of our jobs have been so challenging to automate is that they rely on something even more precious than our time: namely, our capacity for scientific decision-making. It is worth considering what we lose when we cede that — and our agency — to machines.\n\nPeer review\n\nOver the past decade, the number of published articles has grown much faster than the number of scientists. The peer-review system is strained to near breaking point. As editors, we find it harder than ever to secure willing referees; as authors, we watch our manuscripts languish in editorial limbo; as reviewers, we receive many more requests than we can possibly accept.\n\nEvolutionary biologist Carl Bergstrom.Credit: Kris Tsujikawa\n\nWe (C.T.B. and J.B.-C.) have collaborated for the better part of a decade and have come to realize that we share an approach to writing referee reports. We begin with an initial read of the paper, taking notes along the way. With a sense of the full arc, we reread the paper, refining our notes and diving deeper: searching the literature, checking code, sketching diagrams or doing a bit of analysis, for example. Eventually, we cull, organize and expand our notes into the prose that constitutes the final report. The process — which is entirely uncompensated and mostly unrecognized — takes hours or even days.\n\nCould a large language model (LLM) accelerate the process? Some engineers are trying to build entirely automated peer-review systems, but that goal strikes us as patently silly: it is peer review, after all, emphasis on ‘peer’.\n\nAttempting a more moderate position, one Nature columnist suggested that reviewers first use auto-dictation tools to compile notes during an initial read and then feed those notes into an LLM to organize their feedback. The author says they can complete a review using this approach in 30–40 minutes, or even faster if the paper is obviously flawed.\n\nAI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried\n\nBut in our view, writing a good peer review is not rote work. Like any kind of critical analysis, it requires that we triage, rank and organize our unstructured thoughts. We perhaps start with praise, then raise a few of the most pressing issues that need to be addressed. From there, we enumerate quick fixes, minor concerns and points of confusion. The whole process constitutes a negotiation with ourselves over what is important enough to mention, so that we can negotiate with the editors and authors over what should be changed. We might discover that our original impressions were misguided; that some of our comments need to be revised or omitted; or that seemingly minor issues are, in fact, fundamental flaws. The process of summarizing and synthesizing helps us to engage more deeply with the manuscript.\n\nWriting a peer review, then, or even going from initial notes to the final text, requires capacities that an LLM simply lacks: our unique perspective, training, values, ethics, domain expertise, understanding of editorial priorities and perceptions of the authors. Even if an AI tool could write a review, it would never be able to write your review — or any peer’s review, for that matter. If we cede this process to LLMs, we relinquish our agency to improve the scientific literature. As historian David McCullough expressed in a 2003 interview: “Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard.”\n\nAI science, automation and de-skilling\n\nThe implications extend well beyond peer review. Proponents of AI-assisted science argue that AI can increase productivity by freeing researchers from the drudgery of routine tasks. Where these tasks are entirely rote — formatting a bibliography, for example — we agree. But, more often than not, they include crucial aspects of doing science.",

          "abstract": "The US National Institutes of Health’s Gateway Center is the main visitor entrance to the agency’s campus in Bethesda, Maryland.Credit: Briscoe Savoy for Nature\n\nFrom 1 July, researchers funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be required to make their scientific papers available to read for free as soon as they are published in a peer-reviewed journal. That’s according to the agency’s latest public-access policy, aimed at making federally funded research accessible to taxpayers.\n\nUS government reveals big changes to open-access policy\n\nEstablished under former US president Joe Biden, the policy was originally set to take effect on 31 December for all US agencies, but the administration of Biden’s successor, Donald Trump, has accelerated its implementation for the NIH, a move that has surprised some scholars. That’s because, although the Trump team has declared itself a defender of taxpayer dollars, it has also targeted programmes and research projects focused on equity and inclusion for elimination. And one of the policy’s main goals is to ensure equitable access to federally funded research.\n\nThe move means that universities will have less time to advise their researchers on how to comply with the policy, says Peter Suber, director of the Harvard Open Access Project in Cambridge, Massachusetts. There is usually “some confusion or even some non-compliance after a new policy takes effect, but I think universities will eventually get on top of that”, he says.\n\nThe NIH policy has been welcomed by open-access (OA) advocates, and reflects a global shift towards making publicly funded research freely available. Since 2021, several European science agencies that provide funding for researchers have required grant holders to make their papers OA immediately.\n\nHere, Nature asks publishing specialists what researchers need to know about the NIH policy.\n\nWhat is the new policy?\n\nScientific papers that result from projects funded by the NIH must be deposited in the agency’s digital repository, PubMed Central, and made freely available there immediately after publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Previously, the NIH, the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, allowed journals to restrict access to papers for an embargo period of up to 12 months before making them publicly available in PubMed Central. The policy applies to manuscripts accepted for publication on or after 1 July, and the version deposited can be either the ‘accepted’ manuscript (including all revisions resulting from the peer-review process) or the final published article.\n\nWhat options do authors have?\n\nScientists can take one of several routes to make their papers immediately free to read. For authors already publishing in an OA journal (or the OA portion of a hybrid journal), the policy brings little change: when researchers’ papers are posted online by the journal, they are made freely available to readers. These authors just need to ensure that their papers are deposited in PubMed Central as soon as they are published. And “if you’re publishing open access, a lot of those publishers have mechanisms in place to do the deposit for you”, says Lisa Hinchliffe, a librarian and academic at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign.\n\nAuthors publishing in closed-access journals (or the closed sections of hybrid journals), which require people to have a subscription to read papers, will be most affected by the change, Hinchliffe says. Researchers will have to make sure that the agreement they sign with the publisher complies with the NIH policy, meaning that they are allowed to deposit the full version of the paper in PubMed Central without embargo. They might also need to submit the paper to PubMed Central themselves, because some publishers have indicated that they will not offer this service.\n\nWhat issues might researchers encounter?\n\nSeveral publishers, including Elsevier and Springer Nature, require that papers published in closed-access journals remain available only to subscribers for an embargo period — 6 or 12 months, for instance — before they can be placed in repositories such as PubMed Central (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher, Springer Nature). “It’s very likely that not all publisher agreements will be compatible with the new policy, and that creates a difficult situation — both for the publisher and for the author,” Suber says.\n\nHow can I publish open access when I can’t afford the fees?\n\nThese publishers might steer authors towards their OA journals (or the OA parts of their hybrid journals) to comply with the policy. However, OA journals make their money by asking for article-processing charges (APCs), which can be anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Authors switching to publishing in an OA journal would be responsible for paying those APCs. This is what happened when Plan S — an OA initiative launched by a coalition of mostly European funders — went into effect, Hinchliffe says.\n\n“Authors should know that in advance, and if they don’t want to pay the APC, but still want to comply with the NIH policy, then they have to go somewhere else,” Suber says.\n\nSome authors might not need to worry about APCs, however. In preparation for the NIH policy coming into effect, some universities have been putting in place agreements with publishers that allow their researchers to publish OA papers at no cost to them, generally through contracts where universities shift funds previously spent on subscriptions to supporting OA publishing. The Big Ten Academic Alliance, a consortium of US research universities, announced one such agreement with Springer Nature last month. Not only are we prepared for the transition to OA, says Maurice York, director of Library Initiatives for the Big Ten alliance, but “it’s what we’ve been pushing for”.\n\nFurthermore, some funders cover APCs. According to the NIH’s policy, the agency will allow authors to include ‘reasonable costs’ associated with publication, such as APCs, in their project budgets.",

However, not everyone is able to respond to the same degree. Illness, disability, lack of transport and financial constraints can all exacerbate the risk for people in vulnerable groups. This can lead to disproportionate consequences. For example, between 1930 and 2015, people aged over 65 accounted for 46% of excess deaths associated with hurricanes in the United States (R. Young and S. Hsiang Nature 635, 121–128; 2024).\n\nTo help the people most at risk, local authorities and first responders need to know in advance who lives in the areas most affected, so they can deploy targeted resources. But they cannot easily access this information.\n\nHow AI is improving climate forecasts\n\nTo demonstrate what could be possible, my colleagues and I at the Environmental Inequality Lab have developed a framework for rapid-response analysis. Using the best available data, this method can deliver timely insights to local authorities and first responders before, during and after disasters.\n\nOur approach combines demographic and socio-economic data provided by the US Census Bureau with forecasts released by the US National Hurricane Center and Weather Prediction Center. The population data are privacy-protected and consist of aggregated counts by age, race, sex and income decile, mapped in grid cells of approximately one square kilometre. This provides localized insights while ensuring that no individual or household can be identified.\n\nBringing these data sets together tells us in real time where and when a disaster is expected to strike, as well as who is likely to be most exposed to risks such as high winds, storm surges and flooding. We are developing similar tools to evaluate the risks of wildfires and heatwaves.\n\nWe tested our work flow during Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on Florida’s west coast late on 9 October 2024. On 8 and 9 October, we released a report (see go.nature.com/4jwkuro) showing who was forecast to be exposed to the greatest hazards. The next week, we released a follow-up report (see go.nature.com/3hicifv) comparing the forecasts with data on the storm’s actual extent. In this case, the forecasts turned out to be a reasonable guide to what happened.\n\nHurricane risk in a changing climate — the role of uncertainty\n\nOur analysis highlighted how different populations faced different levels of risk. The people who experienced hurricane-force winds and excessive rainfall during Milton were disproportionately older, disproportionately Hispanic and disproportionately relatively poor (falling in the bottom 20% of the national income distribution).",

The behaviour of a Coulomb liquid is characterized by strong interparticle interactions. This means that the motions of the electrons are correlated — what one electron does depends on what the others are doing. Shaju et al. studied the emergence of the Coulomb liquid in objects called electron droplets, which comprise small numbers (in this work, between two and five) of interacting electrons confined in a small space.

          "abstract": "Children’s health could be under threat as a result of cuts to research funding.Credit: Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle/Getty\n\nAmid the hurly-burly of US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s crusade to revolutionize the nation’s health agencies, one message rings clear: it’s all about the kids.\n\nKennedy has pledged that his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement will focus on improving the health of the nation’s children. Last month, Kennedy’s MAHA Commission released the Make Our Children Healthy Again: Assessment report to guide federal efforts to tackle chronic disease among kids. “For Americans to be healthy, we must start when they are children,” Kennedy said in a statement to the US Senate on 14 May.\n\nHow paediatrician researchers are advancing child health\n\nBut many scientists who study paediatric health and disease fear that the US government’s push to reduce science spending jeopardizes that goal. Since Kennedy became head of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in February, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) — which is part of the HHS — has axed more than 1,900 research grants, and US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting the NIH’s funding by about 40% for 2026.\n\n“These cuts are catastrophic,” says Laura Anthony, a clinical and developmental psychologist at the Children's Hospital of Colorado in Aurora, who spoke to Nature in her own capacity and not on behalf of her employers. “I worry that this is going to affect a whole generation, both of kids and scientists.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump administration says grant terminations by the NIH have largely focused on wasteful spending projects. Last week, a federal judge told the NIH to reinstate many of the terminated grants and said that their cancellation was discriminatory and “bereft of reasoning”.\n\nMixed bag\n\nA key goal of the MAHA movement is to address what its supporters consider to be the roots of chronic disease in the United States. This includes overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, and exposure to environmental factors such as industrial and agricultural chemicals, fluoride in drinking water and electromagnetic radiation. The MAHA report, released on 22 May, focused on the effect of these and other influences on children’s health, and called for more research in areas including nutrition, toxicology and drug safety.\n\nMAHA’s spotlight on children’s health is welcome — especially its emphasis on diet and mental health, says Wendy Chung, a geneticist and chief of the department of paediatrics at Boston Children’s Hospital in Massachusetts. “This could be the decade of the kids, and that would be an amazing thing,” she says.\n\n154 million lives and counting: 5 charts reveal the power of vaccines\n\nBut, she adds, the report also expressed scepticism about the safety of childhood vaccines known to protect children from numerous harmful diseases. The American Academy of Pediatrics has said that it welcomed the report’s focus on disease prevention and mental health, but that the report misrepresented the academy’s treatment guidelines for obesity. The MAHA report also cited several studies that do not exist. The White House press secretary attributed the fictitious references to “formatting issues”.\n\nMAHA’s handling of scientific evidence has worried researchers. “It’s not a bad idea to make people healthy,” says Phyllis Dennery, chair of paediatrics at Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island. “The approach just has to be based in science.”\n\nA spokesperson for the White House denied that it challenges the value of vaccination. “HHS remains committed to advancing children’s health through gold-standard science and evidence-based policy,” says an HHS spokesperson.\n\nKids’ research cancelled\n\nThe 1,900 or more grants cancelled since Kennedy took his position include some paediatric studies. “I don’t see any evidence of increased funding,” says Anthony. “Instead, it has been a drastic, tragic decrease.”\n\nSome areas of paediatric research have been hit particularly hard. In January, Trump signed one executive order that officially recognized only two sexes, and another that banned US funding or support for some gender-affirming medical treatments for people under the age of 19. A Nature analysis in April found that nearly one-quarter of cancelled NIH grants at that time were related to the health of transgender people and members of other gender and sexual minority communities (LGBTQ+). “The medical interventions for gender dysphoria that the prior administration pushed are not backed by evidence,” a spokesman for the White House says.\n\nExclusive: NIH to terminate hundreds of active research grants\n\nThese funding cuts pose a particular problem for children’s health, says Dennery, given the growing number of adolescents who are seeking gender-affirming care in the United States, and the need for more data on how best to provide it. “It’s hard to understand the logic behind these research cuts,” says Dennery. “They may, in fact, make less information available in terms of guiding treatment.”\n\nOn 16 June, a federal court ordered the NIH to restore some terminated grants pertaining to LGBTQ+ people and Black people. Many of those grants were cancelled after Trump issued an executive order to end programmes for diversity, equity and inclusion. His administration could appeal against the court’s decision.",

          "authors": "Mariana Lenharo",
          "abstract": "The United Nations, governments and aid agencies are scrambling to save one of the world’s largest public-health databases from extinction. In February, the US government cut all funding for the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programme, which collects and publishes data on health, nutrition and gender equality in more than 90 countries.\n\nThe termination was a result of the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which had supported the DHS programme for some 40 years, including a 5-year, US$236-million grant awarded last year.\n\nThe surveys collect data on HIV, childhood and maternal mortality, malaria, tuberculosis and other health topics. With around 345,000 citations on Google Scholar, it is the most-cited international household-survey programme in the world, says João Pedro Azevedo, chief statistician at UNICEF, the UN children’s fund, based in New York City. The data are also used to track health-related indicators supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nEnding the DHS would be catastrophic, says Peter Macharia, a spatial epidemiologist from Kenya, now at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. Macharia says his PhD on child health interventions was based entirely on DHS data from Kenya. “Where would we get our new statistics from?” he asks. “We would not know what is happening in terms of health in the communities and the needs in each area,” he says.\n\n“For many countries, [the DHS] was one of the very few sources of reliable micro-data to inform policies and monitor the well-being of children and women especially,” Azevedo adds. “The discontinuity of the US grants was a big loss.”\n\nNow, a task force has been established by the UN Statistical Commission, the world's body that sets standards for statistics. The task force, which includes representatives from national governments, UN agencies and international funders, is assessing how access to the database can continue, along with finding alternative funding sources.\n\nLarge funders, including the World Bank, headquartered in Washington DC, and the Gates Foundation, based in Seattle, Washington, are involved. A Gates Foundation spokesperson confirmed that funders are searching for ways to keep the DHS going for at least the next three years. They said the foundation regards the DHS as a “public good”. Many of these organizations also rely on DHS data to guide their funding decisions, says Haoyi Chen, a member of a UN-convened body called the Inter-Secretariat Working Group on Household Surveys, which is coordinating the task force.\n\nWho owns the data?\n\nThe taskforce is also grappling with how to clarify who owns the data, which will influence whether or how other funders will get involved. USAID subcontracted the surveys programme to ICF International, a private consulting company based in Reston, Virginia. The firm oversees both the physical data collection from household surveys and the online platform that hosts the database, which is accessed by policymakers and researchers worldwide.\n\nUsers already registered on the platform have retained data access. But new users can no longer request it. ICF International has not publicly disclosed its plans for the database.\n\n“ICF has the redistribution rights, and presumably countries own their own data. But this has never been written in a contract,” Chen says. One risk, she notes, is if the company starts charging for access. “It’s a for-profit company. So, what if the company says, ‘I have the data, I own it, so you have to pay to get it?’”\n\nThe company did not reply to Nature’s request for a comment by the time this article was published.",

A study now suggests they are at least 4.16 billion years old — 160 million years older than any others recorded, and the only piece of Earth's crust known to have survived from the planet’s earliest eon1.\n\nIn 2008, researchers reported that these rocks dated back 4.3 billion years2, a claim that other scientists contested. Work reported today in Science1 seems to confirm that the rocks, known as the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt, are record-breakers.\n\nResearchers say the rock formation offers a unique window into early Earth, after the planet cooled from its fiery birth 4.5 billion years ago.\n\n“It’s not a matter of ‘my rock is older than yours’,” says Jonathan O’Neil, a geologist at Ottawa University who leads the research team. “It’s just that this is a unique opportunity to understand what was going on during that time.”\n\nThe ‘oldest rocks’ label has sometimes backfired. In the past few years, other teams have chiselled many samples out of the Nuvvuagittuq belt, leaving the landscape scarred. Last year, the local Inuit community closed access to the rocks to prevent further despoliation.\n\nOnly a handful of geological samples in the world date back to 3.8 billion years or older. Of those, the oldest undisputed rocks are found in the Acasta gneiss formation in Canada’s Northwest Territories; at 4 billion years old, they mark the boundary between Earth’s first geological eon, the Hadean, and the following one, the Archaean. Geologists have also found tiny mineral crystals dating back to the Hadean — such as 4.4-billion-year-old zircon crystals from Western Australia — that have become embedded into newer rock. But there are no known surviving chunks of crust from the Hadean — except, perhaps, the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt. It consists primarily of material that started out as volcanic basalt before undergoing various modifications during Earth’s tortured history.\n\nThe dark rock of Canada's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt could have originated from the basaltic lava of a volcano that erupted some 4.3 billion years ago.Credit: Jonathan O’Neil\n\nIn their 2008 work, O’Neil and his colleagues analysed the chemical imprint left by the radioactive decay of the isotope samarium-146 into neodymium-142 to calculate that the Nuvvuagittuq rocks were 4.3 billion years old. (Samarium-146 is a short-lived isotope that was depleted in Earth’s first 500 million years, and none was left after about 4 billion years ago.) Other scientists challenged that work, arguing, for instance, that Hadean-age crust had become mixed into younger crust, contaminating the results3,4.\n\nFor the latest work, O’Neil’s team analysed some once-molten rocks that had intruded into the main Nuvvuagittuq rocks like a knife cutting into a cake. By dating the intruded rocks, O’Neil and his colleagues were able to establish a minimum age for the cake itself. They used two radioactive clocks: the decay of samarium-146 into neodymium-142 and that of samarium-147 into neodymium-143. Both yielded ages of around 4.16 billion years for the intruded rocks. “If you don’t agree with this, then you need a very speculative, intricate model to get to the same answer,” says O’Neil.",

Credit: Willice Obonyo\nRadioastronomy in Africa\n\nIn 2005, when South Africa and its partner countries in Africa submitted a proposal to host the world’s largest radio telescope, called the Square Kilometre Array, the continent had five radioastronomers, all based in South Africa. That year, the country embarked on a targeted human-capital development programme to develop talent to build, operate and use radio telescopes, which collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the government-funded programme has created 5 research-chair positions and more than 1,370 scholarships for undergraduate, master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral studies — at a total cost of about 500 million rand (US$28 million).\n\nNow, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is under construction. It will have more than 100,000 tree-like antennas in Australia and almost 200 dish antennas in South Africa. South Africa now owns and operates several radio telescopes, and there are hundreds of radioastronomers and students at universities and institutions in African countries.\n\nNature’s careers team spoke to officials and scientists working to grow Africa’s radioastronomy capacity, in part through the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. In the second of a short series of articles investigating the growth of the discipline on the continent, Willice Obonyo, a lecturer in astronomy and space sciences at the Technical University of Kenya in Nairobi, talks about the importance of hands-on training.\n\nI had always loved space. At school, at about age 12, we were told about constellations and stars, but I didn’t know someone could pursue it as a career. Even when I went to university, there was no option to study astronomy, let alone radioastronomy, which uses radio waves to observe parts of the Universe that are invisible to the naked eye. I ended up earning a bachelor’s of science degree in 2006, and then becoming a mathematics and physics teacher at a secondary school.\n\nIn 2011, I went back to Moi University in Eldoret, Kenya, for a master’s in theoretical nuclear physics, and when I was finishing up, a friend told me about the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) scholarships to study astronomy. I asked him about it, then googled ‘astronomy’, and I realized that this was an opportunity to study the Universe. I applied and was accepted into an astrophysics and space science master’s programme at the University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa.\n\nDeveloping astronomers in Africa: ‘We wanted to create a discipline’\n\nThe SARAO scholarship gave me an enormous opportunity. It was the first time that I used a telescope: a 1.9-metre optical telescope. In fact, it was the first scientific equipment that I had used hands-on. My education had mostly been theoretical to that point. At the UCT, I could test theories, observe celestial objects for the first time and then process and analyse the data. It was inspiring and it gave me an opportunity to be confident in science and feel that I could be trusted with data for research and interact with leading researchers.\n\nI met and was taught by world-class scholars from various continents. It was a steep learning curve, but there was a lot of help from colleagues and other students. I also received a lot of support from my supervisor Vanessa McBride, who is now the science director at the International Science Council in Paris, an organization that brings global science councils, unions and academies together.\n\nThen, in 2015, South Africa and the United Kingdom were piloting the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (DARA) project in African countries, which offered eight weeks of training in basic radioastronomy. It trained me and the other students in the science and technical engineering aspects of radioastronomy, as well as the processing of data. DARA allowed me to transition from optical astronomy into radioastronomy. In 2020, I earned my PhD in physics and astronomy, looking at radio emissions from massive protostars, at the University of Leeds, UK, before returning to Kenya.",

The science-led start-ups highlighted below show the importance of a strong pipeline from academia to industry, as they make their mark in clean energy, climate monitoring and health care.\n\nTWELVE: Portable power\nEtosha Cave, co-founder of carbon-conversion company Twelve, wants to expand her firm globally to tackle the climate crisis.Credit: Mark Leong for Nature Index\n\nEtosha Cave, co-founder and chief science officer at Twelve, a start-up based in Berkeley, California, hopes to reduce the reliance of industry on fossil fuels by providing a more sustainable option. Twelve’s business centres on converting carbon dioxide from industrial waste streams into carbon monoxide, which can then be combined with green hydrogen — made by splitting water using renewable energy — and used to make synthetic fuels.\n\nThe firm’s technology can be traced back to Cave’s PhD research on the electroreduction of CO2 — which essentially uses electricity to convert CO2 into other molecules — at Stanford University in California. The work felt urgent and meaningful, she says, given the threat that fossil-fuel extraction and CO2 emissions pose to the environment. She wanted to take her research to the market as soon as possible — and that meant taking it beyond the bounds of academia. “It was going to die if we didn’t bring it outside,” says Cave.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science Inc.\n\nAfter completing her PhD in 2015, Cave teamed up with fellow Stanford chemist, Kendra Kuhl, and Nicholas Flanders, an engineer and Stanford alumnus, with hopes of establishing a CO2-conversion start-up. They joined the first cohort of a US Department of Energy-sponsored programme called the Cyclotron Road Project, which aimed to help entrepreneurs working in advanced manufacturing, clean power or electronics launch their business. Run at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory — about an hour’s drive from Stanford — Cyclotron Road provided lab space and funding to help push the trio’s CO2-conversion science towards commercialization. The support was invaluable in turning their idea into reality, says Cave of the early stages of Twelve. At the time, venture capitalists in the science and technology space were funding things that could scale quickly and deliver fast returns, such as software and biotechnology, she says. “What we were doing — fundamental chemistry and electrochemical engineering — didn’t look anything like those sectors. Deep, lab-based research didn’t fit the typical venture-capitalist mould. Back then, very few investors were willing to take that kind of long view.”\n\nTwelve’s technology, particularly its Opus system, is powered by renewable energy, and uses proprietary metal catalysts to speed up the conversion of CO2 into carbon monoxide, which can be used to make base chemicals and materials for industry. By 2021, the company had raised US$57 million in venture-capital funding and had collaborated with several multinational companies, including Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Mercedes-Benz, which wanted to use Twelve’s technology in pilot projects to create materials for their products.\n\nTwelve is preparing to flip the switch on its first commercial-scale plant, AirPlant. Located in Moses Lake, Washington, the facility runs on hydropower and converts CO2 captured from a nearby ethanol plant into aviation fuel, called E-Jet, which can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft. Last year, Twelve announced that it had raised US$645 million from investors, including San Francisco-based private-equity firm TPG and Alaska Airlines, to develop sustainable jet fuel. Now with a team of 175 employees, Twelve’s ascent comes after nearly a decade of scientific hurdles and pivots and relentless fundraising, says Cave. “CO2 is a very stubborn molecule to convert, and it took a lot of iteration, and a lot of capital to scale up. It’s been really challenging to do.”\n\nFor underrepresented founders, the climb can be even steeper. As a Black woman, Cave reflects that she “stood out a lot of times in the room”. She recalls how she and her co-founder Kuhl were an unusual sight in meetings. “People would remember our team — me and Kendra, the only women in the room.” In 2024, only 0.4% of US start-up funding went to companies with Black founders, according to Crunchbase, a data-analytics firm in San Francisco.\n\nAs Twelve continues to expand, Cave hopes to see it scale fast enough to make a real impact on the global emissions crisis. “With our technology, you can make fuel anywhere in the world where you have direct air capture of CO2,” she says. — Starre Vartan\n\nRIVERKIN: Against the flow\nRiverkin co-founder Jessica Droujko.Credit: Ruben Stadler\n\nSwitzerland relies on hydropower to provide more than half of its energy needs — but there’s a problem. Rising temperatures and melting glaciers in the country’s mountainous regions are causing the surrounding landscapes to erode more quickly, sending increased amounts of gravel, sand and other debris into the rivers that feed the country’s hydroelectric plants. These sediments are damaging turbines and pipes and accumulating in reservoirs at an alarming rate, says Nitin Kumar, a data scientist and co-founder of Zurich-based start-up company, Riverkin.\n\nOver the past few decades, Switzerland has lost around 28% of its hydroelectric energy capacity as a result of these changes, says Kumar. It’s a challenge that he and his Riverkin co-founder Jessica Droujko, an environmental engineer, hope to solve by installing sensors in rivers to alert hydropower operators when the water quality falls, such as after a flood (J. Droujko and P. Molnar Nature Water 1, 758–759; 2023). The notifications would allow users to react, shutting down turbines to prevent damage when sediment levels are high, for example.\n\nEstablished in 2024, Riverkin grew with help from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), Switzerland’s leading university in the Nature Index. It is one of more than 600 companies that have been incubated by ETH Zurich, which has a reputation for its spin-off success. The university is ranked second in Europe, after the University of Cambridge, UK, for the economic value generated by its spin-off companies, according to a report by Dutch analytics firm, Dealroom. “At ETH, they’re highly supportive,” says Kumar.\n\nHaving moved from India to do a PhD at the University of Zurich, Kumar met Droujko, who had moved from Canada to pursue a PhD at ETH Zurich. Droujko developed the sensor hardware as part of her PhD research — work that was accelerated by a fellowship that she won from ETH Zurich worth 150,000 Swiss francs (US$182,000) in 2023. In 2024, she teamed up with Kumar, who developed the software that accompanies the sensor. Riverkin’s sensor can measure water level, temperature, turbidity and fine sediment concentration remotely and in real time, and is cheaper and more efficient than similar devices, according to the company.\n\nKumar says the things that attracted him to Switzerland were its leading universities, stable political and economic environment, and “a culture of science-based innovation”. He adds that diversity is also a big draw that is often overlooked. Foreigners comprise more than one-quarter of Switzerland’s population and having access to such a diverse workforce allows companies to “approach challenges from entirely different angles”, says Kumar. In his experience at Riverkin, this “leads to fresh, focused thinking and a more holistic understanding of every problem we tackle”, he says.\n\nTo expand Riverkin, Kumar and Droujko are taking things one step at a time. A large-scale validation study of Riverkin’s sensor is under way, which involves testing how reliably it connects to satellites so it can transmit real-time data to users, even in remote locations with no phone coverage. The team also wants to start collecting global water-quality data to check for patterns linked to climate change.\n\nIn addition, there are plans to extend Riverkin’s services beyond the energy sector to make an impact in wastewater management and mining, which is also affected by sedimentation. The goal, Kumar says, is one day to make water data as accessible and actionable as weather data, so that we can “make our waters cleaner for future generations”. — Sandy Ong\n\nNALAGENETICS: Disease detector\nNalaGenetics co-founders (left to right) Astrid Irwanto, Alexander Lezhava and Levana Sani.Credit: NalaGenetics",

It is produced from molecules derived from fossil fuels, but researchers are working to develop processes that use more sustainable source molecules, such as plastic waste.\n\n“We’re able to transform a prolific environmental and societal waste into such a globally important medication in a way that’s completely impossible using chemistry alone or using biology alone,” says co-author Stephen Wallace, a chemical biotechnologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nCentral to the project’s success was the discovery by Wallace and his team that a synthetic chemical reaction that typically requires conditions that are toxic to cells can occur in their presence. The reaction, called the Lossen rearrangement, has been known for more than a century, but had previously been observed only in a test tube or a flask, says Wallace.\n\nPlastic unpacked\n\nTo convert plastic waste into paracetamol, the researchers used conventional chemical methods to degrade and modify polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a plastic used in food packaging and textiles, into a precursor molecule. They added this molecule into a culture of Escherichia coli cells, where the Lossen rearrangement transformed it into a biologically relevant molecule. The reaction also occurred, to a lesser extent, in the experiment’s negative control, which contained only the precursor molecule and growth medium. The team later discovered that phosphate, an ion found in all organisms, catalysed the reaction.\n\nThe authors also modified the E. coli, introducing the genes for enzymes able to catalyse reactions that use the product of the Lossen rearrangement. The enzymes produced by the modified E. coli carried out the remaining synthetic steps needed to create paracetamol. When the researchers gave the degraded PET to these bacteria, 92% was converted into paracetamol.",

The investigation is part of a broader movement to assess whether artificial intelligence (AI) is making us cognitively lazy.\n\nHow close is AI to human-level intelligence?\n\nComputer scientist Nataliya Kosmyna at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and her colleagues measured brain-wave activity in university students as they wrote essays either using a chatbot or an Internet search tool, or without any Internet at all. Although the main result is unsurprising, some of the study’s findings are more intriguing: for instance, the team saw hints that relying on a chatbot for initial tasks might lead to relatively low levels of brain engagement even when the tool is later taken away.\n\nEchoing some posts about the study on online platforms, Kosmyna is careful to say that the results shouldn’t be overinterpreted. This study cannot and did not show “dumbness in the brain, no stupidity, no brain on vacation”, Kosmyna laughs. It involved only a few dozen participants over a short time and cannot address whether habitual chatbot use reshapes our thinking in the long-term, or how the brain might respond during other AI-assisted tasks. “We don’t have any of these answers in this paper,” Kosmyna says. The work was posted ahead of peer review on the preprint server arXiv on 10 June1.\n\nEasy essays\n\nKosmyna’s team recruited 60 students, aged 18 to 39, from five universities around the city of Boston, Massachusetts. The researchers asked them to spend 20 minutes crafting a short essay answering questions, such as “should we always think before we speak?”, that appear on Scholastic Assessment Tests, or SATs.\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nThe participants were divided into three groups: one used ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI’s large language model GPT-4o, as the sole source of information for their essays; another used Google to search for material (without any AI-assisted answers); and the third was forbidden to go online at all. In the end, 54 participants wrote essays answering three questions while in their assigned group, and then 18 were re-assigned to a new group to write a fourth essay, on one of the topics that they had tackled previously.\n\nEach student wore a commercial electrode-covered cap, which collected electroencephalography (EEG) readings as they wrote. These headsets measure tiny voltage changes from brain activity and can show which broad regions of the brain are ‘talking’ to each other.\n\nThe students who wrote essays using only their brains showed the strongest, widest-ranging connectivity among brain regions, and had more activity going from the back of their brains to the front, decision-making area. They were also, unsurprisingly, better able to quote from their own essays when questioned by the researchers afterwards.\n\nThe Google group, by comparison, had stronger activation in areas known to be involved with visual processing and memory. And the chatbot group displayed the least brain connectivity during the task.\n\nMore brain connectivity isn’t necessarily good or bad, Kosmyna says. In general, more brain activity might be a sign that someone is engaging more deeply with a task, or it might be a sign of inefficiency in thinking, or an indication that the person is overwhelmed by ‘cognitive overload’.",

          "abstract": "Nature’s Memory: Behind the Scenes at the World’s Natural History Museums Jack Ashby Allen Lane (2025)\n\nNatural history museums are crucial for conservation — and for communicating its importance to the public. But step through the ‘staff only’ doors, and museums look very different. In vaults and laboratories, curators store, catalogue and preserve millions of specimens collected from the natural world — sometimes in controversial ways.\n\nIn Nature’s Memory, zoologist Jack Ashby explains how all of this works, and the human choices that it entails. Ashby, who studies marsupials and monotremes, is assistant director of the University Museum of Zoology in Cambridge, UK. He is also president of the Society for the History of Natural History in London.\n\nIn his office, plastered with posters of some of the world’s best nature dioramas, Ashby told Nature about his quest to communicate the importance of natural history museums.\n\nDo you have a favourite?\n\nOne is the Biological Museum in Stockholm. The building looks like a wooden Norwegian church, and it’s effectively one giant diorama that goes up three storeys. It covers all of the Nordic biomes. And it shows that we do have some exciting wildlife in Europe.\n\nEgypt is building a $1-billion mega-museum. Will it bring Egyptology home?\n\nAnother is the National Natural History Museum in Paris. You walk into the comparative-anatomy section and it’s one giant wall with thousands of skeletons all facing towards you, so tightly packed that you cannot walk between them.\n\nThese probably shouldn’t be my favourites, because they are so old fashioned, but they are stunning.\n\nDo museums teach science in a neutral way? In one book chapter, you highlight male biases in specimen collection and display.\n\nNatural history museums are amazing, but of course they are built by people, and people have interests and biases. One study, by biologist Natalie Cooper at the Natural History Museum in London and her collaborators, looked at more than 2 million specimens at 5 museums, and found that only 40% of the birds were female (N. Cooper et al. Proc. R. Soc. B 286, 20192025; 2019). For mammals, the figure was 48%, but in some of the mammalian groups, particularly artiodactyls — such as deer and antelope — only 40% were female. In another study, curator Rebecca Machin found that almost three-quarters of the natural-history specimens on display at the Manchester Museum, UK, were male (R. Machin Museum Soc. 6, 54–67; 2008).\n\nThe numbers are huge, but it’s also about how they are displayed, presented and interpreted. For example, descriptions of male specimens are much more likely to give general facts: this is where the animal lives, how it’s adapted to its environment, and so on. Whereas, for a female specimen, you tend to have more of a story of ‘this is how the species reproduces’.\n\nHow did the idea of collecting natural-history specimens arise?\n\nIn a sense, all museums — but certainly natural history museums — have their philosophical origins in the Wunderkammern, the private cabinets of curiosity maintained by aristocrats and natural philosophers in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Some museums today are direct descendants of those collections.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment period, when scientific proof became important, collecting at an institutional level grew. And it went hand in hand with the ‘age of discovery’. Some of those voyages explicitly focused on finding out what resources were out there in the world that could be traded or acquired. And museums were both a place to study those resources — be they animal, vegetable or mineral — and a tool to promote the mission: ‘Look what we’ve got in our newly found colony’.\n\nThe British colony in southeastern Australia was intended to be founded in what’s now Botany Bay, near Sydney. And the colonists called it Botany Bay — it already had a name, Kamay, in the Indigenous language Dharawal — because, in 1770, on the voyage of Captain James Cook, naturalist Joseph Banks spent weeks collecting plants there. He came back and later said to Parliament, on the basis of what he had found, ‘this is where you should set up a colony’. Those plants are now in the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nSpecimens at the National Museum of Ireland — Natural History in Dublin.Credit: Lucas Vallecillos/VWPics/Redux/eyevine\nBanks also wanted to collect the heads of Aboriginal people for his anatomical studies. Isn’t that problematic?\n\nIt was. Scientists at the time had theorized a racial hierarchy of people across the world, and then sought people’s remains without consent to try to back up this theory. It fed into the eugenics movement starting in the late nineteenth century, which has repercussions today. The desire to categorize people is inherently linked to extraordinary forms of violence and has been used in a pseudoscientific way to justify horrific social policy.\n\nHow are museums dealing with this legacy of colonialism?\n\nThere isn’t one museum that I would say is doing colonial history particularly well. But a lot of the research being done in natural history museums is, partly, understanding the true origins of the collections and who really collected them.\n\nI bring up nineteenth-century naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in that context, because he was relatively good at giving credit to people that he was working with. Two Malay teenagers called Ali and Baderoon, in particular, helped him during his eight-year voyage to the Malay Archipelago. Out of the 125,000 specimens that we lazily say were ‘collected by Wallace’, we know he attributed many to other people. But the institutions of science decided to ignore that and give the credit to Wallace.\n\nSome museums have begun to repatriate human remains and artefacts. Should every collection be repatriated?\n\nThe important question is, where does an object have the most meaning? It’s always going to be on a story-by-story basis. Take the thylacine, for example, the extinct Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus). There are nearly 800 specimens in museums around the world, and there are more in Australia, where they were native, than anywhere else. It is good that all of the thylacines aren’t in Australia. Because we talk about human-driven extinction in museums all around the world, that’s an important story — objects have power by being spread around.\n\nWhy museums should repatriate fossils\n\nBut there are no specimens of gorillas in museums in any of the gorilla’s home states. If anyone who studies gorillas in Central Africa wants to use museum collections, they have to go to another part of the world, which is not right. If a museum has many gorilla specimens, to repatriate some of them would be a good thing.",

          "authors": "Traci Watson",
          "abstract": "Cancer cells turbocharge themselves by stealing the energy-producing units from neurons in tumours, scientists report today in Nature1. This act of thievery seems to give cancer cells a boost to help them survive when they metastasize, or spread to distant organs.\n\nThe findings show that cancer cells siphon off neurons’ mitochondria — organelles that generate most of a cell’s energy — through ultrathin tubes that grow between the two types of cell. The purloined mitochondria increase cancer cells’ ability to withstand the stress of shooting through blood vessels during metastasis.\n\n“Now we have a new culprit for metastasis, which means we have a new target to block metastasis,” says study co-author Simon Grelet, a cancer neurobiologist at the University of South Alabama in Mobile. “And metastasis is what make cancers so deadly.”\n\nEnergy theft\n\nScientists have long known that cancer co-opts the nervous system to fuel its growth. To learn more about the process, Grelet and his colleagues worked with mice that had a rodent version of aggressive breast cancer. The authors treated the mice with a chemical agent that blocks nerve function and saw that the metabolic activity in the animals’ cancer cells fell, confirming that neurons influence tumours’ metabolism.\n\nCells are swapping their mitochondria. What does this mean for our health?\n\nObservations of cancer cells growing in a laboratory dish revealed that they extend drinking-straw-like tubes through which they drain neurons’ mitochondria. Other experiments showed that cancer cells with ‘stolen’ mitochondria generate more energy than do cancer cells without them.\n\nThe researchers wanted to see how the turbocharged cancer cells would fare during a simulated trip from an original ‘primary’ tumour to a metastatic site in a new tissue. So they pushed some cells through a needle and syringe to simulate the buffeting that they would encounter in the blood stream during the journey, and exposed others to hydrogen peroxide to mimic the potentially damaging chemical environment they would meet. The team found that the cells were much more likely to survive than those lacking extra mitochondria.",

          "abstract": "Sea slugs in the genus Elysia are bright green because they store chloroplasts, the organelles that make energy in plants. Credit: Corey Allard\n\n‘Solar-powered’ sea slugs have specialized depots in their cells that store photosynthetic equipment looted from algae, a study1 reports. These depots provide just the right chemical environment to keep the stolen apparatus, called chloroplasts, alive and working to turn sunlight into nutrients.\n\n“It was the wildest thing that we had seen,” says study co-author Nicholas Bellono, a biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The authors also found that, in lean times, the slugs can raid these compartments to consume chloroplasts.\n\nThe compartment “is basically like a moving refrigerator of chloroplasts where, after a period of starvation, the slugs can switch from storage to consumption to survive”, Bellono says.\n\nThe findings were published in Cell.\n\nGreen grazer\n\nScientists discovered decades ago that certain species of sea slug store chloroplasts from the algae they eat, a diet that can turn the slugs bright green. But no one understood how the slugs keep these foreign organelles alive without the support of the rest of the algal cell.\n\nNow that’s using your head: a sea slug’s severed noggin sprouts a new body\n\nBellono and his team added chemical tags to proteins newly made by the slugs’ own cells. They found that most of the proteins in a slug’s chloroplasts were made by the slug — not by the original algae. That meant the slug was helping to maintain the chloroplasts.\n\nWhen the scientists looked at the chloroplasts under a microscope, they found that the organelles were housed in special compartments in the slugs’ guts. Each compartment was surrounded by a membrane that tested positive for markers typically found in cellular structures called phagosomes, which fuse with other structures called lysomes to digest unneeded organelles. The researchers named this structure the kleptosome, after a Greek word that means to steal.\n\nLife of crime\n\nThe team also found that these organelles contained ion channels — receptors that convert chemical messages into electrical signals. Among them is one called P2X4, which opens in response to the presence of ATP, an energy-carrying molecule produced during photosynthesis.",

          "title": "Tardigrade-obsessed: meet the researchers trying to turn water bears into neuroscience models",
          "authors": "Benjamin Plackett",
          "abstract": "There’s no two ways about it: tardigrades are badass.\n\nThese eight-legged, microscopic water-dwellers have survived the vacuum of space, extreme dehydration, and temperatures ranging from near absolute zero to above boiling point. In 2021, researchers fired frozen tardigrades from a gun onto a target several metres away, to simulate a meteorite impact, and showed that they lived to tell the tale1.\n\nTardigrades are also transparent, skin-shedding and occasionally cannibalistic — traits seemingly at odds with their cuddly appearance and ‘water bear’ nickname. And they have great PR. They have a dedicated subreddit on which people showcase their tardigrade tattoos and soft toys. There are tardigrade fan clubs and memes, as well as online merchandise. Water bears might not care, but the Internet certainly does. People can’t seem to get enough of them.\n\nNew species of tardigrade reveals secrets of radiation-resisting powers\n\nBut for a burgeoning community of researchers getting ready to converge this month on Tsuruoka, Japan, for the 16th International Symposium on Tardigrada, it’s all about the legs.\n\nTardigrades “are one of the smallest animals on Earth that we know of that have limbs,” explains Ana Lyons, a neuroscientist at Keio University’s Institute for Advanced Biosciences in Tsuruoka City. “At the same time, they also have simple eye spots, a central brain and a peripheral nervous system.”\n\nTardigrades, therefore, exist in a sweet spot: simple enough to study properly and intricate enough for it to be worth doing so. That’s one of the reasons that neuroscientists such as Lyons are working to make tardigrades a model organism for studying how neural circuits work — a field of research called systems neuroscience.\n\nNot every organism has what it takes to be ‘model’, however — there are basic requirements. Ideally, they are easy to maintain and breed in the lab and have a short life cycle. They should also be genetically tractable and, for systems neuroscientists, have well-understood neurocircuitry. It is these latter two issues that scientists need to work on if tardigrades are ever to transition from meme to model organism.\n\nFortunately, tardigrade enthusiasts are a confident bunch.\n\n“There’s work to be done, but I have faith in the tardigrade community,” says Jasmine Nirody, an organismal biologist at the University of Chicago in Illinois. “We’re determined.”\n\n‘A little space alien’\n\nLyons has been into tardigrades since the age of 15. In rural Michigan, where she grew up, there were no advanced science courses available at her school, so she took a course at a specialized ‘magnet’ school. In search of a topic for a project, she wandered around the local library. An encyclopaedia of North American invertebrates caught her eye.\n\n“It had a black and white [scanning electron microscope] photograph of a heterotardigrade” on the cover, she recalls. “Those are the really cool tardigrades that have all the cilia on their backs and really prominent eye spots and their claws on their legs are very distinct. It just looked like a little space alien to me.”\n\nAna Lyons wants to help build a ‘neural atlas’ of tardigrades.Credit: Ana Lyons\n\nFascinated, she reached out to the author of the tardigrade chapter and struck up a conversation. That author, Diane Nelson, invited Lyons to visit her laboratory at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. “I spent my 16th birthday there, learning how to handle and identify tardigrades,” Lyons says. They ended up co-authoring a paper when Lyons was an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge — although, because there were no tardigrade labs at MIT at the time, she mostly studied fruit flies and yeast.\n\nLyons returned to water bears during a fellowship year in Germany and continued her work as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. For her postdoc, she joined the lab of neuroscientist Saul Kato. A worm biologist, Kato was looking to branch into a new experimental system when he started his lab at the University of California, San Francisco — he describes tardigrades as “Caenorhabditis elegans with feet”. They met at a tardigrade conference in 2018, and she joined his lab in 2022.\n\nA Goldilocks-shaped niche\n\nAs Lyons and Kato outline in a preprint review posted earlier this year, tardigrades could fill a Goldilocks-shaped niche in the systems-neuroscience space2. Mice and fruit flies (Drosophila), tardigrade-enthusiasts argue, are too complicated for the field. It’s too difficult to isolate and connect behaviours with neural networks in these species. “You have to understand a simple system before you can understand a complex system,” says Kato. “We are so far from even having the language or frameworks to truly understand how these large, complex neuro systems work in mice, and arguably it’s the same with Drosophila.”\n\nAt the other extreme, nematodes such as the roundworm C. elegans are too simple. “You can’t get at the question of ‘what is the role of the central nervous systems versus the peripheral nervous system when it comes to limb movement’ [in worms], because worms don’t have limbs,” says Lyons.\n\nTardigrades do; they “have a very trimmed-down neural system but still have a brain and ganglia throughout their bodies and have limbs and can walk”, says Lyons. Most organisms that walk need thousands of neurons to do so, she explains, but not water bears. “We don’t yet know how many neurons tardigrades have, but they seem to be in the order of 300 to 700,” she says.\n\nThat simplicity makes it relatively easy — in theory — to tinker with tardigrade neurobiology and observe the consequences. It has also led some researchers to wonder whether tardigrades might be similar to, if not the ancestors of, arthropods: the group that includes insects, spiders and crustaceans. “It is one of the most ancestral states,” says Georg Mayer, a zoologist at the University of Kassel in Germany, of tardigrades; studying them “almost enables you to look back in time at a living fossil”.\n\nLive fast, die young\n\nAnother string to the bow of tardigrades as a model organism, is their translucency. Pretty much any of their cells can be observed while the animal is alive and in motion. That’s especially important when you’re trying to study the role of neurons in delivering various behaviours. “You can actually see them,” says Lyons. “We’re trying to genetically encode florescent reporter proteins so that, in theory, we could see all their neurons.”\n\nTardigrades also behave in interesting and unusual ways for such small creatures. “How do they both crawl in a very organized, coordinated fashion, and have their legs move independently and grasp things?” asks Kato. “There seems to be both local control of the limb and top-down control.” Kato wants to know more about how the animal’s nervous system accomplishes both at the same time.\n\n“There are so many other versions of this type of question in neuroscience and we think this is the perfect animal to study and find out,” Kato adds.\n\nAnd then there’s the question of aesthetics — water bears are basically charismatic microfauna. “Tardigrades are definitely cuter than worms,” Kato says, “Nobody calls a worm cute.” That cuteness, he admits, has probably contributed to the water bears’ appeal as a research subject. “They’re sort of the darlings of the Internet.”\n\nBasic barriers\n\nGiven all these potential upsides, why do researchers know more about worms and Drosophila than they do about the seemingly ideal tardigrade? Why have water bears been “leap-frogged”, as Kato puts it, by people who want to study systems neuroscience?\n\nFor one thing, tardigrades were late to the party. Researchers have conventionally gravitated towards either worms or fruit flies, because that’s where most of the early grunt work had been done and key genetic tools created. “That’s not the case with tardigrades,” says Nirody. “We still have to pin down our basic understanding of some of their genetics and neurology.”\n\nSaul Kato thinks tardigrades could be models for systems neuroscience.Credit: Saul Kato\n\nResearchers aren’t even sure which specific type of tardigrade to focus on. There are around 1,300 tardigrade species, and it’s not yet clear which would be the most suitable as a model organism. But as a group, they have many traits in common.\n\nFor example, says Mayer, tardigrade genomes tend to include lots of duplicated genetic material. “They have multiple copies of some gene families, which is crazy, since they’ve kept their genome so small,” says Mayer. “They have a small generation time and so it’s a disadvantage to them to have to duplicate a lot of DNA.” Why those duplications exist is a mystery that would be helpful to solve.\n\nTardigrade researchers are also struggling to genetically manipulate the animals — especially when it comes to inserting genes into their genome, a technique known as knock-in transgenics. At a conference in March on genetic tools for new model organisms, Lyons “was reassured to learn” that tardigrade researchers aren’t alone in facing this difficulty. “It’s all emerging model organisms, such as cuttlefish,” she says. “It seems to be much more straightforward to knock out genes.”\n\nA 2024 paper from a Japanese group showed limited success with one approach3 that used the editing tool CRISPR to insert genetic material into a tardigrade genome. But not at scale. Researchers need to be able to routinely knock-in hundreds of base pairs, and that isn’t yet possible.\n\n“We don’t yet know the best way to do knock-in for tardigrades,” Lyons concludes. “Is it CRISPR? Transposons? Viruses? Or something else? Do we target tardigrades when they’re early-stage embryos? Or do we try to get in through the ovaries of the mother tardigrade?”\n\nOnce scientists answer those questions, they’ll need to work out how to do it without popping the egg or killing the embryo. “That took a long time to figure out in Drosophila, for example, but once we realized you slightly dehydrate the embryos and then replace the liquid, boom. That was it. So, there are lots of little things like that which we need to know,” says Kato.\n\nOne not-so-little unknown for systems neuroscientists is basic neuroanatomy. Tardigrade enthusiasts don’t know how many cells the typical organism has, let alone how many neurons. Nor do they know what types of neuron the animals have, nor what they do.\n\nLyons is applying a battery of fluorescence-microscopy techniques to find out. “I’m finding all kinds of weird and cool cell morphologies,” she says, “and some of the suspected neurons look very different from what we see in worms or fruit flies. To be sure they’re all neurons, we really need to confirm the presence of synapses using electron microscopy.”",

          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Union members protest against federal cuts at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, in April 2025.Credit: Jim West/Getty\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump is hacking away at funding for research institutions — aiming, it says, to eliminate waste and bias in government-funded research. This is disrupting science in ways that are rippling well beyond laboratories and lecture halls. Here, Nature’s Careers team looks into some of the figures that might indicate wider disruptions to the scientific enterprise.\n\nThe number of active grants awarded by federal funding bodies has fallen strikingly, and companies that provide products to scientists — from basic vials to sophisticated cell analysers — are reporting a downturn in demand from academic and government customers. Their concerns are exacerbated by the president’s announcements of tariffs on foreign imports, which have triggered retaliatory trade restrictions in other countries. Some companies are predicting price rises fuelled by increased import costs.\n\nMost of the people who have directly lost grants are principal investigators, but early-career researchers are being affected as well, warns Jason Owen-Smith, a sociologist who leads the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science (IRIS) consortium at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Drawing on IRIS data, Owen-Smith estimates that nationwide, federal grants to universities support about 646,000 researchers. About 48% of those are students and trainees, he says.\n\nPeople outside academia will also be affected. “A whole lot of businesses in a really wide range of industries, from local restaurants to construction companies to specialized manufacturing companies,” Owen-Smith says, “are going to see a hit to their bottom line as a result of the cuts.”\n\nHowever, not all areas of scientific activity have declined in the first quarter of 2025 — some have even picked up. For instance, the US National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, published more working papers in January, February and March this year than in the same period of 2024. Globally, publication rates for preprints, journal articles and other research content also continue to increase, consistent with long-term trends. But publication takes time, so this method of measuring scientific output will be slower to reflect trends than will some other metrics.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, just a few months into the Trump administration, uncertainty about the future of US science reigned, as Nature’s charts show. Some statistics are pulled from small subsections of the scientific enterprise, such as sales from a single supplier. Others, including the number of federal grants awarded to US scientists, reflect more fundamental shifts.\n\nOverall, the picture is gloomy, says Andrew Castaldi, a market specialist at Temblor, a risk-assessment company based in Redwood City, California. “To me, the federal science funding cuts will make it harder for any industry to build off the work done by the scientists employed by the government,” he says. “No single entity has the capacity to make up what is lost. In effect, the private sector’s innovations will diminish.”\n\nGrants withdrawn\n\nUS federal science agencies have retracted many grants (see ‘Funding’). More than 1,000 grants were terminated between 20 January and the end of March at three government agencies: the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA. Many more have been flagged for scrutiny on the grounds that they promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), or because research in areas including vaccines and HIV is being de-emphasized. This is destabilizing careers.\n\nSource: NIH Reporter; nsf.gov\n\nThe situation is changing fast, however. Since the end of March, many more grants have been cancelled. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), of which the NIH is part, now lists more than 7,000 terminated contracts. But on 16 June, a US judge ruled that many of these cancellations were illegal, and ordered that they be restored. And Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachussetts, is locked in an ongoing legal battle with the federal government after its research funding was specifically targeted.\n\nSupplier and demand\n\nFalling revenues have affected scientific-product suppliers of every size (see ‘Lab equipment’). For some, a drop in US academic and government sales is offset by other sectors, so overall revenues have not declined. But even these companies are predicting future losses, which might have spooked investors.\n\nSource: Agilent; Addgene; Avantor; Waters; BD; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Illumina; Bruker\nLet’s get together\n\nSome international researchers are reluctant to travel to the United States amid increases in border controls. Even US researchers are travelling less, given cuts in travel budgets at some institutions. And some conference organizers have had to postpone or cancel events, or relocate them to other countries. However, in the first three months of 2025, not all US-based scientific conferences had yet been affected (see ‘Conferences’).\n\nSource: APS; ABRF\nLease on life sciences\n\nNationwide, science-related buildings are standing empty (see ‘Property’). This is particularly notable in Boston, Massachusetts, where 25% of the lab or research and development (R&D) property inventory is vacant, compared with 14% in the previous year, according to the commercial property firm CBRE in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe Boston–Cambridge area has a high concentration of universities, life-sciences companies and related vendors, and is the biggest US market for life-sciences property. Across the United States, demand for such buildings started to fall during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has intensified in 2025. Companies are delaying leasing decisions owing to uncertainty, although some are looking to increase their US operations in response to tariffs on foreign manufacturing.\n\nThe effects will probably cascade into residential housing. Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, anticipates a downturn in the property market, saying: “If you have fewer graduate students, it’s going to affect housing demand.”\n\nSource: CBRE Insights report\nJob cuts\n\nWhen it comes to employment, the larger effects of funding cuts and tariffs will take time to materialize, Ginther says. Thousands of staff positions have been cut from federal science agencies including the NIH, based in Bethesda, Maryland; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia; and the Food and Drug Administration, based in Silver Spring, Maryland. Yet overall R&D-related employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics barely shifted between the first three months of 2024 and the first three months of 2025 (see ‘Employment’).\n\nSource: BLS Employment Statistics survey\n\nChange might be coming. A spokesperson for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston notes: “Payroll employment in the Boston–Cambridge–Newton metro area, which has a tech-heavy economy, is down 0.3% in March 2025 from one year earlier.” And some universities are cutting staff, students and programmes, whereas others are seeking stopgap solutions to funding shortfalls.\n\nMoney, money, money",

          "title": "Here’s why China’s science and innovation model is thriving",
          "authors": "Jacob Dreyer",
          "abstract": "An increasing number of Chinese companies are grabbing the headlines with new technologies rolled out at scale. The most prominent example in 2025 has been DeepSeek and its low-cost large language models, but others include electric-vehicle (EV) maker BYD — which this year launched its ‘God’s Eye’ intelligent driving system as a standard feature on most of its models — and battery manufacturer CATL, which is planning a major expansion of ‘swapping stations’ in China that allow quick battery replacement in EVs.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science Inc.\n\nUnderlying such roll-outs is a commitment to research and development and an increasing synergy between China’s top universities and its private sector. In many ways, collaboration between academia and industry in China, especially when it comes to launching new companies and products, is similar to how things work in the West. It is increasingly structured around a high-risk, high-reward funding philosophy in which promising ideas originating in academia are given investment, even if the vast majority of them fail. But unlike well-established university–industry ecosystems such as Silicon Valley, where private investors typically dominate and accept the risk of most start-up businesses failing, in China, the state plays a pivotal role. National government departments, including the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), and local innovation funds are pouring billions of yuan into university-affiliated businesses, knowing most will not achieve commercial success. However, those that do can go on to redefine whole industries.\n\nChinese policy has explicitly sought to create synergies between researchers and companies since the launch of a MOST initiative in 1988 called the Torch Programme. It sought to commercialize research outputs from universities and institutes and set up special research zones — such as Zhongguancun in Beijing — that provide incentives for start-ups such as tax breaks, easier access to credit, land and infrastructure. This was followed in 2014 by the Mass Innovation and Entrepreneurship plan, which sought to spark grassroots innovation and start-up activity across China — not just in elite labs or giant companies, but among ordinary citizens, students, small firms and rural entrepreneurs. The plan has funded innovation spaces and incubators, and expanded access to venture capital, angel funding and government support. It also explicitly encouraged universities to spin off research into new companies, with scientists taking equity stakes in the firms.\n\nAs well as schemes to boost funding, the government can act as facilitator, reducing bureaucratic hurdles to accelerate lab-to-market transitions. One example is China’s National Medical Products Administration, formerly the China Food and Drug Administration, which has undergone major reforms in the past decade to speed up drug approvals and clinical trials. A priority review pathway was established for especially promising medicines; China joined the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use in 2017 so that Chinese clinical trials would be accepted in other countries and cut backlogs of clinical-trial applications, partly through digitalized submission systems and more staff.\n\nThe Chinese model is evident in companies such as Beijing-based Likang Life Sciences, an mRNA cancer vaccine start-up with links to Tsinghua University, also based in China’s capital. Likang is making use of Tsinghua’s pool of researchers by jointly establishing an AI for Medicine laboratory to promote an mRNA vaccine that can be tailored to individual patients using genetic sequencing.\n\nAlthough its vaccine technology is still in early clinical trials, Likang represents the ambition of the country’s health innovation system. Yet the challenges are immense. Cancer vaccines using mRNA technology are still unproven at scale, and Likang is competing with well-known global companies such as Moderna in Boston, Massachusetts, and BioNTech in Mainz, Germany. But the rewards for Chinese policymakers, who see biotechnology as a strategic priority, are potentially huge. If only one such company succeeds, it could position China as a leader in precision medicine.\n\nAnother example of China’s approach is the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer based in Wuxi, which was developed with public money by the National Research Center of Parallel Computer Engineering & Technology with close involvement from Tsinghua University. Rather than being used purely for academic computation, the supercomputer has been used by private Chinese companies in domains such as weather forecasting, materials simulation and drug discovery. Unlike Western supercomputers, which often rely on corporate partnerships to be built before they are then made available to researchers, China’s approach is seeking to integrate academic research with state-backed industrial policy. The project’s success has spurred further partnerships with companies, including in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing.\n\nThe possibilities of AI in education, a hot topic in China, provides a different template for the Chinese innovation model. Researchers in machine learning and cognitive science have spun off companies such as Liulishuo, an AI language tutor, and Squirrel AI, which adapts lessons to an individual student’s needs. Such start-ups are often founded using grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, then attract private capital.",

          "abstract": "Five paddlers completed a journey from Taiwan to Yonaguni Island, across some of the world’s fastest oceanic currents, without modern navigation tools.Credit: Kaifu et al./Science Advances (CC-By-ND)\n\nArchaeologists had previously ‘drawn lines’ to show how Stone Age seafarers could have discovered the southernmost islands of Japan, travelling northeast from Taiwan. But Yousuke Kaifu wanted to “know the story behind those lines”.\n\nIn a detailed re-enactment of the perilous journey, Kaifu, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University Museum of the University of Tokyo, and his collaborators demonstrated how Palaeolithic people could have travelled huge distances with the tools, materials, techniques and navigational skills available at the time. They described their feat in Science Advances on 25 June1.\n\nThe study highlights that “these journeys are definitely much more epic than we give them credit for”, says Eleanor Scerri, an archaeological scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.\n\nPalaeolithic sites in the Ryukyu Islands — a chain that extends for around 1,200 kilometres and includes Okinawa — contain human remains and stone tools dating to some 30,000 years ago. This suggests that the islands’ early settlers navigated there successfully from Taiwan by crossing the Kuroshio, one of the world’s strongest ocean currents.\n\nBut exactly how they did this remains a mystery. Any boat carcases have long since rotted away, so researchers instead try to recreate the voyage experimentally, using the kinds of tool and material that humans were known to have access to at the time. Kaifu and his team have been trying to travel from Taiwan to the Ryukyu Islands since 2013, partly financing their research through crowdfunding. Their first attempts, using rafts made of reeds or bamboo, were unsuccessful.\n\nSlash and burn",

          "abstract": "Grant reviewers at the US National Institutes of Health are still following screening guidelines that a judge declared illegal.Credit: Getty\n\nThe US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has not yet rescinded directives that led to the cancellation of more than 2,400 research projects it funded, NIH staff members say, even though a US judge last week called the directives “bereft of reasoning” and ruled them illegal.\n\nNIH employees, who had been instructed to screen thousands of grants on a rolling weekly basis to assess their compliance with “agency priorities”, have continued to do so after the court ruling on 16 June. This has left many confused and worried about the legality of their actions, according to eight NIH employees who spoke to Nature and were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with the press. The directives were issued by the administration of US President Donald Trump, a Republican, after he took office in January.\n\nSamuel Bagenstos, who until December 2024 was the top lawyer for NIH’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), told Nature that his office was responsible for sending out guidance to staff on how to comply with court orders — often within hours or by the next business day at latest.\n\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\n\n“This is not the way things normally go,” says Bagenstos, who worked at HHS under former president Joe Biden, a Democrat. “You would not want to leave the people responsible for complying [with court orders] hanging out in the wind, trying to figure out what they’re supposed to do.”\n\nThe NIH, HHS and White House did not immediately respond to Nature’s queries about their plans to rescind these directives, the allegations by NIH staff members that the administration is disregarding a court order or NIH employees’ concerns about the continued screening of grants.\n\nThe NIH has made some progress in complying with the court’s orders. It has begun to reinstate about 900 projects covered by the judge’s ruling, and it has directed staff to cease any further terminations, according to emails that Nature obtained. A top NIH official wrote in one of the emails that these actions are “part of the first phase of our compliance with the court’s judgment” and “additional information is forthcoming”.\n\nFar-reaching cancellations\n\nSince Trump took office earlier this year, the NIH has cancelled funding for thousands of projects, including research on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+) and COVID-19.\n\nRepresentatives of the HHS and billionaire Elon Musk’s US Department of Government Efficiency issued directives to NIH staff members to slash grants on disfavoured topics, and they provided boilerplate language for the employees to use in termination letters to scientists, Nature previously reported.\n\nNIH grant cuts will axe clinical trials abroad — and could leave thousands without care\n\nLawsuits filed in early April challenged these cuts, arguing that they were unlawful because the NIH did not follow proper procedures and did not give adequate reasoning for their cancellation. Last week, Judge William Young of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston ruled that the directives were “arbitrary and capricious” and thus illegal and void. He also delivered a blistering rebuke after his ruling, excoriating the Trump administration for targeting research on the health of LGBTQ+ individuals and people from minority ethnic groups.",

          "title": "How to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "Since taking over as the top US health official in February, Robert F. Kennedy Jr has overseen radical changes that have alarmed many public-health experts. The agency he leads announced that it would cut its workforce by 20,000, and cancelled billions of dollars in federal funding for research and public health. Earlier this month, Kennedy replaced all the members of an influential vaccine advisory committee with hand-picked ones, including some who have expressed scepticism about vaccines. His mission, he says, is to ‘Make America Healthy Again’. “We are the sickest nation in the world,” he said in March, “and we have the highest rate of chronic disease.”\n\nWho is on RFK Jr’s new vaccine panel — and what will they do?\n\nHis diagnosis holds some truth, say public-health specialists and analysts. Relative to other similarly wealthy nations, the United States has the shortest life expectancy despite spending the most on health care. It “has the highest rates of preventable and treatable deaths”, says Reginald Williams, a health-policy specialist at the Commonwealth Fund, a think tank in New York City that publishes regular comparisons of health-care systems around the world. And researchers agree that high rates of chronic disease, including heart disease and obesity, are key contributors to Americans’ higher death rates, as Kennedy emphasizes.\n\nBut researchers say that Kennedy — widely known as RFK Jr — has mostly ignored other leading causes of death and ill health, including car accidents, drug overdoses and gun violence. In these areas, the United States “is a really clear outlier”, says Colin Angus, who studies health policy at the University of Sheffield, UK. “But, you know, I don’t see RFK talking about those things.” Kennedy has also promoted medical misinformation and conspiracy theories — particularly with regards to the safety of vaccines.\n\nWith Kennedy’s plans for US health beginning to come into focus, Nature has dug into the data to explore how unhealthy America is, how it got there and why many researchers say that some of Kennedy’s proposed solutions are misguided.\n\nShorter lives\n\nTo gauge US health, life expectancy — the average number of years a person is expected to live — is a good place to start. Many analyses show that the United States has lower life expectancy than most similar nations. A comparison by KFF, a non-profit health-policy research organization based in San Francisco, California, shows that US life expectancy at birth in 2023 was 78.4 years. This is 4.1 years shorter than the average of 11 comparably large wealthy countries, including Australia, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom (see ‘Low expectations’). “The US is just like nothing else. It’s shocking,” says Angus.\n\nSource: Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker\n\nPeople in the United States also spend fewer of their years in good shape. Healthy life expectancy — the average number of years lived in good health — was 64.4 years in 2021. This ranks below that of almost all other high-income countries, according to data from the Global Burden of Disease study1, a massive epidemiological project to measure health loss.\n\nThe gap wasn’t always so wide. Life expectancy in the United States was closer to the average for its peers around 1980 and gradually improved, according to KFF’s analyses. The gains were driven partly by a drop in smoking and increased use of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins, which cut deaths from cardiovascular and other chronic diseases, says Thomas Bollyky, who directs the global-health programme at the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank headquartered in New York City.\n\nAlthough that trend continued in most peer nations, improvements in life expectancy gradually slowed in the United States, plateauing around 2010. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily widened the gap, because of higher excess mortality in the United States compared with its peers. So what’s going on?\n\nTo find out, KFF researchers looked at death data across age groups. The biggest difference in death rates has been in people aged 15–49 (see ‘Early deaths’). Among these younger people, the death rate has been falling much more slowly in the United States than in peer countries — and it spiked drastically owing to COVID-19. “More people die younger,” says Lynne Cotter, a senior health-policy researcher at KFF. And because young deaths erase more years of life than do older ones, they drag down overall life expectancy.\n\nSource: Human Mortality Database\n\nHow much does chronic disease contribute to the high US death rate? A lot. Overall, chronic conditions — heart disease, cancer, stroke and respiratory disease — take up four out of five spots on the country’s list of biggest killers. Cotter attributes about one-third of excess premature deaths in people under the age of 70 to cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and kidney disease. “Chronic conditions certainly make up a large portion,” she says. KFF estimates that Americans are about twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease before reaching 70 as are people in similar countries.\n\nExclusive: NIH to cut grants for COVID research, documents reveal\n\nOne of the biggest drivers of those deadly conditions is obesity, say researchers. As of 2022, about 42% of adults were considered obese in the United States, compared with 27% in the United Kingdom and 5.5% in Japan. Obesity increases the risks of developing diabetes, heart disease, cancer and many other conditions. “The US has, particularly around diet, obesity and overweight, adopted unhealthier lifestyles at a higher rate than our country peers,” Bollyky says.\n\nIn a May report2, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission, which Kennedy leads, blamed childhood chronic disease mainly on ultra-processed foods, excessive screen time, lack of physical activity, exposure to chemicals and overprescription of medications. A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which Kennedy leads, did not directly address the criticisms and questions raised by sources in this article. They said that the MAHA report focuses on “a disturbing reality unfolding across the nation — the scale of the chronic disease epidemic and the institutional failures that allowed it to grow unchecked for decades”, and that the agency will next publish a report outlining policy recommendations. Americans “elected President Trump and put Kennedy in office — to Make America Healthy Again — and that’s exactly what we’re doing”, they said.\n\nUnhealthy diets are one factor driving obesity-related chronic conditions in the United States. Credit: Derek Davis/Portland Press Herald/Getty\n\nResearch supports Kennedy’s argument that ultra-processed foods might be partly to blame for poor health. Their consumption has been linked to increased risks of obesity and some other chronic diseases, and is relatively high in the United States. Such foods comprise an estimated 58% of US daily energy intake — similar to that in the United Kingdom, but greater than the 48% in Canada and 31% in France3.\n\nWilliams says that the problems caused by chronic disease are compounded by poor health care. Compared with a group of similar high-income countries, the United States is the only one that lacks universal health-insurance coverage. “We have still 26 million people that remain uninsured,” Williams says. Lack of health insurance, high costs and other barriers prevent people from getting diagnoses and treatment early on. “And then when they do seek care, they’re at a place where their disease or needs are much higher.”\n\nBy contrast, death rates from cancer in the under 70s have remained similar in the United States and other countries, probably because of widespread cancer screening and proactive cancer care, say public-health specialists. “Cancer has moved from basically a death sentence to a manageable chronic disease,” says Williams. “So we need to have that same level of engagement around obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular care.”\n\nThe other big contributors to lower life expectancy in the United States — and what really sets the country apart, researchers say — are high death rates from substance misuse, car accidents, suicide and homicide (see ‘Varied causes’). These tend to kill people of working age.\n\nSource: Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker\n\nDeaths from substance misuse are explained mainly by overdoses of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl — part of the US opioid crisis. Many Americans are killed in traffic accidents, partly because they tend to spend proportionately more time driving, and in bigger cars, than people in many other nations. “We’re a very car-centric society,” says Mary Pat Campbell, a life-insurance specialist who works at the investment-management firm Conning in Hartford, Connecticut, and blogs about mortality data. “We don’t have a lot of good mass-transit alternatives.”\n\nGun deaths account for about 80% of US murders and 55% of suicides. This led physician Vivek Murthy to call gun violence a public-health crisis in 2024, when he was US surgeon-general, and to highlight that it was the leading cause of death in children and adolescents. (The HHS removed this advisory from its website in March, according to news reports.) More gun deaths are suicides than homicides, says Campbell. “It gets very bleak thinking about some of these things,” she says.\n\nIt gets bleaker. All told, the death rates in working-age people mean that one 5-year-old out of every 20 — or roughly one in every school class — will die before the age of 45, according to Angus’s calculations. The comparable figure is one in 50 in the United Kingdom and one in 100 in Switzerland.\n\nRegional differences\n\nAlthough the life expectancy for the United States suggests that the country is relatively unhealthy, the average masks a more complex picture. Closer examination reveals that the figure varies drastically across the country.",

Credit: John Keeble/Getty\n\nImaging research in the popular field of computer vision almost always involves analysing humans and their environments, and most of the subsequent patents can be used in surveillance technologies, a study has found.\n\nComputer-vision research involves developing algorithms to extract information from images and videos. It can be used to spot cancerous cells, classify animal species or in robot vision. But much of the time, the technologies are used to identify and track people, suggests the study published in Nature on 25 June1.\n\nComputer scientists need to “wake up” and consider the moral implications of their work, says Yves Moreau, a computational biologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, who studies the ethics of human data.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nHuman-surveillance technologies have advanced in the past few years with the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and imaging capabilities. The technologies can recognize humans and their behaviour, for instance, through face or gait recognition and monitoring for certain actions.\n\nPolice forces and governments say that AI-powered surveillance allows them to better protect the public. But critics say that the systems are prone to error, disproportionately affect minority populations and can be used to suppress protest.\n\nImaging humans\n\nThe analysis assessed 19,000 computer-vision papers published between 1990 and 2020 at the leading Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, as well as 23,000 patents that cited them. The researchers looked in depth at a random sample of 100 papers and 100 patents and found that 90% of the studies and 86% of the patents that cited those papers involved data relating to imaging humans and their spaces. Just 1% of the papers and 1% of the patents were designed to extract only non-human data.\n\nThe ethical questions that haunt facial-recognition research\n\nAnd the trend has increased. In a wider analysis, the researchers searched all the patents for a list of keywords linked to surveillance, such as ‘iris’, ‘criminal’ and ‘facial recognition’. They found that in the 2010s, 78% of computer-vision papers that led to patents produced ones related to surveillance, compared with 53% in the 1990s (see ‘Surveillance-enabling research’). Almost “the entire field is working on faces and gaits, on detecting people in images, and nobody seems to be saying, ‘Wait, what are we doing here?’” says Moreau.\n\nAlthough many have assumed that there was a pipeline from computer-vision research to surveillance, that is “very different than having actual empirical evidence”, says Sandra Wachter, who studies technology and regulation at the University of Oxford, UK.",

          "title": "What incentives do companies need to publish research?",
          "authors": "Brian Owens",
          "abstract": "Academic research might lay the groundwork for modern technology, but the products we use daily are often shaped by innovations from corporate labs. Unlike in academia, where publishing is central to progress, corporate research tends to prioritize secrecy — protecting discoveries to maintain a competitive edge. That is not to say that companies don’t disseminate the results of their research. Results are often shared in company annual reports, investor prospectuses and white papers. And US publicly traded firms produce around 30,000 peer-reviewed scientific publications a year, says Dror Shvadron, a researcher at the University of Toronto in Canada who studies how companies approach scientific research. “It’s a big activity that firms are involved in,” he says.\n\nBut even that relatively large number of publications represents a small fraction of the research that firms do. Amazon, for example, has a research and development (R&D) budget of about US$85 billion, says Jungkyu Suh, an economist at New York University. In 2024, the company published just over 200 research articles that were indexed in the Web of Science database, owned by analytics firm Clarivate.\n\nData prepared for Nature Index by Sydney-based firm League of Scholars, which tracks recruitment across the public and private research sectors, suggest that other big-tech companies, such as Apple and Meta, are even less likely to publish, despite being among the top ten corporations globally for researcher headcount (see ‘Papers vs patents’).\n\nThis trend is due in part to a change in how companies approach science, especially in the United States, says Suh. In the first part of the twentieth century, firms tended to invest heavily in science in areas where US academia was lagging behind Europe, such as organic chemistry, polymers and electrical engineering. “AT&T Bell Labs, Dupont Experimental Station, Kodak Research Labs, were all huge labs that dwarfed what American universities were able to provide in the 1920s and ’30s,” he says.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science Inc.\n\nBut by the 1950s and ’60s, universities in the United States had improved a lot, and that led to the rise of a different kind of corporate research lab, what Suh and Shvadron call an “absorptive” lab — one that absorbs the knowledge produced in universities, and builds on it, rather than creating its own.\n\nThe main reason for firms to invest in science of any kind is to create products that boost profits, so the question is, why do they publish their research at all? And, if governments or society want them to publish more, what incentives might help? “Whether to publish new knowledge is always a tough strategic decision for a company,” says Katrin Hussinger, an economist at the University of Luxembourg. “They have to consider what they could potentially win or lose.” Some fruits of internal research are such important company secrets that they will never be published — Google’s search algorithm, for instance, or the recipe for Coca-Cola — but other discoveries might serve a strategic purpose if they are shared, says Hussinger.\n\nSometimes firms will decide to give up their exclusive knowledge of a technology as a way to shape the market, influence regulation and build standards, she says. Automaker Toyota shared the technology behind its hydrogen fuel cells, not out of altruism, but because it wanted to accelerate the adoption of the technology and make its version the industry standard, says Hussinger. Tesla did something similar by opening up its electric-vehicle charging network to other companies. “That can be a win, because the whole ecosystem grows” around a product, says Hussinger, which potentially increases customer demand.\n\nIn some industries, such as pharmaceuticals, publishing the results of clinical trials is a regulatory requirement, says David Wehrheim, who studies business strategy at the University of Navarra in Spain. Doctors use these findings to decide which treatments to prescribe. Research papers can also be a marketing device to communicate with markets, investors and customers. This not only signals what the company is working on, but also shows that the work has been certified by others through peer review. Getting research published in a big-name journal “is better than any marketing” message, says Daniele Rotolo, who studies corporate science at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. “It’s a more credible source.”\n\nResearch publications can also support a company’s intellectual-property (IP) strategy, even if protecting IP might seem like a good reason for keeping results secret, says Rotolo. Companies often try to protect their patents on inventions by pursuing related patenting claims, he says, to prevent competitors from attempting to claim their own patents on incremental changes or improvements. But that can be an expensive strategy. It’s much cheaper to make their additional research publicly available through publications. This allows them to demonstrate that they have changed the state of the art — a term used in IP circles to mean everything about a technology that has been made public — and makes it much more difficult for competitors to claim incremental patents because they can’t show novelty.\n\nA similar strategy can be at play when competitors are racing to claim a patent, says Rotolo. A firm in the lead might publish some of its results to discourage the laggards by showing how close they are to winning. Or those falling behind might publish their research to make it more difficult for the leader to receive a patent or to reduce its expected value. A company might even decide to completely disclose a particular technology (essentially renouncing its claim on a patent) to stop others from patenting it, while preserving its ability to exploit that technology in the future. “A classic example of this is pharmaceutical company, Merck, disclosing all their human gene sequences”, which has been seen as a way to avoid the privatization of that knowledge, so that the company could still use the information later for drug development, says Rotolo. Publishing can also give companies a competitive edge: access to new ideas and recruits from academia, says Scott Stern, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. “They spill a little knowledge to get access to more. It’s the ticket of admission to a scientific community they can draw from.”\n\nThe ability to publish their work is often an incentive for prospective employees. Stern’s work has shown that scientists are even willing to accept a lower salary for jobs that offer the freedom to publish and set their own research agenda. Looking at roles being advertised in the life sciences, Stern found that jobs that allowed more publishing had starting salaries that were on average 20% lower than more restrictive positions, a trend that has also been seen in other fields. “The ongoing competition for talent plays a role,” says Hussinger. Allowing employees “to publish, go to conferences and build their reputation keeps people motivated”.\n\nDespite these incentives, publishing by firms seems to be on the decline. US companies are spending less of their R&D budgets on the research side, according to work by Ashish Arora, who studies innovation at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. The share of fundamental and applied research in corporate R&D declined from 28% in 1985 to 20% in 2015. Less of that research is being published, as well. Since the 1980s, publicly traded companies have spent more on science and research, but the rate of patenting remains relatively stable, and the number of scientific publications they produce is falling.",

          "abstract": "More than 600,000 students were enrolled in PhD programmes in China in 2023.Credit: ChinaImages/Sipa USA via Alamy\n\nThe number of doctoral graduates globally has been growing steadily over the past few decades. And in countries such as China and India, those numbers are exploding.\n\nConventionally, the doctorate was a stepping stone to a lifelong career in academia. But today, the number of PhD graduates vastly exceeds the number of job openings at universities and research institutions. Researchers say that many universities are not preparing graduates for a career outside academia.\n\n“We need to make doctoral education more meaningful, more sustainable and better aligned with the diverse societal and labour-market needs,” says Cláudia Sarrico, the Secretary of State for Higher Education in Portugal, who previously worked at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris.\n\nThe PhD explosion\n\nAmong the 38 countries belonging to the OECD, the number of new doctorate holders almost doubled between 1998 and 20171, and has continued to increase in the years since. (Although several countries, including Australia and Brazil, have seen a dip in PhD enrolments over the past few years, driven in part by high living costs and low stipends.)\n\nIn China, the number of doctoral students has doubled — from around 300,000 in 2013 to more than 600,000 students enrolled in PhD programmes in 2023. “The numbers are massive, and they keep growing,” says Hugo Horta, who researches higher-education policy and practice at the University of Hong Kong. There are several factors driving this growth, Horta explains, such as the increasing number of people with bachelor’s and master’s degrees, and the expectation among many in the country that an investment in higher education will provide better economic and social prospects.\n\nBut the number of jobs in academia has not kept pace with the growth in PhD holders, says Horta. People coming into these doctoral programmes are, for the most part, training to become academics, so many future graduates are going to face fierce competition for any position, he says.\n\nGreat expectations\n\nIn countries such as the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, non-academic jobs are increasingly becoming the norm for people with PhDs. A 2023 study2 of more than 4,500 PhD graduates in the United Kingdom found that over two-thirds of doctoral graduates were employed outside academia.\n\nSuch employment can mean graduates taking jobs that aren’t research based or that are outside their area of expertise. In South Africa, out of more than 6,000 PhD graduates who completed a 2020 survey, 18% said that they had had trouble finding jobs related to their expertise. “Even though they do find jobs, it’s not necessarily linked to their PhDs, and it’s not always the jobs that they expected or that they wanted,” says Milandré van Lill, a researcher at Stellenbosch University in South Africa and a co-author of the study. “From my perspective, we have reached saturation point in terms of PhD graduates.” Some graduates who find jobs outside of academia feel overqualified and undervalued, says van Lill.\n\nThat isn’t the case everywhere. The 2023 study found that job satisfaction among PhD graduates was generally high, with more than 90% saying they were happy with their career2. Those in science- and technology-related fields were more likely to find research-related roles — which are linked to higher levels of job satisfaction — than were those in the social sciences, arts and humanities.",

          "abstract": "Researchers feed vast quantities of genomic data into machine-learning systems to train them to predict the role of non-coding sequences.Credit: JuSun/iStock via Getty\n\nNearly 25 years after scientists completed a draft human genome sequence, many of its 3.1 billion letters remain a puzzle. The 98% of the genome that is not made of protein-coding genes — but which can influence their activity — is especially vexing.\n\nAn artificial intelligence (AI) model developed by Google DeepMind in London could help scientists to make sense of this ‘dark matter’, and see how it might contribute to diseases such as cancer and influence the inner workings of cells. The model, called AlphaGenome, is described in a 25 June preprint.\n\n“This is one of the most fundamental problems not just in biology — in all of science,” said Pushmeet Kohli, the company’s head of AI for science, at a press briefing.\n\nThe ‘sequence to function’ model takes long stretches of DNA and predicts various properties, such as the expression levels of the genes they contain and how those levels could be affected by mutations.\n\n“I think it is an exciting leap forward,” says Anshul Kundaje, a computational genomicist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who has had early access to AlphaGenome. “It is a genuine improvement in pretty much all current state-of-the-art sequence-to-function models.”\n\nAn ‘all in one’ approach\n\nWhen DeepMind unveiled AlphaFold 2 in 2020, it went a long way towards solving a problem that had challenged researchers for decades: determining how a protein’s sequence contributes to its 3D shape.\n\nWorking out what DNA sequences do is different, because there is no one answer, as in a 3D structure that AlphaFold delivers. A single DNA stretch will have numerous, interconnected roles — from attracting one set of cellular machinery to latch onto a particular section of a chromosome and turn a nearby gene into an RNA molecule, to attracting protein-transcription factors that influence where, when and to what extent gene expression occurs. Many DNA sequences, for example, influence gene activity by altering a chromosome’s 3D shape, either restricting or easing access for the machinery that does the transcription.\n\nBiologists have been chipping away at this question for decades with various kinds of computational tool. In the past decade or so, scientists have developed dozens of AI models to make sense of the genome. Many of these have focused on an individual task, such as predicting levels of gene expression or determining how modular segments of individual genes, called exons, are cut-and-pasted into distinct proteins. But scientists are increasingly interested in ‘all in one’ tools for interpreting DNA sequences.\n\nAlphaGenome is one such model. It can take inputs of up to one million DNA letters — a stretch that could include a gene and myriad regulatory elements — and make thousands of predictions about numerous biological properties. In many cases, AlphaGenome’s predictions are sensitive to single-DNA-letter changes, which means that scientists can predict the consequences of mutations.\n\nIn one example, DeepMind researchers applied the AlphaGenome model to diverse mutations identified in previous studies in people with a type of leukaemia. The model accurately predicted that the non-coding mutations indirectly activated a nearby gene that is a common driver of this cancer.\n\nStill limited",

Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library\n\nIf Stephen Quake gets his way, biologists in the future will spend a lot less time wielding pipettes. “Our goal,” he says, “is to create computational tools so that cell biology goes from being 90% experimental and 10% computational to the other way around.”\n\nQuake, head of science at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) in Redwood City, California, is among the researchers leading a charge to create virtual cells. These are artificial intelligence (AI) models that can generate the kinds of insight that currently take weeks of experiments to answer — such as how tumour cells will respond to a particular drug.\n\n“It’s going to be a very powerful tool for understanding what goes wrong in disease,” says Quake, who envisions that scientists will use experiments mainly to validate predictions made by virtual cells.\n\nI told AI to make me a protein. Here’s what it came up with\n\nEfforts to create virtual cells are in their early days, but the idea has attracted intense interest in both academic and industry laboratories worldwide. CZI, a non-profit organization that develops open data sets and tools, is planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on creating virtual cells over the next decade. Google DeepMind, in London, has a virtual-cell project too, its chief executive Demis Hassabis said earlier this year.\n\n“This is a gigantic task,” says Jan Ellenberg, a molecular biologist at the Science for Life Laboratory, a national research organization in Solna, Sweden. He is co-leading the lab’s own virtual-cell model called Alpha Cell, which will launch in 2026. “What is possible now and needed now is to have the first pioneering projects that show this can, in principle, work.”\n\nBut some scientists say that the rush to develop virtual cells — although an important long-term goal for biology — has a lot of hype, but not a lot of concrete results or a clear path to success.\n\n“It’s primarily being used as a rallying cry and a funding mechanism, and it’s working,” says Anshul Kundaje, a computational biologist at Stanford University in California. “Investors are putting a huge amount of funding into this space.”\n\nBugs in the machine\n\nBiologists have been using computers to model cellular behaviour for decades. In 2012, scientists created the first computational model of an entire cell, capturing the inner workings of the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium, which has just 525 genes1.\n\nBut these and other early efforts “were often trying to really build a full mechanistic model of the cell”, says Silvana Konermann, a computational biologist at the Arc Institute in Palo Alto, California.\n\nBy contrast, the current push to develop virtual cells takes advantage of advances in AI that allow it to develop sophisticated representations of data, such as text in the case of large language models, when fed vast quantities of it. “Building models that learn from data is revolutionary,” says Quake.\n\nFive protein-design questions that still challenge AI\n\nEarly virtual-cell offerings have focused largely on one type of data: that from experiments that sequence all of the messenger-RNA molecules in individual cells, amounting to a catalogue of gene activity and a snapshot of the cell’s current state.\n\nThese data form the basis of ‘atlases’ that map different cell types across humans and other organisms, revealing underappreciated diversity. Researchers are now churning out ‘single-cell sequencing’ data sets to help power their virtual cells. CZI has plans to release sequencing data from one billion cells (expanding a database of more than 100 million), and in February, Arc released sequencing data from 100 million cancer cells treated with hundreds of drugs.\n\nSingle-cell sequencing data is appealing, says systems biologist Hani Goodarzi at the Arc Institute, because it can be affordably generated at a similar scale to that at which large language models start to gain sophisticated capabilities — in the hundreds of billions of datapoints.",

          "abstract": "After being charged last month with trying to smuggle frog embryos into the United States, Kseniia Petrova, a Russian bioinformatician, was indicted on 25 June on additional charges by a grand jury in Boston, Massachusetts — including making a false statement to customs agents. Petrova is one of at least four foreign scientists facing criminal charges for attempting to bring biological material into the country, adding to the anxiety rippling through the research community as the administration of US President Donald Trump slashes science spending and cracks down on immigration.\n\nInternational PhD students make emergency plans in fear of US immigration raids\n\nNature talked to research and legal specialists to understand whether these cases cropping up is unusual and how lab materials should be transported. Detentions for carrying undocumented biological material into the United States happen every year, says Jonathan Grode, an attorney at the immigration law firm Green and Spiegel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who is not involved in any of the cases.\n\nTypically, if a person enters the country with a non-hazardous item that is either prohibited or lacks the proper documentation, the authorities confiscate the item, inform the individual of the proper procedure to retrieve it and issue a fine for failing to follow protocol, Grode says. If something is considered hazardous, that changes the calculus, as does being a repeat offender. If you’re both of those things “you are going to get arrested, you are going to be fined and you are going to be denied entry to the country”, he adds.\n\n“The rules have not changed” under the Trump administration, Grode says. What has is the “sensationalism” around any foreigner who has problems at the border, whether from the media or from the Trump team highlighting the case in its deportation efforts, he adds.\n\nCustoms violations\n\nPetrova, who had been working at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, was arrested in February for allegedly failing to declare the embryos when transporting them to Harvard from France. At a hearing on 18 June, Brian Goldsworthy, an agent for the US Department of Homeland Security, testified that border agents at Boston’s Logan International Airport asked Petrova whether she had food in her bag and she said no — but she was actually carrying a foam box containing the embryos.\n\nPetrova’s immigration attorney, Gregory Romanowsky, contends that border agents broke protocol, because the alleged customs violation should have triggered a civil process rather than a criminal one. Instead, agents treated the issue as an immigration violation, revoked Petrova’s visa and started deportation proceedings, he says. She spent 116 days in detention before her release from federal custody on bail on 12 June.\n\nKseniia Petrova was released on bail from federal custody on 12 June.Credit: Leah Willingham/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nPetrova might be able to avoid some of the criminal charges, because there are questions about whether the embryos were hazardous, Grode says, but her mistake was not to tell the authorities about the embryos in the first place. “That is the number-one way you can find yourself in trouble,” he says.\n\nIn another case, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested Yunqing Jian, a Chinese postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, earlier this month. According to court documents, in July last year, her partner, Zunyong Liu, a researcher at Zhejiang University in China, tried to bring samples of a fungus known as Fusarium graminearum, which can harm cereal crops such as wheat, into the United States. He initially denied carrying the fungus in his backpack, the documents say, but then admitted he was taking it to Jian’s university, where he said he planned to study it during his visit. Following an investigation by the FBI, both plant pathologists have been charged with conspiracy, smuggling and making false statements, and Liu has also been charged with visa fraud. Jian remains in custody in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed by FBI agent Edward Nieh on 2 June, phone records show that this wasn’t the first time Jian and Liu had smuggled biological materials into the United States.\n\n‘Another blow’: how Trump’s latest travel ban could harm research\n\nOn 8 June, another Chinese scientist, Chengxuan Han, was arrested at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Han, a biologist at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, was planning to spend a year conducting research at the University of Michigan, according to a criminal complaint filed as part of the case. The authorities detained her and charged her, alleging that she had, on four occasions, sent staff members at the University of Michigan “concealed biological materials” that were “related to round worms”, according to a press release issued by the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told Nature that parasitic roundworms can cause significant damage to crops, leading to economic hardship for farmers. The criminal complaint filed with the case doesn’t mention parasitic roundworms — only Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of roundworm frequently used in the laboratory as a model organism.\n\nThe hazardousness of the materials that the scientists sent will need to be assessed in each case, as will the scientists’ intent in using the materials, but their lack of transparency will make their cases more difficult, Grode says. “It’s not so much what was being sent, but the effort to conceal what was being sent,” he says.",

          "abstract": "US President Donald Trump with members of his cabinet following strikes on Iran.Credit: Carlos Barria/Pool/AFP via Getty\n\nOn 22 June, many people woke to the news that the United States had bombed nuclear sites in Iran, with the goal of destroying its ability to produce nuclear weapons. The raids targeted Iran’s uranium-enrichment facilities in Fordow and Natanz, and its nuclear research centre in Esfahan, using stealth bombers — which dropped massive ‘bunker-busters’ — and cruise missiles.\n\nAlthough Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, experts have long assessed that Iran was close to having the capability of building nuclear weapons, if it chose to do so. The US attacks followed a bombing campaign by Israel, which has since carried out further attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. On 23 June, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that “very significant damage is expected to have occurred” at the underground Fordow site.\n\nResearchers at academic institutions and think tanks are also assessing the potential impacts of the attacks on Iran's nuclear capabilities. Analysts have said that the attacks probably set the nuclear programme back substantially, but not permanently. In particular, Iran could have moved stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium, and perhaps some enrichment centrifuges, elsewhere. David Albright, a nuclear-policy specialist and president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington DC, spoke to Nature about what researchers know.\n\nHow do you assess the impact of the bombings on Iran’s nuclear capabilities?\n\nThere aren’t many researchers who are able to assess the impact of the bombings. We have decades of experience with the Iranian nuclear programme, so we know their facilities and activities very well. And we have great access to satellite imagery — which we have to buy. We try to buy some every day. And we utilize analysts who have decades of experience to analyze these images. We also have lots of contacts with governments, and we have colleagues who also have contacts with governments.\n\nA lot of the damage is on the surface, so it’s a question of knowing what the building did [in terms of its role in the nuclear program]. We rely on our repository of information about the sites that are attacked. So it’s pretty straightforward.\n\nObviously, more problematic are the underground sites. When we initially assessed Israel’s bombing of Natanz, three days later I saw a very small crater above the underground hall. I could work out and link it to a type of Earth-penetrating weapon that Israel is known to have. It would leave a really small crater when it went in, and the damage would be underground. The United States bombed it with a much more powerful Earth penetrator, so the damage is probably more extensive.\n\nHow and when will the extent of the damage be known for sure?\n\nAs nuclear experts, we’d like to see this done with diplomatic agreements, where Iran would allow intrusive inspections into its programme. If that does not happen, then it’s the job of US and Israeli intelligence to assess the damage. They’re looking at communications intercepts, or trying to recruit people on the inside to reveal information.\n\nWould radioactive material be detected outside Natanz, Esfahan and Fordow if the attacks were successful?\n\nSo far, the IAEA reports no such leaks. And it appears that Iran had moved the enriched uranium stockpiles in the days before the bombings. The United States has said that the target of its bombings was the facilities, so they understand they are not getting at the nuclear material.",

          "title": "Medical AI can transform medicine — but only if we carefully track the data it touches",
          "authors": "Akhil Vaid",
          "abstract": "The practice of modern medicine is built on pattern recognition — whether in a patient’s history, physical examination, laboratory results or response to treatment. A skilled physician can identify crucial patterns early and distinguish them from others that appear deceptively similar.\n\nBut some patterns are too chaotic, too subtle or too fleeting to raise red flags. No doctor can reliably catch early-stage pancreatic cancer from routine blood tests, for example. Answers to many questions of profound importance that demand knowledge of the future1, such as whether a tumour will spread or how long a person might live, are thus subjective — often coming down to a physician’s cumulative experience or ‘gut feeling’.\n\nOne approach to reducing subjectivity in medicine is through supervised machine learning — a technique based on creating computer models that can detect patterns by learning from labelled data. For instance, by examining many mammogram images that either include or lack tumours, models can learn how to recognize the statistical features that tend to go with one label or the other, even when those features aren’t obvious to the human eye.\n\nWhy an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science\n\nUnsurprisingly, interest in predictive modelling has exploded. In cases involving tumour spread, organ failure or narrow treatment windows, accurate knowledge of how someone’s condition might unfold can conserve resources, reduce suffering and save lives. In 2024 alone, the citation database PubMed indexed more than 26,000 studies mentioning artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning or deep learning in patient health care and clinical medicine. The global market for AI in health care is projected to exceed US$46 billion by the end of this year, and $200 billion by 2030.\n\nYet any model, no matter how sophisticated, is still a source of uncertainty. If it underestimates risk, it contributes to clinicians overlooking serious concerns. And if it overestimates risk, it could lead to unnecessary tests and interventions, and wasted resources.\n\nA model’s usefulness is typically judged by how well it generalizes to previously unseen data, which is treated as a proxy for real-world performance. But there’s a catch: in learning to predict outcomes, models also absorb the clinical decisions, relationships and biases that are baked into the data used to train them. Supervised learning relies on the assumption that these conditions, including the biases, will remain stable during model use. Without this foundation, things fall apart.\n\nFor example, ‘Is this patient at risk of dying tomorrow?’ is a different question in a rural outpatient clinic than in a cardiac intensive-care unit, and a model trained in one setting is likely to perform poorly in the other.\n\nCurrent best practices2 emphasize transparency in data sources and encourage testing models in the environments where they will be used. Still, given that many medical data sets are small, biased or tied to narrow populations, the odds that models will underperform or stop working altogether remain uncomfortably high.\n\nHowever, the greatest threat to the widespread adoption of predictive modelling in health care could come not from the instances in which the model fails outright, but rather those in which it succeeds in delivering results.\n\nData contamination\n\nWherever machine learning is used in a health-care setting, it is typically built on the foundation of the electronic health record (EHR) for patients. Although EHR adoption varies globally, it is deeply embedded in many high-income countries, where it serves as both the source of training data for predictive models and the system through which those predictions are returned to clinicians. At its core, the EHR is a dynamic database that continuously logs almost all aspects of patient care — including lab results, medication, clinical notes and key events such as infections or deaths.\n\nCould biomarkers mean better pain treatment?\n\nBy expanding the amount of patient data available, the EHR enables a standardized workflow: data are pulled from the EHR to train models, and once the models are deployed, they analyse fresh patient data to predict potential health risks. These predictions can guide clinical decisions — for example, prompting a physician to order a chest X-ray or to begin administering antibiotics if a model flags a high risk of pneumonia, even before classic symptoms fully develop.\n\nBut the EHR is also the destination of the predictions of models — and the consequences of those predictions. Take, for example, a model designed to detect early signs of the onset of sepsis. Ideally, the physician is alerted and takes timely action in administering antibiotics or fluids to prevent the condition from progressing. This is exactly the kind of impact we want from AI in health care. Sepsis is notoriously hard to catch early and has a mortality rate of 30–40%, so swift intervention can save lives.\n\nBut therein lies the rub: because the physician intervened, the patient doesn’t develop sepsis. As a result, the pattern the model flagged — originally linked to sepsis — is now recorded in the EHR as being associated with a non-septic outcome. This creates a ‘contaminated association’3 in the data, in which warning signs of sepsis seem to lead to good outcomes, simply because of successful intervention. As these associations accumulate, they begin to erode the reliability of existing and even future models.\n\nOver time, even well-performing AI models can degrade. Shifts in patient demographics, evolving standards of care, new medications or changes in clinical practice can all cause a model’s predictions to become less accurate — a phenomenon known as model drift.\n\nA physician in a French hospital studies an X-ray in which an artificial-intelligence model has flagged possible fractures. Credit: Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty\n\nRetraining models on newer, more representative data is widely considered the best way to recover performance4. But as the EHR database gets corrupted with false associations, retraining becomes effectively impossible. The data set used to train the model now contains a pattern that implies sepsis, but also ‘not-sepsis’. This is the equivalent of teaching addition to a child by telling them that two plus two is four. Sometimes. At other times it’s three, but only when it’s not five3.\n\nSerious conditions such as pneumonia, acute kidney injury (AKI) and sepsis often occur together during a single illness or hospital stay. A model that successfully prevents one of these conditions might indirectly prevent the others as well. This introduces misleading associations into the EHR — not just for current models, but for those yet to be built3.\n\nThings get even more complicated when multiple AI models are used in the same clinical setting. For example, one model might predict the risk of AKI, while another might forecast blood clots. These are different conditions, but both rely on the same lab values, such as measurements of the waste product creatinine, blood platelets or inflammatory markers. If a physician responds to the AKI alert by adjusting fluids or medications, that could render the predictions of the blood-clot model obsolete, or unreliable. In this way, an intervention triggered by one model can quietly disrupt another, even if they are focused on entirely different outcomes3.\n\nHigher-order effects\n\nCurrent approaches to predictive modelling in health care don’t account for how models interact with each other or with clinical decision-making. This raises serious questions about some of the field’s core practices, starting with how researchers monitor model performance after deployment.\n\nIf a model helps to prevent an adverse event, its predictions do not occur — for example, patients do not die of sepsis — and its real-world performance might appear to decline5. That said, a drop in performance could also mean that the model isn’t working well in practice and is making poor predictions. It is often difficult to tell the difference between these two situations.\n\nOne way to improve understanding of what’s happening is to regularly compare outcomes between periods when the model is active and when it is not. This kind of side-by-side comparison can help to determine whether the model is truly effective or if it’s falling short. In this scenario, an expected range of performance change should be established as part of the evaluation process. If performance drops beyond this range, it might indicate model degradation. If the drop is smaller than expected, it could point to limited model use or ineffective integration into clinical practice. Estimating this range in advance can be difficult, because factors such as model drift or clinical variability might interfere. A more reliable approach might be to determine the range experimentally, under controlled conditions.\n\nA question of trust for AI research in medicine\n\nUnfortunately, real-world patient care, especially in environments with multiple models and providers, is far removed from controlled conditions. Although randomized controlled trials6 (RCTs) remain the gold standard for evaluating clinical treatments and models, applying that level of control in day-to-day clinical settings is rarely possible. In practice, clinicians might need to choose between several overlapping or even conflicting models. As the number of deployed models grows, the results of isolated, tightly controlled studies become less reliable as indicators of real-world effectiveness. Unless a model is going to be used in exactly the same controlled environment in which it was tested — free from competing models, system changes or drift — its performance in isolation should be interpreted with caution.\n\nEven if we accept RCTs at face value as being able to provide usable proof of a predictive model’s effectiveness, they come with substantial financial and time costs. A more practical way to assess a model is to test it on entirely new data — such as from another hospital or site. This process, often called external validation, helps to show whether the model can detect real biological patterns rather than just those specific to the data it was trained on. But akin to the challenges related to retraining models, this kind of testing becomes much harder7 when previous models have already shaped or influenced the data being used for testing.",

Results published on 25 June in Cell show that consistent exercise raises levels of the compound, at least in young men. The study also found that feeding betaine to aged mice boosts their immune health and grip strength.\n\nWhether it will have similar beneficial effects in people remains to be seen. But there is a need for treatments that can mimic the effects of exercise, says Christiane Wrann, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the study. “There are people in the ageing population who don’t have the capacity any more to exercise to the extent they need,” she says.\n\nNo pill measures up\n\nFor now, there is no drug like exercise. It can sharpen the mind, soothe inflammation and rally cells to repair damaged tissue. It helps to keep some diseases at bay or ease their symptoms. “Physical activity is a recognized efficient and low-cost way to promote health and fight ageing,” says Guanghui Liu, who studies regenerative medicine at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. “But its deep-level molecular mechanisms are still not fully clear.”\n\nAgeing studies in five animals suggest how to reverse decline\n\nTo learn more, Liu and his colleagues enlisted the aid of 13 healthy young men willing to put their fitness goals on hold and lounge about for 45 days of limited physical activity. After that, the volunteers ran 5 kilometres every one or two days. The researchers took blood and stool samples and various physiological measurements from the men after their 45-day rest, and again after 25 days of their new running routine.\n\nA detailed analysis of those samples revealed the extent to which exercise reshapes the body at a molecular level. After 25 days of regular running, there were changes in immune cells, lipid metabolism, the gut microbiome and more.\n\nOne of the biggest changes was in the abundance of betaine. Following up on these results in mice, the team found that exercise induced betaine production mainly in their kidneys. They also found that the molecule binds to and inhibits a protein called TBK1, which is known to promote ageing in cells and organs.\n\nFurthermore, old mice that drank water spiked with betaine had stronger muscles, less inflammation and more-youthful skin than did their counterparts that did not get the supplement.",

          "abstract": "Childhood vaccines used in the United States have not contained the preservative thimerosal for decades. Credit: Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters\n\nVaccine advisers appointed by US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr have recommended against the use of influenza vaccines containing a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal — fulfilling a long-held goal of the anti-vaccine movement.\n\nThe vote’s practical effects in the United States are limited, because most US flu vaccine doses are already free of thimerosal, which is only present in multi-dose vials, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And the ingredient was removed from all childhood vaccines in 2001.\n\nTrump team vows to improve kids‘ health: scientists are sceptical\n\nBut thimerosal has long been a target of the anti-vaccine movement, despite strong evidence supporting its safety in the low doses found in vaccines. Public-health officials and scientists say that the vote’s symbolic effects are powerful as they struggle to maintain public confidence in vaccines. “We are talking about such a small amount of vaccine” containing thimerosal, says Chrissie Juliano, executive director of Big Cities Health Coalition, an association of US health departments, in Takoma Park, Maryland. “What this does is sow mistrust. It confuses the public.”\n\n“It was an anti-science recommendation,” says Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. “We have the information we need to tell us that thimerosal, at the level contained in vaccines, is a trivial contribution to the mercury that we’re exposed to every day.”\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the CDC, did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.\n\nHandpicked panel\n\nThe decision came today during the first meeting of the newly chosen Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel that recommends which vaccines US residents should receive and when. Most US health-insurance programmes, which fund health care for US residents, are required to provide vaccines recommended by the ACIP at no cost. Earlier this month, Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, fired all 17 members of the committee and appointed 8 new ones, some of whom have expressed scepticism about vaccines. (One new member stepped down shortly before the meeting.)\n\nBefore the vote, the committee heard a presentation by Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner and president emeritus of the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, founded by Kennedy. She advocated for the removal of the ingredient from US vaccines, pointing to various studies to make her case.\n\nWill RFK Jr’s vaccine agenda make America contagious again?\n\nOffit, who is a former member of the ACIP, says that subject-matter experts typically vet presentations before the meeting — a step that was not followed in this case — and probably would have flagged some of the data Redwood presented as inaccurate. A version of Redwood’s slides posted before the meeting contained a reference to a paper that doesn't exist, according to Reuters. The reference was later removed.\n\nSome members of the committee echoed Redwood’s claims about the safety of thimerosal, but member Cody Meissner, a paediatrics researcher at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine in Lebanon, New Hampshire, criticized the meeting’s focus on thimerosal. “I’m not quite sure how to respond to this presentation. This is an old issue that has been addressed in the past,” he said. “Of all the issues that ACIP needs to focus on, this is not a big issue,” he added. His was the only dissenting vote on the recommendation against thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\nMeissner expressed concerns that the ACIP’s recommendation could impact access to vaccines in other countries. “The recommendations that the ACIP makes are followed among many countries around the world,” he noted, and removing thimerosal from all vaccines could increase costs. Multi-dose vials, which are the ones that still contain the ingredient, are generally cheaper and easier to store and use in mass vaccination programs.",

          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "Mary Rice was among hundreds of scientists at Harvard University who watched helplessly as millions of dollars in research funds disappeared in an instant in mid-May. Two of the pulmonologist’s grants were formally cancelled as part of a series of punitive actions taken by the administration of US President Donald Trump against the university. Little justification was given to Rice aside from a statement that her research does not align with government priorities.\n\nThe cuts imperil Rice’s work at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, including a US$2.5-million clinical trial designed to test whether air purifiers benefit people with lung disease. Terminating that trial, she says, would waste millions of dollars in taxpayer money that have already been spent, as well as the time, blood and nasal tissues that nearly 180 people contributed to the study. “If we were to just close up shop completely today, we would not get an answer.”\n\nHarvard researchers devastated as Trump team cuts nearly 1,000 grants\n\nRice is on the front lines as Harvard seeks to navigate its new relationship with the US government, which has shifted from long-standing partner to hostile adversary. The Trump administration alleged that Harvard has failed to protect against antisemitism, and the government has demanded changes to the university’s curriculum as well as hiring and enrolment procedures that it says promote a liberal political agenda. The administration has terminated grants worth more than $2.4 billion over multiple years and sought to ban international students from attending the institution. Harvard is fighting both actions in court.\n\nLegal experts argue that Harvard is ultimately likely to prevail in its challenges to the Trump administration’s latest attacks, but how and when remains unclear. Trump has said that the government is nearing a deal with the university, but researchers told Nature that long-term threats to science at Harvard are likely to remain no matter what kind of deal emerges. For example, the administration is pushing broader efforts to increase taxes on university endowments and slash ‘indirect’ funds in research grants, which pay for infrastructure at the institutions that host the grants. The government has taken similar punitive measures against other elite universities, such as Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island; Columbia University in New York City; Cornell University in Ithaca, New York; and Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nBut the Trump administration has aimed its harshest actions at Harvard — arguably the most prestigious US university and the one with the largest endowment, a $53-billion pot of money that comes from donations and helps to fund university activities. The issues facing Harvard, say researcher leaders, are harbingers of what could come for scores of other US universities as the government seeks to slash funding for scientific research and increase oversight of educational institutions.\n\nIn June, a federal judge ruled that hundreds of National Institutes of Health grant terminations by the government were illegal and discriminatory, and that they had to be reinstated. Some of these include grants to Harvard.\n\nResponding to allegations in this article, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that Harvard has failed “to create a safe campus environment”, refused to share information about foreign students’ “illegal or dangerous activities” and flouted the civil rights of students and faculty members. “Suggestions that there will be economic impacts for enforcing federal law and holding institutions accountable for their failure to protect civil liberties miss the forest for the trees and completely neglect the human cost of allowing dangerous ideologies like antisemitism to fester in America.”\n\nScientists and academics who spoke to Nature say that the Trump administration has, in the space of five months, upended a science and innovation system that dates back to the Second World War and has helped the United States to become a scientific and economic powerhouse. Like their counterparts at other universities, Harvard leaders are now thinking about how to design a viable — and probably smaller — institution that is less reliant on federal support.\n\n“The uncertainties are immense,” says John Holdren, a physicist at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and science adviser during the presidency of Barack Obama. “If federal funding is substantially reduced over any significant period of time, it’s going change the institution in substantial ways.”\n\nFinancing the future\n\nWith its vast endowment, Harvard has more resources than other universities to withstand the unprecedented cuts in federal funding. Federal grants supplied $686 million in fiscal year 2024, accounting for nearly three-quarters of research revenue and 11% of the total for the university (see ‘Harvard’s revenue’).\n\nSource: Harvard Univ. Financial Report Fiscal Year 2024\n\nAlthough much of the endowment is locked up in long-term investments and legally dedicated to a variety of specific causes, university leaders have been busy looking for ways to tap into those funds, including seeking permission from donors to use the money to help solve the immediate crisis. Since March, the university has also raised $1.2 billion by issuing bonds. So far, Harvard has announced that it will spend $250 million to help cushion the blow to its schools as federal funding disappears; resources will be allocated in proportion to the amount lost.\n\nThe US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long?\n\nIn a 3 June e-mail to faculty, George Daley, dean of the medical school, said it will receive $90 million. The medical school will then contribute a further $120 million to fund research over the coming fiscal year, which begins on 1 July. All told, Daley, said in the e-mail, the medical school expects to be able to cover 74% of the cancelled federal grants over the coming year. He promised to work with department chairs and school leadership “to adjust and support the research as much as we can”.\n\nNow it’s up to department chairs to determine how the money is distributed and which positions and projects get cut. But alternative funding mechanisms — such as borrowing money and tapping into the endowment — cannot continue indefinitely, says Jeffrey Flier, an endocrinologist and former dean of the medical school. Without a restoration of federal funding or a significant increase in investments from philanthropic organizations and industry, he adds, “Harvard Medical School’s research programmes will look drastically different in four years.”\n\nStay or go\n\nThe situation is even more dire at the Chan school of public health. More than $200 million in federal research grants account for nearly half of its budget this year, and international students comprise 40% of the student body. Around 21% of the budget comes from the school’s share of the Harvard endowment, but researchers fear that this revenue could also drop if the Trump administration and fellow Republicans in Congress increase the tax on university endowments, as expected. Another 12% comes from student tuition fees.",

In a small study, the drug liraglutide reduced monthly migraine episodes by nearly half among people with obesity who experience the headache-inducing condition.\n\nMigraine is more than a headache — a radical rethink offers hope to one billion people\n\nThis is the first clinical study to explore the potential of the popular weight-loss drugs — known as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists — to curb migraine, a condition that affects around 15% of people worldwide and is characterized by debilitating headaches that can be accompanied by nausea, light sensitivity and fatigue.\n\nThe pilot study’s results were presented on 21 June at the Congress of the European Association of Neurology in Helsinki, a few days after publication in the journal Headache1. The work did not include a control group, so part of the headache reduction observed could be down to the placebo effect, says Lanfranco Pellesi, a physician specializing in headache disorders at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense who was not involved in the study. (The placebo effect is when a person experiences a benefit from a drug because they know they’re taking it and expect to feel better.)\n\nBut the results are promising enough to justify a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis, Pellesi says. Such a trial would be needed to prove that the drugs can be used against migraines, he adds.\n\nGLP-1 drugs are already used to treat obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but they are being tested against a wide range of other conditions, including arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease and addiction.\n\nBetter quality of life\n\nIn the study, Simone Braca, a neurologist at the Federico II University of Naples in Italy, and his colleagues administered liraglutide to 31 people with chronic migraine and obesity.

          "authors": "Humberto Basilio",
          "abstract": "Mindia Wichert has taken part in plenty of brain experiments as a cognitive-neuroscience graduate student at the Humboldt University of Berlin, but none was as challenging as one he faced in 2023. Inside a stark white room, he stared at a flickering screen that flashed a different image every 10 seconds. His task was to determine what familiar object appeared in each image. But, at least at first, the images looked like nothing more than a jumble of black and white patches.\n\n“I’m very competitive with myself,” says Wichert. “I felt really frustrated.”\n\nCognitive neuroscientist Maxi Becker, now at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, chose the images in an attempt to spark a fleeting mental phenomenon that people often experience but can’t control or fully explain. Study participants puzzling out what is depicted in the images — known as Mooney images, after a researcher who published a set of them in the 1950s1 — can’t rely on analytical thinking. Instead, the answer must arrive all at once, like a flash of lightning in the dark (take Nature’s Mooney-images quiz below).\n\nBecker asked some of the participants to view the images while lying inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, so she could track tiny shifts in blood flow corresponding to brain activity. She hoped to determine which regions produce ‘aha!’ moments.\n\nOver the past two decades, scientists studying such moments of insight — also known as eureka moments — have used the tools of neuroscience to reveal which regions of the brain are active and how they interact when discovery strikes. They’ve refined the puzzles they use to trigger insight and the measurements they take, in an attempt to turn a self-reported, subjective experience into something that can be documented and rigorously studied. This foundational work has led to new questions, including why some people are more insightful than others, what mental states could encourage insight and how insight might boost memory.\n\nBecker’s study aimed to find out how the rapid reorganization and integration of knowledge that she and others think is a defining feature of insight happens in the brain and whether it’s linked to memory2. Through such work, researchers could better explore memory and learning more generally, and perhaps find ways to enhance both.\n\n“We are at this extremely exciting verge, where we can get closer to insight than we have ever come before,” says Becker.\n\nCapturing the flash\n\nWhereas analytical thinking involves using logic and reasoning to arrive at a solution in a step-by-step way, insight is a sudden realization that seems to pop into conscious awareness. These mental leaps can lead to a grand discovery or solution, or something more mundane — the answer to a daily word puzzle, for example.\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, cognitive psychologists wrestled with how to distinguish insight from analytical problem solving. Although consensus was growing that insight was distinct, not everyone agreed. Cognitive psychologist Robert Weisberg at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has argued, for example, that insight might not be as different from analytical thinking as it seems. He has suggested that insight, too, comes from the brain gradually building on what it already knows — incorporating new information with each failed attempt. For him, the main feature of insight is the emotion that someone feels after finding an answer or creating something that seems new.\n\n“It’s true that we get aha! experiences,” says Weisberg. “But that doesn’t mean the underlying process is different. It just means the outcome knocks your socks off.”\n\nCognitive neuroscientist John Kounios, who began studying insight in the 1990s at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, has a different view. For him, insight isn’t about adding up knowledge to arrive at an answer. Instead, it’s when a person spontaneously forms new knowledge. Sometimes, says Kounios, now at Drexel University in Philadelphia, “it’s the solution to a problem they didn’t even know they had”.\n\nMost early insight research was based on self-reports alone. Kounios decided to bring a different type of data into the field. In the early 2000s, he began using technologies including fMRI and electroencephalogram (EEG) — which captures electrical activity — to look for a distinct signature of insight in the brain. “We were prepared to be proven wrong,” he says.\n\nIn the laboratory, he and cognitive neuroscientist Mark Beeman at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, used what are known as remote associate problems to trigger aha! moments. Participants were tasked with finding a word that connects three seemingly unconnected ones, such as ‘home’, ‘sea’ and ‘bed’. (The answer is ‘sick’.) After each attempt, they reported whether the solution came with an aha! feeling. If so, they rated the strength of the feeling. Kounios and Beeman used fMRI scans and EEGs to monitor participants’ brains as they solved the puzzles.\n\nIn their early experiments3, Kounios, Beeman and their colleagues found that insight was accompanied by a burst of activity and blood-flow changes in the right side of the brain, in a region called the right superior temporal gyrus, which is associated with learning, memory and language processing. This activity occurred just 300 milliseconds before participants pressed a button to report being consciously aware of the answer. Kounios and Beeman had detected an aha! signal in the brain.\n\nThe consciousness wars: can scientists ever agree on how the mind works?\n\nThe pair also found that neural activation linked to insight is more sudden and localized than that for analytical problem-solving, supporting the notion that insight is an abrupt realization of knowledge rather than a gradual accumulation.\n\nFurther studies have shown that insight consistently includes a burst of high-frequency gamma waves that can involve different areas of the brain. Another common region of activity is the anterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in attention, emotion and decision-making.\n\nKounios, Beeman and others have done “really rigorous research” to demonstrate how insight is grounded in brain activity, says cognitive psychologist Daniel Schacter at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, adding that such work will improve our understanding of other forms of creative cognition.\n\nIn 2020, cognitive neuroscientist Carola Salvi at John Cabot University in Rome reported another line of evidence supporting the idea that insight and analytical problem-solving are distinct processes. In an experiment with 38 participants, Salvi discovered that people’s pupils rapidly dilated about 500 milliseconds before they reported having an insight — signalling a shift in awareness4. When participants solved problems analytically, their eyes instead made tiny, rapid movements known as microsaccades.\n\nEarly cognitive psychologists who described insight as a distinct process were onto something, says Salvi. “A hundred years later, we were finally able to say they were right,” she says.\n\nMemory follows insight\n\nSalvi thinks that pupil dilation reflects a shift in cognitive processing linked to activity in a brain network involved in regulating attention and arousal, which might also influence memory formation.\n\nA link to memory would make sense, Salvi says. Psychologists have observed that people tend to better remember moments of their lives marked by strong emotions. “That’s why you can remember a lot of details of events like your first date or your wedding,” says Salvi.\n\nFor the past decade, cognitive psychologist Amory Danek at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, has been studying whether such a memory boost also comes with the emotional experience of insight.\n\nShe decided to move away from the three-word puzzles that other researchers had been using. She suggests that these stimuli lack an element present in real-world aha! moments: an initial false representation that forced people to restructure the problem to solve it. “They were quite boring,” says Danek. “I was not satisfied with that.”\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nInstead, Danek decided to collaborate with a professional magician for her experiments. After showing study participants videos of a magician performing tricks, she asks the participants to attempt to work out how the tricks were done. Participants come up with a solution and report whether they arrived at it through insight. “Magicians put the observers in the wrong mental set before they do a trick,” says Danek. “Observers have to break free from this initial wrong problem representation in order to understand how it’s done.”\n\nDanek also thought magic tricks would elicit more intense emotions, which people easily recognize and can thus reliably report. She asks study participants reporting a solution to rate on a scale from 0 to 100 their feelings of suddenness, certainty and pleasure, for example.\n\nIn one experiment, participants tried to remember the solutions two weeks after watching the tricks5. Danek found that people who reported discovering how a magic trick was achieved through insight were better able to remember the solution than were those who didn’t experience insight. She calls this memory boost the “insight memory advantage”6.\n\nCognitive neuroscientist Roberto Cabeza at Duke University says that insight often comes with mental processes related to memory, such as semantic learning — when people find that solutions align well with what they already know — and emotional memory, which strengthens recall through emotional engagement.\n\nOther research hints that people are better at remembering unrelated, random information that they encounter around the time of aha! moments, as well as ‘d’oh!’ moments, when a solution is revealed and suddenly feels obvious7.",

Gender gaps in higher education and the workforce are in stark contrast to the lack of differences between boys and girls in mathematical ability during early childhood1. Understanding the origin of these gaps is a crucial step in reducing them, because it informs education-policy practitioners about when to intervene. Writing in Nature, Martinot et al.2 use data on some 2.6 million children aged 5–7 years in their first and second years of school in France to systematically document the emergence of the gender gap in maths. They reveal that it arises during, not before, the first year of school.",

It is influenced by social processes such as peer influence, group cohesion and strategic cooperation that shape the social dynamics of criminal behaviour. Studying co-offending helps to reveal how social interactions and relationships influence individuals’ decisions to engage in crime. Here we conducted a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis on two measures of co-offending, prevalence and group size, using data from 110 included studies from 17 countries. The pooled effect of the prevalence of co-offences was 0.29 (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.22–0.35) based on a total sample of 45,973,445 offences, and the pooled effect of the prevalence of co-offenders was 0.50 (95% CrI 0.43–0.56) based on a total sample of 3,459,133 offenders. On average, most of the offences were committed by two people with a pooled average group size of 2.73 (95% CrI 2.63–2.84). Property crimes had a higher prevalence of co-offences and co-offenders compared with violent crimes, while the average group size was larger for violent offences. Young offenders were more likely to engage in co-offending compared with adult offenders, and offences committed by youth usually involved larger groups. Furthermore, male offenders tended to form larger groups than females. No notable differences were observed between male and female co-offenders in terms of the prevalence of co-offenders. Variations in reported measures across studies pose challenges for cross-study comparison, highlighting the importance of standardized reporting.

          "abstract": "Previous research and theorizing have overwhelmingly focused on the psychological underpinnings of conspiracy beliefs. Here we examine what conspiracy beliefs imply for attitudes and behaviours relevant for the social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. We propose that conspiracy beliefs mostly contribute negatively to sustainability, either by reducing sustainable attitudes and behaviours or by justifying (and thereby reinforcing) people’s existing unsustainable attitudes and behaviours. Specifically, conspiracy beliefs are mostly associated with reduced public health and well-being, weakened social cohesion and deteriorated basic human rights (social sustainability); with lower support for reducing carbon emissions, investing in clean energy sources and preserving delicate ecosystems (environmental sustainability); and with reduced trust and cooperation, diminished support for technological innovation and increased harm to the international relationships necessary for fair trade (economic sustainability). However, most studies supporting these relationships were conducted in western democratic societies, underscoring a need for more cross-cultural research on these issues.",

We show that a deep neural network trained on this dataset predicts human choices with greater accuracy than leading theories of strategic behaviour, revealing systematic variation unexplained by existing models. By modifying this network, we develop an interpretable behavioural model that uncovers key insights: individuals’ abilities to respond optimally and reason about others’ actions are highly context dependent, influenced by the complexity of the game matrices.

Through relational neural control, we generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large numbers of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. This revealed a typical network-level configuration of representational relationships in which shared or unique representational content varied on the basis of cortical distance, categorical selectivity and position within the visual hierarchy. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent participants. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, trust in US public health and science institutions has faced unprecedented declines, particularly among Republicans/conservatives. To what extent might institutional criticism on social media be responsible for such politically polarized declines in institutional trust? Two online survey experiments (total N = 6,800), using samples roughly reflective of the US adult population, examined the effects of key types of criticism against the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results suggest that just a single exposure to any of the key types of criticism was sufficient to undermine institutional trust. While an institutional rebuttal was partially able to reverse these effects, residual declines in trust were substantial enough to cause decreased intentions to adhere to the AHRQ/CDC health recommendation featured in the experiments. While institutions should, therefore, be concerned about all types of social media criticism, those featuring morally charged trust-undermining narratives attacking the integrity of the AHRQ/CDC generated dramatically more anger (i.e., moral outrage), which in turn attracted social media engagement preferences likely to promote viral spread and exacerbate preexisting institutional politicization and issue polarization. These results suggest that efforts to bolster institutional trust should pay special attention to criticisms featuring integrity-based trust-undermining narratives.",

          "abstract": "Generative AI is poised to revolutionize how humans work, and has already demonstrated promise in significantly improving human productivity. A key question is how generative AI affects learning—namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. Learning is critical to long-term productivity, especially since generative AI is fallible and users must check its outputs. We study this question via a field experiment where we provide nearly a thousand high school math students with access to generative AI tutors. To understand the differential impact of tool design on learning, we deploy two generative AI tutors: one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (“GPT Base”) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (“GPT Tutor”). Consistent with prior work, our results show that having GPT-4 access while solving problems significantly improves performance (48% improvement in grades for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction in grades for GPT Base)—i.e., unfettered access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards in GPT Tutor. Without guardrails, students attempt to use GPT-4 as a “crutch” during practice problem sessions, and subsequently perform worse on their own. Thus, decision-makers must be cautious about design choices underlying generative AI deployments to preserve skill learning and long-term productivity.",

Although human interactions involve complex contact networks, current explorations are limited to static networks, where social ties are permanent and do not change over time. In reality, human activities often involve temporal interactions, where links are impermanent, and understanding the evolution of cooperation on such temporal networks is an open problem. Here, we systematically analyze how cooperation spreads on arbitrary temporal networks, and we distill our results down to a concise condition, which integrates evolutionary game dynamics with both static and temporal interactions. We find that the emergence of cooperation is facilitated by a simple rule of thumb: Hubs (individuals with many social ties) should be temporally deprioritized in interactions. For empirical applications, we further provide a quantitative metric capturing the priority of hubs, which is validated on empirical datasets based on its effectiveness in orchestrating the ordering of interactions to best promote cooperation. Our findings unveil the fundamental advantages conferred by temporal interactions for promoting collective cooperation, transcending the specific insights gleaned from studying static networks.",

However, this mechanism requires a population to agree on who has good standing and who has bad standing. Consensus can be provided by a central institution that monitors and broadcasts reputations. But how might such an institution be maintained, and how can a population ensure that it is effective and incorruptible? Here, we explore a simple mechanism to sustain an institution for judging reputations: a tax collected from each member of the population. We analyze the possible tax rate that individuals will rationally pay to sustain an institution of judgment, which provides a public good in the form of information, and we derive necessary conditions for individuals to resist the temptation to evade their tax payment. We also consider the possibility that institution members may be corrupt and subject to bribery, and we analyze how strong the incentives against corruption need to be. Our analysis has implications for establishing robust public institutions that provide social information to support cooperation in large populations—and the potential negative consequences associated with wealth or income inequality.",

          "abstract": "The Late Paleozoic Ice Age (~340 to 260 Ma) occurred under peak atmospheric O 2 (1.2 to 1.7 PIAL, pre-industrial atmospheric levels) for Earth history and CO 2 concentrations comparable to those of the preindustrial to that anticipated for our near future. The evolution of the marine redox landscape under these conditions remains largely unexplored, reflecting that oceanic anoxia has long been considered characteristic of carbon cycle perturbation during greenhouse times. Despite elevated O 2 , a 10 5 -y period of CO 2 -forced oceanic anoxia was recently identified, but whether this short-term interval of widespread oceanic anoxia was anomalous during this paleo-ice age is unexplored. Here, we investigate these issues by building a high-resolution record of carbonate uranium isotopes (δ 238 U carb ) from an open-marine succession in South China that permits us to reconstruct the global marine redox evolution through the deep glacial interval (310 to 290 Ma) of near peak O 2 . Our data reveal repeated, short-term decreases in δ 238 U carb coincident with negative C isotopic excursions and rises in paleo-CO 2 , all superimposed on a longer-term rise in δ 238 U carb . A carbon–phosphorus–uranium biogeochemical model coupled with Bayesian inversion is employed to quantitatively explore the interplay between marine anoxia, carbon cycling, and climate evolution during this paleo-glacial period. Although our results indicate that protracted, enhanced organic carbon burial can account for the long-term O 2 increase, seafloor oxygenation, and overall low CO 2 , episodic pulses of C emissions had the potential to drive recurring short-term periods of marine anoxia (with 4 to 12% of seafloor anoxia) despite up to 1.7 times higher atmospheric O 2 than present day.",

          "abstract": "The contact between two rough surfaces has been a topic of significant interest since early studies on Coulombic friction and remains crucial for numerous technological applications. However, theoretical progress has outpaced experiments due to the challenges in measuring contact areas across scales ranging from subnanometers to macroscopic dimensions. Here, we demonstrate the use of commonly available infrared-based (IR) spectroscopy in combination with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical simulations to measure separation gaps and contact areas for glassy polymers ranging in roughness over two orders in magnitude. With the combined IR and FDTD simulations, we can overcome the optical diffraction limits and take advantage of the chemical specificity of IR spectroscopy to overcome limitations due to scattering. The scaling of the contact area ratio as a function of pressure illustrated the limitations of using pure elastic or plastic deformation in explaining the results. At both low and high pressures, the contact area ratios scale linearly with pressure as expected for purely elastic deformations at low pressures or plastic deformations at high pressures. However, if analyzed over a broad range of pressure, the power laws we observe are much larger than 1, exemplifying the need to consider elastoplastic models in explaining results for softer polymer contacts compared to other brittle, glassy materials. In comparison, the separation gaps scale exponentially with pressure, as expected. These results have important implications for the interpretation of properties such as friction, adhesion, and conductivity for softer, glassy contact interfaces.",

          "abstract": "Regulation of proteome homeostasis is crucial for the survival and adaptation to changing environments for all species. In eukaryotes, this process is finely tuned through regulation at the level of transcription, translation, protein modification, and protein degradation. The phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAA) is present in all eukaryotes and believed to be a key player in ubiquitin-dependent protein sorting and degradation via its interactions with ubiquitin and/or the AAA+ ATPase, valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97). PLAA’s molecular targets and interaction network remain unclear. We used Caenorhabditis elegans and unbiased proteome-scale approaches to investigate neuronal specific interactors of the C. elegans PLAA ortholog UFD-3 (ubiquitin fusion degradation 3), its effect on ubiquitinated proteins, and global protein expression changes in an ufd-3 mutant. We found that PLAA may play a unique role in cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) processing bodies (P-bodies). Using biochemical analysis in vitro and fluorescence imaging in C. elegans , we show that UFD-3 directly interacts with the mRNA decapping complex regulatory subunit DCAP-1. UFD-3's intrinsic disordered region (IDR), which contains conserved amino acid motifs, is important for the recruitment of DCAP-1 to P-bodies. Finally, we show that loss of the IDR does not affect UFD-3's role in sorting ubiquitinated proteins through the multivesicular body pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that UFD-3's role in P-bodies is distinct from its role in the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway and the IDR is only critical for UFD-3-regulated P-bodies pathways. Thus, PLAA/UFD-3 might regulate the proteome via two distinct pathways: ubiquitinated protein turnover, as well as mRNA regulation through P-bodies.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by Nature, we present a polypeptide-based organic redox-active material constructed from renewable feedstocks, L-glutamic acid (an amino acid) and riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ), to address challenges with start-to-end-of-life management in energy storage systems (ESSs). The amino acid was utilized to establish a degradable polymer backbone, along which many copies of riboflavin were incorporated to serve as the redox-active pendant groups that enabled energy storage. The overall synthesis involved the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of an l -glutamic acid-derived N- carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomer, followed by side chain activation with azides and, finally, click coupling to achieve installation of alkyne-functionalized riboflavin moieties. The steric bulkiness and rich chemical functionality of riboflavin resulted in synthetic complexities that required reaction optimization to achieve the desired polymer structure. Electrochemical characterization of the resultant riboflavin polypeptide, in organic electrolyte, showed quasireversible redox activity with a half-wave potential (E 1/2 ) of ca. −1.10 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc + ). Cell viability assays revealed biocompatibility, as indicated by negligible cytotoxicity for fibroblast cells. The polypeptide design, consisting of labile amide backbone linkages and side-chain ester functionalities that tethered the riboflavin units to the backbone, enabled hydrolytic degradation to recover building blocks for future upcycling or recycling.

          "abstract": "Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is an important model for the study of pathogenesis in lentiviruses. Studies of viral genome organization and replication mechanisms are fundamental to the understanding of virus pathogenicity. In this study, we identified an unique transcript from EIAV in vivo and in vitro by Sanger sequencing and Northern blotting. The transcript contains a complete open reading frame and has length 369 nt. We named the protein encoded by this transcript S4 and demonstrated its expression in EIAV-infected cells. An S4-deficient EIAV infectious clone displayed obviously impaired virion release and attenuated virus replication in vitro, demonstrating that S4 plays a role in the release step of EIAV. The host restriction factor tetherin has broad-spectrum antiviral activity and prevents the release of a wide range of enveloped viruses, including lentiviruses. Here, we demonstrated that S4 enhances the release of the EIAV-like particle by counteracting the equine tetherin (eqTHN). S4 interacts with the eqTHN and sequesters it within intracellular membrane compartments, attenuating eqTHN expression on the cell surface and thereby disrupting its antiviral activity. Further investigation revealed that S4 retains eqTHN in the endoplasmic reticulum and trans-Golgi network through impacting its anterograde transport to the cell surface and may interfere with the posttranslational modification of this membrane protein. Collectively, our findings uncover an accessory protein, S4, of EIAV and reveal its ability to promote virion release by antagonizing the antiviral activity of the host restriction factor tetherin.",

          "abstract": "Hydrocephalus, a neurological condition characterized by an excessive buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, affects millions worldwide and leads to severe consequences. Current treatments, such as ventriculoperitoneal shunts, divert excess CSF from the brain but often face complications, mainly due to shunt obstructions caused by biological matter accumulation. While previous shunt designs aimed to improve fluid flow and reduce occlusion, they often lacked the precision needed for real-world applications due to simplified simulation models that did not fully capture the dynamics of the cerebral ventricular system. Here, we introduce BrainFlow, a computational model that integrates detailed anatomical and physiological features to simulate CSF dynamics in the presence of shunt implants. BrainFlow incorporates patient-specific medical imaging data, pulsatile flow to mimic cardiac cycles, adjustable parameters for various hydrocephalus conditions, and a biomolecule tracking feature to evaluate the long-term risk of shunt occlusion due to flow-mediated biomolecular transport. This model provides a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to shunt obstruction, offering insights into optimal shunt placement, design, and materials choice. Through validation against four-dimensional MRI flow data, BrainFlow demonstrates robust accuracy across multiple flow metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for the development of next-generation shunts tailored to individual patient anatomy and pathology, ultimately aiming to improve hydrocephalus treatment through informed, patient-specific design strategies.",

In humans, testis development begins in embryonic life in the first trimester, with considerable effort focused on the cell and developmental events associated with testis cell specification, leaving limited knowledge on testicular organogenesis during the second and third trimesters. To fill this knowledge gap, we evaluated testicular cell maturation at weeks 5 (W5), W6, W8, W15, and W19 postconception using a rhesus macaque model. Our data identify a major transcriptional change in the somatic cells of the testis (Sertoli cells, interstitial cells and fetal Leydig cells) between W8 and W15, and this is associated with the maturation of seminiferous cords and maturation of PGCs into fetal spermatogonia. Through this work, we identified cellular changes and differential protein expression between W5 and W19 that can be used to holistically define testis development across the time course of embryonic and fetal life.

In cyanobacteria, single RRM domain proteins are involved in mRNA targeting to the thylakoid membrane and acclimation to certain stress conditions, but many details of their physiological functions and molecular targets have remained unknown. The model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has a family of three genes encoding the RRM domain–containing proteins Rbp1, Rbp2, and Rbp3. Here, we verified the RNA-binding activity of Rbp3 in vivo and show that cells of a Δ rbp3 deletion strain had a lower photosystem (PS) I:PSII ratio and decreased pigment content and were significantly smaller than wild-type cells. To identify the set of interacting molecules, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed with a strain expressing a C-terminally FLAG-tagged Rbp3. Mass spectrometry of the elution fraction suggested physical proximity between Rbp3, ribosomes, and a very small number of other proteins. The most highly enriched transcript in the coeluting RNA fraction was the psaAB mRNA. This was corroborated by fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses showing decreased psaA mRNA signals in Δ rbp3 , and colocalization with Rbp3 fusions to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the wild type. Other mRNAs coenriched with Rbp3 encode thylakoid, plasma membrane, and carboxysome proteins. Binding assays using Bio-layer Interferometry validated the Rbp3- psaAB mRNA interaction, indicating a preference for folded RNA segments near or overlapping the respective stop codons.",

The region is warming at a rate twice the global average, yet the evolutionary dynamics of its unique biota are poorly understood. Here, we used the endemic land plant genera of the QTP to investigate how its floristic endemism was shaped over time by Cenozoic geoclimatic changes. We first clarified that the QTP hosts 82 endemic land plant genera; we found that the origins of these endemic genera were most likely driven by ecological niche and elevation differentiation, caused by the uplift of the QTP and associated climate change. By sampling 37 land plant clades that together encompass 1,740 species, covering all 82 endemic genera, we show that QTP floristic endemism had emerged by the Early Eocene. Furthermore, the unique biodiversity of the QTP comprises a mix of indigenous elements and immigrants. Among the three subregions of the QTP (Plateau Platform, Himalaya, and the Hengduan Mountains), the processes associated with floristic endemism are asynchronous, reflecting different geoclimatic events with the Miocene as a particularly critical period. The relative contributions of in situ speciation and immigration to the unique biodiversity of the three subregions are also markedly different; in situ speciation dominated in the Hengduan Mountains, which hosts the oldest endemic components of the flora and has served as an important “pump” and “sink” of unique biodiversity. These findings provide insights into how past geoclimatic events may have shaped floristic endemism on the QTP and also have important conservation implications.",

          "abstract": "Freshwater resources are fundamental to supporting humanity, and measures of water scarcity have been critical for identifying where water requirements and water availability are imbalanced. Existing water scarcity metrics typically account for blue water withdrawals (i.e., from surface-/groundwater), while the contribution of green water (i.e., soil moisture) and water quality—dimensions with important implications for multiple societal sectors—to water scarcity remains unclear. Here, we introduce the concept of multidimensional water scarcity that explicitly assesses all three of these dimensions of water scarcity and evaluates their individual and combined effects. We find that 22 to 26% of the global land area and 58 to 64% of the global population are exposed to some form of water scarcity annually, with multidimensional (i.e., blue, green, and quality) water scarcity particularly high in India, China, and Pakistan. Examining seasonal water scarcity, we estimate that 5.9 billion people (or 80% of the world’s population in 2015) were exposed to at least one dimension of water scarcity for at least 1 mo per year and that 1-in-10 people (10%) were exposed to multidimensional water scarcity at least 1 mo per year. Our findings demonstrate that the challenges of water scarcity are far more widespread than previously understood. As such, our assessment provides a more holistic view of global water scarcity issues and points to overlooked scarcity where action needs to bring human pressure on freshwater resources into balance with water quantity and quality.",

In this study, we observed a continuous LLPT with an inversion of electronegativity in a K–Rb binary alloy. This uniquely exhibits a three-state system behavior. The transition, induced by pressure-driven reordering of electronic orbital energies, progresses through a sequence from s -metal to electride to d -metal, accompanied by a valence reversal: Potassium transitions from a negative to a positive valence, while rubidium undergoes the opposite shift. This process is marked by two successive anomalies in the alloy’s optical, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties over a broad pressure range. The observation of similar LLPT phenomena in other alkali and alkaline earth metal liquids suggests that this three-state system mechanism may provide broader insights into the nature of continuous phase transitions.",

This field is sufficiently strong to ionize water and produce the H 4 O 2 + cation, a hydroxyl radical adduct with a hydronium ion. We further demonstrate that this electric field can drive a variety of electron transfer reactions.

The ability of populations to evolve and adapt to environmental changes depends on rates of mutational diversification and the distribution of fitness effects of random mutations. In turn, the distribution of fitness effects of stochastic mutations can be expected to depend on the adaptive state of a population. To systematically study the impact of the interplay between the adaptive state of a population on the ability of asexual populations to adapt, we used a spatial agent-based model of a neoplastic population adapting to a selection pressure of continuous exposure to targeted therapy. We found favorable mutations were overrepresented at the extinction bottleneck but depleted at the adaptive peak. The model-based predictions were tested using an experimental cancer model of an evolution of resistance to a targeted therapy. Consistent with the model’s prediction, we found that enhancement of the mutation rate was highly beneficial under therapy but moderately detrimental under the baseline conditions. Our results highlight the importance of considering population fitness in evaluating the fitness distribution of random mutations and support the potential therapeutic utility of restricting mutational variability.",

Accumulating evidence from patients with PIK3CA -related disorders indicates that peripheral nerves are frequently affected, leading to severe neurological symptoms. However, the exact underlying mechanism of these disorders remains unclear. To address this, we developed a mouse model with a PIK3CA gain-of-function mutation specifically in Schwann cells, which successfully mirrored the clinical features observed in patients. In this model, we observed that PIK3CA -mutated cells communicate with neighboring healthy cells, such as adipocytes and hair follicles, through a unique crosstalk mechanism that triggers their growth, proliferation, and anagen phase expansion. Additionally, we demonstrated that PIK3CA mutation in peripheral nerves leads to a metabolic shift through glycolytic activation. We investigated the effects of alpelisib, an approved pharmacological inhibitor of PIK3CA, in the model. Early administration of alpelisib significantly improved the signs and symptoms in the mice. However, when treatment was delayed, its efficacy was diminished due to the drug’s inability to penetrate the myelin sheath effectively. In summary, our study offers a valuable mouse model for studying PIK3CA -related neuropathy, uncovers a unique communication between healthy and affected tissues, and highlights the potential benefits of early pharmacological intervention using alpelisib.",

The steroidogenic enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (3βHSD1) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target and the corresponding inhibitors, biochanin-A (BCA) and its derivatives, suppress tumor growth in preclinical models and patients. However, the poor oral bioavailability of BCA hinders its clinical application. Here, we employed a sophisticated computational approach to refine the structural design of 3βHSD1 inhibitors. AlphaFold2 was utilized to construct detailed models of 3βHSD1 binding to various substrates. These models, in conjunction with the elucidated enzymatic mechanism of 3βHSD1, guided the optimization of a series of BCA-related compounds. Our structure–activity relationship studies identified HEAL-116 as a potent 3βHSD1 inhibitor. HEAL-116 exhibited enhanced binding specificity to the substrate-binding pocket of 3βHSD1 and effectively neutralized the local charge environment. The incorporation of hydrophilic groups in its structure also markedly enhanced its oral bioavailability. HEAL-116 robustly inhibited 3βHSD1 activity and exerted pronounced antitumor effect in biochemical, cellular, and mouse models. Our findings lay the foundation for the clinical translation of 3βHSD1 inhibitors, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of prostate cancer and potentially other diseases.",

We also demonstrate that extracellular vesicles (TvEVs) produced by the parasite downregulate host cell IFNε, counteracting this symbiont-driven response and elevating infection. We further demonstrate that IFNε, a hormonally regulated cytokine produced in the human reproductive system, is protective against T. vaginalis cytoadherence and cytolysis of host cells.

The AsDMS structure exhibits a didomain architecture consisting of a terpene cyclase β domain and a haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphatase domain, with two distinct active sites located on opposite sides of the protein. Mechanistic studies show that dephosphorylation of the drimenyl diphosphate intermediate proceeds through stepwise hydrolysis such that two equivalents of inorganic phosphate rather than inorganic pyrophosphate are coproducts of the reaction sequence. When the AsDMS reaction is performed in H 2 18 O, 18 O is not incorporated into drimenol, indicating that the hydroxyl oxygen of drimenol originates from the prenyl oxygen of FPP rather than a water molecule from bulk solution. These results correct a mechanistic proposal previously advanced by another group. Surprisingly, AsDMS exhibits substrate promiscuity, catalyzing the conversion of the slowly reactive substrate mimic farnesyl- S -thiolodiphosphate into cyclic and linear sesquiterpene products. Structural and mechanistic insights gained from AsDMS illustrate the functional diversity of terpene biosynthetic enzymes and provide a foundation for engineering “designer cyclase” assemblies capable of generating a wide variety of terpenoid products.",

However, current D-peptide discovery methods are severely limited by specific size, structure, and the chemical synthesizability of their protein targets. Here, we describe a computational method for de novo design of D-peptides that bind to an epitope of interest on the target protein using Rosetta’s hotspot-centric approach. The approach comprises identifying hotspot sidechains in a functional protein–protein interaction and grafting these side chains onto much smaller structured peptide scaffolds of opposite chirality. The approach enables more facile design of D-peptides and its applicability is demonstrated by design of D-peptidic binders of influenza A virus hemagglutinin, resulting in identification of multiple D-peptide lead series. The X-ray structure of one of the leads at 2.38 Å resolution verifies the validity of the approach. This method should be generally applicable to targets with detailed structural information, independent of molecular size, and accelerate development of stable, peptide-based therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic homeostasis is essential for survival; however, many studies have focused on the fluctuations of these factors. Furthermore, while metabolic homeostasis depends on the balance between the production and consumption of metabolites, there have been limited investigations into the mechanisms regulating their consumption. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism has diverse functions, including methylation, polyamine biosynthesis, and transsulfuration, making its regulation and control crucial. Recent studies have revealed the feedback regulation of SAM production; however, the mechanisms governing its consumption are still poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the stability of SAM levels in the fat body (FB) of Drosophila , which serves as a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver and adipose tissue, under conditions of SAM shortage, including nutrient deprivation. We found that glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt), a major SAM-consuming methyltransferase in the FB, decreased via the nuclear ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS), along with the inhibition of SAM synthesis and starvation. The inhibition of Gnmt level reduction by suppression of the nuclear UPS causes starvation tolerance. Thus, the regulation of Gnmt levels through nuclear UPS-mediated reduction helps maintain SAM levels under SAM shortage conditions.",

The structural features that distinguish Cyclin F as a ligase adaptor and the mechanisms underlying its selective substrate recruitment over Cyclin A, which functions in complex with CDK2 at a similar time in the cell cycle, remain largely unexplored. We utilized single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to elucidate the structure of a Cyclin F–Skp1 complex bound to an E2F1 peptide. The structure and biochemical analysis reveal important differences in the substrate-binding site of Cyclin F compared to Cyclin A. Our findings expand on the canonical cyclin-binding motif (Cy or RxL) and highlight the importance of electrostatics at the E2F1 binding interface, which varies between Cyclin F and Cyclin A.

In 2020, newly hatched Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) fry in California’s Central Valley (CCV) hatcheries swam in corkscrew patterns and died at unusually high rates due to a lack of this essential vitamin. We subsequently investigated the impacts and causes of thiamine deficiency in California’s anadromous salmonids. Our laboratory studies defined the relationship between thiamine concentrations in Chinook salmon eggs and early life-stage survival in offspring; we used these data to develop a model that estimated 26 to 48% thiamine-dependent fry mortality across consecutive years (2020–2021) for winter-run Chinook salmon. We established an egg surveillance effort that found widespread thiamine deficiency in CCV Chinook salmon in 2020 and 2021, and emerging thiamine deficiency in Klamath River and Trinity River coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ) in 2021. We determined that thiamine injections into adults raised egg thiamine concentrations above levels found to impact early life-stage survival and swimming behavior. Ocean surveys, prey nutrition, salmon gut contents, and stable isotope data link thiamine deficiency to an ocean diet dominated by a booming population of northern anchovy ( Engraulis mordax ). This forage fish had low thiamine, high lipid, and high thiaminase activity levels consistent with both a thiaminase and oxidative stress hypothesis for causing thiamine deficiency in California salmon. Our research suggests California’s already stressed anadromous salmonids will continue to be impacted by thiamine deficiency as long as their ocean forage base and diet are dominated by northern anchovy.",

          "abstract": "The outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by diderm bacteria have important roles in cell envelope homeostasis, secretion, interbacterial communication, and pathogenesis. The facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STm) activates OMV biogenesis inside the acidic vacuoles of host cells by upregulating the expression of the OM protein PagC, one of the most robustly activated genes in a host environment. Here, we used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy (EM), with native bacterial OMVs, to demonstrate that three histidines, essential for the OMV biogenic function of PagC, constitute a key pH-sensing motif. The NMR spectra of PagC in OMVs show that they become protonated around pH 6, and His protonation is associated with specific perturbations of select regions of PagC. The use of bacterial OMVs is a key aspect of this work enabling NMR structural studies in the context of the physiological environment. PagC expression upregulates OMV production in Escherichia coli , replicating its function in STm. Moreover, the presence of PagC drives a striking aggregation of OMVs and increases bacterial cell pellicle formation at acidic pH, pointing to a potential role as an adhesin active in biofilm formation. The data provide experimental evidence for a pH-dependent mechanism of OMV biogenesis and aggregation driven by an OM protein.",

Here, we found that beyond the regulation of mRNA transcript abundance, light regulates alternative splicing (AS) in the filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans , Trichoderma guizhouense, and Neurospora crassa . Blue light-regulated AS was involved in ergothioneine biosynthesis and conidiation in T. guizhouense , which required the blue light receptor BLR1. Blue light activated the MAPK HOG (Sak) pathway which then transmitted the signal via the serine/threonine kinase SRK1 to the AS key regulator SRP1. SRK1 and SRP1 are important for light-induced conidiation. The light-activated HOG pathway led to an increase of the SRK1 protein level and its phosphorylation status. Phosphorylated SRK1 translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to interact with SRP1, thereby regulating AS efficiency. This study unravels another level of complexity of fungal environmental sensing and responses and also first describes the entire cascade from an environmental signal to the splicing machinery.",

Here, we present a global kinetic model to describe lipid-induced amyloid aggregation of α -synuclein. Using this framework, we find that α -synuclein fibrils form via a two-step primary nucleation mechanism and that lipid molecules are directly involved in both the nucleation and fibril elongation steps, giving rise to lipid–protein coaggregates. To illustrate the applicability of this kinetic approach to drug discovery, we identify the mechanism of action of squalamine, a known inhibitor of lipid-induced α -synuclein aggregation, revealing that this small molecule reduces the rate of lipid-dependent primary nucleation.

This transmission mode ensures that symbiont-conferred effects, both beneficial and negative, are passed onto offspring. Here, we report an extreme example of symbiont-mediated temperature sensitivity imposed by a vertically transmitted, defensive symbiont. Pea aphids infected with the bacterial endosymbiont, Fukatsuia symbiotica, resist infection by fungal pathogens but produce few or no offspring when moved from cool (15 °C) to mildly warmer temperatures (20 °C). This temperature-dependent reduction in host fitness is associated with increased symbiont abundance, disordered symbiont localization, and high expression of a horizontally acquired nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) locus. This NRPS operon is syntenic with the locus responsible for the production of Herbicolin A, a known antifungal produced by some plant-associated Erwiniaceae . Activity of chemical extracts from infected aphids is predictive of in vivo protection against entomopathogenic fungi, indicating that an Herbicolin A–like molecule is the likely source of Fukatsuia’s protective effects against fungal pathogens. Injection of the same chemical extracts into naive aphids partially recapitulates developmental defects observed in natural infections at 20 °C, suggesting that increased levels of this compound contribute to disrupted embryonic development. Finally, the purification of the causal agent revealed Fukatsuia produces a compound similar but not identical to Herbicolin A, that exhibits both antifungal and hemolytic activity. These results suggest that F. symbiotica infection imposes a trade-off between antifungal defense and disrupted embryonic development, mediated by a single genetic locus.",

          "abstract": "There is overwhelming evidence that forest trees are locally adapted to climate. Thus, genecological models based on population phenotypes have been used to measure local adaptation, infer genetic maladaptation to climate, and guide assisted migration. However, instead of phenotypes, there is increasing interest in using genomic data for gene resource management. We used whole-genome resequencing and common-garden experiments to understand the genetic architecture of adaptive traits in black cottonwood. We studied the potential of using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic prediction to detect causal loci, identify climate-adapted phenotypes, and inform gene resource management. We analyzed population structure by partitioning phenotypic and genomic (single-nucleotide polymorphism) variation among 840 genotypes collected from 91 stands along 16 rivers. Most phenotypic variation (60 to 81%) occurred among populations and was strongly associated with climate. Population phenotypes were predicted well using genomic data (e.g., predictive ability r &gt; 0.9) but almost as well using climate or geography ( r &gt; 0.8). In contrast, genomic prediction within populations was poor ( r &lt; 0.2). We identified many GWAS associations among populations, but most appeared to be spurious based on pooled within-population analyses. Hierarchical partitioning of linkage disequilibrium and haplotype sharing suggested that within-population genomic prediction and GWAS were poor because allele frequencies of causal loci and linked markers differed among populations. Given the urgent need to conserve natural populations and ecosystems, our results suggest that climate variables alone can be used to predict population phenotypes, delineate seed zones and deployment zones, and guide assisted migration.",

While being more susceptible to extinction and as such potentially targeted for conservation interventions such as genetic rescue, small-island populations can experience relatively less anthropogenic habitat degradation than those on larger islands. Here, we determine the consequences and conservation implications of long-term isolation and recent human activities on genetic diversity of island populations of two forest-dependent mammals endemic to the Wallacea archipelago: the anoa ( Bubalus spp.) and babirusa ( Babyrousa spp.). Using genomic analyses and habitat suitability models, we show that, compared to closely related species, populations on mainland Sulawesi exhibit low heterozygosity, high inbreeding, a high proportion of deleterious alleles, and experience a high rate of anthropogenic disturbance. In contrast, populations on smaller islands occupy higher-quality habitats, possess fewer deleterious mutations despite exhibiting lower heterozygosity and higher inbreeding. Site frequency spectra indicate that these patterns reflect stronger, long-term purging in smaller-island populations. Our results thus suggest that conservation efforts should focus on protecting small-island high-quality habitats and avoiding translocations from mainland populations. This study highlights the crucial role of small offshore islands for the long-term survival of Wallacea’s iconic and indigenous mammals in the face of development on the mainland.",

          "abstract": "Antagonistic interactions are critical determinants of microbial community stability and composition, offering host benefits such as pathogen protection and providing avenues for antimicrobial control. While the ability to eliminate competitors confers an advantage to antagonistic microbes, it often incurs a fitness cost. Consequently, many microbes only produce toxins or engage in antagonistic behavior in response to specific cues like quorum sensing molecules or environmental stress. In laboratory settings, antagonistic microbes typically dominate over sensitive ones, raising the question of why both antagonistic and nonantagonistic microbes are found in natural environments and host microbiomes. Here, using both theoretical models and experiments with killer strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we show that “boom-and-bust” dynamics—periods of rapid growth punctuated by episodic mortality events—caused by temporal environmental fluctuations can favor nonantagonistic microbes that do not incur the growth rate cost of toxin production. Additionally, using control theory, we derive bounds on the competitive performance and identify optimal regulatory toxin-production strategies in various boom-and-bust environments where population dilutions occur either deterministically or stochastically over time. Our mathematical investigation reveals that optimal toxin regulation is much more beneficial to killers in stochastic, rather than deterministic, boom-and-bust environments. Overall, our findings show how both antagonistic and nonantagonistic microbes can thrive under varying environmental conditions.",

Fibrosis also contributes to immune exclusion in tumor tissues. Targeting fibrosis might be a strategy for prolonging allograft survival while suppressing cancer development. Here, single-cell transcriptomes of human and mouse heart allografts showed that macrophages accumulated in grafts with fibrosis were reprogrammed via histone methylation regulated by Setdb1, an H3K9 methyltransferase. Myeloid-specific deletion of Setdb1 prolonged heart allograft survival but reversed immune exclusion in tumor tissues. Interestingly, myeloid-specific Setdb1-knockout led to lower fibrosis in heart allografts and tumor tissues in mice. Our single-cell sequencing data showed that Setdb1 ablation impaired Fn1 + and SPP1 + profibrogenic macrophage reprogramming. Mechanistically, Fn1, which was induced by the CCR2-Creb/Setdb1 axis, upregulated the expression of genes related to fibrosis in fibroblasts and macrophages via ITGA5 and PIRA receptors.

          "abstract": "Salt marshes provide valuable ecosystem services but are vulnerable to drowning with accelerated sea-level rise (SLR). Marsh belowground biomass (BGB) production helps avoid drowning by building marsh surface elevation. Reductions in BGB can serve as an early warning sign of marsh deterioration, as they often precede decreases in aboveground biomass (AGB). However, landscape-scale BGB assessments to predict broad trends in marsh deterioration have not been previously available. We applied the Belowground Ecosystem Resiliency Model (BERM) to assess standing stocks and trends in both BGB and AGB over the past decade (2014–2023) across US Georgia coast Spartina alterniflora marshes (691 km 2 ). Over this time period, BGB and AGB averaged 841 ± 323 and 221 ± 14 g m −2 , respectively, but showed opposite trends. BGB decreased on average by 0.94% per year and over most of the marsh area (72%), while AGB increased on average by 0.66% per year and showed a net increase across most of the marsh area (88%). This disconnect suggests that AGB is not a good indicator of marsh resilience, and we highlight two areas with similar AGB but different BGB. Inundation intensity, an important predictor of BGB, rose through time and was negatively related to BGB. SLR trends suggest continuing increases in inundation, which will result in further declines in BGB followed by widespread marsh drowning. Landscape BGB assessments are a valuable tool to identify ecosystem vulnerability and proactively manage salt marshes and the services they provide under rising sea levels.",

This populational approach allowed us to distinguish parental legacy of inherited variation from postpolyploidy evolution, and our analyses revealed that whereas gene fractionation occurred in an early burst, accumulation of transposable elements (TEs) and homoeologous exchanges has been gradual. Patterns of homoeolog expression bias are highly variable across tissues, with no consistent subgenome expression bias.

We utilized summary statistics for protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) of 2,004 plasma and 1,443 brain proteins, a genome-wide association study of MS susceptibility with 14,802 cases and 26,703 controls, both bulk and cell-type specific transcriptome data, and external pQTL data in blood and brain. Our integrative analysis included a proteome-wide association study to identify MS-associated proteins, followed by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to determine potential causal associations. We used the HEIDI test and Bayesian colocalization analysis to distinguish pleiotropy from linkage. Proteins passing all analyses were prioritized as potential drug targets. We further conducted pathway annotations and protein–protein interaction network analysis (PPI) and verified our findings at mRNA and protein levels. We tested hundreds of MS-associated proteins and confirmed 18 potential causal proteins (nine in plasma and nine in brain). Among these, we found 78 annotated pathways and 16 existing non-MS drugs targeting six proteins. We also identified intricateAQ PPIs among seven potential drug targets and 19 existing MS drug targets, as well as PPIs of four targets across plasma and brain. We identified two targets using bulk mRNA expression data and four targets expressed in MS-related cell types. We finally verified 10 targets using external pQTL data. We prioritized 18 potential drug targets in plasma and brain, elucidating the underlying pathology and providing evidence for potential drug discovery and repurposing in MS.",

Here, we report a pyrogenic carbon record of East Asian fire history over the past 300,000 y from the East China Sea. This record suggests a rapid increase in fire activity since approximately 50,000 y ago, indicating a decoupling from the monsoon climate, and this pattern is consistent with fire histories in Europe, Southeast Asia, and Papua New Guinea-Australia regions. By integrating extensive archaeological data, we propose that the intensified global expansion of modern human and population growth, coupled with the rising demand for fire use during cold glacial periods, resulted in a significant increase in fire utilization from 50,000 y onward. This suggests that a measurable human imprint on the carbon cycle via fire likely predates the Last Glacial Maximum.",

Androgenesis, a way for producing offspring solely from male genetic material, is limited in mammals, presumably due to barriers arising from genomic imprinting, an epigenetic mechanism leading to monoallelic gene expression. Here, we report adult mammalian offspring derived from the genetic material of two sperm cells. These mice, which we refer to as androgenetic mice, were produced via targeted DNA methylation editing of seven imprinting control regions (ICRs) through CRISPR-based epigenome engineering. Two sperm cells were injected into an enucleated oocyte to form putatively diploid embryos. Allele-specific epigenetic editing was achieved by injecting guide RNAs with protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences designed to match one allele but not the other. The birth of androgenetic mice that were able to develop to adulthood demonstrates that mammalian androgenesis is achievable by targeted epigenetic remodeling of a few defined ICRs.",

          "abstract": "Chloroplast division, a process tightly linked to the energy demands of plants, is initiated by the formation of the stromal filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring. The Z ring is highly dynamic, and its constriction provides the essential force for chloroplast division. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing Z-ring dynamics and constriction remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the chloroplast inner envelope membrane (IEM) protein ACCUMULATION AND REPLICATION OF CHLOROPLASTS6 (ARC6) interacts with the chloroplast stromal protein ARC3, and this interaction is negatively regulated by the conserved J-like domain of ARC6. ARC3 is found both distributed throughout the stroma and localized to a ring-like structure at the chloroplast division site. We demonstrate that ARC6 recruits ARC3 to the division site to form a ring-like structure, likely through direct interaction. This ARC6–ARC3 interaction enables ARC3 to bind FtsZs. Furthermore, we show that the ARC6–ARC3 complex significantly promotes the dynamics of chloroplast Z rings reconstituted in a heterologous system. Finally, the constriction of these reconstituted Z rings is markedly enhanced by ARC6–ARC3. Our findings reveal a regulatory mechanism that governs Z-ring dynamics and constriction, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying chloroplast division.",

Although HBZ protein is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the dynamics of HBZ protein localization and its contribution to oncogenesis have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular expression pattern of HBZ in primary HTLV-1–infected T cells from asymptomatic carriers and leukemic cells of ATL patients using the Proximity Ligation Assay. Nuclear localization of HBZ protein was significantly higher in fresh ATL cells than in HTLV-1–infected cells from carriers. Importantly, translocation of HBZ protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after TGF-β activation was observed in ATL patients, but not in HTLV-1 carriers. In ATL cells, the cellular transcription factors JunB and pSmad3 interact with HBZ and facilitate its nuclear translocation upon TGF-β stimulation. JUNB knockdown inhibits cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and promotes apoptosis in ATL cells but not in HTLV-1–infected nonleukemic cells, indicating that JunB has important roles in maintaining ATL cells. In conclusion, TGF-β-induced nuclear translocation of HBZ–JunB complexes is associated with ATL oncogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Tree species worldwide face increasing exposure to unprecedented macroclimatic conditions due to anthropogenic climate change, which may trigger biome shifts and ecosystem disruptions. We quantified climate change exposure–shifts to species’ currently unoccupied climate zones–for 32,089 tree species globally by 2100, assessing both species-level and local tree diversity risks. On average, 69% of species are predicted to experience macroclimatic shifts in at least 10% of their range, while 14% face exposure in over 50% of their range under a high-emission (4 °C warming) future scenario. This suggests that most species retain substantial climate refugia within their current range. However, local tree diversity exposure is predicted to be severe in vast regions, including Eurasia, the northwestern United States and Canada, northern Chile, and the Amazon Delta. Under a moderate (2 °C warming) scenario, high tree diversity exposure is mostly restricted to taiga regions in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings provide conservative estimates of climate-driven biodiversity risk, as our approach focuses solely on macroclimate and does not account for additional stressors such as land-use change or species interactions. Identifying tree species and areas of high macroclimatic shift exposure allows for targeted conservation strategies, including species stability monitoring, assisted migration, and the protection of climate refugia. Our results offer a foundation for prioritizing conservation actions in a rapidly changing climate, ensuring long-term ecosystem resilience.",

          "abstract": "Currently, catalytic recycling of polyethylene (PE) into high-value chemicals using solar energy often faces poor product selectivity and low efficiency. This is mainly due to the difficulty in effectively controlling the intermediates during PE photoreforming and the long-standing challenge of inefficient charge dynamics. Here, we present a solar-driven photothermal catalytic approach for the selective conversion of PE waste into propionic acid and hydrogen under ambient conditions. Atomically dispersed Ni sites supported on CeO 2 (Ni SA /CeO 2 ) achieve a propionic acid yield of 331 μmol h –1 with 94.8% selectivity in the photothermal reaction. This performance is 1.6 times higher than that of catalysts supported by Ni clusters (Ni NP /CeO 2 ). Additionally, Ni SA /CeO 2 exhibits a hydrogen yield of 0.23 mmol h –1 with stable long-term performance. Mechanistic studies reveal that single Ni atoms form linear coordination with oxygen atoms in CeO 2 , introducing unoccupied mid-gap states that effectively capture hot electrons and enhance the photothermal effect through local hotspot formation. In contrast, Ni clusters suffer from inefficient heat accumulation due to multistep phonon scattering. Furthermore, site isolation of Ni single atoms spatially separates the reaction intermediates and suppresses dimerization of the key intermediate COOHCH 2 CH 2 *, thereby greatly improving the selectivity for propionic acid. In contrast, closely packed Ni cluster sites promote intermediate coupling and the formation of undesirable byproducts, reducing selectivity. This work provides mechanistic insights into the advantages of atomic-scale catalyst design for selective chemical transformations.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the delayed interferon response. Interferons are typically produced upon host recognition of pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns, such as nucleic acids. While the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evades host recognition of its RNA are well studied, how it evades immune responses to cytosolic DNA—leaked from mitochondria or nuclei during infection—remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein directly suppresses DNA sensing by cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). Although primarily known for packaging the viral RNA genome, we uncover that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein also binds DNA with high affinity and competitively blocks cGAS activation. Using cell-free biochemical and biophysical approaches, including single-molecule optical tweezers, we show that the nucleocapsid protein binds to DNA at nanomolar concentrations and cocondenses with DNA at micromolar concentrations, thereby impeding stable cGAS-DNA interactions required for signal propagation. Hyperphosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein diminishes its competitive binding capacity. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in directly suppressing the cGAS-STING pathway, strongly suggesting that this contributes to the delayed interferon response during infection. This study raises the possibility that nucleocapsid proteins of other RNA viruses may also exhibit moonlighting functions by antagonizing host nucleic acid–sensing pathways.",

          "abstract": "Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) plays an important role in both the mouse and human prostate. The endogenous ligand for ERβ is the dihydrotestosterone metabolite, 5β-androstane-3β, 17β-diol (3β-Adiol). Thus, treatment with 5-α reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) should produce a phenotype similar to that seen in ERβ −/− mice. By comparing RNA-Seq of the ventral prostates (VP) of ERβ knockout mice (ERβ crispr−/− ) and wild-type (WT) mice, we confirmed that ERβ modulates androgen receptor (AR) signaling indirectly by suppressing AR coactivators. Compared to WT mice, basal cell genes from ERβ crispr−/− mouse VP were significantly upregulated. A population of abnormal basal cells coexpressing P63 and AR was identified in the ERβ crispr−/− mouse VP by immunohistochemistry. In men treated with 5-ARI for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), there was induction of a P63-positive intermediate cell population characterized by down regulation of Krt14 without significant change in the expression of Krt15, upregulation of AR and NKX3.1, and increased proliferation. In both VP of aging ERβ crispr−/− mice and in human prostates after 5-ARI treatment, there was substantial immune infiltration. Testosterone treatment inhibited immune infiltration in the VP of ERβ crispr−/− mice. We conclude that ERβ is a gene critical in maintaining normal basal cells and modulating immune environment in the prostate. Its loss leads to histological changes suggesting prostatitis and increases the number of intermediate cells, which are considered to be the cells of origin of prostate cancers. We suggest that an ERβ agonist could protect against 5-ARI-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and defects in the basal cell layer in BPH.",

Other ion channels, including Kv2.1 and Slo1, appear to form clusters through prominent intrinsically disordered sequences in the cytoplasm.

          "abstract": "The basal ganglia play a crucial role in action selection by facilitating desired movements and suppressing unwanted ones. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a key output nucleus, facilitates movement through disinhibition of the superior colliculus (SC). However, its role in action suppression, particularly in primates, remains less clear. We investigated whether individual SNr neurons in three male macaque monkeys bidirectionally modulate their activity to both facilitate and suppress actions and examined the role of glutamatergic inputs in suppression. Monkeys performed a sequential choice task, selecting or rejecting visually presented targets. Electrophysiological recordings showed that SNr neurons decreased firing rates during target selection and increased firing rates during rejection, demonstrating bidirectional modulation. Pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic inputs to the lateral SNr disrupted saccadic control and impaired suppression of reflexive saccades, providing causal evidence for the role of excitatory input in behavioral inhibition. These findings suggest that glutamatergic projections, potentially originating from sources including the subthalamic nucleus, contribute to the increased SNr activity during action suppression. Our results highlight conserved basal ganglia mechanisms across species and offer insights into the neural substrates of action selection and suppression in primates, with implications for understanding disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.",

          "abstract": "Recently, extensive evidence has demonstrated that the brain operates close to a critical state, characterized by dynamic patterns known as neuronal avalanches. The critical state, reflecting the delicate balance between neural excitation and inhibition, offers numerous advantages in information processing. However, the role of genetics in shaping brain criticality is not fully understood. Whether there is any shared genetic factor influencing the critical state and cognitive functions remains elusive. Here, we aimed to address these questions by examining the heritability of brain criticality and its relation to cognitive function by analyzing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in 250 monozygotic twins, 142 dizygotic twins, and 437 Not-twin subjects. We found that genetic factors substantially influenced brain criticality across various scales, encompassing brain regions, functional networks, and the whole brain. These genetic influences exhibited heterogeneity, with the criticality of the primary sensory cortex being more strongly influenced by genetic factors compared to that of the association cortex. Furthermore, we combined rs-fMRI data with transcriptional microarray data from the Allen Brain Atlas: Human Brain (ABHB) dataset and found that the organization of regional critical dynamics was highly explained by a specific gene expression profile. Finally, our results showed that the critical state was correlated with total cognition and had a genetic link with it. These findings provide empirical evidence that brain criticality is a biological phenotype and suggest a shared genetic foundation underlying brain criticality and cognitive functions. Our results pave the way toward revealing specific biological mechanisms contributing to critical dynamics and their associations with brain function and dysfunction.",

Previously, we have shown that signaling of ABA in the endodermis leads to protoxylem (PX) differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that ROPs suppress PX differentiation in the roots of both Arabidopsis and tomato. Fourier transform and Shannon’s entropy show that endodermal ABA signaling controls the periodicity and overall order of PX secondary cell wall (SCW) coils in an ROP-dependent manner. Correspondingly, in the PX, GFP-ROP11 is initially dispersed and gradually becomes distributed in an oscillatory fashion with a periodicity corresponding to that of the SCW coils. Oryzalin treatments disrupt the frequency and increase the entropy of the GFP-ROP11 signal, suggesting that microtubules delimit ROP distribution. Signaling of ABA in the endodermis encourages the enlargement of metaxylem SCW pits, while ABA signaling in the stele limits this enlargement. Pit size and density are decreased in ROP mutants while ABA enhances ROP11 expression in the stele and broadens its distribution in the endodermis. Taken together, non-cell-autonomous and cell-autonomous interactions between ABA and ROPs regulate xylem differentiation and SCW patterning.",

Metabolic reprogramming is a notable phenotype associated with the acquisition of drug resistance. Here, we develop a computational framework that predicts metabolic gene targets capable of reverting the metabolic state of drug-resistant cells to that of drug-sensitive parental cells, thereby sensitizing the resistant cells. The computational framework performs single-gene knockout simulation of genome-scale metabolic models that predicts genome-wide metabolic flux distribution in drug-resistant cells, and clusters the resulting knockout flux data using uniform manifold approximation and projection, followed by k -means clustering. From the clustering analysis, knockout genes that lead to the flux data near that of drug-sensitive cells are considered drug sensitization targets. This computational approach is demonstrated using doxorubicin- and paclitaxel-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells. Drug sensitization targets are further refined based on proteome and metabolome data, which generate GOT1 for doxorubicin-resistant MCF7, GPI for paclitaxel-resistant MCF7, and SLC1A5 as a common target. These targets are experimentally validated where treating drug-resistant cancer cells with small-molecule inhibitors results in increased sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to doxorubicin or paclitaxel. The applicability of the developed framework is further demonstrated using drug-resistant triple-negative breast cancer cells. Taken together, the computational framework predicts drug sensitization targets in an intuitive and cost-efficient manner and can be applied to overcome drug-resistant cells associated with various cancers and other metabolic diseases.",

          "abstract": "Cancer therapy would benefit from suppressing cancer cell motility in the process of metastasis. Such directed cell migration relies on the propulsive force established by the filamentous actin network within lamellipodia. Proteins of the Ena/VASP family and the WAVE regulatory complex orchestrate lamellar protrusions and therefore provide promising targets for pharmacological interventions. Here, we report a cross-talk between Ena/VASP proteins and WAVE2 that is important for cancer cell extravasation. Mutating the EVH1 domain recognition motif in WAVE2 abrogates chemotaxis of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and reduces their extravasation in a zebrafish model. In pilot experiments, orthotopic implantation of these cells into mice led to a reduction in macrometastasis, resulting in prolonged survival. Similarly, intervention by an Ena/VASP-EVH1 inhibitor also reduced metastasis in vivo. Our results suggest that pharmacological interference with the Ena/VASP–WAVE2 interaction may thus reduce metastasis.",

          "abstract": "Climate change pushes species toward higher latitudes and altitudes, but the proximate drivers of range expansions vary, and it is unclear whether evolution facilitates climate change–induced range changes. In a temporally replicated field experiment, we translocated wall brown butterflies ( Lasiommata megera ) descending from range interior and range margin populations to sites at 1) the range interior, 2) the range margin, and 3) beyond the current northern range edge. Thereby, we tested for local adaptation in seasonal timing and winter survival and evaluated to what extent local adaptation influences the ongoing, climate-driven range expansion. Almost all individuals from all populations entered diapause at an appropriate time, despite previously identified among-population variation in diapause induction thresholds. Caterpillars of northern descent, however, grew faster than those from southern populations at all field sites. This may be a countergradient adaptation to compensate for the short, northern growing seasons, but we found no evidence for prewinter body mass affecting winter survival. In fact, winter survival was low overall—extremely so at the beyond range site—regardless of population origin, indicating that the primary constraint to range expansion is an inability to adapt to winter conditions. Hence, although range-expanding wall browns show clear local evolution of two traits related to seasonal timing, these putative local adaptations likely do not contribute to range expansion, which is instead limited by winter survival. To predict future range changes, it will be important to distinguish between the traits that evolve during range expansion and those that set the range limit.",

Gain and loss of function experiments have indicated retinoic acid’s critical role in cochlear hair cell development. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we hypothesized that RA receptor alpha (RARA) has a dual role in cochlear organogenesis: First, during embryonic development, in the presence of RA, RARA functions as a transcriptional activator that induces prosensory gene expression in progenitor cells and supports differentiation of the organ of Corti; later during postnatal development, when RA is absent, the function of RARA switches, thereby repressing prosensory genes in postnatal hair cells and hindering trans-differentiation into supporting cells. This hypothesis was supported by demonstration that RARA forms a complex with either the coactivator NCOA1 or the corepressor NCOR1 depending on the developmental stage. In addition, modulation of RA levels was found to govern recruitment of the coactivator and corepressor to the RARA complex, and the expression of prosensory genes was validated to depend on RARA complex composition. Together, our results provide insights supporting the potential of harnessing RA signaling to induce prosensory progenitors in stem cell–based strategies for hearing loss.",

          "abstract": "The Hantzsch ester (HEH 2 ) has found considerable utility as a photoreductant in synthesis, with photodriven transfer hydrogenation reactions typically limited to activated substrates. We recently established that the addition of an organic buffer of collidinium triflate [(ColH)OTf] and collidine (Col) allows photodriven transfer hydrogenation from HEH 2 to N 2 forming NH 3 (nitrogen reduction; N 2 R) in the presence of a Mo catalyst. Given the requirements for Mo-catalyzed thermally driven N 2 R, this result suggested the generation of a significant driving force for proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) when irradiating HEH 2 in the presence of Col-buffer. In this study, we probe how Col-buffer enables efficient photodriven proton-coupled reductions with HEH 2 . Wavelength-dependent NH 3 yields are consistent with HEH 2 photoexcitation, and the combination of HEH 2 with Col-buffer is privileged. Data are presented, suggesting that HEH 2 is statically quenched via ET to [ColH]OTf through an H-bonded association complex to release ColH • and [HEH 2 ] •+ . Transient absorbance data and EPR studies establish that the resulting [HEH 2 ] •+ intermediate is rapidly deprotonated by Col to yield HEH • , in net furnishing HEH • and ColH • as potent H-atom donors. Broader utility of this reagent combination is demonstrated in the photoreduction of a range of C=O and N=O π-bonds by HEH 2 , with a significant boost in rates and yield, and altered reactivity, observed on addition of Col-buffer. ColH • is posited as the most potent PCET donor generated (BDFE N−H of 28 kcal mol −1 ).",

When monkeys report more confidence in a perceptual decision, that decision is more likely to be correct. It is not known how neural circuits in the primate brain assess the quality of perceptual decisions. Here, we test two hypotheses. First, that decision confidence is related to the structure of population activity in the sensory cortex. And second, that this relation differs from the one between sensory activity and decision content. We trained macaque monkeys to judge the orientation of ambiguous stimuli and additionally report their confidence in these judgments. We recorded population activity in the primary visual cortex and used decoders to expose the relationship between this activity and the choice-confidence reports. Our analysis validated both hypotheses and suggests that perceptual decisions arise from a neural computation downstream of visual cortex that estimates the most likely interpretation of a sensory response, while decision confidence instead reflects a computation that evaluates whether this sensory response will produce a reliable decision. Our work establishes a direct link between neural population activity in the sensory cortex and the metacognitive ability to introspect about the quality of perceptual decisions.",

          "abstract": "Chronic pain arises from maladaptive changes in both peripheral and central nervous systems, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key region implicated in descending pain modulation. Chronic pain increases the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the ACC. Although a reduction in inhibitory inputs onto pyramidal neurons has been observed in neuropathic conditions, the identity of the specific interneurons responsible remains unclear. We show that chronic pain selectively impairs parvalbumin (PV), but not somatostatin, interneurons in the rostral ACC. This is characterized by a decrease in the density of PV interneuron processes, a reduction in their surrounding perineuronal net, and a lower expression of PV. Functionally, PV interneurons display diminished inhibitory efficacy in vitro and reduced phasic activation in response to aversive stimuli in vivo. Dopamine (DA) fibers preferentially contact PV interneurons and excite them via D1 dopamine receptor activation, increasing their excitability and enhancing the frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents on pyramidal neurons in healthy, but not neuropathic, conditions. Furthermore, we show that this pathway is involved in hunger-induced analgesia: Food deprivation increases DA release in the ACC and consequently decreases pain thresholds in neuropathic mice. Conversely, when mice are not food deprived, neuropathic pain significantly reduces DA release in the ACC. We conclude that the loss of PV interneuron inhibitory efficacy, alongside convergent hypodopaminergic signaling, synergistically contributes to pathological ACC dysfunction and associated symptoms of chronic pain.",

Sourness, one of the primary tastes, is aversive in mammals, whereas many birds frequently consume acidic fruits, suggesting a potential tolerance.

We demonstrate that sour tolerance is a conserved trait in birds, with avian OTOP1 exhibiting acid-induced inhibition and OTOP1 modulation affecting sour perception and tolerance. Ancestral reconstruction reveals that the increase in acid tolerance may have evolved at the same point in the songbird phylogeny as the regain of sweet sensing in this clade. This shift might have enabled songbirds to feed on a wider range of fruits, affecting the evolution and diversification of the songbird radiation.",

Optogenetic activation of RE neurons leads to an unusual phenotype: presleep behaviors (grooming and nest organizing) followed by prolonged, intense sleep that resembles RS. Inhibiting RE activity during SD impairs subsequent RS, which suggests that these neurons signal sleep need. RE neurons act upstream of sleep-promoting zona incerta cells, and SD triggers plasticity of this circuit to strengthen their connectivity.

We present an in vivo engineering strategy using targeted lipid nanoparticles (tLNPs) for messenger RNA delivery to specific T cell subsets. These tLNPs reprogrammed CD8 + T cells in both healthy donor and autoimmune patient samples, and in vivo dosing resulted in tumor control in humanized mice and B cell depletion in cynomolgus monkeys. In cynomolgus monkeys, the reconstituted B cells after depletion were predominantly naïve, suggesting an immune system reset. By eliminating the requirements for complex ex vivo manufacturing, this tLNP platform holds the potential to make CAR T cell therapies more accessible and applicable across additional clinical indications.",

Before the earthquake, a moment magnitude ( M w ) 6.0 slow-slip event (SSE) was observed from late 2023 in a downdip extension of the mainshock. The coseismic slip was adjacent to the 1996 Hyuga-nada earthquake source. The afterslip resolved near the hypocenter area and in the downdip extension of the mainshock, reaching M w 6.7 on 16 September 2024. Leading up to the earthquake, the recurrence interval for SSEs in the preslip area shortened from an average of 2 years, estimated from observations over the past 30 years, to 1 year, consistent with simulations in which the weakening of the Nankai megathrust was attributed to the cause.",

Insufficient retinoic acid (RA) production, caused by the deficiency of rate-limiting enzyme Aldh1a2 and boosted RA degradation, was responsible for the failure of mouse pinna regeneration. Switching on Aldh1a2 or RA supplementation reactivated regeneration. Evolutionary inactivation of multiple Aldh1a2-linked regulatory elements accounted for the deficient Aldh1a2 expression upon injury in mice and rats. Furthermore, the activation of Aldh1a2 by a single rabbit enhancer was sufficient to improve ear pinna regeneration in transgenic mice.

Despite the transformative impact, visible-light photoredox catalysis remains constrained by the thermodynamic limits of photon energy and inefficiencies arising from unproductive back electron transfer, both of which become particularly pronounced in thermodynamically demanding reactions. In this work, we introduce an organic photoredox catalyst system that overcomes these obstacles to drive chemical transformations that require super-reducing capabilities. This advancement is accomplished by coupling the energy of two photons into a single chemical reduction, whereas inefficiencies from back electron transfer are mitigated through a distinct proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism embedded in the catalyst design. The super-reducing capabilities of this organic catalyst system are demonstrated through efficient application in a broad scope of challenging arene reductions.",

When mice engaged in an olfactory task, OB cholinergic axons rapidly shifted their response patterns from movement correlated to odor aligned. This response shift was absent in cholinergic axons projecting to the dorsal cortex during olfactory task engagement, and in OB, during an auditory task. Inactivation of OB-projecting cholinergic neurons impaired olfactory task performance and reduced odor responses in OB granule cells.

We report structures of the bacterial ribosome in complex with peptidyl-tRNA and RFs in the prepeptide release state. No hydrolytic water molecule was seen in the peptidyl transferase center. Instead, RFs induced rearrangements of the peptidyl-tRNA adenine 76 (A76) ribose pucker that orient the 2′-OH for the nucleophilic attack onto the neighboring carbonyl group. These findings suggest a catalytic mechanism of RF-mediated peptide release and provide a structural basis for the universal conservation of the catalytic domain in peptide RFs.",

          "abstract": "In drug development, replacement of a skeletal carbon with a sulfur atom can result in analogs of bioactive compounds with improved properties. Currently, the sulfur analogs are almost exclusively prepared by de novo synthesis; the existing approach to swap carbon with sulfur is inefficient and involves stoichiometric mercury reagents. In this study, we report a two-step carbonyl-to-sulfur (CO-to-S) atom swap approach, enabled by a rationally designed N ′-alkyl-hydrazonamide (NAHA) reagent that promotes forming pre-aromatic intermediates twice sequentially by different mechanisms, thereby achieving homolytic cleavage of both α-C−C bonds of the ketone substrates. A Ts−S−Ts (Ts, p -toluenesulfonyl) reagent mediates this process through successive intermolecular and intramolecular alkyl radical trapping by the central sulfur. This method shows a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity, providing a streamlined route to sulfur-containing scaffolds from readily available ketones.",

          "abstract": "The gut microbiota of mammals possess distinctive metabolic pathways with untapped therapeutic potential. Using molecular insights into dietary fiber metabolism by the human gut microbiota, we designed a targeted drug delivery system, called GlycoCaging, that is based on bespoke glycoconjugates of a complex plant oligosaccharide. GlycoCaging of exemplar anti-inflammatory drugs enabled release of active molecules triggered by specific glycosidases of autochthonous gut bacteria. GlycoCaging ensured that drug efficacy was potentiated, and off-target effects were eliminated in murine models of inflammatory bowel disease. Biochemical and metagenomic analyses of gut microbiota of individual humans confirmed the broad applicability of this strategy.",

          "abstract": "Human language is unique among communication systems since many elements are learned and transmitted across generations. Previous research suggests that this process is best predicted by infant-directed communication, i.e., a mode of communication directed by caregivers to children. Despite its importance for language, whether infant-directed communication is unique to humans or rooted more deeply in the primate lineage remains unclear. To assess this, we investigated directed and surrounding vocal communication in human infants and infants of wild nonhuman great apes. Our findings reveal that human infants receive dramatically more infant-directed communication than nonhuman great ape infants. These data suggest that the earliest hominins likely relied more on surrounding communication to become communicatively competent, while infant-directed vocal communication became considerably more prominent with human language.",

          "abstract": "Adapting to change is a fundamental feature of human learning, yet its developmental origins remain elusive. We developed an experimental and computational approach to track infants’ adaptive learning processes via pupil size, an indicator of tonic and phasic noradrenergic activity. We found that 8-month-old infants’ tonic pupil size mirrored trial-by-trial fluctuations in environmental volatility, while phasic pupil responses revealed that infants used this information to dynamically optimize their learning. This adaptive strategy resulted in successful task performance, as evidenced by anticipatory looking toward correct target locations. The ability to estimate volatility varied significantly across infants, and these individual differences were related to infant temperament, indicating early links between cognitive adaptation and emotional responsivity. These findings demonstrate that infants actively adapt to environmental change, and that early differences in this capacity may have profound implications for long-term cognitive and psychosocial development.",

          "abstract": "Rice was a staple crop in the ancestral Austronesian regions of Taiwan and Island Southeast Asia, but it was unknown in any of the Pacific Islands at the time of European encounters, with the exception of the unique case of Guam and the Mariana Islands. Through multiple methodologies, including phytolith analysis, micro–computed tomography scanning, and thin-section petrography, this recent research confirms the presence of abundant rice husk and leaf phytoliths adhering to red-slipped pottery (“Marianas Red”) at the Ritidian Site Complex in Guam, dated by radiocarbon to 3500 to 3100 years ago. This study addresses the long-standing question of whether the first Pacific Islanders transported rice with them from the Philippines across 2300 kilometers of open sea, representing the longest known ocean voyage of the time. During this early period, rice was restricted to special ritual events in the Marianas. The early voyage apparently was planned with provisions of rice at 3500 years ago.",

          "abstract": "Conventional drug delivery methods for chronic disease often suffer from low potency and poor patient compliance, while current advanced devices face limitations because of bulkiness, frequent implantation needs, inflammation risk, and lack of precise control. To overcome these challenges, we developed the SUSTAIN—a smart, ultra-long-lasting, sequentially triggerable, and artfully implantable nozzle system. The SUSTAIN integrates an osmotic pressure–triggered module, an airflow-generated T-pipe (AGT), and a drug infusion pump (DIP) for controlled subcutaneous drug release. The AGT enables tunable dosing by varying NaHCO 3 /KH 2 PO 4 powder amounts, while shear thinning of the β-cyclodextrin/Pluronic F-127 hydrogel in the DIP ensures sustained drug infusion. In vivo studies show that the SUSTAIN delivers at least four doses of levothyroxine sodium over 10 days and three doses of semaglutide over 42 days, maintaining effective blood drug levels with minimal invasiveness. This system presents a highly promising solution for improving therapeutic outcomes and convenience in chronic disease management.",

Nanotechnology has been applied to drug delivery for reducing drug toxicity and improving efficacy, but few studies have addressed hERG-related cardiotoxicity. We report the use of self-assembling dendrimer nanosystems for drug formulation and delivery, which effectively reduced hERG binding and associated toxicity while promoting therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, these dendrimer nanosystems efficiently encapsulated the antimalarial drug chloroquine, the anticancer agent doxorubicin, and the NUPR1 inhibitor ZZW115, all three having high affinity to hERG channels. These nanoformulations showed three- to eightfold reduced hERG binding affinity, which, in animal models, translated to abolished toxicity. These nanodrugs exhibited prolonged circulation, leading to enhanced accumulation at disease sites and improved treatment outcomes. This study highlights the potential of nanotechnology to reduce hERG binding and related toxicity while improving drug efficacy, offering valuable perspectives for drug development.",

We report, to our knowledge, the first discovery of abundant HSCs in adult mollusk shells, an invertebrate hematopoietic niche resembling vertebrate bone marrow (BM). Cell-lineage analysis and functional assays reveal the developmental origin of HSCs during larval shell formation and their participation in hemocyte-mediated shell regeneration and soft-body blood supply. Widespread skeleton-related HSC-like cells are found in diverse invertebrate groups and bony fish group, suggesting skeletons as a universal niche for animal HSCs and HSC-skeleton association preceding vertebrate water-to-land transition. Comparison of invertebrate and vertebrate skeletal HSCs enables the macroevolutionary profiling of a core-set of animal HSC regulators. Our findings would boost fundamental paradigm shifts for hematopoiesis and stem cell research in invertebrates and provide the redefined understanding of vertebrate BM evolution and water-to-land transition.",

Inspired by cryptobiosis in nature, researchers have pioneered approaches to create cell-in-shell nanobiohybrids, aiming to endow cells with enhanced protection and exogenous functions. Yet, these methods still lack the biological autonomy intrinsic to natural cellular responses. Here, we present an innovative chemo-metabolically coupled strategy for the autonomous construction of cell-in-shell structures in cell growth medium. Our system harnesses ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae , chemically coupled with an enzymatic cascade involving alcohol oxidase and horseradish peroxidase, to drive the nanoshell formation of polydopamine. The integration of autonomous shell formation with cellular proliferation produces anisotropic cell-in-shell structures, which can serve as enzyme-powered cell microrobots, upon conjugation with urease. Our autonomous system enables the creation of cell-in-shell nanobiohybrids with dynamic and adaptive environmental interactions, paving the way for transformative applications in synthetic biology, such as artificial cells, as well as advancements in cell-based therapies.",

          "abstract": "Identifying previously unknown targets for pathological cardiac hypertrophy and understanding its mechanisms are crucial. Here, we observed that the deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1 was moderately elevated in human hypertrophic myocardium and mouse models. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of YOD1 reduced Ang II– and TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Subsequently, we used multiple proteomic analyses to identify and confirm STAT3 as a substrate protein for YOD1. Mechanistically, our findings revealed that the C155 site of YOD1 removes K48-linked ubiquitin chains from K97 on STAT3, stabilizing STAT3 levels and enhancing its nuclear translocation in cardiomyocytes under Ang II stimulation. Notably, inhibiting STAT3 reversed the antihypertrophic effects of YOD1 deficiency in Ang II–challenged mice. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of YOD1 mitigated Ang II–induced pathological ventricular remodeling in mice. This study clarifies the role of YOD1 and introduces a previously unidentified YOD1-STAT3 axis in regulating pathological cardiac hypertrophy, providing valuable insights for drug development targeting this condition.",

To enhance our understanding of their multifaceted functions, we developed copper-64–radiolabeled nanobodies targeting the human CD4 receptor ( 64 Cu-CD4-Nb1) for positron emission tomography (PET). In human CD4-receptor knock-in mice, 64 Cu-CD4-Nb1 specifically accumulated in different orthotopic tumors, correlating with histological CD4 + cell densities. Based on intratumoral CD4 + cell distribution patterns within the core and periphery, we distinguished responders to combined αPD-1/4-1BB antibodies early on-treatment. CD4-PET identified resistance to αPD-1 monotherapy, which was mitigated by adding regulatory T cell–depleting α4-1BB antibodies. Patients with early-stage non–small cell lung cancer who relapsed after neoadjuvant αPD-L1 therapy revealed low CD4 + T cell densities in the tumor core. In human and mouse tumor tissues, regulatory T cells correlated with CD4 + cell densities. Thus, visualizing the spatial distribution patterns of CD4 + cells by PET offers mechanistic insights into CD4-mediated therapy efficacy, with great potential for guiding combinatorial immunotherapies in patients with cancer.",

In this work, we have demonstrated that Zn 2+ features the strongest anti-inflammatory performance by screening 10 representative metal ions, and the MTC1 agonists can trigger lysosomal Zn 2+ release and inhibit pyroptosis in macrophages. Based on these findings, we further engineered a mucolipin TRP channel 1 (MTC1)–related therapeutic nanoplatform for endogenously triggering lysosomal zinc release to curb inflammation and block macrophage pyroptosis. This nanoplatform consists of mesoporous silica nanoparticles to deliver MTC1 agonists and carbon nanodots, which could synergistically exert antiatherosclerotic effect by scavenging toxic reactive oxygen species, inhibiting macrophage pyroptosis, modulating macrophage transition, and rebuilding atherosclerotic immune microenvironment. These findings demonstrate that macrophage pyroptosis can be efficiently blocked via leveraging self-lysosomal zinc pool, which provides the paradigm of lysosomal zinc modulation-involved nanotherapeutics for managing other inflammatory diseases.",

          "abstract": "Vesta, the only differentiated rocky protoplanet explored by a spacecraft, offers insight into early planetary formation. The Divalia Fossae, surface troughs comparable in size to the Grand Canyon, encircle two-thirds of the equator. Two giant impacts reshaped the southern hemisphere, where an older basin is partially superposed by the younger Rheasilvia basin. The origin of the Divalia Fossae is widely accepted as directly linked to the Rheasilvia impact, either by tectonics caused immediately by the impact, up-spinning, or secondary cratering. We present several geologic constraints that support a tectonic origin of the troughs due to the adjustment of Vesta’s spin axis to a geoid changed by both large impacts. The best fit to Vesta’s gravitational field corresponds to a spin axis reorientation of 3° that, when coupled with despinning, induces a stress state that predicts Divalia Fossae’s established location, fracture type, and orientation. These insights underline the importance of tectonic processes in the early evolution of protoplanets.",

Unusually high concentrations of Cl and Cu in the magma and large magma volumes are not required. Arc magmas of modest volume (&lt;10 3 km 3 ) and modest initial Cu and Cl concentrations can generate large PCDs, if a sufficient mass of magmatic fluid is exsolved at an advanced stage of crystallization.",

Some of these populations have made remarkable recoveries and are now approaching pre-exploitation levels of abundance. Contrary to expectations of baleen whales making minor oscillations around equilibrium abundances, several populations that have made the strongest recoveries have experienced major mortality events. We review examples from the literature showing increasing demographic variability in recovering populations of baleen whales and present a simulation study on the expected response of recovered versus depleted whale population to environmental variability and climate impacts. We propose that baleen whales are more sensitive to environmental variability than previously recognized; that major demographic fluctuations will become the norm as baleen whales recover; and that climate-driven disruptions to whale population dynamics will be most dramatic in populations with the lowest rates of anthropogenic mortality.",

We hypothesize that induction of PKS activity facilitates mixotrophic behavior during nutrient-depleted bloom conditions. To identify potential in situ stimuli for growth, toxigenicity, and bloom persistence, we compared environmental factors and biological processes identified by metaomics to Chrysochromulina leadbeateri HABs between two fjords in northern Norway. We identified the polyketide ichthyotoxin leadbeaterin-1 from the C. leadbeateri bloom and found potentially associated candidate PKS genes of which most were higher expressed at bloom stations. A relative depletion of inorganic nitrogen and phosphate during the bloom was correlated with higher expression of genes involved in endocytosis, autophagy, and lysosomal activity. Mixotrophy is evidently a compensatory nutritional strategy coupled to induction of toxigenesis and other metabolomic processes as biotic factors linked to Chrysochromulina bloom dynamics.",

Light field–driven currents were demonstrated in various media including dielectrics, semiconductors, and topological insulators. Now, our research question is whether we can drive and control orders of magnitude more charge carriers in metals enabling ultrafast switching with practically low-energy, picojoule-level pulses. Here, we demonstrate the interaction of light with nanometer-thick metallic layers, which leads to a generation of light field–controlled electric currents.

However, the specific contribution of each interneuron subtype remains uncertain. In this work, we explore the contributions of cell type–specific activity and synaptic connections to the dynamics of a spatially organized spiking neuron network. We find that the firing rates of the somatostatin (SOM) interneurons align closely with the level of network synchrony irrespective of the target of modulatory input. Further analysis reveals that inhibition from SOM to parvalbumin interneurons must be limited to allow gradual transitions from asynchrony to synchrony and that the strength of recurrent excitation onto SOM neurons determines the level of synchrony achievable in the network. Our results are consistent with recent experimental findings on cell type–specific manipulations.

          "abstract": "Climate change is altering marine ecosystems, driving shifts in sea turtle distributions and challenging conservation efforts. Our study examines how climate change affects the global sea distribution of all seven sea turtle species, intersecting with marine protected areas (MPAs) and shipping corridors. Using species distribution models and environmental data from 2000 to 2024, we project sea turtle habitats under current conditions and three future climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) for 2050 and 2100. Our results show substantial habitat redistributions, with poleward shifts and contractions, particularly under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Over 50% of sea turtle hotspots may disappear by 2050, with many new habitats in high shipping intensity areas. Alarmingly, only 23% of current hotspots are within MPAs, highlighting the need for adaptive conservation strategies.",

          "abstract": "Methane is a major greenhouse gas and a key component of global biogeochemical cycles. Microbial methane often deviates from isotope and isotopolog equilibrium in surface environments but approaches equilibrium in deep subsurface sediments. The origin of this near-equilibrium isotopic signature in methane, whether directly produced by methanogens or achieved through anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), remains uncertain. Here, we show that, in the absence of AOM, microbial methane produced from deep-sea sediments exhibits isotopolog compositions approaching thermodynamic equilibrium due to energy limitation. In contrast, microbial methane from salt marsh and thermokarst lakes exhibits significant hydrogen and clumped isotopic disequilibrium due to high free-energy availability. We propose that clumped isotopologs of methane provide a proxy for characterizing the bioenergetics of environments for methane production. Together, these observations demonstrate methane clumped isotopes as a powerful tool to better understand the relation between methane metabolisms and the energy landscape in natural environments.",

This study performs numerical simulations to investigate the conditions that were needed to cross between Taiwan and Yonaguni Island, where one of the world’s strongest ocean currents, the Kuroshio, remains active. We combined simulations based on three ocean models with data from an actual experimental voyage conducted in 2019. The results showed that travel across this sea would have been possible on both the modern and Late Pleistocene oceans if a dugout canoe was used with a suitable departure place and paddling strategy. Recognizing the Kuroshio, paddling to counteract this current, and using high-level navigation were crucial to success. This suggests that the Paleolithic maritime expansion in the Western Pacific involved both advanced technologies and strategic challenges.",

Here, using the tendon cell as a mechanosensitive cell type within a bioreactor, we show that the tension of the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adaptively increases in response to repetitive external stimuli. Depletion of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the highest expressed PM-ER tether protein, interfered with mechanotransduction from the PM to the ER, and affected the ER tension. We found that an optimized mechanical strain increased ER tension in a homeostatic manner, but excessive strain resulted in ER expansion, as well as activating ER stress. Last, we showed that changes in ER tension were linked with ER-mitochondria interactions and associated with cellular energetics and function. Together, these findings identify a PM-ER mechanotransduction mechanism that dose-dependently regulates cellular metabolism.",

Particularly, we develop electrically responsive hydrogels to establish rapidly detachable device/hydrogel interfaces, endowing the reusability of the biosensor array. Meanwhile, the adhesion of hydrogel/skin interfaces is also enhanced to facilitate high-fidelity signal acquisition. By analyzing the photoplethysmography (PPG) infrared (IR) signals, the biosensor array can accurately and responsively locate PAs across different types of free flaps in clinical cases, outperforming existing techniques. This biosensor array represents a promising platform for PA locating.

The Ryukyu Islands in southwestern Japan, where archaeological sites suddenly appeared 35,000 to 30,000 years ago, are of particular interest in this regard because of the apparent difficulty in crossing the surrounding waters. In this study, we test if a non-sailing dugout canoe can be produced with Upper Paleolithic tools, and if it can cross the 110-kilometer-wide strait at the western entrance of the Ryukyus, where one of the world’s strongest ocean currents intervenes. Our 7.5-meter-long dugout, manufactured with edge-ground stone axes, was speedy and durable enough to cross this strait. This supports the early development of functional boats, such as dugouts, while our experiment also highlighted that this type of sea travel was possible only for experienced paddlers with advanced navigational skills.",

In microscopic scenarios, organizing microrobot collectives is now governed by agent-agent physical interactions. However, the existing methods are insufficient to produce robust connections and fail to tolerate harsh environments. We propose a strategy to efficiently program microrobots into reconfigurable robust collectives to operate in various dynamic environments. Magnetic collectives are produced to achieve reconfigurable pattern transformation with considerable structural enhancement via well-designed gradient magnetic fields. The strong gradient magnetic field–induced connections among individual microrobots enable a record-breaking 700-fold output force enhancement, and 0.2-gram microrobot collectives generate Newton-level output forces. The proposed reconfigurable microrobot collectives provide a stable and promising approach to executing droplet, fluid, and solid manipulations via powerful output forces. These results may have implications for further understanding of self-assembly, particle systems, microrobot collectives, smart dust, and related microscopic multiagent behaviors.",

In this study, we investigated mechanical stimuli and identified a positive feedback loop between Wnt signaling and tissue stretching. We developed a mathematical model of mechanochemical pattern formation in a closed elastic shell, representing regenerating Hydra epithelial spheroids. Our model explains how mechanical forces drive axis formation and predict the organizer’s location under various perturbations. Validation by partially confining regenerating tissues showed that the organizer forms in regions with the greatest stretching potential.

A growth analysis demonstrated a 48% decrease in asymptotic body length from 1996 to 2019 while a genome-wide association analysis revealed outlier loci and gene candidates linked to growth performance. The contributing loci showed signals of directional selection with high autocovariance of allele frequency change and significant overlap with regions of high genetic differentiation.

Using Higgs echo spectroscopy, we also uncover unconventional echo formation caused by inhomogeneous broadening and “soft” QP bands, which dynamically evolve under terahertz (THz) driving. Specifically, THz pulse pairs modulate the superconducting gap, imprinting coherence and forming a temporal “Higgs grating.” This grating produces echoes with distinctive characteristics: (i) echo rephasing spectral peaks at superconducting gap frequencies, (ii) asymmetric echo formation delays unlike those observed in atoms or semiconductors, and (iii) negative-time echo signals stemming from Higgs-QP anharmonic interactions. Combined with advanced time-frequency analysis, these findings distinguish Higgs from QP responses and clarify their intricate interactions in THz-driven superconductivity.",

This result is supported by evidence of temporal and geographical overlap between cetaceans and endothermic fish lineages in the fossil record, as well as correlations between cetacean diversification and the origin of endothermy in fishes. Phylogenetic comparative analyses identified correlations between endothermy, large body sizes, and specialized swimming modes while challenging diet specialization and depth range expansion hypotheses. Comparative genomic analyses identified several genes under selection in endothermic lineages, including carnmt1 (involved in fatty acid metabolism) and dcaf6 (associated with development).

Here, we show that the sequential functions of the decidual reaction—implantation and decidualization—pivot on the time-sensitive loss of progesterone-resistant DIO2 + stromal cells that form a specialized implantation niche and reciprocal expansion of progesterone-dependent PLA2G2A + predecidual cells. Simultaneously, uterine natural killer (uNK) cell proliferation results in the accumulation of immunotolerant subsets. Examination of endometrial biopsies from 924 women revealed that the recurrence risk of miscarriage closely aligns with the incidence of a weakened or stalled decidual reaction, more so than poor uNK cell expansion. Analysis of paired biopsies obtained in different cycles and modeling in assembloids intimated that prior miscarriages disrupt intercycle endometrial homeostasis and calibration of the decidual reaction. Our findings show that erosion of the decidual reaction following a miscarriage drives the recurrence risk irrespective of maternal age.",

Luminescence ages reveal a common sedimentary hiatus from ~26 to ~17 thousand years ago (ka), reflecting fluvial incision of &gt;35 meters triggered by sea level fall. Subsequent rapid aggradation occurred within these incised valleys during deglaciation between ~17 and ~9 ka and then slowed down afterward.

We find experimentally that pedestrian crowds can exhibit three distinct dynamical regimes (free regime, slow-moving regime, and jammed regime) depending on the crowd density. In the free regime, pedestrians’ movement is not constrained; in the slow-moving regime, pedestrians’ speed is constrained, but pedestrians’ movement direction in each step is not influenced; and in the jammed regime, both pedestrians’ speed and movement direction in each step are constrained. We also demonstrate that pedestrians are most likely to synchronize their movements spontaneously at the onset of jamming. Our findings provide important insights into crowd dynamics.",

During neuroinflammation, we found increased perineural immune cells that had access to intracranial injected beads, dye, and bacteria. Additionally, we identified osseous channels connecting the environment surrounding olfactory nerves to bone marrow in the cribriform plate (cpBM).
