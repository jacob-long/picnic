          "abstract": "When humans assemble into face-to-face social networks, they create an extended social environment that permits exposure to the microbiome of others, thereby shaping the composition and diversity of the microbiome at individual and population levels1,2,3,4,5,6. Here we use comprehensive social network mapping and detailed microbiome sequencing data in 1,787 adults within 18 isolated villages in Honduras7 to investigate the relationship between network structure and gut microbiome composition. Using both species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial sharing occurs between many relationship types, notably including non-familial and non-household connections. Furthermore, strain-sharing extends to second-degree social connections, suggesting the relevance of a person’s broader network. We also observe that socially central people are more microbially similar to the overall village than socially peripheral people. Among 301 people whose microbiome was re-measured 2 years later, we observe greater convergence in strain-sharing in connected versus otherwise similar unconnected co-villagers. Clusters of species and strains occur within clusters of people in village social networks, meaning that social networks provide the social niches within which microbiome biology and phenotypic impact are manifested.",

          "abstract": "Aneuploid epithelial cells are common in breast cancer1,2; however, their presence in normal breast tissues is not well understood. To address this question, we applied single-cell DNA sequencing to profile copy number alterations in 83,206 epithelial cells from the breast tissues of 49 healthy women, and we applied single-cell DNA and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing co-assays to the samples of 19 women. Our data show that all women harboured rare aneuploid epithelial cells (median 3.19%) that increased with age. Many aneuploid epithelial cells (median 82.22%) in normal breast tissues underwent clonal expansions and harboured copy number alterations reminiscent of invasive breast cancers (gains of 1q; losses of 10q, 16q and 22q). Co-assay profiling showed that the aneuploid cells were mainly associated with the two luminal epithelial lineages, and spatial mapping showed that they localized in ductal and lobular structures with normal histopathology. Collectively, these data show that even healthy women have clonal expansions of rare aneuploid epithelial cells in their breast tissues.",

However, the molecular details that link enhancer sequence to TF binding, promoter state and transcription levels remain unclear. Here we applied single-molecule footprinting2,3 to measure the simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes and other regulatory proteins on engineered enhancer–promoter constructs with variable numbers of TF binding sites for both a synthetic TF and an endogenous TF involved in the type I interferon response. Although TF binding events on nucleosome-free DNA are independent, activation domains recruit cofactors that destabilize nucleosomes, driving observed TF binding cooperativity. Average TF occupancy linearly determines promoter activity, and we decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the enhancer binding microstates and gene expression dynamics. This work provides a template for the quantitative dissection of distinct contributors to gene expression, including TF activation domains, concentration, binding affinity, binding site configuration and recruitment of chromatin regulators.",

Here we use a nanoscale superconducting sensor1,2 to map the magnetic fringe fields in twisted bilayers of MoTe2, in which transport3,4 and optical sensing5,6 experiments have revealed the formation of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states at zero magnetic field. We observe oscillations in the local magnetic field associated with fillings ν = −1, −2/3, −3/5, −4/7 and −5/9 of the first moiré hole band, consistent with the formation of FCIs at these fillings. We determine the local thermodynamic gaps of the most robust FCI state at ν = −2/3, finding −2/3Δ as large as 7 meV. We also characterize sample spatial disorder, which is dominated by both inhomogeneity in the effective unit cell area7 as well as inhomogeneity in the band edge offset and bound dipole moment. Our results highlight both the challenges posed by structural disorder in the study of twisted homobilayer moiré systems and the opportunities afforded by the robust nature of the underlying correlated topological states.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma is incurable and in urgent need of improved therapeutics1. Here we identify a small compound, gliocidin, that kills glioblastoma cells while sparing non-tumour replicative cells. Gliocidin activity targets a de novo purine synthesis vulnerability in glioblastoma through indirect inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2). IMPDH2 blockade reduces intracellular guanine nucleotide levels, causing nucleotide imbalance, replication stress and tumour cell death2. Gliocidin is a prodrug that is anabolized into its tumoricidal metabolite, gliocidin–adenine dinucleotide (GAD), by the enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1) of the NAD+ salvage pathway. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of GAD together with IMPDH2 demonstrates its entry, deformation and blockade of the NAD+ pocket3. In vivo, gliocidin penetrates the blood–brain barrier and extends the survival of mice with orthotopic glioblastoma. The DNA alkylating agent temozolomide induces Nmnat1 expression, causing synergistic tumour cell killing and additional survival benefit in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models. This study brings gliocidin to light as a prodrug with the potential to improve the survival of patients with glioblastoma.",

          "authors": "Hao Zhang, Jin-Xiang Chen, Jian-Ping Qu, Yan-Biao Kang",
          "abstract": "Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are found in many everyday consumer products, often because of their high thermal and chemical stabilities, as well as their hydrophobic and oleophobic properties1. However, the inert carbon–fluorine (C–F) bonds that give PFASs their properties also provide resistance to decomposition through defluorination, leading to long-term persistence in the environment, as well as in the human body, raising substantial safety and health concerns1,2,3,4,5. Despite recent advances in non-incineration approaches for the destruction of functionalized PFASs, processes for the recycling of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as well as polymeric PFASs such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are limited to methods that use either elevated temperatures or strong reducing reagents. Here we report the defluorination of PFASs with a highly twisted carbazole-cored super-photoreductant KQGZ. A series of PFASs could be defluorinated photocatalytically at 40–60 °C. PTFE gave amorphous carbon and fluoride salts as the major products. Oligomeric PFASs such as PFCs, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), polyfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and derivatives give carbonate, formate, oxalate and trifluoroacetate as the defluorinated products. This allows for the recycling of fluorine in PFASs as inorganic fluoride salt. The mechanistic investigation reveals the difference in reaction behaviour and product components for PTFE and oligomeric PFASs. This work opens a window for the low-temperature photoreductive defluorination of the ‘forever chemicals’ PFASs, especially for PTFE, as well as the discovery of new super-photoreductants.",

However, it is unclear which parts of the human brain are covered by existing protocols, and it has been difficult to quantitatively assess organoid variation and fidelity. Here we integrate 36 single-cell transcriptomic datasets spanning 26 protocols into one integrated human neural organoid cell atlas totalling more than 1.7 million cells1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. Mapping to developing human brain references27,28,29,30 shows primary cell types and states that have been generated in vitro, and estimates transcriptomic similarity between primary and organoid counterparts across protocols. We provide a programmatic interface to browse the atlas and query new datasets, and showcase the power of the atlas to annotate organoid cell types and evaluate new organoid protocols. Finally, we show that the atlas can be used as a diverse control cohort to annotate and compare organoid models of neural disease, identifying genes and pathways that may underlie pathological mechanisms with the neural models. The human neural organoid cell atlas will be useful to assess organoid fidelity, characterize perturbed and diseased states and facilitate protocol development.",

          "abstract": "Although rare neurodevelopmental conditions have a large Mendelian component 1 , common genetic variants also contribute to risk 2,3 . However, little is known about how this polygenic risk is distributed among patients with these conditions and their parents nor its interplay with rare variants. It is also unclear whether polygenic background affects risk directly through alleles transmitted from parents to children, or whether indirect genetic effects mediated through the family environment 4 also play a role. Here we addressed these questions using genetic data from 11,573 patients with rare neurodevelopmental conditions, 9,128 of their parents and 26,869 controls. Common variants explained around 10% of variance in risk. Patients with a monogenic diagnosis had significantly less polygenic risk than those without, supporting a liability threshold model 5 . A polygenic score for neurodevelopmental conditions showed only a direct genetic effect. By contrast, polygenic scores for educational attainment and cognitive performance showed no direct genetic effect, but the non-transmitted alleles in the parents were correlated with the child’s risk, potentially due to indirect genetic effects and/or parental assortment for these traits 4 . Indeed, as expected under parental assortment, we show that common variant predisposition for neurodevelopmental conditions is correlated with the rare variant component of risk. These findings indicate that future studies should investigate the possible role and nature of indirect genetic effects on rare neurodevelopmental conditions, and consider the contribution of common and rare variants simultaneously when studying cognition-related phenotypes.",

          "authors": "Shen-Ying Zhang, Jean-Laurent Casanova",
          "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) is the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in humans. It is life-threatening and has a first peak of incidence in childhood, during primary infection. Children with HSE are not particularly prone to other infections, including HSV-1 infections of tissues other than the brain. About 8–10% of childhood cases are due to monogenic inborn errors of 19 genes, two-thirds of which are recessive, and most of which display incomplete clinical penetrance. Childhood HSE can therefore be sporadic but genetic, enabling new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this Review, we examine essential cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity in the brain that are disrupted in individuals with HSE. These mechanisms include both known (such as mutations in the TLR3 pathway) and previously unknown (such as the TMEFF1 restriction factor) antiviral pathways, which may be dependent (for example, IFNAR1) or independent (for example, through RIPK3) of type I interferons. They operate in cortical or brainstem neurons, and underlie forebrain and brainstem infections, respectively. Conversely, the most severe inborn errors of leukocytes, including a complete lack of myeloid and/or lymphoid blood cells, do not underlie HSE. Thus congenital defects in intrinsic immunity in brain-resident neurons that underlie HSE broaden natural host defences against HSV-1 from the leukocytes of the immune system to other cells in the organism.",

          "abstract": "Building a large-scale quantum computer requires effective strategies to correct errors that inevitably arise in physical quantum systems 1 . Quantum error-correction codes 2 present a way to reach this goal by encoding logical information redundantly into many physical qubits. A key challenge in implementing such codes is accurately decoding noisy syndrome information extracted from redundancy checks to obtain the correct encoded logical information. Here we develop a recurrent, transformer-based neural network that learns to decode the surface code, the leading quantum error-correction code 3 . Our decoder outperforms other state-of-the-art decoders on real-world data from Google’s Sycamore quantum processor for distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes 4 . On distances up to 11, the decoder maintains its advantage on simulated data with realistic noise including cross-talk and leakage, utilizing soft readouts and leakage information. After training on approximate synthetic data, the decoder adapts to the more complex, but unknown, underlying error distribution by training on a limited budget of experimental samples. Our work illustrates the ability of machine learning to go beyond human-designed algorithms by learning from data directly, highlighting machine learning as a strong contender for decoding in quantum computers.",

          "abstract": "Quantum computers process information with the laws of quantum mechanics. Current quantum hardware is noisy, can only store information for a short time and is limited to a few quantum bits, that is, qubits, typically arranged in a planar connectivity1. However, many applications of quantum computing require more connectivity than the planar lattice offered by the hardware on more qubits than is available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU). The community hopes to tackle these limitations by connecting QPUs using classical communication, which has not yet been proven experimentally. Here we experimentally realize error-mitigated dynamic circuits and circuit cutting to create quantum states requiring periodic connectivity using up to 142 qubits spanning two QPUs with 127 qubits each connected in real time with a classical link. In a dynamic circuit, quantum gates can be classically controlled by the outcomes of mid-circuit measurements within run-time, that is, within a fraction of the coherence time of the qubits. Our real-time classical link enables us to apply a quantum gate on one QPU conditioned on the outcome of a measurement on another QPU. Furthermore, the error-mitigated control flow enhances qubit connectivity and the instruction set of the hardware thus increasing the versatility of our quantum computers. Our work demonstrates that we can use several quantum processors as one with error-mitigated dynamic circuits enabled by a real-time classical link.",

It is unclear, however, whether the predicted decorrelation and redundancy reduction in the activity of ganglion cells, the retina’s output neurons, hold under gaze shifts, which dominate the dynamics of the natural visual input 5 . We show here that species-specific gaze patterns in natural stimuli can drive correlated spiking responses both in and across distinct types of ganglion cells in marmoset as well as mouse retina. These concerted responses disrupt redundancy reduction to signal fixation periods with locally high spatial contrast. Model-based analyses of ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli show that the observed response correlations follow from nonlinear pooling of ganglion cell inputs.

The fibula transformed throughout dinosaur evolution from a columnar structure into its splint-like avian form, a change long thought to be of little biomechanical consequence3,6. Here we integrated comparative three-dimensional kinematic analyses with transitional morphologies from the fossil record to refute this assumption and show that the reduced fibula serves a crucial function in enabling extreme knee long-axis rotation (LAR). Extreme LAR is fundamental to avian locomotion and is regularly exploited by living birds to execute complex terrestrial manoeuvres7. We infer that the evolution of this capacity was preceded by restriction of the knee to hinge-like motion in early theropod dinosaurs, driven by the origin of a mid-shank articulation8 that precluded ancestral patterns of tibiofibular motion. Freeing of the fibula from the ankle joint later enabled mobilization of this initially static articulation and, in doing so, established a novel pattern of tibiofibular kinematics essential to the extreme levels of LAR retained by modern birds. Fibular reduction thus ushered in a transition to LAR-dominated three-dimensional limb control, profoundly altering the course of theropod locomotor evolution.",

          "abstract": "Cross-electrophile coupling reactions have evolved into a major strategy for rapidly assembling important organic molecules 1 . Two readily accessible electrophiles are coupled to form new C–C bonds, providing a key advantage over traditional cross-coupling strategies that require the preformation of reactive organometallic species. Yet, the formation of C( sp 3 )–C( sp 3 ) bonds that form the core of nearly all organic compounds remains highly challenging with current approaches, calling for the design of innovative new strategies. Here we report a distinct, transition-metal-free platform to form such bonds without the need for activating or stabilizing groups on the coupling partners. The reaction is enabled by an unusual single-electron transfer in a frustrated ion pair, and it can couple fragments containing functional groups that would be challenging in related transition-metal-catalysed processes. Moreover, we could further leverage this new mechanistic manifold in the design of other reactions, showing the broad potential of this type of reactivity. We anticipate that our results will provide a framework for further exploration of this reactivity pattern to tackle challenging problems in organic synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Astronomers have found more than a dozen planets transiting stars that are 10–40 million years old1, but younger transiting planets have remained elusive. The lack of such discoveries may be because planets have not fully formed at this age or because our view is blocked by the protoplanetary disk. However, we now know that many outer disks are warped or broken2; provided the inner disk is depleted, transiting planets may thus be visible. Here we report observations of the transiting planet IRAS 04125+2902 b orbiting a 3-million-year-old, 0.7-solar-mass, pre-main-sequence star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The host star harbours a nearly face-on (30 degrees inclination) transitional disk3 and a wide binary companion. The planet has a period of 8.83 days, a radius of 10.7 Earth radii (0.96 Jupiter radii) and a 95%-confidence upper limit on its mass of 90 Earth masses (0.3 Jupiter masses) from radial-velocity measurements, making it a possible precursor of the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes frequently found around main-sequence stars. The rotational broadening of the star and the orbit of the wide (4 arcseconds, 635 astronomical units) companion are both consistent with edge-on orientations. Thus, all components of the system are consistent with alignment except the outer disk; the origin of this misalignment is unclear.",

          "abstract": "Malaria pathology is driven by the accumulation of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in microvessels1. This process is mediated by the polymorphic erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesion proteins of the parasite. A subset of PfEMP1 variants that bind to human endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) through their CIDRα1 domains is responsible for severe malaria pathogenesis2. A longstanding question is whether individual antibodies can recognize the large repertoire of circulating PfEMP1 variants. Here we describe two broadly reactive and inhibitory human monoclonal antibodies to CIDRα1. The antibodies isolated from two different individuals exhibited similar and consistent EPCR-binding inhibition of diverse CIDRα1 domains, representing five of the six subclasses of CIDRα1. Both antibodies inhibited EPCR binding of both recombinant full-length and native PfEMP1 proteins, as well as parasite sequestration in bioengineered 3D human brain microvessels under physiologically relevant flow conditions. Structural analyses of the two antibodies in complex with three different CIDRα1 antigen variants reveal similar binding mechanisms that depend on interactions with three highly conserved amino acid residues of the EPCR-binding site in CIDRα1. These broadly reactive antibodies are likely to represent a common mechanism of acquired immunity to severe malaria and offer novel insights for the design of a vaccine or treatment targeting severe malaria.",

          "abstract": "The observed temperature record, which combines sea surface temperatures with near-surface air temperatures over land, is crucial for understanding climate variability and change 1–4 . However, early records of global mean surface temperature are uncertain owing to changes in measurement technology and practice, partial documentation 5–8 , and incomplete spatial coverage 9 . Here we show that existing estimates of ocean temperatures in the early twentieth century (1900–1930) are too cold, based on independent statistical reconstructions of the global mean surface temperature from either ocean or land data. The ocean-based reconstruction is on average about 0.26 °C colder than the land-based one, despite very high agreement in all other periods. The ocean cold anomaly is unforced, and internal variability in climate models cannot explain the observed land–ocean discrepancy. Several lines of evidence based on attribution, timescale analysis, coastal grid cells and palaeoclimate data support the argument of a substantial cold bias in the observed global sea-surface-temperature record in the early twentieth century. Although estimates of global warming since the mid-nineteenth century are not affected, correcting the ocean cold bias would result in a more modest early-twentieth-century warming trend 10 , a lower estimate of decadal-scale variability inferred from the instrumental record 3 , and better agreement between simulated and observed warming than existing datasets suggest 2 .",

The intestinal epithelium requires precise regulation during continuous homeostatic and damage-induced tissue renewal to prevent neoplastic transformation, suggesting that pathways unlinking tumour growth from regenerative processes must exist. Here, by mining RNA-sequencing datasets from two intestinal damage models 4,5 and using pharmacological, transcriptomics and genetic tools, we identified liver X receptor (LXR) pathway activation as a tissue adaptation to damage that reciprocally regulates intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, intestinal organoids, and gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that LXR activation in intestinal epithelial cells induces amphiregulin ( Areg ), enhancing regenerative responses. This response is coordinated by the LXR-ligand-producing enzyme CYP27A1, which was upregulated in damaged intestinal crypt niches. Deletion of Cyp27a1 impaired intestinal regeneration, which was rescued by exogenous LXR agonists. Notably, in tumour models, Cyp27a1 deficiency led to increased tumour growth, whereas LXR activation elicited anti-tumour responses dependent on adaptive immunity. Consistently, human colorectal cancer specimens exhibited reduced levels of CYP27A1 , LXR target genes, and B and CD8 T cell gene signatures. We therefore identify an epithelial adaptation mechanism to damage, whereby LXR functions as a rheostat, promoting tissue repair while limiting tumorigenesis.",

          "abstract": "Achieving net zero global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), with declining emissions of other greenhouse gases, is widely expected to halt global warming. CO2 emissions will continue to drive warming until fully balanced by active anthropogenic CO2 removals. For practical reasons, however, many greenhouse gas accounting systems allow some “passive” CO2 uptake, such as enhanced vegetation growth due to CO2 fertilisation, to be included as removals in the definition of net anthropogenic emissions. By including passive CO2 uptake, nominal net zero emissions would not halt global warming, undermining the Paris Agreement. Here we discuss measures addressing this problem, to ensure residual fossil fuel use does not cause further global warming: land management categories should be disaggregated in emissions reporting and targets to better separate the role of passive CO2 uptake; where possible, claimed removals should be additional to passive uptake; and targets should acknowledge the need for Geological Net Zero, meaning one tonne of CO2 permanently restored to the solid Earth for every tonne still generated from fossil sources. We also argue that scientific understanding of net zero provides a basis for allocating responsibility for the protection of passive carbon sinks during and after the transition to Geological Net Zero.",

A celebrated example is the composite Fermi liquid, a non-Fermi liquid formed by composite fermions in strong magnetic fields1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Its zero-field counterpart is predicted in a twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2)11,12—a recently discovered fractional Chern insulator exhibiting the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect13,14,15,16. Although transport measurements at ν = −1/2 show signatures consistent with a zero-field composite Fermi liquid14, new probes are crucial to investigate the state and its elementary excitations. Here, by using the unique valley properties of tMoTe2, we report optical signatures of a zero-field composite Fermi liquid. We measured the degree of circular polarization (ρ) of trion photoluminescence versus hole doping and electric field. We found that, within the phase space showing robust ferromagnetism, ρ is near unity for Fermi liquid states. However, ρ is quenched at both integer and fractional Chern insulators, and in a hole doping range near ν = −1/2. Temperature, optical excitation power and electric-field-dependence measurements demonstrate that the quenching of ρ is a direct consequence of an energy gap (pseudogap) for electronic excitations of the Chern insulators (composite Fermi liquid): because the local spin-polarized excitations necessary to form trions are strongly suppressed, trion formation at the corresponding filling factors relies on optically generated unpolarized itinerant holes. Our work highlights a new excitonic probe of zero-field fractional Chern insulator physics, unique to tMoTe2.",

Furthermore, they are implemented in both tethered and ingestible formats, facilitating endoscopic applications or patient self-dosing. Our study identified suitable pressure and nozzle dimensions for different segments of the gastrointestinal tract and applied microjets in a variety of devices that support delivery across the various anatomic segments of the gastrointestinal tract. We characterized the ability of these systems to administer macromolecules, including insulin, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) analogue and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) in large animal models, achieving exposure levels similar to those achieved with subcutaneous delivery.

Spatial localization of cell clusters in our in situ sequencing data using a new tool, ISS-Patcher, revealed mechanisms of progenitor zonation during bone and joint formation. Through trajectory analysis, we predicted potential non-canonical cellular origins for human chondrocytes from Schwann cells. We also introduce SNP2Cell, a tool to link cell-type-specific regulatory networks to polygenic traits such as osteoarthritis. Using osteolineage trajectories characterized here, we simulated in silico perturbations of genes that cause monogenic craniosynostosis and implicate potential cell states and disease mechanisms.

However, the mechanism by which cellular valine abundancy is sensed for subsequent cellular functions remains undefined. Here we identify that human histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) serves as a valine sensor by directly binding valine through a primate-specific SE14 repeat domain. The nucleus and cytoplasm shuttling of human, but not mouse, HDAC6 is tightly controlled by the intracellular levels of valine. Valine deprivation leads to HDAC6 retention in the nucleus and induces DNA damage. Mechanistically, nuclear-localized HDAC6 binds and deacetylates ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) to initiate active DNA demethylation, which promotes DNA damage through thymine DNA glycosylase-driven excision. Dietary valine restriction inhibits tumour growth in xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models, and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PARP inhibitors. Collectively, our study identifies human HDAC6 as a valine sensor that mediates active DNA demethylation and DNA damage in response to valine deprivation, and highlights the potential of dietary valine restriction for cancer treatment.",

The neuronal circuits that detect and relay visual features have been well studied 1–8 . Much less is known about how an animal adjusts its visual attention as its goals or environmental conditions change. During social behaviours, flies need to focus on nearby flies 9–11 . Here we study how the flow of visual information is altered when female Drosophila enter an aggressive state. From the connectome, we identify three state-dependent circuit motifs poised to modify the response of an aggressive female to fly-sized visual objects: convergence of excitatory inputs from neurons conveying select visual features and internal state; dendritic disinhibition of select visual feature detectors; and a switch that toggles between two visual feature detectors. Using cell-type-specific genetic tools, together with behavioural and neurophysiological analyses, we show that each of these circuit motifs is used during female aggression. We reveal that features of this same switch operate in male Drosophila during courtship pursuit, suggesting that disparate social behaviours may share circuit mechanisms. Our study provides a compelling example of using the connectome to infer circuit mechanisms that underlie dynamic processing of sensory signals.",

Recently, a lattice analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect at zero magnetic field has been observed, confirming the existence of a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI). Despite this, the bulk–edge correspondence—a hallmark of a FCI featuring an insulating bulk with conductive edges—has not been directly observed. In fact, this correspondence has not been visualized in any system for fractional states owing to experimental challenges. Here we report the imaging of FCI edge states in twisted MoTe2 (t-MoTe2) using microwave impedance microscopy1. By tuning the carrier density, we observe the system evolving between metallic and FCI states, the latter of which exhibits insulating bulk and conductive edges, as expected from the bulk–boundary correspondence. Further analysis suggests the composite nature of the FCI edge states. We also observe the evolution of edge states across the topological phase transition as a function of interlayer electric field and reveal exciting prospects of neighbouring domains with different fractional orders. These findings pave the way for research into topologically protected one-dimensional interfaces between various anyonic states at zero magnetic field, such as gapped one-dimensional symmetry-protected phases with non-zero topological entanglement entropy, Halperin–Laughlin interfaces and the creation of non-abelian anyons.",

However, maintaining weight loss is a considerable challenge, especially as the body seems to retain an obesogenic memory that defends against body weight changes 3,4 . Overcoming this barrier for long-term treatment success is difficult because the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Here, by using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we show that both human and mouse adipose tissues retain cellular transcriptional changes after appreciable weight loss. Furthermore, we find persistent obesity-induced alterations in the epigenome of mouse adipocytes that negatively affect their function and response to metabolic stimuli. Mice carrying this obesogenic memory show accelerated rebound weight gain, and the epigenetic memory can explain future transcriptional deregulation in adipocytes in response to further high-fat diet feeding. In summary, our findings indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory, largely on the basis of stable epigenetic changes, in mouse adipocytes and probably other cell types.

Unfortunately, the factors that underlie these limitations remain unclear and, therefore, no clear device-engineering guidelines are available. Here, by using electrically excited transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that the low efficiency of state-of-the-art green cadmium-free QD-LEDs (which ubiquitously adopt the InP–ZnSeS–ZnS core–shell–shell structure) originates from the ZnSeS interlayer because it imposes a high injection barrier that limits the electron concentration and trap saturation. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that replacing the currently widely used ZnSeS interlayer with a thickened ZnSe interlayer enables improved electron injection and depressed leakage simultaneously, allowing to achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.68% and T95 lifetime (time for the luminance to drop to 95% of the initial value) of 1,241 h at an initial brightness of 1,000 cd m–2 in green InP-based QD-LEDs emitting at 543 nm—exceeding the previous best values by a factor of 1.6 and 165, respectively3,4.",

          "abstract": "The intestine is characterized by an environment in which host requirements for nutrient and water absorption are consequently paired with the requirements to establish tolerance to the outside environment. To better understand how the intestine functions in health and disease, large efforts have been made to characterize the identity and composition of cells from different intestinal regions1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, the robustness, nature of adaptability and extent of resilience of the transcriptional landscape and cellular underpinning of the intestine in space are still poorly understood. Here we generated an integrated resource of the spatial and cellular landscape of the murine intestine in the steady and perturbed states. Leveraging these data, we demonstrated that the spatial landscape of the intestine was robust to the influence of the microbiota and was adaptable in a spatially restricted manner. Deploying a model of spatiotemporal acute inflammation, we demonstrated that both robust and adaptable features of the landscape were resilient. Moreover, highlighting the physiological relevance and value of our dataset, we identified a region of the middle colon characterized by an immune-driven multicellular spatial adaptation of structural cells to the microbiota. Our results demonstrate that intestinal regionalization is characterized by robust and resilient structural cell states and that the intestine can adapt to environmental stress in a spatially controlled manner through the crosstalk between immunity and structural cell homeostasis.",

However, the activation of carbon-fluorine bonds, the most commercially abundant organohalide and found in PFAS, or “forever chemicals”, are much rarer. Current approaches based on photoredox chemistry for activation of small molecule carbon-fluorine (C–F) bonds are limited by the substrates and transition-metal catalysts needed4. A general method for the direct activation of organofluorines would have significant value in organic and environmental chemistry. Here, we report an organic photoredox catalyst system that can efficiently reduce C–F bonds to generate carbon-centered radicals, which can then be intercepted for hydrodefluorination (swapping F for H) and cross-coupling reactions. This system enables the general use of organofluorines as synthons under mild reaction conditions. We extend this method to the defluorination of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and fluorinated polymers, a critical challenge in the breakdown of persistent and environmentally damaging forever chemicals.",

However, understanding of the core microbial processes governing river biogeochemistry is hindered by a lack of genome-resolved functional insights and sampling across multiple rivers.

GROWdb profiles the identity, distribution, function and expression of microbial genomes across river surface waters covering 90% of United States watersheds. Specifically, GROWdb encompasses microbial lineages from 27 phyla, including novel members from 10 families and 128 genera, and defines the core river microbiome at the genome level. GROWdb analyses coupled to extensive geospatial information reveals local and regional drivers of microbial community structuring, while also presenting foundational hypotheses about ecosystem function. Building on the previously conceived River Continuum Concept1, we layer on microbial functional trait expression, which suggests that the structure and function of river microbiomes is predictable. We make GROWdb available through various collaborative cyberinfrastructures2,3, so that it can be widely accessed across disciplines for watershed predictive modelling and microbiome-based management practices.",

Advances in genomics and a surge in gastrointestinal diseases 1,2 has fuelled efforts to catalogue cells constituting gastrointestinal tissues in health and disease 3 . Here we present systematic integration of 25 single-cell RNA sequencing datasets spanning the entire healthy gastrointestinal tract in development and in adulthood. We uniformly processed 385 samples from 189 healthy controls using a newly developed automated quality control approach (scAutoQC), leading to a healthy reference atlas with approximately 1.1 million cells and 136 fine-grained cell states. We anchor 12 gastrointestinal disease datasets spanning gastrointestinal cancers, coeliac disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease to this reference. Utilizing this 1.6 million cell resource (gutcellatlas.org), we discover epithelial cell metaplasia originating from stem cells in intestinal inflammatory diseases with transcriptional similarity to cells found in pyloric and Brunner’s glands. Although previously linked to mucosal healing 4 , we now implicate pyloric gland metaplastic cells in inflammation through recruitment of immune cells including T cells and neutrophils. Overall, we describe inflammation-induced changes in stem cells that alter mucosal tissue architecture and promote further inflammation, a concept applicable to other tissues and diseases.",

These require a common measure of cell similarity across the body and an efficient way to search. Here, we develop SCimilarity, a metric learning framework to learn a unified and interpretable representation that enables rapid queries of tens of millions of cell profiles from diverse studies for cells that are transcriptionally similar to an input cell profile or state. We use SCimilarity to query a 23.4 million cell atlas of 412 scRNA-seq studies for macrophage and fibroblast profiles from interstitial lung disease1 and reveal similar cell profiles across other fibrotic diseases and tissues. The top scoring in vitro hit for the macrophage query was a 3D hydrogel system2, which we experimentally demonstrated reproduces this cell state. SCimilarity serves as a foundation model for single-cell profiles that enables researchers to query for similar cellular states across the human body, providing a powerful tool for generating biological insights from the Human Cell Atlas.",

          "abstract": "C 4 photosynthesis is used by the most productive plants on the planet, and compared with the ancestral C 3 pathway, it confers a 50% increase in efficiency 1 . In more than 60 C 4 lineages, CO 2 fixation is compartmentalized between tissues, and bundle-sheath cells become photosynthetically activated 2 . How the bundle sheath acquires this alternate identity that allows efficient photosynthesis is unclear. Here we show that changes to bundle-sheath gene expression in C 4 leaves are associated with the gain of a pre-existing cis -code found in the C 3 leaf. From single-nucleus gene-expression and chromatin-accessibility atlases, we uncover DNA binding with one finger (DOF) motifs that define bundle-sheath identity in the major crops C 3 rice and C 4 sorghum. Photosynthesis genes that are rewired to be strongly expressed in the bundle-sheath cells of C 4 sorghum acquire cis -elements that are recognized by DOFs. Our findings are consistent with a simple model in which C 4 photosynthesis is based on the recruitment of an ancestral cis -code associated with bundle-sheath identity. Gain of such elements harnessed a stable patterning of transcription factors between cell types that are found in both C 3 and C 4 leaves to activate photosynthesis in the bundle sheath. Our findings provide molecular insights into the evolution of the complex C 4 pathway, and might also guide the rational engineering of C 4 photosynthesis in C 3 crops to improve crop productivity and resilience 3,4 .",

          "abstract": "Multicomponent reactions – those where three or more substrates combine into a product – have been highly useful in rapidly building chemical building blocks of increased complexity4, but achieving this enzymatically has remained rare.5 This limitation primarily arises because an enzyme’s active site is not typically set up to address multiple substrates, especially in cases involving multiple radical intermediates6. Recently, chemical catalytic radical sorting has emerged as an enabling strategy for a variety of useful reactions7,8. However, making such processes enantioselective is highly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in the stereochemical control of radicals9. Here, we repurpose a thiamine-dependent enzyme10,11 through directed evolution, combine it with photoredox catalysis, to achieve a photobiocatalytic enantioselective three-component radical cross-coupling. This approach combines three readily available starting materials — aldehydes, α-bromo-carbonyls and alkenes — to give access to enantioenriched ketone products. Mechanistic investigations provide insights into how this dual photo-/enzyme system precisely directs the three distinct radicals involved in the transformation, unlocking new enzyme reactivity. Our approach has achieved exceptional stereoselectivity, with 25 out of 33 examples achieving ≥97% enantiomeric excess.",

Indeed, it has a central role in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which aims to limit the increase in this temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. Accurate estimates of how the global temperature has changed over time are therefore crucial for tracking efforts to mitigate the threat of climate change. Writing in Nature, Sippel et al.1 provide evidence that existing estimates for between 1900 and 1930 are too low, owing to an unresolved systematic error in ocean surface temperatures. Correcting the record would improve researchers’ understanding of long-term temperature change and its causes.",

Humans, like nearly all living things, are fuelled by the products of photosynthesis. However, the central enzyme of the process can engage in non-productive reactions in hot and dry climates, which poses a problem for crop growing as global temperatures increase. Writing in Nature, Swift et al.1 create comprehensive maps of where photosynthesis genes are turned on and off in the leaves of rice (Oryza sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), a plant that bypasses the problem of inefficiency by using an alternative mode of photosynthesis. Differences in these maps enabled the authors to decipher codes that might pave the way for engineering this alternative, and efficient, version of photosynthesis in rice.",

Overcoming this challenge is crucial to building a practical quantum computer.

          "abstract": "Public trust in scientists is critical to our ability to face societal threats. Here, across five pre-registered studies (N = 2,034), we assessed whether perceptions of scientists’ intellectual humility affect perceived trustworthiness of scientists and their research. In study 1, we found that seeing scientists as higher in intellectual humility was associated with greater perceived trustworthiness of scientists and support for science-based beliefs. We then demonstrated that describing a scientist as high (versus low) in intellectual humility increased perceived trustworthiness of the scientist (studies 2–4), belief in their research (studies 2–4), intentions to follow their research-based recommendations (study 3) and information-seeking behaviour (study 4). We further demonstrated that these effects were not moderated by the scientist’s gender (study 3) or race/ethnicity (study 4). In study 5, we experimentally tested communication approaches that scientists can use to convey intellectual humility. These studies reveal the benefits of seeing scientists as intellectually humble across medical, psychological and climate science topics.",

          "abstract": "Menstrual taboos are pervasive today and are often based on ideas of purity and impurity and include practices of seclusion. In western Nepal, the tradition of chhaupadi prohibits menstruating individuals from cooking and they must spend the time outside the home2. Seclusion may also be evident in ancient societies. In the UK, taboos surrounding menstruation have led to period poverty. Although negative menstrual taboos are nearly universal, there are exceptions. Ojibwe women (Minnesota) traditionally secluded themselves for the duration of their period, which was seen as a healthy time of rest, regeneration and a way to celebrate womanhood.\n\nFew studies have been able to detect evidence of menstrual seclusion archaeologically. Evidence can be detected when it is deemed important enough to consider. An example of archaeological evidence of menstruation and seclusion is at the Newt Kash shelter (eastern Kentucky). Claassen3 determined that the activities conducted within the shelter (the production of string and cord) were ‘women’s activities’ carried out during menstruation. Equally, menstrual huts are often used for childbirth and the pacifiers, cradleboards and a child’s mobile could be evidence of children and women using this space at times of ‘impurity’3.",

We assess this over four studies ( n = 1,145). We reveal that the valence of information sought affects mental health, which in turn influences the valence of information sought, forming a self-reinforcing loop. We quantified the valence of text on webpages participants chose to browse using natural language processing and found that browsing more negative information was associated with worse mental health and mood. By manipulating the webpages browsed and measuring mood and vice versa, we show that the relationship is causal and bidirectional. Finally, we developed an intervention that altered web-browsing patterns in a manner that improved mood. Together, the findings suggest that the information sought reflects mental state and shapes it, creating a loop that may perpetuate mental health problems. The results also provide a potential method for assessing and enhancing welfare in the digital age.",

          "abstract": "Young adults from low socioeconomic backgrounds face an increased risk of early mortality. Here we utilize population-wide data from 17 Norwegian birth cohorts (N = 986,573) to assess whether this risk gradient was explained by early-life educational performance, specifically grade point average at 16 years of age. We show that the gradients in both parental education and income largely disappeared when adjusting for school performance in the models. Specifically, among boys, those with the lowest parental education had an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.86–2.22) compared with peers with the highest parental education, while for girls, the HR was 1.64 (95% CI 1.35–1.93). After adjusting for school performance, these estimates dropped to 0.99 (95% CI 0.79–1.19) for boys and 0.87 (95% CI 0.55–1.19) for girls. Similarly, the mortality risk for those from the lowest parental income quartile decreased from 1.79 (95% CI 1.67–1.91) to 1.25 (95% CI 1.12–1.38) for boys and from 1.63 (95% CI 1.44–1.83) to 1.24 (95% CI 1.03–1.46) for girls. Low educational performance remained strongly associated with early mortality in analyses accounting for unobserved heterogeneity at the family level; boys with a grade point average in the lowest quartile had an HR of 3.04 (95% CI 2.38–3.89), while for girls, the HR was 1.79 (95% CI 1.22–2.63). External causes of death, particularly accidents and poisoning, were most overrepresented among individuals with poor school performance.",

Many individuals share such links without first reading the linked information. Here we analysed over 35 million public Facebook posts with uniform resource locators shared between 2017 and 2020, and discovered that such ‘shares without clicks’ (SwoCs) constitute around 75% of forwarded links. Extreme and user-aligned political content received more SwoCs, with partisans engaging in it more than politically neutral users. In addition, analyses with 2,969 false uniform resource locators revealed higher shares and, hence, SwoCs by conservatives (76.94%) than liberals (14.25%), probably because, in our dataset, the vast majority (76–82%) of them originated from conservative news domains. Findings suggest that the virality of political content on social media (including misinformation) is driven by superficial processing of headlines and blurbs rather than systematic processing of core content, which has design implications for promoting deliberate discourse in the online public sphere.",

In the case of most menstrual and menopausal policies to date, this appears to be the menstruating body (and ‘women’ by association), rather than universal menstrual ignorance and taboos, associated discriminatory beliefs and practices, and those who profit from these things.\n\nFor instance, when we talk about ‘period poverty’ (in the Global North) and ‘menstrual hygiene management’ (in the Global South), the policy solution is typically ‘access to disposable period products’. Subsequently, the problem of period poverty or poor menstrual hygiene management is represented as ‘(unmanaged) periods make girls or women miss school or work’3. This, unfortunately, frames periods and female bodies as the problem rather than the government policies and societal gender inequalities that directly contribute to increasing poverty especially among women and girls4; or the fact that most schools (and workplaces) are not fit for people who menstruate5; or the huge profit margins involved in the sale of expensive disposable period products (and other products subject to ‘pink tax’)3.",

For others, including those who have prioritized professional ambitions or suffered medical setbacks, the years of peak fertility are far too short. And with menopause comes a new menu of irksome side effects and serious health concerns, which include a sharp increase in the risks of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. For these reasons, biomedicine views menopause not only as a public health priority but also often as a medical condition.\n\nThe medicalization of menopause, similar to that of ageing or pregnancy, serves a practical purpose in directing research efforts towards improving health and quality of life for women. At its most literal, this perspective has stimulated new interest in clinical interventions to delay menopause1. However, the development of sound clinical approaches can be improved by understanding menopause within its context as a natural phenomenon that is shaped by evolutionary processes. Evolutionary thinking about menopause often involves hypotheses about the past that are only of tangential interest in medicine, but evolutionary perspectives also have a lot to offer for understanding the interactions of reproduction, health and our complex environments.",

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had profound impacts on tourist behaviour and psychology. Understanding tourists’ behavioural and psychological responses to the pandemic is crucial for tourism businesses to manage and sustain post-COVID-19 tourism recovery. To address whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced tourists’ thoughts and behaviours and the extent to which these changes might persist, we provide a narrative Review of the research on tourist behaviours and the psychological impacts of the pandemic. This Review delves into three themes: tourists’ decision-making behaviour; the psychological impacts of the pandemic on tourists; and tourists’ responses to crisis communication strategies. We argue that crisis communication strategies across sectors, pandemic-induced uncertainties and risks and psychological impacts were the predominant influences on tourists’ travel decisions during the pandemic. We conclude by discussing which changes are likely to be sustained.",

The results revealed 16 pleiotropic loci ( P &lt; 5 × 10 −8 ) jointly associated with rhythm impairment and dyslexia, and intricate shared genetic and neurobiological architectures. The joint genetic signal was enriched for foetal and adult brain cell-specific regulatory regions, highlighting complex cellular composition in their shared underpinnings. Local genetic correlation with a key white matter tract (the left superior longitudinal fasciculus-I) substantiated hypotheses about auditory–motor connectivity as a genetically influenced, evolutionarily relevant neural endophenotype common to rhythm and language processing. Overall, we provide empirical evidence of multiple aspects of shared biology linking language and musical rhythm, contributing novel insight into the evolutionary relationships between human musicality and linguistic communication traits.",

          "authors": "Yakov Pichkar, Alexandra Surowiec, Nicole Creanza",
          "abstract": "The history of people’s movements and interactions shapes both genetic and linguistic variation. Genes and languages are transmitted separately and their distributions reflect different aspects of human history, but some demographic processes can cause them to be similarly distributed. In particular, forms of societal organization, including movements in and out of a community, may have shaped the transmission of both genes and languages. If children were more likely to learn their mother’s language than their father’s when their parents were from populations that spoke different languages or dialects, then language variation might show a closer association with maternally transmitted genetic markers than autosomal ones; this association could be further reinforced if children reside with predominantly maternal kin. We analyze the worldwide relationship between linguistic and genomic variation, leveraging the sex-biased transmission of X chromosomes to assess whether language has tended to be preferentially transmitted along the male or female line. In addition, we measure the effects of postmarital residence with female kin, matrilineal descent, and endogamy on the covariation of mitochondrial DNA and languages, using mtDNA because genomic data were available for very few populations with these ethnographic traits. We find that while there is little evidence for a consistent or widespread sex bias in the transmission of language, such biased transmission may have occurred locally in several parts of the world and might have been influenced by population-level ethnographic characteristics, such as female-based descent or residence patterns. Our results highlight the complex relationships between genes, language, ethnography, and geography.",

          "abstract": "Although the theoretical foundations of the modern field of cultural evolution have been in place for over 50 y, laboratory experiments specifically designed to test cultural evolutionary theory have only existed for the last two decades. Here, we review the main experimental designs used in the field of cultural evolution, as well as major findings related to the generation of cultural variation, content- and model-based biases, cumulative cultural evolution, and nonhuman culture. We then identify methodological advances that demonstrate the iterative improvement of cultural evolution experimental methods. Finally, we focus on one common critique of cultural evolution experiments, the appropriate individual learning control condition needed to demonstrate cumulative culture, and present an original experimental investigation relevant to this critique. Participants completed a combinatorial innovation task allowing for cumulative improvement over time in one of four commonly used experimental designs/conditions: social learners in chains, social learners in groups, individual learners experiencing an extended session lasting the same accumulated time as an entire chain or group, and individual learners experiencing repeated sessions adding up to the same total time. We found that repeated individual learning resulted in superior performance to any other condition. We discuss these findings in light of the relevance of the specific criticism of previous experimental studies that purport to have demonstrated cumulative culture. We also use our findings to discuss the broad trade-offs that participants face when learning individually and socially in different contexts, including variable acquisition costs, redundancy of effort in groups, and cognitive and motivational fatigue.",

          "abstract": "Climate change poses complex risks without precedent that challenge established planning and risk management tools, including property insurance. The nature and timing of transitions in markets and institutions in response to growing climate risks will shape prospects for future socioeconomic well-being. As property insurance markets in the United States face higher levels of turmoil, policymakers are weighing various interventions to stabilize not only insurance but also housing and mortgage markets. We identify policy lessons based on the investigation of three bounding scenarios designed to address the question of how near-term (1 to 3 y) policy and regulatory choices surrounding insurance markets in Florida could influence medium-term (3 to 15 y) risk levels, disaster recovery, housing markets, and local economic outcomes. Since our policy choices today have a profound impact on future outcomes, careful consideration of the longer-term impacts of today’s policy choices is required to secure more effective and equitable adaptation decisions and pathways.",

These studies incorporated cultural transmission and its interaction with genetics in contributing to patterns of human variation. Neither CE nor GCC results were consistent with racist claims of ubiquitous genetic differences between socially defined races. We summarize how genetic data refute the notion of racial substructure for human populations and address naive interpretations of race across the biological sciences, including those related to ancestry, health, and intelligence, that help to perpetuate racist ideas.

          "abstract": "Cultural evolution applies evolutionary concepts and tools to explain the change of culture over time. Despite advances in both theoretical and empirical methods, the connections between cultural evolutionary theory and evidence are often vague, limiting progress. Theoretical models influence empirical research but rarely guide data collection and analysis in logical and transparent ways. Theoretical models themselves are often too abstract to apply to specific empirical contexts and guide statistical inference. To help bridge this gap, we outline a quality-assurance computational workflow that starts from generative models of empirical phenomena and logically connects statistical estimates to both theory and real-world explanatory goals. We emphasize and demonstrate validation of the workflow using synthetic data. Using the interplay between conformity, migration, and cultural diversity as a case study, we present coded and repeatable examples of directed acyclic graphs, tailored agent-based simulations, a probabilistic transmission model for longitudinal data, and an approximate Bayesian computation model for cross-sectional data. We discuss the assumptions, opportunities, and pitfalls of different approaches to generative modeling and show how each can be used to improve data analysis depending on the structure of available data and the depth of theoretical understanding. Throughout, we highlight the significance of ethnography and of collecting basic cultural and demographic information about study populations and call for more emphasis on logical and theory-driven workflows as part of science reform.",

          "abstract": "Modern cultural evolution theory adopts a variety of concepts and methods developed in mathematical biology, in particular population genetics theory. In addition to forward-looking approaches such as two-locus models, backward-looking approaches such as coalescent theory, which describe ancestral states of the current population, have played an important role in population genetics. Here, we show how forward and backward approaches can be applied to two examples in cultural evolution. The first example deals with the number of cultural traits, which can be analyzed by a backward approach. Cultural coalescent theory illustrates many unique aspects of cultural processes such as information transfer (i.e., social learning) from many donors (“cultural parents”), including or excluding the biological parents. Theory predicts that many cultural traits of intermediate (or higher) frequency (popularity) can exist that are surprisingly old. Many unsolved issues remain, however, such as how to incorporate social structure as well as natural and/or cultural selection, which we believe to be an urgent agenda. The second example is the punishment of sibling incest, a problem to which cultural coalescent theory cannot currently be usefully applied. By analyzing forward recursions, we show that punishment is ineffective in suppressing incest, unless the incestuous inclination is diminished by the presence of punishers. Based on these examples, we discuss the merits and demerits of forward and backward approaches.",

          "abstract": "Cultural evolutionary processes can often lead to a statistical association between neutral and adaptive traits during episodes of population dispersal and the introduction of a beneficial technology in a geographic region. Here, we examine such cultural hitchhiking processes using an individual-based model that portrays the cultural interaction between a migrant and an incumbent population. Our model is loosely based on the interaction between farming and foraging populations during the initial stages of the adoption and diffusion of agricultural practices. The two populations are characterized by different variants for their neutral and adaptive cultural traits, with the latter set providing a reproductive advantage for the migrant communities over the incumbent ones. We explore how the neutral traits of the migrant population spread and how this process is conditioned by the following factors: 1) the possibility of transmission of the adaptive traits; 2) the extent of the increased reproductive advantage provided by the adaptive variants of the migrant population; 3) postmarital residence rules; and 4) how and when neutral traits are transmitted. Our results reveal a diverse range of outputs, highlighting the relevance of factors such as the nature of postmarital resocialization and the specific combination of postmarital residence rules and sex-biased transmission.",

          "abstract": "We examine from whom children learn in mobile hunter-gatherers, a way of life that characterized much of human history. Recent studies on the modes of transmission in hunter-gatherers are reviewed before presenting an analysis of five modes of transmission described by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman [L. L. Cavalli-Sforza, M. W. Feldman, Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach (1981)] but not previously evaluated in hunter-gatherer research. We also present two modes of group transmission, conformist transmission, and concerted transmission, seldom mentioned in hunter-gatherer social learning research, and propose a unique mode of group transmission called cumulative transmission. The analysis of the additional modes of transmission indicated that cultural evolutionary signatures of vertical transmission, such as the conservation of cultural traits, have been underestimated because previous studies have seldom considered remote generations or distinguished intrafamilial from extrafamilial horizontal and oblique transmission. However, field data also indicate that hunter-gatherer children interacted with and learned from many nongenetically related individuals; about half of children’s and adolescents’ horizontal and oblique social learning came from nongenetically related individuals. Intimate living conditions of hunter-gatherers provide opportunities for group transmission, and ethnographic evidence presented demonstrates that at least three types of group transmission exist. All three forms of group transmission theoretically contribute to the conservation of culture, homogeneity of intracultural diversity, and high intercultural diversity. Analysis of additional modes of oblique and horizontal transmission and discussion of previous and unique modes of group transmission demonstrate the various mechanisms by which hunter-gatherer children learn and how cultures are conserved and contribute to cumulative culture.",

          "abstract": "In response to the disruption of gas supplies from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, European politicians and public utilities appealed to citizens and customers to conserve natural gas. Moreover, they strengthened economic incentives for gas conservation. In fact, a substantial amount of natural gas was saved during the winter of 2022/23. This raises the question to what extent this success is attributable to government and corporate means to foster energy conservation in the crisis, including energy policies such as the German government’s “gas price brake,” gas-saving programs launched by public utilities, and consumers’ individual pricing schemes. We analyzed the effectiveness of these means using a survey and a field experiment with a German gas supplier and show that, while household savings during the crisis were substantial, economic incentives did not significantly change behavior. Indeed, demand for gas is largely price inelastic. A large majority of consumers do not understand the incentives arising from the gas price brake, and when they do, they do not respond. Likewise, consumers do not react to the design of the utilities’ gas-saving program. These findings suggest that i) citizens’ response to marginal individual economic incentives contributes little to overall gas savings, and ii) the crisis, along with the extensive societal engagement it generated, likely shifted the public’s mindset about energy consumption, making conservation a social priority.",

          "abstract": "The last two decades have seen great advances in the study of social learning (learning from others), in part due to efforts to identify it in the wild as the basis of behavioral traditions. Theoretical frameworks suggest that both the dynamics of social tolerance and transmission biases (or social learning strategies) influence the pathways of information diffusion in social groups. Bearded capuchins ( Sapajus libidinosus ) inhabiting the semiarid seasonal caatinga biome of the Serra da Capivara National Park (SCNP) form highly tolerant societies that possess the largest “tool-kit” described for monkeys, a feat likely facilitated by social learning. Here, we used social network analysis and an open diffusion experiment using an extractive foraging task to identify the occurrence of social learning and describe the pathways of social transmission of information in two wild primate populations. The dynamics of social tolerance outside of task introductions predicted opportunities for social learning, but it was tolerance during task introductions that predicted the actual pathways of social information diffusion. Our results also indicated that the capuchins mainly learned from others via direct observation and naïve individuals exhibited an observation bias toward successful males. This study supports the claims of cultural transmission in robust capuchins and empirically supports the role of social tolerance and social learning strategies in human and nonhuman primate cultural evolution.",

          "abstract": "Cultural practices perceived to be adaptive—from clearing land for food production to medical innovations—can disseminate quickly through human populations. However, these same practices often have unintended maladaptive effects. A particularly consequential effect is the emergence of diseases. In numerous instances, a cultural change is followed by the appearance of a new pathogen. Here, we develop mathematical models to analyze the population processes through which cultural evolution precipitates the emergence of a new disease. We find that when a risk-bearing cultural practice spreads, emergence can be an unavoidable cost even if a safer alternative practice eventually evolves from the original. Social learning and a fitness advantage associated with the evolving practice drive early disease emergence but the two factors have distinct effects on the time to mutation of the pathogen and significant stochastic variation is observed. For example, a disease can take longer to emerge in a population that adopts the risk-bearing practice quickly than in a population that is slow to transition. Extending the model to explore the effects of an alternative practice evolving from the original, we find a nonmonotonic relationship between relative risk of the two practices and the median time to disease emergence. Our findings contribute to understanding how cultural evolution can shape pathogen evolution and highlight the unpredictability of disease emergence.",

It is, however, difficult to assess when children first achieve linguistic productivity simply because we rarely know all the utterances a child has experienced. The onset of linguistic productivity has been at the heart of a long-standing theoretical question in language acquisition––do children come to language learning with abstract categories that they deploy from the earliest moments of acquisition? We address the problem of when linguistic productivity begins by marrying longitudinal behavioral observations and computational modeling to capitalize on the strengths of each. We used behavioral data to assess when a sample of 64 English-learning children began to productively combine determiners and nouns, a linguistic construction previously used to address this theoretical question. After the onset of productivity, the children produced determiner–noun combinations that were not attested in our sample of their linguistic input from caregivers. We used computational techniques to model the onsets and trajectories of determiner–noun combinations in these 64 children, as well as characteristics of their utterances in which the determiner was omitted. Because we knew exactly what input the model was trained on, we could, with confidence, know that the model had gone beyond its input. The parallels found between child and model in the timing and number of novel combinations suggest that the children too were creatively going beyond their input.",

          "abstract": "Indirect reciprocity is a key explanation for the exceptional magnitude of cooperation among humans. This literature suggests that a large proportion of human cooperation is driven by social norms and individuals’ incentives to maintain a good reputation. This intuition has been formalized with two types of models. In public assessment models, all community members are assumed to agree on each others’ reputations; in private assessment models, people may have disagreements. Both types of models aim to understand the interplay of social norms and cooperation. Yet their results can be vastly different. Public assessment models argue that cooperation can evolve easily and that the most effective norms tend to be stern. Private assessment models often find cooperation to be unstable, and successful norms show some leniency. Here, we propose a model that can organize these differing results within a single framework. We show that the stability of cooperation depends on a single quantity: the extent to which individual opinions turn out to be correlated. This correlation is determined by a group’s norms and the structure of social interactions. In particular, we prove that no cooperative norm is evolutionarily stable when individual opinions are statistically independent. These results have important implications for our understanding of cooperation, conformity, and polarization.",

          "abstract": "Human evolution is intricately linked with culture, which permeates almost all facets of human life from health and reproduction, to the environments in which we live. Nevertheless, our understanding of the ways in which stably transmitted, evolutionarily relevant human cultural traits might interact with the human genome is incomplete, and methods to detect such interactions are limited. Here, we describe some rules of cultural transmission which could pertain to both humans and cultural nonhuman animals that could lead to the formation and maintenance of stable associations between cultural and genetic traits. Next, we show that, in the presence of such associations, a process analogous to genetic hitchhiking is possible in gene–culture systems. These could leave signatures in the human genome similar to, and perhaps indistinguishable from, those left by selection on genetic traits. Finally, we model selective interference between cultural and genetic traits. We show that selective interference between a cultural trait under selection and a genetic trait under selection can reduce the efficacy of natural selection in the human genome, both in terms of the probability of fixation of beneficial alleles and the dynamics of selective sweeps. We then show that the efficiency of selection at genetic loci can, however, be increased in the presence of strong cultural transmission biases. This implies that the signatures of gene–culture interactions in genetic data may be complex and wide-ranging in gene–culture coevolutionary systems.",

However, therapeutic outcomes are compromised by low MSC retention and survival rates in corpus cavernosum tissue. Here, we developed an innovative magnetic soft microrobot comprising an ultrasoft hydrogel microsphere embedded with a magnetic nanoparticle chain for MSC delivery. This design also features phenylboronic acid groups for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). With a Young’s modulus of less than 1 kPa, the ultrasoft microrobot adapts its shape within narrow blood vessels, ensuring a uniform distribution of MSCs within the corpus cavernosum. Our findings showed that compared with traditional MSC injections, the MSC delivery microrobot (MSC-Rob) significantly enhanced MSC retention and survival. In both rat and beagle ED models, MSC-Rob treatment accelerated the repair of corpus cavernosum tissue and restored erectile function. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that MSC-Rob treatment facilitates nerve and blood vessel regeneration in the corpus cavernosum by increasing the presence of regenerative macrophages. Overall, our MSC-Rob not only advances the clinical application of MSCs for ED therapy but also broadens the scope of microrobots for other cell therapies.",

          "abstract": "Rhodopsin, the prototypical class-A G-protein coupled receptor, is a highly sensitive receptor for light that enables phototransduction in rod photoreceptors. Rhodopsin plays not only a sensory role but also a structural role as a major component of the rod outer segment disc, comprising over 90% of the protein content of the disc membrane. Mutations in RHO which lead to structural or functional abnormalities, including the autosomal recessive E150K mutation, result in rod dysfunction and death. Therefore, correction of deleterious rhodopsin mutations could rescue inherited retinal degeneration, as demonstrated for other visual genes such as RPE65 and PDE6B. In this study, we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 adenine base editing strategy to correct the E150K mutation and demonstrate precise in vivo editing in a Rho -E150K mouse model of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and the G-protein activation assay, we characterized wild-type rhodopsin and rhodopsin variants containing bystander base edits. Subretinal injection of dual-adeno-associated viruses delivering our base editing strategy yielded up to 44% Rho correction in homozygous Rho -E150K mice. Injection at postnatal day 15, but not later time points, restored rhodopsin expression, partially rescued retinal function, and partially preserved retinal structure. These findings demonstrate that in vivo base editing can restore the function of mutated structural and functional proteins in animal models of disease, including rhodopsin-associated RP and suggest that the timing of gene-editing is a crucial determinant of successful treatment outcomes for degenerative genetic diseases.",

Traditional anthropological divisions of “foragers” and “farmers” have shaped our understanding of ancient cultivation practices but have several limitations, including how people stewarded and managed nondomesticated species. To investigate the long-term effects of plant management in the Pacific Northwest, this study focuses on beaked hazelnut ( Corylus cornuta ) which has a long, precolonial history of management, transportation, and cultivation in British Columbia (BC, Canada). In particular, isolated hazelnut populations in northwestern BC are thought to be the result of historical transplanting and management. We sampled individual hazelnuts (n = 219) representing three distinct regions in and assessed 9,650 genome-wide SNPs identified with nextRAD genotyping-by-sequencing libraries to test for population genetic structure. We used linear measurements of individuals to assess morphological phenotypes and to identify variation between individuals and lineages. These data reveal shared genetic clusters in distant and disjunct northwestern and interior regions consistent with the movement of humans across the landscape. We also find several small genetically distinct populations in the northwestern region. The Genetic structure of hazelnut in the previously labeled “disjunct” region in Gitxsan, Ts’msyen, and Nis g a’a homelands is consistent with the enduring influence of people on the distribution of purportedly “wild” plant species. Our results support the hypothesis that hazelnut was likely transplanted long distances and also managed in situ. This study highlights the often-overlooked agency of Indigenous Peoples in shaping species range distributions in North America.",

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has been reported to allosterically activate iPLA 2 , and this has now been verified with a lipidomics-based mixed-micelle assay, but its mechanism of action has been unknown. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was employed to identify ATP interaction peptide regions located within the ankyrin repeat domain at which ATP interacts. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which ATP binds to its site and the main residues that interact. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to verify the importance of these residues in the role of ATP in regulating iPLA 2 activity. Importantly, calcium was found to abolish the enhancing regulatory function of ATP and to promote the inhibitory activity by calmodulin. Given previous evidence that calcium does not bind directly to iPLA 2 , its effect appears to be indirect via association with ATP and/or calmodulin. Using HDX-MS, we found that calmodulin interacts with the N terminus peptide region of iPLA 2 consisting of residues 20 to 28. These two regulatory iPLA 2 sites open the road to the development of potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, debilitating inflammatory skin disease with a poorly understood immunopathogenesis. Here, we report that HS lesional skin is characterized by the expansion of innate lymphocytes and T cells expressing CD2, an essential activation receptor and adhesion molecule. Lymphocytes expressing elevated CD2 predominated with unique spatial distribution throughout the epidermis and hypodermis in the HS lesion. CD2 + cells were mainly innate lymphocytes expressing the NK cell marker, CD56, and CD4 + T cells. Importantly, these CD2 + cells interacted with CD58 (LFA3) expressing epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the hypodermis. Granzyme A bright NKT cells (CD2 + CD3 + CD56 bright ) clustered with α-SMA expressing fibroblasts juxtaposed to epithelialized tunnels and fibrotic regions of the hypodermis. Whereas NK cells (CD2 + CD56 dim ) were perforin + , granzymes A + and B + , and enriched adjacent to hyperplastic follicular epidermis and tunnels of HS showing presence of apoptotic cells. The cytokines IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18, which enhance NK cell maturation and function were significantly elevated in HS. Ex vivo HS skin explant cultures treated with CD2:CD58 interaction-blocking anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody attenuated secretion of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and suppressed inflammatory gene signature. Additionally, CD2:CD58 blockade altered miRNAs involved in NK/NKT differentiation and/or function. In summary, we show that a cellular network of heterogenous NKT and NK cell populations drives inflammation and is critical in the pathobiology of HS, including tunnel formation and fibrosis. Finally, CD2 blockade is a viable immunotherapeutic approach for the effective management of HS.",

We utilized precise optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques to modulate these neurons, which significantly alleviated behaviors associated with pain and anxiety. Our investigations revealed an inhibitory pathway from the LHb GABAergic neurons to the posterior paraventricular thalamus. Activation of this pathway primarily mitigated pain-related behaviors, with minimal effects on anxiety. Conversely, interactions between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons within the LHb were essential in alleviating both pain and anxiety following trigeminal nerve damage. Additionally, we identified that β-sitosterol interacts directly with LHb GABAergic neurons via the estrogen receptor α, providing dual therapeutic effects for both pain and anxiety. These findings highlight the critical role of reduced GABAergic neuronal activity in the LHb in the intersection of pain and anxiety, pointing to promising therapeutic possibilities.",

These ganglion cells project to the visual cortex, but to reveal its intrinsic contribution to conscious vision is technically challenging as it requires melanopsin to be separated from the responses originating in the rods and three cone classes. Using a display engineered to isolate the melanopic visual response, we show that it detects lowpass spatial (≤0.35 cycles per degree) and temporal image content (≤1 Hz) but cannot reconstruct the stimulus form necessary for object recognition. We demonstrate that a model of the spatially diffuse intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells’ sampling structure is predictive of the measured image reconstruction limits of melanopic spatial vision. Separately, we find that under five-photoreceptor silent substitution conditions, rod pathways alone can support form vision in bright lighting when typically thought to be in saturation. Form vision that is absent from melanopsin can be only perceived in mixtures of both melanopsin and rod signals because it is the rod pathway that sees the form. Our findings show that melanopsin’s unique tuning to the diffuse and slow-changing elements in the world provides a stabilized reference point for vision.",

          "abstract": "The Bayesian confidence hypothesis (BCH), which postulates that confidence reflects the posterior probability that a decision is correct, is currently the most prominent theory of confidence. Although several recent studies have found evidence against it in the context of relatively complex tasks, BCH remains dominant for simpler tasks. The major alternative to BCH is the confidence in raw evidence space (CRES) hypothesis, according to which confidence is based directly on the raw sensory evidence without explicit probability computations. Here, we tested these competing hypotheses in the context of perceptual tasks that are assumed to induce Gaussian evidence distributions. We show that providing information about task difficulty gives rise to a basic behavioral signature that distinguishes BCH from CRES models even for simple 2-choice tasks. We examined this signature in three experiments and found that all experiments exhibited behavioral signatures in line with CRES computations but contrary to BCH ones. We further performed an extensive comparison of 16 models that implemented either BCH or CRES confidence computations and systematically differed in their auxiliary assumptions. These model comparisons provided overwhelming support for the CRES models over their BCH counterparts across all model variants and across all three experiments. These observations challenge BCH and instead suggest that humans may make confidence judgments by placing criteria directly in the space of the sensory evidence.",

          "abstract": "Why microbes harm their hosts is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology with broad relevance to our understanding of infectious diseases. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this \"evolution of virulence.\" In this perspective, we reexamine one of these hypotheses in the specific context of the human gut microbiome, namely short-sighted evolution. According to the short-sighted evolution hypothesis, virulence is a product of niche expansion within a colonized host, whereby variants of commensal microbes establish populations in tissues and sites where the infection causes morbidity or mortality. This evolution is short-sighted in that the evolved variants that infect those tissues and sites are not transmitted to other hosts. The specific hypothesis that we propose is that some bacteria responsible for invasive infections and disease are the products of the short-sighted evolution of commensal bacteria residing in the gut microbiota. We present observations in support of this hypothesis and discuss the challenges inherent in assessing its general application to infections and diseases associated with specific members of the gut microbiota. We then describe how this hypothesis can be tested using genomic data and animal model experiments and outline how such studies will serve to provide fundamental information about both the evolution and genetic basis of virulence, and the bacteria of intensively studied yet poorly understood habitats including the gut microbiomes of humans and other mammals.",

The unique functional properties of this material critically depend on its ability to transport charge in the form of polarons, namely narrow electron wavepackets accompanied by local distortions of the crystal lattice. It is currently well established that the most important polymorphs of TiO 2 , the rutile and anatase phases, harbor small electron polarons and small hole polarons, respectively. However, whether additional polaronic species exist in TiO 2 , and under which conditions, remain open questions. Here, we provide definitive answers to these questions by exploring the rich landscape of polaron quasiparticles in TiO 2 via recently developed ab initio techniques. In addition to the already known small polarons, we identify three species, namely a large hole polaron in rutile, a large quasi-two-dimensional electron polaron in anatase, and a large exciton polaron in anatase. These findings complete the puzzle on the polaron physics of TiO 2 and pave the way for systematically probing and manipulating polarons in a broad class of complex oxides and quantum materials.",

The integrity of the lens plasma membrane is crucial for maintaining lens cellular structure, homeostasis, and transparency. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a selenoenzyme, plays a critical role in protecting against lipid peroxidation. This study aims to elucidate the role of GPX4 in lens plasma membrane stability during lens development using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo systems. Our findings reveal that GPX4 deficiency triggers lens epithelial apoptosis-independent but ferroptosis-mediated cell death. Blocking lens GPX4 activity during ex vivo culture induces lens opacification, LEC death, and disruption of lens fiber cell arrangement. Deletion of lens-specific Gpx4 results in significant unsaturated phospholipid loss and an increase in oxidized phospholipids. Consequently, lenses with Gpx4 deficiency exhibit massive disruption of lens fiber cell structure, significant loss of LECs via ferroptosis, and formation of newborn cataracts. Remarkably, administering the lipid peroxidation inhibitor, liproxstatin-1, to pregnant mothers at embryonic days 9.5 significantly prevents lipid peroxidation, LEC death, and lens developmental defects. Our study unveils the crucial role of GPX4 in lens development and transparency, and also provides a successful intervention approach to prevent lens developmental defects through lipid peroxidation inhibition.",

In many situations, microbes assemble themselves into densely packed multispecies biofilms. The density and complexity pose acute difficulties for visualizing individual cells and analyzing their interactions. Here, we address this problem through an unconventional application of expansion microscopy, which allows for the “decrowding” of individual bacterial cells within a multispecies community. Expansion microscopy generally has been carried out under isotropic expansion conditions and used as a resolution-enhancing method. In our variation of expansion microscopy, we carry out expansion under heterotropic conditions; that is, we expand the space between bacterial cells but not the space within individual cells. The separation of individual bacterial cells from each other reflects the competition between the expansion force pulling them apart and the adhesion force holding them together. We employed heterotropic expansion microscopy to study the relative strength of adhesion in model biofilm communities. These included mono- and dual-species Streptococcus biofilms and a three-species synthetic community ( Fusobacterium nucleatum , Streptococcus mutans , and Streptococcus sanguinis ) under conditions that facilitated interspecies coaggregation. Using adhesion mutants, we investigated the interplay between F. nucleatum outer membrane protein RadD and different Streptococcus species. We also examined the Schaalia-TM7 epibiont association. Quantitative proximity analysis was used to evaluate the separation of individual microbial members. Our study demonstrates that heterotropic expansion microscopy can “decrowd” dense biofilm communities, improve visualization of individual bacterial members, and enable analysis of microbe–microbe adhesive interactions at the single-cell level.",

Dissimilatory nitrate reduction is observed to have an 18 ε/ 15 ε proportionality of ~0.9 in marine and ~0.6 in freshwater/terrestrial ecosystems. The origins of this difference are uncertain, with both geochemical and biological factors conceivably at play. One potential factor is variation in the isotope effect of nitrate reduction among different forms of the nitrate reductase enzyme. NarG nitrate reductases are observed to typically have an 18 ε/ 15 ε of ~0.9. However, a recent study uncovered an exception, with Bacillus NarG enzymes having an 18 ε/ 15 ε proportionality of ~0.6. This provides an opportunity to investigate genetic controls on 18 ε/ 15 ε. Furthermore, this atypical NarG signature also raises the question of whether intrinsic isotope signatures can evolve as the enzymes that produce them accumulate mutations through time. Here, we present data from site-directed mutagenesis experiments of key NarG residues, which suggest that the distinct Bacillus 18 ε/ 15 ε cannot be caused by single mutations alone and is potentially uncommon in nature. Variation in the intrinsic isotope effects of an enzyme through time may thus require more extensive evolutionary changes.",

A metabolomics analysis of mouse colon tissue showed a decrease in the 5(6)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid [5(6)-EET] level and an increase in soluble epoxide hydrolase, which is related to HSD-mediated injuries to the gut barrier. The mice treated with a chemical inhibitor of sEH and the mice with genetic intervention by intestinal-specific knockout of the sEH gene significantly attenuated HSD-caused intestinal injuries by reducing HSD-mediated colon inflammation and improving the impaired tight junction caused by an HSD. Further, in vitro studies showed that treatment with 5(6)-EET, but not its hydrolytic product 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-DiHET), significantly ablated high sucrose-caused intestinal epithelial inflammation and impaired tight junction. Additionally, 5(6)-EET is anti-inflammatory and improves gut epithelial tight junction while 5,6-DiHET cannot do so. This study presents an underlying mechanism of and a therapeutic strategy for the gut barrier dysfunction caused by an HSD.",

          "abstract": "Many enveloped viruses bud from the plasma membrane that is tightly associated with a dense and thick actin cortex. This actin network represents a significant challenge for membrane deformation and scission, and how it is remodeled during the late steps of the viral cycle is largely unknown. Using superresolution microscopy, we show that HIV-1 buds in areas of the plasma membrane with low cortical F-actin levels. We find that the cellular oxidoreductase MICAL1 locally depolymerizes actin at budding sites to promote HIV-1 budding and release. Upon MICAL1 depletion, F-actin abnormally remains at viral budding sites, incompletely budded viruses accumulate at the plasma membrane and viral release is impaired. Remarkably, normal viral release can be restored in MICAL1-depleted cells by inhibiting Arp2/3-dependent branched actin networks. Mechanistically, we find that MICAL1 directly disassembles branched-actin networks and controls the timely recruitment of the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport scission machinery during viral budding. In addition, the MICAL1 activator Rab35 is recruited at budding sites, functions in the same pathway as MICAL1, and is also required for viral release. This work reveals a role for oxidoreduction in triggering local actin depolymerization to control HIV-1 budding, a mechanism that may be widely used by other viruses. The debranching activity of MICAL1 could be involved beyond viral budding in various other cellular functions requiring local plasma membrane deformation.",

          "abstract": "One driver of the high failure rates of clinical trials for therapeutic cancer vaccines is likely the inability to sufficiently engage conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), the antigen-presenting cell (APC) subset that is specialized in priming antitumor T cells. Here, we demonstrate that, relative to vaccination with an injectable mesoporous silica rod (MPS) vaccine alone (Vax), combining MPS vaccines with CD122-biased IL-2/anti-IL-2 antibody complexes (IL-2cx) drives ~3-fold expansion of cDCs at the vaccination sites, vaccine-draining lymph nodes, and spleens of treated mice. Furthermore, relative to Vax alone, Vax+IL-2cx led to a ~3-fold increase in the numbers of CD8 + T cells and ~15-fold increase in the numbers of NK cells at the vaccination site. Notably, with both the model protein antigen OVA as well as various peptide neoantigens, Vax+IL-2cx induced ~5 to 30-fold greater numbers of circulating antigen-specific CD8 + T cells relative to Vax alone. We further demonstrate that Vax+IL-2cx leads to significantly improved efficacy in the MC38 colon carcinoma model relative to either monotherapy alone, driving complete regressions in 50% of mice in a cDC-dependent manner. Relative to vaccine alone, Vax+IL-2cx led to comparable numbers of CD8 + T cells, but markedly greater numbers of NK cells and activated cDCs in the B16F10 melanoma tumor microenvironment post-therapy. Taken together, these findings suggest that the administration of factors that engage both the cDC-CD8 + T cell and cDC-NK cell axes can boost the potency of therapeutic cancer vaccines.",

Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are individually well known to play beneficial roles in amelioration of EAE. However, little is known about the relationship between IFN-γ and Tregs during the disease. Here, we show that IFN-γ polarizes Tregs into T helper 1 (Th1)-type Tregs (Th1-Tregs) to recover from EAE. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that brain Tregs showed signs of IFN-γ stimulation during EAE. Loss of IFN-γ signaling in Tregs and of T cell-derived IFN-γ impaired the Th1-Treg polarization and worsened the disease. Moreover, selective ablation of Th1-Tregs using an intersectional genetic method promoted proinflammatory features of macrophages in the inflamed brains and exacerbated the EAE.

Determination of these structures has been facilitated by the presence of large extramembrane components (such as G protein, arrestin, or Venus flytrap domains) in these complexes that aid in particle alignment during the processing of the cryo-EM data. In contrast, determination of the inactive state structure of Family A GPCRs is more challenging due to the relatively small size of the seven transmembrane domain (7TM) and to the surrounding detergent micelle that, in the absence of other features, make particle alignment impossible. Here, we describe an alternative protein engineering strategy where the heterodimeric protein calcineurin is fused to a GPCR by three points of attachment, the cytoplasmic ends of TM5, TM6, and TM7. This three-point attachment provides a more rigid link with the GPCR transmembrane domain that facilitates particle alignment during data processing, allowing us to determine the structures of the β 2 adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) in the apo, antagonist-bound, and agonist-bound states. We expect that this fusion strategy may have broad application in cryo-EM structural determination of other Family A GPCRs.",

          "abstract": "2′-O-methylation is one of the most prevalent RNA modifications found in different RNA types. However, the identities of enzymes participating in the transfer of methyl groups are not well defined. To date, fibrillarin (FBL) is the only known small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) 2′-O-methyltransferase. Whether other snoRNP 2′-O-methyltransferases exist and their functions in targeting RNAs to determine cell differentiation and function need to be elucidated. Here, we identify FBL-like protein 1 (FBLL1) as a 2′-O-methyltransferase and find its function in promoting neuronal differentiation. We show that FBLL1 is a key snoRNP complex enzyme that transfers methyl groups to substrate RNAs both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, FBLL1 exhibits different 2′-O-methyltransferase site selectivity from FBL and tissue-specific distribution. FBLL1 is preferentially expressed in the brain, especially in human neuron cells, and promotes neuronal differentiation through 2′-O-methylation of GAP43 messenger RNA (mRNA). Knockdown of FBLL1, but not FBL, reduced 2′-O-methylation levels in GAP43 mRNA, decreased expression of GAP43 proteins, and eventually repressed neuronal differentiation. Our finding of neuron-specific FBLL1 adds insights into RNA modification in neurobiology and provides clues for understanding 2′-O-methylation in health and disease.",

          "abstract": "Odors are key signals for guiding spatial behaviors such as foraging and navigation in rodents. Recent findings reveal that odor representations in the piriform cortex (PCx) also encode spatial context information. However, the brain origins of this information and its integration into PCx microcircuitry remain unclear. This study investigates the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) as a potential source of spatial contextual information affecting the PCx microcircuit and its olfactory responses. Using mice brain slices, we performed patch-clamp recordings on superficial (SP) and deep (DP) pyramidal neurons, as well as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) inhibitory interneurons. Concurrently, we optogenetically stimulated excitatory LEC projections to observe their impact on PCx activity. Results show that LEC inputs are heterogeneously distributed in the PCx microcircuit, evoking larger excitatory currents in SP and PV neurons due to higher monosynaptic connectivity. LEC inputs also differentially affect inhibitory circuits, activating PV while suppressing SOM interneurons. Studying the interaction between LEC inputs and sensory signals from the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) revealed that simultaneous LEC and LOT activation increases spiking in SP and DP neurons, with DP neurons showing a sharpened response due to LEC-induced inhibition that suppresses delayed LOT-evoked spikes. This suggests a regulatory mechanism where LEC inputs inhibit recurrent activity by activating PV interneurons. Our findings demonstrate that LEC afferents reconfigure PCx activity, aiding the understanding of how odor objects form within the PCx by integrating olfactory and nonolfactory information.",

Yet, no study to date has directly measured the energy expenditure associated with this process. We examined the metabolic cost of color change in octopuses by measuring oxygen consumption in samples of excised octopus skin during periods of chromatophore expansion and contraction and then modeled metabolic demand over the whole octopus as a function of octopus mass. The metabolic demand of the fully activated chromatophore system is nearly as great as an octopus’s resting metabolic rate. This high metabolic cost carries ecological and evolutionary implications, including selective pressures in octopuses that may influence the adoption of nocturnal lifestyles, the use of dens, the reduction of the chromatophore system in deep-sea species, and metabolic trade-offs associated with foraging.",

Here, we study how cave life in the Mexican tetra ( Astyanax mexicanus ) has affected an identified giant multisensory neuron, the Mauthner neuron (MN). Because this neuron is crucial in driving rapid escapes, the absence of predation risk in the cave forms predicts a massive reduction in this neuron. Moreover, the absence of functional eyes in the A. mexicanus Pachón form predicts an even stronger reduction in the cell’s large ventral dendrite that receives visual inputs in sighted fish species. We succeeded in recording in vivo from this neuron in the blind cavefish and two surface tetra ( A. mexicanus and Astyanax aeneus ), which offers unique chances to simultaneously study evolutionary changes in morphology and function in this giant neuron. In contrast to the predictions, we find that cave life, while sufficient to remove vision, has neither affected the cell's morphology nor its functional properties. This specifically includes the cell's ventral dendrite. Furthermore, cave life did not increase the variance in morphological or functional features. Rather, variability in surface and cave forms was the same, which suggests a complex stabilizing selection in this neuron and a continued role of its ventral dendrite. We found that adult cavefish are potent predators that readily attack smaller fish. So, one of the largely unknown stabilizing factors could be using the MN in such attacks and, in the young fish, escaping them.",

In addition, data from several small-scale societies show that humans evolved exceptionally high resting, activity, and total metabolic rates apparently by overcoming tradeoffs between resting and active energy expenditures that constrain other primates.

In this work, we develop an analytically tractable model for multicomponent liquids capable of retrieving states with target compositions. We name this model the liquid Hopfield model in reference to corresponding work in the theory of associative neural networks. In this model, we show that nonlinear repulsive interactions are a general requirement for retrieval of target structures. We demonstrate that this is because liquid mixtures at low temperatures tend to transition to phases with few components, a phenomenon that we term localization. Taken together, our results reveal a trade-off between retrieval and localization phenomena in liquid mixtures, and pave the way for other connections between the phenomenologies of neural computation and liquid mixtures.",

We explored the opening of cryptic ligand binding sites in 16 proteins, where the closed and open conformations define the expected extreme points of the conformational variation. Due to the many structures of these proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we were able to study whether the distribution of X-ray structures affects the distribution of AF2 models. We have found that AF2 generates both a cluster of open and a cluster of closed models for proteins that have comparable numbers of open and closed structures in the PDB and not too many other conformations. This was observed even with default MSA parameters, thus without further subsampling. In contrast, with the exception of a single protein, AF2 did not yield multiple clusters of conformations for proteins that had imbalanced numbers of open and closed structures in the PDB, or had substantial numbers of other structures. Subsampling improved the results only for a single protein, but very shallow MSA led to incorrect structures. The ability of generating both open and closed conformations for six out of the 16 proteins agrees with the success rates of similar studies reported in the literature. However, we showed that this partial success is due to AF2 “remembering” the conformational distributions in the PDB and that the approach fails to predict rarely seen conformations.",

Thousands of plant species possess tiny structures called “domatia” that house mites which protect plants from pests, yet these traits remain woefully understudied. Here, we release a worldwide database of species with mite domatia and provide an evaluation of the phylogenetic and geographic distribution of this mutualistic trait. With &gt;2,500 additions based on digital herbarium scans and published reports, we increased the number of known species with domatia by 27% and, importantly, documented their absence in &gt;4,000 species. We show that mite domatia likely evolved hundreds of times among flowering plants, occurring in an estimated ~10% of woody species representing over a quarter of all angiosperm families. Contrary to classic hypotheses about the evolutionary drivers of mutualism, we find that mite domatia evolved more frequently in temperate regions and in deciduous lineages; this pattern is concordant with a large-scale geographic transition from predominantly ant-based plant defense mutualisms in the tropics to mite-based defense mutualisms in temperate climates. Our data also reveal a pattern of evolutionary convergence in domatia morphology, with tuft-form domatia more likely to evolve in dry temperate habitats and pit domatia more likely to evolve in wet tropical environments. We have shown climate-associated drivers of mite domatia evolution, demonstrating their utility and power as an evolutionarily replicated system for the study of plant defense mutualisms.",

To understand individualities in the context of animal movement, we focused on one of the most remarkable migrations—the journey of the endangered European eel from their birthplace in the Sargasso Sea to freshwater environments. Laboratory observations unveiled a continuum of diverse phenotypes of migrating eels: Some displayed a heightened tendency to swim against a constant water flow, while others a greater propensity to climb obstacles. Looking for the biological underpinnings of this migratory diversity, we characterized the eels’ individual differences in traits of four key domains: life history, physiology, behavior, and cognition, among which we found significant variance and interconnectedness. Upon reducing this variance to its primary multivariate axes, we found that these predict the migratory types. Eels with 1) low exploration, high activity, low boldness, and high lateralization; 2) strong lateralization, enhanced quantitative abilities, short problem-solving time, high boldness, and low growth rates; or 3) enhanced problem-solving, reduced spatial learning, high cognitive flexibility, and shorter time to solve the cognitive tasks were more likely to display the climbing migratory type. Field sampling revealed how specific traits’ combinations seemed to influence the distribution of eels once they begin to settle in the freshwater environment. Our study underscores the impressive diversity of individuals during this critical migration, emphasizing an intrinsic connection to multidomain trait variance. Preserving this diversity becomes paramount, as it likely contributes to the resilience and adaptability of endangered migratory species.",

Systematic trend analysis of P, a nonrenewable resource, has been challenging, primarily due to sparse and inconsistent historical data. Here, we leveraged intensive hydrometeorological data and the recent renaissance of deep learning approaches to fill data gaps and reconstruct temporal trends. We trained a multitask long short-term memory model for total P (TP) using data from 430 rivers across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Trend analysis of reconstructed daily records (1980–2019) shows widespread decline in concentrations, with declining, increasing, and insignificantly changing trends in 60%, 28%, and 12% of the rivers, respectively. Concentrations in urban rivers have declined the most despite rising urban population in the past decades; concentrations in agricultural rivers however have mostly increased, suggesting not-as-effective controls of nonpoint sources in agriculture lands compared to point sources in cities. TP loss, calculated as fluxes by multiplying concentration and discharge, however exhibited an overall increasing rate of 6.5% per decade at the CONUS scale over the past 40 y, largely due to increasing river discharge. Results highlight the challenge of reducing TP loss that is complicated by changing river discharge in a warming climate.",

          "abstract": "Nest predation rates critically influence avian biodiversity and evolution. In the north temperate zone, increased nest failure along edges of forest fragments is hypothesized to play a major role in the disappearance of bird species from disturbed landscapes. However, we lack comprehensive syntheses from tropical latitudes, where biodiversity is highest and increasingly threatened by habitat fragmentation and disturbance. We assembled data from five decades of field studies across the global tropics (1,112 populations of 661 species) and used phylogenetic models to evaluate proposed predictors of nest success. We found significant effects of several traits, including adult body mass and nest architecture. Contrary to results from many temperate locations, anthropogenic habitat disruption did not consistently reduce nest success; in fact, raw nest success rates were lower in large tracts of primary forest than in disturbed or fragmented landscapes. Follow-up analyses within species, using a subset of 76 species for which we had estimates of nest survival in habitats with different levels of disruption, confirmed that neither disturbance nor fragmentation significantly influenced nest success. These results suggest that nest predation alone cannot explain observed declines in avian biodiversity in tropical forest fragments, raising new questions about the demographic processes that drive extinction in the tropics.",

NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome assembly is initiated by the binding of a single NAIP to its cognate ligand, but a subset of bacterial flagellins or T3SS structural proteins are thought to evade NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome sensing by not binding to their cognate NAIPs. Unlike other inflammasome components such as NLRP3, AIM2, or some NAIPs, NLRC4 is constitutively present in resting macrophages and not known to be induced by inflammatory signals. Here, we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling up-regulates NLRC4 transcription and protein expression in murine macrophages, which licenses NAIP detection of evasive ligands. In contrast, TLR priming in human macrophages did not up-regulate NLRC4 expression, and human macrophages remained unable to detect NAIP-evasive ligands even following priming. Critically, ectopic expression of either murine or human NLRC4 was sufficient to induce pyroptosis in response to immunoevasive NAIP ligands, indicating that increased levels of NLRC4 enable the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome to detect these normally evasive ligands. Altogether, our data reveal that TLR priming tunes the threshold for the murine NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome to enable inflammasome responses against immunoevasive or suboptimal NAIP ligands. These findings provide insight into species-specific TLR regulation of NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation.",

          "abstract": "A critical host response against viral infections entails the activation of innate immune signaling that culminates in the production of antiviral proteins. DNA viruses are sensed by the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), which initiates a signaling pathway that results in production of proinflammatory cytokines such as Interferon-β (IFN-β) and activation of the antiviral response. Precise regulation of the antiviral innate immune response is required to avoid deleterious effects of its overactivation. We previously reported that the 4EHP/GIGYF2 translational repressor complex reduces the translation of Ifnb1 mRNA, which encodes IFN-β, upon RNA viral infections. Here, we report a distinct regulatory mechanism by which 4EHP controls replication of DNA viruses by translational repression of the Cgas mRNA, which encodes the DNA viral sensor cGAS. We show that 4EHP is required for effective translational repression of Cgas mRNA triggered by miR-23a. Upon infection, 4EHP deficiency bolsters the elicited innate immune response against the diverse DNA viruses Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Vaccinia Virus (VacV) and concomitantly reduces their rate of replication in vitro and in vivo. This study elucidates an intrinsic regulatory mechanism of the host response to DNA viruses which may provide unique opportunities for countering viral infections.",

          "abstract": "The H3K27M oncogenic histone (oncohistone) mutation drives ~80% of incurable childhood brain tumors known as diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs). The major molecular feature of H3K27M mutant DMGs is a global loss of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a phenotype conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ). Here, we perform unbiased genome-wide suppressor screens in C. elegans expressing H3K27M and isolate 20 suppressors, all of which at least partially restore H3K27me3. 19/20 suppressor mutations map to the same histone H3.3 gene in which the K27M mutation was originally introduced. Most of these create single amino acid substitutions between residues R26-Y54, which do not disrupt oncohistone expression. Rather, they are predicted to impair interactions with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and are functionally conserved in human cells. Further, we mapped a single extragenic H3K27M suppressor to ubc-20 , an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, whose loss rescued H3K27me3 to nearly 50% wild-type levels despite continued oncohistone expression and chromatin incorporation. We demonstrate that ubc-20 is the major enzyme responsible for generating diubiquitinated histone H2B. Our study provides in vivo support for existing models of PRC2 inhibition via direct oncohistone contact and suggests that the effects of H3K27M may be modulated by H2B ubiquitination.",

However, there is a special condition where humans are unable to accurately detect relative motion: Images moving in a direction consistent with retinal slip where the motion is unnaturally amplified can, under some conditions, appear stable [D. W. Arathorn, S. B. Stevenson, Q. Yang, P. Tiruveedhula, A. Roorda, J. Vis. 13 , 22 (2013)]. We asked: Is world-fixed retinal image background content necessary for the visual system to compute the direction of eye motion, and consequently generate stable percepts of images moving with amplified slip? Or, are nonvisual cues sufficient? Subjects adjusted the parameters of a stimulus moving in a random trajectory to match the perceived motion of images moving contingent to the retina. Experiments were done with and without retinal image background content. The perceived motion of stimuli moving with amplified retinal slip was suppressed in the presence of a visible background; however, higher magnitudes of motion were perceived under conditions when there was none. Our results demonstrate that the presence of retinal image background content is essential for the visual system to compute its direction of motion. The visual content that might be thought to provide a strong frame of reference to detect amplified retinal slips, instead paradoxically drives the misperception of relative motion.",

Our approach generates precise deletions using a CRISPR library framework that is free from constraints of gRNA target site availability and efficacy. We applied our method to AcrIIA4, a phage-encoded anti-CRISPR protein that robustly inhibits SpCas9. Extensive structural characterization has shown that AcrIIA4 physically occupies the DNA-binding interfaces of several SpCas9 domains; nonetheless, the importance of each AcrIIA4 interaction for SpCas9 inhibition is unknown. We used our approach to determine the essential and dispensable regions of AcrIIA4. Surprisingly, not all contacts with SpCas9 were required, and in particular, we found that the AcrIIA4 loop that inserts into SpCas9’s RuvC catalytic domain can be deleted. Our results show that AcrIIA4 inhibits SpCas9 primarily by blocking PAM binding and that its interaction with the SpCas9 catalytic domain is inessential.",

We encoded and analyzed new and previously reported design heuristics. Using design principles emerging from this analysis, we redesigned and fabricated multiple shapes and compared their folding accuracy using electrophoretic mobility analysis and electron microscopy imaging. Redesigned shapes showed 6- to 30-fold improvements in yield compared to original designs.

Here, we demonstrate that heterozygous KCTD10 C124W mice display pronounced synaptic abnormalities and exhibit schizophrenia-like behaviors. Mechanistically, we reveal that KCTD10 undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process orchestrated by its intrinsically disordered region (IDR). p.C124W mutation disrupts this LLPS capability, leading to diminished degradation of RHOB and subsequent excessive accumulation in the postsynaptic density fractions. Notably, neither IDR deletion nor p.C124W mutation in KCTD10 mitigates the synaptic abnormalities caused by Kctd10 deficiency.

Consequently, the male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) is extremely uniform in modern horse breeds. The majority of stallions worldwide carry MSY haplotypes (HT) attributed to an only ~1,500-y-old, so-called, “Crown” haplogroup. The predominance of the Crown in modern horse breeds is thought to represent a footprint of the vast impact of stallions of “Oriental origin” in the past millennium. Here, we report the results of a fine-scaled MSY haplotyping of large datasets of patrilines comprising 1,517 males of 189 modern horse breeds, covering a broad phenotypic and geographic spectrum. We can disentangle the multilayered influence of Oriental stallions over the last few hundred years, exposing the intense linebreeding and the wide-ranging impact of Arabian, English Thoroughbred, and Coldblood sires. Iberian and New World horse breeds contain a wide range of diversified Crown lineages. Their broad HT spectrum illustrates the spread of horses of Oriental origin via the Iberian Peninsula after the Middle Ages, which is commonly referred to as the “Spanish influence.” Our survey also revealed a second major historical dissemination of horses from Western Asia, attributed to the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. Our analysis shows that MSY analysis can uncover the complex history of horse breeds and can be used to establish the paternal ancestry of modern horse breeds.",

          "abstract": "Primates are known for their exceptional ability to recognize faces. However, we still have much to learn about how their brains process faces when they are partially hidden. When we cover parts of a face, it affects how our brains respond, even though we still perceive the face as a whole. This suggests that complex brain networks are at work in understanding partially hidden faces. To explore this further, we studied two brain regions, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), while showing primate images of faces with parts occluded. We found that vlPFC neurons were more active when faces were partially covered, while ITC neurons preferred fully visible faces. Interestingly, the ITC seemed to process occluded faces in a separate phase after the vlPFC responded. Our research revealed a coordinated effort between these brain regions based on the level of facial obstruction. Specifically, the vlPFC seemed to play a crucial role, driving the representation of occluded faces in the later phase of ITC processing. Importantly, we also found that the brain processes occluded faces differently from those that are fully visible, suggesting specialized mechanisms for handling these situations. These findings highlight the importance of feedback from the vlPFC in understanding occluded faces in the ITC region of the brain. Understanding these neural processes not only enhances our understanding of how primates perceive faces but also provides insights into broader aspects of visual cognition.",

During these foraging trips, ants memorize and recognize their visual surroundings, which enables them to recapitulate individually learned routes in a fast and effective manner. The compound eyes are crucial for such visual navigation; however, it remains unclear how information from both eyes are integrated and how ants cope with visual impairment. Here, we manipulated the ants’ visual system by covering one of the two compound eyes and analyzed their ability to recognize familiar views. Monocular ants showed an immediate disruption of their ability to recapitulate their familiar route. However, they were able to compensate for this nonnatural impairment in a few hours by engaging in an extensive route-relearning ontogeny, composed of more learning walks than what naïve ants typically do. This relearning process with one eye forms novel memories, without erasing the previous memories acquired with two eyes. Additionally, ants having learned a route with one eye only are unable to recognize it with two eyes, even though more information is available. Together, this shows that visual memories are encoded and recalled in an egocentric and fundamentally binocular way, where the visual input as a whole must be matched to enable recognition. We show how this kind of visual processing fits with their neural circuitry.",

Several viruses reprogram metabolism for viral replication. However, many studies focus on metabolic reprogramming in nutrient-rich conditions that do not recapitulate physiological environments in the body. Here, we investigated how viruses may replicate when a metabolite thought to be essential for replication is limited. We use human cytomegalovirus infection in glucose-free conditions as a model to determine how glucose supports virus replication and how physiologically relevant nutrients contribute to glucose-independent virus production. We find that glucose supports viral genome synthesis, viral protein production and glycosylation, and infectious virus production. Notably, supplement of glucose-free cultures with uridine, ribose, or UDP-GlcNAc—metabolites that feed upper glycolytic branches like the pentose phosphate pathway—results in partially restored virus replication, including low levels of infectious virus production. Supplementing lower glycolysis in glucose-free cultures using pyruvate fails to restore virus replication. These results indicate that nutrients can compensate for glucose via feeding upper glycolytic branches to sustain low levels of virus production. More broadly, our findings suggest that viruses may successfully replicate in diverse metabolic niches, including those in the body with low glucose levels, through alternative nutrient usage.",

Neurons encoded families of image sequences following trigonometric functions. Spike sequence and information flow suggest that repetitive circuit motifs underlie movie detection. Principles of frog topographic retinotectal plasticity and cortical simple cells are employed in machine learning networks for static image recognition, suggesting that discoveries of principles of movie encoding in the brain, such as how image sequences and duration are encoded, may benefit movie recognition technology. We built and trained a machine learning network that mimicked neural principles of visual system movie encoders.

          "abstract": "The establishment of a productive dengue virus (DENV) infection in the midgut epithelial cells of Aedes aegypti is critical for the viral transmission cycle. The hypothesis that DENV virions interact directly with specific mosquito midgut proteins was explored. We found that DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) pretreated with trypsin interacted with a single 31 kDa protein, identified as AAEL011180 by protein mass spectrometry. This putative receptor is a highly conserved protein and has orthologs in culicine and anopheline mosquitoes. We confirmed that impairing the expression of AAEL011180 in the midgut of Ae. aegypti females abolished the interaction with DENV2, and the virus also bound to immobilized recombinant purified receptor. Furthermore, recombinant DENV2 surface E glycoprotein bound to recombinant AAEL011180 with high affinity (38.2 nM) in binding kinetic analysis using surface plasmon resonance. The gene for this DENV2 E protein receptor (EPrRec) was disrupted, but since the gene is essential in Ae. aegypti, only heterozygote knockout (ΔEPrRec +/− ) females could be recovered. Further reducing EPrRec mRNA expression in the midgut of ΔEPrRec +/− females by systemic dsRNA injection significantly reduced the prevalence of DENV2 midgut infection. EPrRec also interacts with heat shock protein 70 cognate 3 (Hsc70-3), and silencing Hsc70-3 expression in ΔEPrRec females also reduced the prevalence of DENV2 midgut infection.",

          "abstract": "Emergence is a fundamental concept in biology and other disciplines, but whether emergent phenotypes evolve similarly to nonemergent phenotypes is unclear. The hypothesized process of emergent evolution posits that evolutionary change in at least some collective behaviors will differ from evolutionary change in the corresponding intrinsic behaviors of isolated individuals. As a result, collective behavior might evolve more rapidly and diversify more between populations compared to individual behavior. To test whether collective behavior evolves emergently, we conducted a large comparative study using 22 ant species and gathered over 1,500 behavioral rhythm time series from hundreds of colonies and isolated individuals, totaling over 1.5 y of behavioral data. We show that analogous traits measured at individual and collective levels exhibit distinct evolutionary patterns. The estimated rates of phenotypic evolution for the rhythmicity of activity in ant colonies were faster than the evolutionary rates of the same behavior measured in isolated individual ants, and total variation across species in collective behavior was higher than variation in individual behavior. We hypothesize that more rapid evolution and higher variation is a widespread feature of emergent phenotypes relative to lower-level phenotypes across complex biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Ethylene is widely recognized as a positive regulator of leaf senescence. However, how plants coordinate the biosynthesis of ethylene to meet the requirements of senescence progression has not been determined. The rate-limiting enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway is ACC synthase. AtACS7 was previously considered one of the major contributors to the synthesis of “senescence ethylene” in Arabidopsis . However, the “brake signal” that fine-tunes the expression of AtACS7 to ensure optimal ethylene production during leaf development has yet to be identified. In the present study, the RING-H2 zinc-finger protein RIE1 was found to specifically interact with and ubiquitinate AtACS7, among all functional ACSs in Arabidopsis , to promote its degradation. Overexpression of RIE1 markedly decreased ethylene biosynthesis and delayed leaf senescence, whereas loss of function of RIE1 significantly increased ethylene emission and accelerated leaf senescence. The ethylene-related phenotypes of RIE1 overexpressing or knockout mutants were effectively rescued by the ethylene precursor ACC or the competitive inhibitor of ACS, respectively. In particular, AtACS7-induced precocious leaf senescence was strongly enhanced by the loss of RIE1 but was significantly attenuated by the overexpression of RIE1 . The specific regions of interaction between AtACS7 and RIE1, as well as the major ubiquitination sites of AtACS7, were further investigated. All results demonstrated that RIE1 functions as an important modulator of ethylene biosynthesis during leaf development by specifically targeting AtACS7 for degradation, thereby enabling plants to produce the optimal levels of ethylene needed.",

          "abstract": "The immunomodulatory function of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is plastic and susceptible to resident microenvironment in vivo or inflammatory factors in vitro. We propose a unique method to enhance the immunoregulatory functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through an artificially controllable in vivo inflammatory microenvironment generated by biomaterials loaded with BMP-2 that induce bone development. MSCs activated through this method effectively induce M1 macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype, promote differentiation of naïve T cells into regulatory T cells, and inhibit the proliferation of activated T cells via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion. This in vivo licensing not only preserves the immunogenicity of MSCs but also alters DNA methylation patterns, enabling MSCs to exhibit immunoregulatory effects with epigenetic memory. Validation in a mouse colitis model demonstrated their therapeutic efficacy and long-term viability. Furthermore, we found that the material composition influences the inflammatory response during development, with polysaccharide-based biomaterials proving advantageous over protein-based materials in establishing an inflammatory niche conducive to MSC activity. These findings underscore the potential of tissue engineering to create in vivo environments that license MSCs, offering a strategic avenue to enhance MSC-based therapies for addressing significant immune disorders.",

Analyzing trends and patterns in consumption can aid in developing policies to mitigate the burden of antimicrobial resistance and global disparities in access to antibiotics. Using pharmaceutical sales data licensed from IQVIA, we estimate national-level trends in antibiotic consumption in 67 countries during 2016–2023 and analyze the effects of economic growth and the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we estimate global human consumption and project growth through 2030 assuming current trends. We find that estimated antibiotic consumption in reported countries increased 16.3% from 29.5 to 34.3 billion defined daily doses (DDDs) from 2016 to 2023, reflecting a 10.6% increase in the consumption rate from 13.7 to 15.2 DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day. Increases were most pronounced in upper-middle- and lower-middle-income countries. While the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced consumption globally, this was most pronounced in high-income countries, and in these countries, reductions in antibiotic use in 2020 were sharper, and lasted longer, than in other countries. By 2030, we project that, without reductions in rapidly developing nations, such as investments to improve infrastructure, particularly water and sanitation, along with improved access to vaccination, global antibiotic consumption will increase by 52.3% from an estimated 49.3 billion in 2023 to 75.1 billion DDDs.",

Density functional theory calculations show that the FM stability between Co 2+ ions is very weak. However, electron doping from additional oxygen vacancies can significantly enhance this FM stability, which explains the observed room-temperature ferromagnetism. Moreover, our calculations illustrate enhanced FM interactions between Co Ti + V O complexes with additional oxygen vacancies.

          "abstract": "In the late spring to summer season of 2023, Canada witnessed unprecedented wildfires, with an extensive burning area and smoke spreading as far as the East Coast of the United States and Europe. Here, using multisource data analysis and climate model simulations, we show that an abnormally warm North Atlantic, as well as an abnormally low Barents Sea ice concentration (SIC), are likely key climate drivers of this Canadian fire season, contributing to ~80% of the fire weather anomaly over Canada from June to August 2023. Specifically, the warm North Atlantic forms an anomalous regional zonal cell with ascending air over the Atlantic and descending air encircling Canada, creating hot and dry local conditions. Meanwhile, reduced Barents SIC leads to a high-pressure center and reinforces the dry northern winds in Canada through Rossby wave dynamics. These exacerbated dry and hot conditions create a favorable environment for the ignition and spread of fires, thus contributing to the prolonged and extreme fire season in Canada. These teleconnections can extend to decadal scales and have important implications for understanding and predicting decadal fire activity in Canada and the surrounding regions.",

Although adaptive immunity and specifically CD4 + T cells play a role in DED pathogenesis, the exact contribution of these cells to corneal epithelial and neural damage remains undetermined. To address this, we explored the progression of a surgical DED model in wild-type (WT) and T cell-deficient mice. We observed that adaptive immune-deficient mice developed all aspects of DED comparably to WT mice except for the absence of functional and morphological corneal nerve changes, nerve damage-associated transcriptomic signature in the trigeminal ganglia, and sustained tear cytokine levels. Adoptive transfer of CD4 + T cells from WT DED mice to T cell-deficient mice reproduced corneal nerve damage but not epitheliopathy. Conversely, T cell-deficient mice reconstituted solely with naïve CD4 + T cells developed corneal nerve impairment and epitheliopathy upon DED induction, thus replicating the WT DED phenotype. Collectively, our data show that while corneal neuropathy is driven by CD4 + T cells in DED, corneal epithelial damage develops independently of the adaptive immune response. These findings have implications for T cell-targeting therapies currently in use for DED.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the processes that link genotype to phenotype is a central challenge in biology. Despite progress in discovering genes associated with ecologically relevant traits, a poor understanding of the processes and functions via which molecules mediate evolutionary differences leaves us critically far from linking proximate and ultimate causes of evolution. This knowledge gap is particularly large in multifaceted phenotypes of ecological relevance such as life histories where multiple traits covary and influence fitness. In Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ), variation in a key life-history trait, maturation age, is largely linked to the transcription cofactor vestigial-like 3 ( vgll3 ). Here, we show that despite this simple genetic architecture, vgll3 genotype influences maturation age through a complex regulatory mechanism whereby it controls the expression of diverse pubertal signaling pathways. Using a multiomic approach in salmon testes, we show that the vgll3 genotype conferring early maturity up-regulates key genes controlling androgen production, cellular energy and adiposity, and TGF-β signaling, thereby increasing the likelihood of earlier pubertal initiation. By mapping VGLL3 regulatory elements we further show its interaction with distinct transcription factors in a genotype-dependent manner, thus coordinating differential activation of regulatory pathways. This study reveals the proximate mechanisms through which a genetically simple association leads to functionally complex molecular differences in a spectrum of cellular traits, thus explaining the molecular basis of pleiotropy in a large-effect gene. Our results indicate that evolution in correlated phenotypes, as exemplified by alternative life history strategies, can be dictated by the function of major life-history genes.",

          "abstract": "We ask the question of how angular momentum is conserved in electroweak interaction processes. To introduce the problem with a minimum of mathematics, we first raise the same issue in elastic scattering of a circularly polarized photon by an atom, where the scattered photon has a different spin direction than the original photon, and note its presence in scattering of a fully relativistic spin-1/2 particle by a central potential. We then consider inverse beta decay in which an electron is emitted following the capture of a neutrino on a nucleus. While both the incident neutrino and final electron spins are antiparallel to their momenta, the final spin is in a different direction than that of the neutrino—an apparent change of angular momentum. However, prior to measurement of the final particle, in all these cases angular momentum is indeed conserved. The apparent nonconservation of angular momentum arises in the quantum measurement process in which the measuring apparatus does not have an initially well-defined angular momentum, but is localized in the outside world. We generalize the discussion to massive neutrinos and electrons, and examine nuclear beta decay and electron-positron annihilation processes through the same lens, enabling physically transparent derivations of angular and helicity distributions in these reactions.",

The mechanisms by which agonists activate the G protein are unclear for many GPCR families, including the bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). We ascertained TAS2R5 properties by live cell-based functional assays, direct binding affinity measurements using optical resonators, and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on three agonists that exhibit a wide range of signal transduction in cells despite comparable ligand–receptor binding energies derived from direct experiment and computation. Metadynamics simulations revealed that the critical barrier to activation is ligand-induced opening of the G protein between the α-helical (AH) and Ras-like domains of Gα subunit from a precoupled TAS2R5-G protein state to the fully activated state. A moderate agonist opens the AH-Ras cleft from 22 Å to 31 Å with an energy gain of −4.8 kcal mol −1 , making GDP water-exposed for signaling. A high-potency agonist had an energy gain of −11.1 kcal mol −1 . The low-potency agonist is also exothermic for Gα opening, but with an energy gain of only −1.4 kcal mol −1 . This demonstrates that TAS2R5 agonist-bound functional potencies are derived from energy gains in the transition from a precoupled complex at the level of Gα opening. Our experimental and computational study provides insights into the activation mechanism of signal transduction that provide a basis for rational design of new drugs.",

MDA has density between that of low-density amorphous (LDA) and high-density amorphous (HDA) ices, adding to the complexity of water’s phase diagram, known for its glass polyamorphism and two-state thermodynamics. The nature of MDA and its relation to other amorphous ices and liquid water remain unsolved. Here, we use molecular simulations under controlled pressure and shear rate at 77 K to produce and investigate MDA. We find that MDA formed at constant shear rate is a steady-state nonequilibrium shear-driven amorphous ice (SDA), that can be produced by shearing ice I h , LDA, or HDA. Our results suggest that MDA could be obtained by ball-milling water glasses without crystallization interference. Increasing the shear rate at ambient pressure produces SDAs with densities ranging from LDA to HDA, revealing shear rate as a new thermodynamic variable in the nonequilibrium phase diagram of water. Indeed, shearing provides access to amorphous states inaccessible by controlling pressure and temperature alone. SDAs produced with shearing rates as high as 10 6 s −1 sample the same region of the potential energy landscape than hyperquenched glasses with identical density, pressure, and temperature. Intriguingly, SDAs obtained by shearing at ~10 8 s −1 have density, enthalpy, and structure indistinguishable from those of water “instantaneously” quenched from room temperature to 77 K over 10 ps, making them good approximants for the “true glass” of ambient liquid water.",

That’s a modest uptick from 73% last year and a hopeful sign that the page may be turning on some of the pandemic-era skepticism.

          "abstract": "Directed protein evolution is central to biomedical applications but faces challenges like experimental complexity, inefficient multi-property optimization, and local maxima traps. While in silico methods using protein language models (PLMs) can provide modeled fitness landscape guidance, they struggle to generalize across diverse protein families and map to protein activity. We present EVOLVEpro, a few-shot active learning framework that combines PLMs and regression models to rapidly improve protein activity. EVOLVEpro surpasses current methods, yielding up to 100-fold improvements in desired properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness across six proteins in RNA production, genome editing, and antibody binding applications. These results highlight the advantages of few-shot active learning with minimal experimental data over zero-shot predictions. EVOLVEpro opens new possibilities for AI-guided protein engineering in biology and medicine.",

In this work, we report the noncovalent synthesis of unprecedented plastics that are mechanically strong yet metabolizable under biologically relevant conditions owing to their dissociative nature with electrolytes. Salt-bridging sodium hexametaphosphate with di- or tritopic guanidinium sulfate in water forms a cross-linked supramolecular network, which is stable unless electrolytes are resupplied. This unusual stability is caused by a liquid-liquid phase separation that expels sodium sulfate, generated upon salt bridging, into a water-rich phase. Drying the remaining condensed liquid phase yields glassy plastics that are thermally reshapable, such as thermoplastics, and usable even in aqueous media with hydrophobic parylene C coating. This approach can be extended to polysaccharide-based supramolecular plastics that are applicable for three-dimensional printing.",

However, little is known about the mechanism behind the abundant presence of T H 1-T reg cells in the TME. We demonstrate that selective depletion of arginase I (Arg1)–expressing tumor-associated macrophages (Arg1 + TAMs) inhibits tumor growth and concurrently reduces the ratio of T H 1-T reg cells in the TME. Arg1 + TAMs secrete the chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4), which reinforces interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–induced T reg cell polarization into T H 1-T reg cells in a manner dependent on CXCR3 and the IFN-γ receptor. Both genetic PF4 inactivation and PF4 neutralization hinder T H 1-T reg cell accumulation in the TME and reduce tumor growth. Collectively, our study highlights the importance of Arg1 + TAM–produced PF4 for high T H 1-T reg cell levels in the TME to suppress antitumor immunity.",

          "abstract": "The CCR4-NOT complex is a major regulator of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) stability. Slow decoding during translation promotes association of CCR4-NOT with ribosomes, accelerating mRNA degradation. We applied selective ribosome profiling to further investigate the determinants of CCR4-NOT recruitment to ribosomes in mammalian cells. This revealed that specific arginine codons in the P-site are strong signals for ribosomal recruitment of human CNOT3, a CCR4-NOT subunit. Cryo–electron microscopy and transfer RNA (tRNA) mutagenesis demonstrated that the D-arms of select arginine tRNAs interact with CNOT3 and promote its recruitment whereas other tRNA D-arms sterically clash with CNOT3. These effects link codon content to mRNA stability. Thus, in addition to their canonical decoding function, tRNAs directly engage regulatory complexes during translation, a mechanism we term P-site tRNA-mediated mRNA decay.",

Although sleep induces synchronized fluctuations in population activity across cortical areas, the post-sleep population activity became more desynchronized relative to the pre-sleep state. The changes after sleep were correlated with an increase in information encoded in population activity in each area and improved behavioral performance. Electrically stimulating visual cortex at 4 hertz emulated the beneficial effects of sleep on network and perceptual performance. A large-scale neural network model indicated that asymmetric depression of local intracortical synapses is consistent with the observed changes in neural activity after sleep.",

Advanced characterizations now allow the surface structure of a catalyst in a gas phase to be determined to some extent. Metal nanoparticles may experience changes in shape, surface structure and composition, and atomic packing in response to the pressure of a reactant or product gas, temperature, and reaction between the catalyst surface and gas. Metal oxide supports can partially or fully encapsulate metal nanoparticles, altering their electronic structure and reactivity. Restructuring is a main approach to creating active catalytic sites. The rational design of catalysts must anticipate that such restructurings can occur under reaction or catalytic conditions and gain knowledge of how they occur. It is expected that computational studies can predict such restructurings and that advanced synthesis may be used to prepare pristine catalysts with enhanced resistance to restructurings.",

TRISCO resolved several crucial issues, including the preservation of RNA integrity, achieving uniform RNA labeling, and enhancing tissue transparency. We tested TRISCO using a broad range of cell-identity markers, noncoding and activity-dependent RNAs, within diverse organs of varying sizes and species. TRISCO thus emerges as a powerful tool for single-cell, whole-brain, 3D imaging that enables comprehensive transcriptional spatial analysis across the entire brain.",

The hippocampus is hypothesized to bind together otherwise abstract combinations of stimuli to represent such latent contexts, to support the process of hidden state inference.

We found that the ventral hippocampus is required for mice to perform hidden state inference during a two-armed bandit task. Hippocampal neurons differentiate the two abstract contexts required for this strategy in a manner similar to the differentiation of spatial locations, and their activity is essential for appropriate dopamine dynamics. These findings offer insight into how latent contextual information is used to optimize decisions, and they emphasize a key role for the hippocampus in hidden state inference.",

We show that limited levels of group connectivity favored the emergence of a few instances of cumulative culture in chimpanzees. As in humans, cultural complexification likely happened in steps, with transmission between populations, incremental changes, and repurposing of technologies. We propose that divergence in social patterns led to increased mobility between groups in the genus Homo , resulting in irreversible dependence on cultural exchange and complexification.",

          "abstract": "Reasoning about someone’s thoughts and intentions—i.e., forming a “theory of mind”—is a core aspect of social cognition and relies on association areas of the brain that have expanded disproportionately in the human lineage. We recently showed that these association zones comprise parallel distributed networks that, despite occupying adjacent and interdigitated regions, serve dissociable functions. One network is selectively recruited by social cognitive processes. What circuit properties differentiate these parallel networks? Here, we show that social cognitive association areas are intrinsically and selectively connected to anterior regions of the medial temporal lobe that are implicated in emotional learning and social behaviors, including the amygdala at or near the basolateral complex and medial nucleus. The results suggest that social cognitive functions emerge through coordinated activity between internal circuits of the amygdala and a broader distributed association network, and indicate the medial nucleus may play an important role in social cognition in humans.",

The remarkable consistencies with the key theoretical predictions of period doubling in quantum oscillations, gate-tunable aperiodic beating patterns, and the symmetry-enforced Landau level crossing phenomena controlled by the competition between Rashba coupling and the Zeeman interaction, which ultimately manifests as all odd-filling factor integer quantum Hall effect with superb sensitivity to quantum phases, establish topo-Fermiology as an indispensable methodology for studying topological quantum matters.",

To identify sleep drive neurons, we imaged Drosophila brains with calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI). The results indicate that the activity of the protocerebral bridge (PB) correlates with sleep drive. We further identified a key three-layer PB circuit, EPG-SpsP-PEcG, in which the four SpsP neurons in the PB respond to ellipsoid body (EB) signals from EPG neurons and send signals back to the EB through PEcG neurons. This circuit is strengthened by sleep deprivation, indicating a plasticity response to sleep drive. SpsP neurons also receive inputs from the sensorimotor brain region, suggesting that they may encode sleep drive by integrating sensorimotor and navigation cues. Together, our experiments show that the four SpsP neurons and their sleep regulatory circuit play an important and dynamic role in sleep regulation.",

In particular, the ability to delicately grasp wrinkled and soft biological and nonbiological surfaces with low preload without causing damage is essential. The proposed adhesive robotic system, inspired by the secretions from a velvet worm, uses a structured magnetorheological material that exhibits precise adhesion control with stability and repeatability by the rapid stiffness change controlled by an external magnetic field. The proposed adhesion protocol involves controlling soft-state adhesion, maintaining a large contact area, and enhancing the elastic modulus, and the mechanical structure enhances the effectiveness of this protocol. Demonstrations of the remote adhesive robot include stable transportation in soft and wet organs, unscrewing a nut from a bolt, and supporting mouse tumor removal surgery. These results indicate the potential applicability of the soft adhesive robot in biomedical engineering, especially for targeting small-scale biological tissues and organisms.",

          "abstract": "A dynamic equilibrium between dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) is essential for striatal circuitry and motor function, as imbalances are associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Conventional theories posit that cholinergic signaling is pathologically elevated in PD as a result of increased ACh release, which contributes to motor deficits. However, using approaches to measure receptor-mediated signaling, we found that, rather than the predicted enhancement, the strength of cholinergic transmission at muscarinic M4 receptor synapses on direct pathway medium spiny neurons was decreased in dopamine-depleted mice. This adaptation was due to a reduced postsynaptic M4 receptor function, resulting from down-regulated receptors and downstream signaling. Restoring M4 transmission unexpectedly led to a partial alleviation of motor deficits and LID dyskinetic behavior, revealing an unexpected prokinetic effect in addition to the canonical antikinetic role of M4 receptors. These findings indicate that decreased M4 function differentially contributes to parkinsonian and LID pathophysiology, representing a promising target for therapeutic intervention.",

Current synthetic systems capture only one dynamic process. Here, we present multi-dynamic hydrogels by uniting a stress-stiffening polymer with supramolecular polymers. Crucial is the molecular dynamics of the supramolecular polymers: They dictate the interaction strength with the stress-stiffening polymer and the subsequent dynamic mechanical properties of the mixed networks. The biological relevance of our multi-dynamic hydrogels is demonstrated by their ability to support fibroblast cell spreading.

Disease-causing mutations are found in both domains. Now, studies have focused largely on LRRK2 kinase activity, while attention to its GTPase function is limited. LRRK2 is a guanine nucleotide–binding protein, but the mechanism of direct regulation of its GTPase activity remains unclear and its physiological GEF is not known. Here, we identified CalDAG-GEFI (CDGI) as a physiological GEF for LRRK2. CDGI interacts with LRRK2 and increases its GDP to GTP exchange activity. CDGI modulates LRRK2 cellular functions and LRRK2-induced neurodegeneration in both LRRK2 Drosophila and mouse models. Together, this study identified the physiological GEF for LRRK2 and provides strong evidence that LRRK2 GTPase is regulated by GAPs and GEFs. The LRRK2 GTPase, GAP, or GEF activities have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets, which is distinct from the direct LRRK2 kinase inhibition.",

In this work, we demonstrate that the meniscus region formed between the electrode and the convex liquid level due to the electrowetting of the catalyst plays a vital role in the CO 2 RR in batch cells. CO 2 RR in the meniscus region in batch cells exhibits similar performance with that in flow cells, and the performance disparity between these two configurations largely disappears when conducting CO 2 RR primarily in the meniscus region. An assembled double-sided gas diffusion electrode with a gas channel is developed to maximize the meniscus-like region, achieving a CO 2 RR partial current density of 640 mA/cm 2 geo on commercial Cu in the KHCO 3 electrolyte. This performance represents the highest CO 2 RR activity in neutral buffered media.",

We determine that the carotenoid lutein underlies the yellow phenotype and describe microstructural feather features likely to enhance color appearance. These same features reduce predicted water shedding capacity of feathers, a potential liability in the tropics. Through genome-scale DNA sequencing of hybrids and each species in the genus, we identify BCO2 as the major gene responsible for the color polymorphism. The BCO2 gene tree and genome-wide allele frequency patterns suggest that carotenoid-pigmented collars initially arose in a third species and reached the hybrid zone through historical gene flow. Complex interplay between sexual selection and hybridization has thus shaped phenotypes of these species, where conspicuous sexual traits are key to male reproductive success.",

Loss-of-function mutations in TSC cause TSC disease, marked by excessive tumor growth. Here, we overcome a high degree of continuous conformational heterogeneity to determine the 2.8-Å cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the complete human TSC in complex with the lysosomal recruitment factor WD repeat domain phosphoinositide–interacting protein 3 (WIPI3). We discover a previously undetected amino-terminal TSC1 HEAT repeat dimer that clamps onto a single TSC wing and forms a phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)–binding pocket, which specifically binds monophosphorylated PIPs. These structural advances provide a model by which WIPI3 and PIP-signaling networks coordinate to recruit TSC to the lysosomal membrane to inhibit mTORC1. The high-resolution TSC structure reveals previously unrecognized mutational hotspots and uncovers crucial insights into the mechanisms of TSC dysregulation in disease.",

This is the earliest large-scale Archaic fish-trapping facility recorded in ancient Mesoamerica. We suggest that such landscape-scale intensification may have been a response to long-term climate disturbance recorded between 2200 and 1900 BCE. Agricultural intensification after 2000 BCE has been credited for supporting the rise of pre-Columbian civilizations in Formative Mesoamerica, but we suggest that some groups relied more heavily on the mass harvesting of aquatic resources. We argue that such early intensification of aquatic food production offered a high value subsistence strategy that was instrumental in the emergence of Formative period sedentarism and the development of complexity among pre-Columbian civilizations like the Maya.",

Their viability under practical conditions is limited at high temperatures when Ni aggregates and converts CO to methane, an undesirable side product. Because experimental and computational studies identify undercoordinated Ni step sites as most active toward CH 4 formation, we eliminate Ni step sites by atomically dispersing Ni into networked, nanoparticulate CeO 2 aerogels. The mesoporous catalyst with 2.5 atomic % Ni in CeO 2 is highly active for WGS, converting near-equilibrium levels of CO at 350°C, while no CH 4 is detected at the limit of detection (&lt;2 parts per million). In contrast, supporting low weight percentages of Ni clusters or nanoparticles on CeO 2 aerogels leads to methanation. The CH 4 yield produced by the atomically dispersed Ni-substituted CeO 2 aerogel is over an order of magnitude lower than previously reported Ni-based catalysts claiming methane suppression, marking an important advance in the development of WGS catalysts.",

Element distribution maps show sharp alternating zoning defined by marked enrichments of non-formula elements, such as Fe, Al, and Na, and ubiquitous nanoscale magnetite inclusions. The zoning and inclusions are similar to those reported in terrestrial zircon crystallizing in the presence of aqueous fluid and are here interpreted as primary features recording zircon growth from exsolved hydrous fluids at ~4.45 billion years.

We assessed the topography of focused ultrasound subthalamotomy ( n = 39) by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to identify statistically validated brain voxels with the optimal effect against each cardinal feature and their respective cortical connectivity patterns by diffusion-weighted tractography. Bradykinesia and rigidity amelioration were associated with ablation of the rostral motor STN subregion connected to the supplementary motor and premotor cortices, whereas antitremor effect was explained by lesioning the posterolateral STN projection to the primary motor cortex. These findings were corroborated prospectively in another PD cohort ( n = 12). This work concurs with recent deep brain stimulation findings that suggest different corticosubthalamic circuits underlying each PD cardinal feature. Our results provide sound evidence in humans of segregated anatomy of subthalamic-cortical connections and their distinct role in PD pathophysiology and normal motor control.",

The molecular mechanisms regulating central iron levels, beyond a few well-known genes controlling peripheral iron, remain unclear. We generated scores based on the archetypal brain iron accumulation observed in magnetic resonance imaging scans of individuals with excessive dietary iron absorption and hemochromatosis risk. Genome-wide analysis revealed that this score is highly heritable, identifying loci associated with iron homeostasis, and driven by peripheral iron levels. Our score predicted gait abnormalities and showed a U-shaped relationship with PD risk, identifying individuals with threefold increased risk. These results establish a hormetic relationship between brain iron and PD risk, where central iron levels are strongly determined by genetics via peripheral iron.

Here, we describe how pseudokinase serine threonine kinase 40 (STK40) facilitates T H 1/T H 17 differentiation under pathological conditions. STK40 in T cells is dispensable for immune homeostasis in resting mice. However, mice with T cell–specific deletion of STK40 exhibit attenuated symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and colitis, accompanied by diminished T H 1 and T H 17 cell differentiation. Mechanistically, STK40 facilitates K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of FOXO1/4 through promoting their interaction with E3 ligase COP1. Inhibition of FOXO4 or FOXO1, respectively, restores differentiation potential of STK40-deficient T H 1/T H 17 cells. Together, our data suggest a crucial role of STK40 in T H 1 and T H 17 cell differentiation, thereby enabling better understanding of the molecular regulatory network of CD4 + T cell differentiation and providing effective targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

Using a state-of-the-art global climate model, we conduct freshwater hosing experiments to reexamine AMOC sensitivity and its climate impacts. The Irminger basin emerges as the most effective region for additional freshwater fluxes, causing the greatest AMOC weakening. While global temperature and precipitation responses are relatively homogeneous, subcontinental responses—especially in the northern mid-latitudes—are heterogeneous. At high latitudes, sea ice responses to freshwater fluxes and associated ice-albedo feedbacks determine temperature changes. In tropical and extratropical regions, temperature dynamics are shaped by atmospheric circulation and oceanic heat transport. Precipitation shows seasonal and regional variability due to altered surface turbulent heat flux and the southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The widespread heterogeneity in climate extremes underscores the need to monitor freshwater release regions linked to AMOC slowdown. These findings hold vital implications for understanding paleoclimate and future AMOC impacts.",

Cell-surface expression of transporters is regulated by substrates and intracellular signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that substrates of the dopamine transporter (DAT), amphetamine and dopamine, synergize with protein kinase C (PKC)–dependent DAT ubiquitination to markedly elevate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of DAT, which is accompanied by DAT movement out of plasma membrane protrusions with a negative curvature. Disruption of the outward-open (OO) DAT conformation or its stabilization in the inward-open (IO) conformation recapitulates substrate effects on DAT endocytosis. Amphetamine strongly increases PKC-dependent endocytosis of norepinephrine transporter (NET) but not of serotonin transporter (SERT), correlating with a substantially weaker ubiquitination of SERT compared to NET. We propose a “shape-transition” model whereby shifting from convex-shaped OO conformers to IO conformers minimizes retention of transporters in negatively curved membranes, which facilitates their PKC-dependent ubiquitination and recruitment to positively invaginated clathrin-coated membranes, driving robust transporter endocytosis.",

Here, we present an approach that allows the adaptation of well-established reflection matrix techniques to scattering compensation in incoherent fluorescence imaging. We experimentally demonstrate that a small number of conventional wide-field fluorescence microscope images acquired under unknown random illuminations can effectively be used to construct a virtual fluorescence-based reflection matrix.

          "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes a common congenital infection leading to long-term neurological impairments including brain, cochlear, and ocular pathology. Infection of newborn mice with murine (M)CMV is an established model of neuropathology caused by congenital CMV infection, with recent work suggesting that brain pathology may be driven by immune responses. In the eye, however, CMV retinitis is thought to result from virus-driven necrosis in the absence of T cell responses. We found that MCMV infection of newborn mice recapitulates human eye disease after congenital CMV infection, including focal chorioretinitis, inflamed vasculature, and disrupted blood-retinal barriers. Moreover, infection drove extensive T cell infiltration of the retina and marked gliosis. Blocking immune responses generally, or via targeting the chemokine receptor CXCR3, did not exacerbate retinal disease but instead prevented pathology despite retinal MCMV infection. Thus, our data establish this model for studies of congenital retinal disease and show that the immune system drives pathology in the neonatal eye after MCMV infection.",

Here, we uncovered a trihydroxy resolvin in fresh human saliva. We identified and determined its complete stereochemistry as 7S,16R,17R-trihydroxy-4Z,8E,10Z,12E,14E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid (17R-RvD2) using total organic synthesis and matching of physical properties. The 17R-RvD2 was produced by activated human M2-like macrophages, M1-like macrophages, and human peripheral blood monocytes. 17R-RvD2 displayed potent proresolving functions (picomolar to nanomolar). Topical application of 17R-RvD2 on mouse ear skin reduced neutrophilic infiltration (~50%). 17R-RvD2 increased M2 markers CD206 and CD163 on human monocyte–derived macrophages and enhanced efferocytosis of senescent red blood cells by M2-like macrophages (EC 50 ~ 2.6 × 10 −14 M). In addition, 17R-RvD2 activated the RvD2 receptor and was equipotent to its epimer RvD2. 17R-RvD2 also significantly increased phagocytosis of Escherichia coli by human neutrophils. Together, these results establish the complete stereochemistry and potent proresolving functions of the previously unknown 17R-RvD2.",

          "abstract": "Quantum noise is one of the most profound obstacles to implementing large-scale quantum algorithms and schemes. In particular, the dynamical process by which quantum noise, varying in strength from 0 to critical levels, affects and destroys quantum advantage has not been well understood. Meanwhile, correlation generation serves as a precious theoretical model for information processing tasks, where quantum advantage can be precisely quantified. In this study, we show that this model provides valuable insights into the understanding of this dynamical process. We prove that, as the strength of quantum noise continuously increases from 0, the quantum advantage diminishes gradually and eventually vanishes. Unexpectedly, in some cases, we observe the phenomenon of a sudden death of quantum advantage: When the noise strength exceeds a certain threshold, the quantum advantage abruptly disappears from a substantial level. This phenomenon, once again, reveals the tremendous impact of noise on quantum information processing tasks.",

Our findings reveal that large stacking fault energy leads to a chiral in-plane vortex pattern that was recently observed in experiments. We also found nonzero out-of-plane local dipole moments, indicating that the strong interlayer interaction might offer a promising strategy to stabilize ferroelectric order in the two-dimensional limit. The vortex pattern in the twisted BaTiO 3 bilayer supports localized electronic states with quasi-flat bands, associated with the interlayer hybridization of oxygen p z orbitals. We found that the associated bandwidth reaches a minimum at ∼19 ∘ twisting, configuring the largest magic angle in moiré systems reported so far. Further, the moiré vortex pattern bears a notable resemblance to two interpenetrating Lieb lattices and the corresponding tight-binding model provides a comprehensive description of the evolution the moiré bands with twist angle and reveals the topological nature.",

The recorded neural signal acts as the trigger for a voltage-driven drug release in detected pathological conditions predicted by real-time electrophysiology analysis. When implanted into epileptic animals, the device enables autonomous antiseizure management, where the dosing of antiepileptic drug is controlled in a time-sensitive, region-selective, and dose-adaptive manner, allowing the inhibition of seizure outbursts through the delivery of just-necessary drug dosages.

          "abstract": "It remains a grand challenge to develop electrocatalysts with simultaneously high activity, long durability, and low cost for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), originating from two competing reaction pathways and often trade-off performances. The adsorbed evolution mechanism (AEM) suffers from sluggish kinetics due to a linear scaling relationship, while the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) causes unstable structures due to lattice oxygen escape. We propose a MoZnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) incorporating AEM-promoter Mo and LOM-active Zn to achieve dual activation and stabilization for efficient and durable OER. Density functional theory and chemical probe experiments confirmed dual-mechanism activation, with representative Co-Co † -Mo sites facilitating AEM and Zn-O † -Ni sites enhancing LOM, resulting in an ultralow OER overpotential (η 10 = 221 mV). The multielement interaction, high-entropy structure, and carbon network notably enhance structural stability for durable catalysis (&gt;1500 hours at 100 mA cm −2 ). Our work offers a viable approach to concurrently enhance OER activity and stability by designing HEA catalysts to enable dual-mechanism synergy.",

The self-organization process of tumor cells is facilitated by a vortex acoustic field, which enables the cell bioassembly and ion channel activation. This approach can significantly enhance the influx of calcium ions, thereby accelerating intercellular interactions of cellular assemblies. We established scaffold-free melanoma and breast cancer organoids using AV-Scaf and cocultured melanoma organoids with T cells. We found that our coculture system resulted in a high activation state of T cells, characterized by notable up-regulation of granzyme B (2.82 to 17.5%) and interferon-γ (1.36 to 16%). AV-Scaf offers an efficient method for tumor organoid–immune cell studies, advancing cancer research and immunotherapy development.",

Here, by designing a fluorescent Eu 3+ -doped Na 3 Zr 2 Si 2 PO 12 solid electrolyte (SE) to facilitate three-dimensional (3D) optical imaging on a confocal laser scanning microscopy, a fluorescence tomography (FT) method is developed for observing the sodium dendrite growth during charge/discharge cycles of the SSBs in a 3D view. It is quantitatively revealed that small-size sodium islands appear after several cycles, and with the cycles increasing, large-size dendrites in tens of micrometers gradually form until a critical sodium dendrite volume arrives where a short circuit or severe performance deterioration occurs. Furthermore, by regulating the Eu 3+ doping ratio, a record-high sodium plating/stripping cycling stability for more than 1 year (487.5 days) is achieved at 25°C. This work demonstrates an FT method observing sodium dendrite growth in SSBs and will promote the functional design of high-performance SEs.",

Here, we collected paired tissues from the tumor core (TC) and peritumoral brain (PTB) for integrated snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq analyses. Tumor cells infiltrating PTB from TC behave more like oligodendrocyte progenitor cells than astrocytes at the transcriptome level. Dual-omics analyses further suggest that the distal regulatory regions in the tumor genome and specific transcription factors are potential determinants of regional heterogeneity. Notably, while activator protein 1 (AP-1) is active in all GBM states, its activity declines from TC to PTB, with another transcription factor, BACH1, showing the opposite trend. Combined inhibition of AP-1 and BACH1 more efficiently attenuates the tumor progression in mice and prolongs survival than either single-target treatment. Together, our work reveals marked molecular alterations of infiltrated GBM cells and a synergy of combination therapy targeting intratumor heterogeneity in and distal to GBM.",

U-Pb zircon ages of tuffs constrain the OAE1a onset to 119.55 +0.072/−0.079 million years ago (Ma) and its duration to 1116 +87/−93 thousand years (kyr). Isotopic excursions of osmium followed by carbon that mark the rapid onset of OAE1a each lasted ~115 kyr.

          "abstract": "Terahertz communication technology based on on-off keying (OOK) direct modulation is vital for sixth-generation communication systems, especially in short-distance and high-rate applications. However, low-order OOK modulation often leads to suboptimal anti-interference capabilities and a heightened demodulation threshold. Here, we propose a high-order direct modulation terahertz communication framework using a wideband time-coding metachip modulator. The modulator leverages the electromagnetic resonance properties within the metaunit structure, with control enabled by gallium arsenide Schottky diodes. By manipulating the timing of voltage pulses applied to these diodes, the equivalent electromagnetic resonance distributions can be precisely regulated in the time domain. This enables independent and accurate control over the amplitude and phase of terahertz harmonics. Leveraging this technique, three high-order modulation schemes—quadrature phase-shift keying, 16-phase-shift keying, and 16-quadrature amplitude modulation— are achieved in a direct modulation and direct detection system, demonstrating the real-time image transmission. The proposed method offers an important way to develop integrated and low-complexity terahertz wireless communication systems.",

Traditionally, the classical Drude model describes plasmonic excitation, wherein plasma frequency exhibits no spatial dispersion. Here, we show conclusive experimental evidence of the breakdown of plasmon resonance and a consequent metal-insulator transition in an ultrathin refractory plasmonic material, hafnium nitride (HfN). Epitaxial HfN thick films exhibit a low-loss and high-quality Drude-like plasmon resonance in the visible spectral range. However, as the film thickness is reduced to nanoscale dimensions, Coulomb interaction among electrons increases because of electron confinement, leading to the spatial dispersion of plasma frequency. With a further decrease in thickness, electrons lose their ability to shield the incident electric field, turning the medium into a dielectric. The observed metal-insulator transition might carry some signatures of Wigner crystallization and indicates that such transdimensional, between 2D and 3D, films can serve as a promising playground to study strongly correlated electron systems.",
