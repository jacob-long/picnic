          "authors": "Tristan L. Botelho, Sora Jun, Demetrius Humes, Katherine A. DeCelles",
          "abstract": "Online platforms are rife with racial discrimination1, but current interventions focus on employers2,3 rather than customers. We propose a customer-facing solution: changing to a two-point rating scale (dichotomization). Compared with the ubiquitous five-star scale, we argue that dichotomization reduces modern racial discrimination by focusing evaluators on the distinction between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ performance, thereby reducing how personal beliefs shape customer assessments. Study 1 is a quasi-natural experiment on a home-services labour platform (n = 69,971) in which the company exogenously changed from a five-star scale to a dichotomous scale (thumbs up or thumbs down). Dichotomization eliminated customers’ racial discrimination whereby non-white workers received lower ratings and earned 91 cents for each US dollar paid to white workers for the same work. A pre-registered experiment (study 2, n = 652) found that the equalizing effect of dichotomization is most prevalent among evaluators holding modern racist beliefs. Further experiments (study 3, n = 1,435; study 4, n = 528) provide evidence of the proposed mechanism, and eight supplementary studies support measurement and design choices. Our research offers a promising intervention for reducing customers’ subtle racial discrimination in a large section of the economy and contributes to the interdisciplinary literature on evaluation processes and racial inequality.",

          "authors": "Adam S. Lowet, Qiao Zheng, Melissa Meng, Sara Matias, Jan Drugowitsch, Naoshige Uchida",
          "abstract": "Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions3. Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons4,5,6,7,8,9 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.",

They raised important concerns, which led them to conclude that our dataset was underpowered to be informative about human evolution during the Black Death. We agree that small sample sizes are an inherent limitation of ancient DNA studies. To address this, we incorporated multiple lines of evidence, including genomic data spanning before, during and after the Black Death; replication across two distinct population cohorts; and experimental data on cellular responses to Yersinia pestis infection, to build a case for selection. Our functional analyses—a rarity in ancient DNA studies—are further supported by independent epidemiological data, showing that the putatively selected ERAP2 allele does indeed protect against severe respiratory infection in contemporary populations3. Together, all lines of evidence continue to support selection on ERAP2.",

          "abstract": "The complex life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum involves several major differentiation stages, each requiring strict control of gene expression. Fundamental changes in chromatin structure and epigenetic modifications during life cycle progression suggest a central role for these mechanisms in regulating the transcriptional program of malaria parasite development 1–6 . P. falciparum chromatin is distinct from other eukaryotes, with an extraordinarily high AT content (&gt;80%) 7 and highly divergent histones resulting in atypical DNA packaging properties 8 . Moreover, the chromatin remodellers that are critical for shaping chromatin structure are not conserved and are unexplored in P. falciparum . Here we identify P. falciparum Snf2L ( Pf Snf2L, encoded by PF3D7_1104200 ) as an ISWI-related ATPase that actively repositions P. falciparum nucleosomes in vitro. Our results demonstrate that Pf Snf2L is essential, regulating both asexual development and sexual differentiation. Pf Snf2L globally controls just-in-time transcription by spatiotemporally determining nucleosome positioning at the promoters of stage-specific genes. The unique sequence and functional properties of Pf Snf2L led to the identification of an inhibitor that specifically kills P. falciparum and phenocopies the loss of correct gene expression timing. The inhibitor represents a new class of antimalarial transmission-blocking drugs, inhibiting gametocyte formation.",

          "abstract": "Chronic stress can change how we learn and, thus, how we make decisions1,2,3,4,5. Here we investigated the neuronal circuit mechanisms that enable this. Using a multifaceted systems neuroscience approach in male and female mice, we reveal a dual-pathway, amygdala–striatal neuronal circuit architecture by which a recent history of chronic stress disrupts the action–outcome learning underlying adaptive agency and promotes the formation of inflexible habits. We found that the projection from the basolateral amygdala to the dorsomedial striatum is activated by rewarding events to support the action–outcome learning needed for flexible, goal-directed decision-making. Chronic stress attenuates this to disrupt action–outcome learning and, therefore, agency. Conversely, the projection from the central amygdala to the dorsomedial striatum mediates habit formation. Following stress, this pathway is progressively recruited to learning to promote the premature formation of inflexible habits. Thus, stress exerts opposing effects on two amygdala–striatal pathways to disrupt agency and promote habit. These data provide neuronal circuit insights into how chronic stress shapes learning and decision-making, and help understanding of how stress can lead to the disrupted decision-making and pathological habits that characterize substance use disorders and mental health conditions.",

          "abstract": "Neoantigen vaccines are under investigation for various cancers, including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR )-driven lung cancers 1,2 . We tracked the phylogenetic history of an EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with erlotinib, osimertinib, radiotherapy and a personalized neopeptide vaccine (NPV) targeting ten somatic mutations, including EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del). The ex19del mutation was clonal, but is likely to have appeared after a whole-genome doubling (WGD) event. Following osimertinib and NPV treatment, loss of the ex19del mutation was identified in a progressing small-cell-transformed liver metastasis. Circulating tumour DNA analyses tracking 467 somatic variants revealed the presence of this EGFR wild-type clone before vaccination and its expansion during osimertinib/NPV therapy. Despite systemic T cell reactivity to the vaccine-targeted ex19del neoantigen, the NPV failed to halt disease progression. The liver metastasis lost vaccine-targeted neoantigens through chromosomal instability and exhibited a hostile microenvironment, characterized by limited immune infiltration, low CXCL9 and elevated M2 macrophage levels. Neoantigens arising post-WGD were more likely to be absent in the progressing liver metastasis than those occurring pre-WGD, suggesting that prioritizing pre-WGD neoantigens may improve vaccine design. Data from the TRACERx 421 cohort 3 provide evidence that pre-WGD mutations better represent clonal variants, and owing to their presence at multiple copy numbers, are less likely to be lost in metastatic transition. These data highlight the power of phylogenetic disease tracking and functional T cell profiling to understand mechanisms of immune escape during combination therapies.",

          "abstract": "Gas samples relevant to health1,2,3 and the environment4,5,6 typically contain many molecular species that span a huge concentration dynamic range. Mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy with high-finesse cavity enhancement has allowed the most sensitive multispecies trace-gas detections so far2,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. However, the robust performance of this technique depends critically on ensuring absorption-path-length enhancement over a broad spectral coverage, which is severely limited by comb–cavity frequency mismatch if strongly absorbing compounds are present. Here we introduce modulated ringdown comb interferometry, a technique that resolves the vulnerability of comb–cavity enhancement to strong intracavity absorption or dispersion. This technique works by measuring ringdown dynamics carried by massively parallel comb lines transmitted through a length-modulated cavity, making use of both the periodicity of the field dynamics and the Doppler frequency shifts introduced from a Michelson interferometer. As a demonstration, we measure highly dispersive exhaled human breath samples and ambient air in the mid-infrared with finesse improved to 23,000 and coverage to 1,010 cm−1. Such a product of finesse and spectral coverage is orders of magnitude better than all previous demonstrations2,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, enabling us to simultaneously quantify 20 distinct molecular species at above 1-part-per-trillion sensitivity varying in concentrations by seven orders of magnitude. This technique unlocks next-generation sensing performance for complex and dynamic molecular compositions, with scalable improvement to both finesse and spectral coverage.",

          "abstract": "The survival of malignant cells within tumours is often seen as depending on ruthless competition for nutrients and other resources1,2. Although competition is certainly critical for tumour evolution and cancer progression, cooperative interactions within tumours are also important, albeit poorly understood3,4. Cooperative populations at all levels of biological organization risk extinction if their population size falls below a critical tipping point5,6. Here we examined whether cooperation among tumour cells may be a potential therapeutic target. We identified a cooperative mechanism that enables tumour cells to proliferate under the amino acid-deprived conditions found in the tumour microenvironment. Disruption of this mechanism drove cultured tumour populations to the critical extinction point and resulted in a marked reduction in tumour growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that tumour cells collectively digest extracellular oligopeptides through the secretion of aminopeptidases. The resulting free amino acids benefit both aminopeptidase-secreting cells and neighbouring cells. We identified CNDP2 as the key enzyme that hydrolyses these peptides extracellularly, and loss of this aminopeptidase prevents tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. These data show that cooperative scavenging of nutrients is key to survival in the tumour microenvironment and reveal a targetable cancer vulnerability.",

However, it is challenging for ultrasmall CsPbI3 QDs to retain their solution-phase properties when they assemble into conductive films, greatly hindering their device application3,6. Here we report an approach for in situ deposit stabilized ultrasmall CsPbI3 QD conductive solids, by constructing CsPbI3 QD/quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite heteroepitaxy. The well-aligned periodic array of edge-oriented ligands at heterointerface triggers a substantial octahedral tilting in a critical layer thickness of CsPbI3 QDs, which heightens the Gibbs free energy difference between the tilted-CsPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 leading to thermodynamic stabilization of CsPbI3 QDs. The approach allows us to fabricate stabilized CsPbI3 QD conductive films with tunable emission covering the entire red spectral region from 600 nm to 710 nm. Here we report the pure-red PeLEDs with narrow electroluminescence peak centred at 630 nm, matching the Rec. 2100 standard for ultrahigh-definition display. The champion device exhibits a certified external quantum efficiency of 24.6% and a half-lifetime of 6,330 min, ranking as one of the most efficient and stable pure-red PeLED reported to date.

          "abstract": "The generation of large-scale entangled states is crucial for quantum technologies, such as quantum computation1, communication2 and metrology3. Integrated quantum photonics that enables on-chip encoding, processing and detection of quantum light states offers a promising platform for the generation and manipulation of large-scale entangled states4,5. Generating entanglement between qubits encoded in discrete variables within single photons is challenging, owing to the difficulty of making single photons interact on photonic chips6,7,8,9,10,11. Devices that operate with continuous variables are more promising, as they enable the deterministic generation and entanglement of qumodes, in which information is encoded in light quadratures. Demonstrations so far have been limited to entanglement between two qumodes12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. Here we report the deterministic generation of a continuous-variable eight-mode entanglement on an integrated optical chip. The chip delivers a quantum microcomb that produces multimode squeezed-vacuum optical frequency combs below the threshold. We verify the inseparability of our eight-mode state and demonstrate supermode multipartite entanglement over hundreds of megahertz sideband frequencies through violation of the van Loock–Furusawa criteria. By measuring the full matrices of nullifier correlations with sufficiently low off-diagonal noises, we characterize multipartite entanglement structures, which are approximate to the expected cluster-type structures for finite squeezing.

          "abstract": "DNA damage promotes mutations that fuel cancer, ageing and neurodegenerative diseases1,2,3, but surprisingly, the causes and types of damage remain largely unknown. There are three identified mechanisms that damage DNA during transcription: collision of RNA polymerase (RNAP) with the DNA-replication machinery head-on and co-directionally4,5,6, and R-loop-induced DNA breakage7,8,9,10. Here we identify novel DNA damage reaction intermediates11,12 and uncover a fourth transcription-related source of DNA damage: endogenous DNA damage at sites of terminated transcripts. We engineered proteins to capture single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends with 3′ polarity in bacterial and human cells. In Escherichia coli, spontaneous 3′-ssDNA-end foci were unexpectedly frequent, at one or more per cell division, and arose via two identifiable pathways, both of which were dependent on DNA replication. A pathway associated with double-strand breaks was suppressed by overexpression of replicative DNA polymerase (pol) III, suggesting competition between pol III and DNA damage-promoting proteins. Mapping of recurrent 3′-ssDNA-ends identified distinct 3′-ssDNA-end-hotspots, mostly unrelated to double-strand breaks, next to the 5′-CCTTTTTT transcription-terminator-like sequence. These 3′-ssDNA-termini coincide with RNA 3′-termini identified by DirectRNA sequencing13 or simultaneous 5′ and 3′ end RNA sequencing (SEnd-seq)14 and were prevented by a mutant RNAP that reads through terminators. Our findings reveal that transcription termination or pausing can promote DNA damage and subsequent genomic instability.",

          "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) disrupt the continuity of the genome, with consequences for malignant transformation. Massive DNA damage can elicit a cellular checkpoint response that prevents cell proliferation1,2. However, how highly aggressive cancer cells, which can tolerate widespread DNA damage, respond to DSBs alongside continuous chromosome duplication is unknown. Here we show that DSBs induce a local genome maintenance mechanism that inhibits replication initiation in DSB-containing topologically associating domains (TADs) without affecting DNA synthesis at other genomic locations. This process is facilitated by mediators of replication and DSBs (MRDs). In normal and cancer cells, MRDs include the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex and the WEE1 kinase, which actively dislodges the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex from replication origins adjacent to DSBs and prevents initiation of DNA synthesis at DSB-containing TADs. Dysregulation of MRDs, or disruption of 3D chromatin architecture by dissolving TADs, results in inadvertent replication in damaged chromatin and increased DNA damage in cancer cells. We propose that the intact MRD cascade precedes DSB repair to prevent genomic instability, which is otherwise observed when replication is forced, or when genome architecture is challenged, in the presence of DSBs3,4,5. These observations reveal a previously unknown vulnerability in the DNA replication machinery that may be exploited to therapeutically target cancer cells.",

Here, using 18 single, double and triple whole-body and tissue-specific knockout and mutant mice, along with systematic mitochondrial morphology analysis, untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered that the synergy between two stress-responsive systems—the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin and the metalloprotease OMA1—safeguards mitochondrial structure and genome by mitochondrial fusion, mediated by the outer membrane GTPase MFN1 and the inner membrane GTPase OPA1. Whereas the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses. Thus, our data show that Parkin and OMA1 maintain a dual regulatory mechanism that controls mitochondrial fusion at the two membranes, even in the absence of extrinsic stress.",

          "abstract": "Glaciers are indicators of ongoing anthropogenic climate change 1 . Their melting leads to increased local geohazards 2 , and impacts marine 3 and terrestrial 4,5 ecosystems, regional freshwater resources 6 , and both global water and energy cycles 7,8 . Together with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, glaciers are essential drivers of present 9,10 and future 11–13 sea-level rise. Previous assessments of global glacier mass changes have been hampered by spatial and temporal limitations and the heterogeneity of existing data series 14–16 . Here we show in an intercomparison exercise that glaciers worldwide lost 273 ± 16 gigatonnes in mass annually from 2000 to 2023, with an increase of 36 ± 10% from the first (2000–2011) to the second (2012–2023) half of the period. Since 2000, glaciers have lost between 2% and 39% of their ice regionally and about 5% globally. Glacier mass loss is about 18% larger than the loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and more than twice that from the Antarctic Ice Sheet 17 . Our results arise from a scientific community effort to collect, homogenize, combine and analyse glacier mass changes from in situ and remote-sensing observations. Although our estimates are in agreement with findings from previous assessments 14–16 at a global scale, we found some large regional deviations owing to systematic differences among observation methods. Our results provide a refined baseline for better understanding observational differences and for calibrating model ensembles 12,16,18 , which will help to narrow projection uncertainty for the twenty-first century 11,12,18 .",

          "abstract": "A fundamental challenge for cancer vaccines is to generate long-lived functional T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Here we find that mRNA–lipoplex vaccines against somatic mutation-derived neoantigens may solve this challenge in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a lethal cancer with few mutations. At an extended 3.2-year median follow-up from a phase 1 trial of surgery, atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitory antibody), autogene cevumeran1 (individualized neoantigen vaccine with backbone-optimized uridine mRNA–lipoplex nanoparticles) and modified (m) FOLFIRINOX (chemotherapy) in patients with PDAC, we find that responders with vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8) have prolonged recurrence-free survival (RFS; median not reached) compared with non-responders without vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8; median RFS 13.4 months; P  =  0.007). In responders, autogene cevumeran induces CD8+ T cell clones with an average estimated lifespan of 7.7 years (range 1.5 to roughly 100 years), with approximately 20% of clones having latent multi-decade lifespans that may outlive hosts. Eighty-six percent of clones per patient persist at substantial frequencies approximately 3 years post-vaccination, including clones with high avidity to PDAC neoepitopes. Using PhenoTrack, a novel computational strategy to trace single T cell phenotypes, we uncover that vaccine-induced clones are undetectable in pre-vaccination tissues, and assume a cytotoxic, tissue-resident memory-like T cell state up to three years post-vaccination with preserved neoantigen-specific effector function. Two responders recurred and evidenced fewer vaccine-induced T cells. Furthermore, recurrent PDACs were pruned of vaccine-targeted cancer clones. Thus, in PDAC, autogene cevumeran induces de novo CD8+ T cells with multiyear longevity, substantial magnitude and durable effector functions that may delay PDAC recurrence. Adjuvant mRNA–lipoplex neoantigen vaccines may thus solve a pivotal obstacle for cancer vaccination.",

We identified T cell receptor clones capable of recognizing and targeting neoantigens derived from aberrant splicing in GNAS and RPL22 . In cases with multi-site biopsies, we detected the tumour-wide expression of the GNAS neojunction in glioma, mesothelioma, prostate cancer and liver cancer. These neoantigens are endogenously generated and presented by tumour cells under physiologic conditions and are sufficient to trigger cancer cell eradication by neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells. Moreover, our study highlights a role for dysregulated splicing factor expression in specific cancer types, leading to recurrent patterns of neojunction upregulation. These findings establish a molecular basis for T cell-based immunotherapies addressing the challenges of intratumoural heterogeneity.",

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide 1,2 . HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that accumulate progressive driver mutations 3 , with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin 2 . However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is broadly independent of the underlying aetiologies 4 . Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC, outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations 5,6 . Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC 7 . Here we generated a suite of genetically driven immunocompetent in vivo and matched in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance and metastasis. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human–mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with the human histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard-of-care treatment and used a linked in vitro–in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not previously been linked to HCC treatment. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy.",

Using game development as a lens, we demonstrate that we can make use of an understanding of user needs to drive the development and evaluation of generative AI models in a way that aligns with these creative practices. Concretely, we introduce a state-of-the-art generative model, the World and Human Action Model (WHAM), and show that it can generate consistent and diverse gameplay sequences and persist user modifications—three capabilities that we identify as being critical for this alignment.

We implement a single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity6,7,8,9,10,11 in indium arsenide–aluminium heterostructures with a gate-defined superconducting nanowire12,13,14. The interferometer is formed by tunnel-coupling the proximitized nanowire to quantum dots. The nanowire causes a state-dependent shift of the quantum capacitance of these quantum dots of up to 1 fF. Our quantum-capacitance measurements show flux h/2e-periodic bimodality with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1 in 3.6 μs at optimal flux values. From the time traces of the quantum-capacitance measurements, we extract a dwell time in the two associated states that is longer than 1 ms at in-plane magnetic fields of approximately 2 T. We discuss the interpretation of our measurements in terms of both topologically trivial and non-trivial origins. The large capacitance shift and long poisoning time enable a parity measurement with an assignment error probability of 1%.",

In multiple mouse models of gastric cancer, nociceptive nerves demonstrated the greatest degree of nerve expansion in an NGF-dependent manner. Neural tracing identified CGRP+ peptidergic neurons as the primary gastric sensory neurons. Three-dimensional co-culture models showed that sensory neurons directly connect with gastric cancer spheroids. Chemogenetic activation of sensory neurons induced the release of calcium into the cytoplasm of cancer cells, promoting tumour growth and metastasis. Pharmacological ablation of sensory neurons or treatment with CGRP inhibitors suppressed tumour growth and extended survival. Depolarization of gastric tumour membranes through in vivo optogenetic activation led to enhanced calcium flux in jugular nucleus complex and CGRP release, defining a cancer cell–peptidergic neuronal circuit. Together, these findings establish the functional connectivity between cancer and sensory neurons, identifying this pathway as a potential therapeutic target.",

In mammals, fatty acid synthase (FASN) contains multiple enzymatic domains to catalyze all chemical reactions needed for de novo fatty acid synthesis1. While the chemical reactions carried out by these enzymatic domains are well defined, how the dimeric FASN with an open architecture continuously catalyzes such reactions to synthesize a complete fatty acid remains elusive. Here, using a strategy of tagging and purifying endogenous FASN in HEK293 for single particle cryogenic electron microscopy studies, we characterized the structural dynamics of endogenous human FASN. We captured the conformational snapshots of various functional substates in the condensing cycle and developed a procedure to analyze particle distribution landscape of FASN with different orientations between its condensing and modifying wings. Together, we reveal that FASN function does not require large rotational motion between its two major functional domains during the condensing cycle, and that the catalytic reactions in condensing cycle carried out by two monomers are unsynchronized. Our data thus provide a new composite view of FASN dynamics during the fatty acid synthesis condensing cycle.",

          "abstract": "When two insulating, neutral materials are contacted and separated, they exchange electrical charge 1 . Experiments have long suggested that this ‘contact electrification’ is transitive, with different materials ordering into ‘triboelectric series’ based on the sign of charge acquired 2 . At the same time, the effect is plagued by unpredictability, preventing consensus on the mechanism and casting doubt on the rhyme and reason that series imply 3 . Here we expose an unanticipated connection between the unpredictability and order in contact electrification: nominally identical materials initially exchange charge randomly and intransitively, but—over repeated experiments—order into triboelectric series. We find that this evolution is driven by the act of contact itself—samples with more contacts in their history charge negatively to ones with fewer contacts. Capturing this ‘contact bias’ in a minimal model, we recreate both the initial randomness and ultimate order in numerical simulations and use it experimentally to force the appearance of a triboelectric series of our choosing. With a set of surface-sensitive techniques to search for the underlying alterations contact creates, we only find evidence of nanoscale morphological changes, pointing to a mechanism strongly coupled with mechanics. Our results highlight the centrality of contact history in contact electrification and suggest that focusing on the unpredictability that has long plagued the effect may hold the key to understanding it.",

          "abstract": "Most current strategies for carbon management require CO2 removal (CDR) from the atmosphere on the multi-hundred gigatonne (Gt) scale by 2100 (refs. 1,2,3,4,5). Mg-rich silicate minerals can remove >105 Gt CO2 and sequester it as stable and innocuous carbonate minerals or dissolved bicarbonate ions3,6,7. However, the reaction rates of these minerals under ambient conditions are far too slow for practical use. Here we show that CaCO3 and CaSO4 react quantitatively with diverse Mg-rich silicates (for example, olivine, serpentine and augite) under thermochemical conditions to form Ca2SiO4 and MgO. On exposure to ambient air under wet conditions, Ca2SiO4 is converted to CaCO3 and silicic acid, and MgO is partially converted into a Mg carbonate within weeks, whereas the input Mg silicate shows no reactivity over 6 months. Alternatively, Ca2SiO4 and MgO can be completely carbonated to CaCO3 and Mg(HCO3)2 under 1 atm CO2 at ambient temperature within hours. Using CaCO3 as the Ca source, this chemistry enables a CDR process in which the output Ca2SiO4/MgO material is used to remove CO2 from air or soil and the CO2 process emissions are sequestered. Analysis of the energy requirements indicates that this process could require less than 1 MWh per tonne CO2 removed, approximately half the energy of CO2 capture with leading direct air capture technologies. The chemistry described here could unlock Mg-rich silicates as a vast resource for safe and permanent CDR.",

HGGs include clinically, anatomically and molecularly distinct subtypes that stratify into diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), such as H3K27M-altered diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and hemispheric HGGs, such as IDH wild-type glioblastoma. Neuronal activity drives glioma progression through paracrine signalling1,2 and neuron-to-glioma synapses3,4,5,6. Glutamatergic AMPA receptor-dependent synapses between neurons and glioma cells have been demonstrated in paediatric3 and adult4 high-grade gliomas, and early work has suggested heterogeneous glioma GABAergic responses7. However, neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by neurotransmitters other than glutamate remain understudied. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, in vivo optogenetics and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models, we identified functional, tumour-promoting GABAergic neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by GABAA receptors in DMGs. GABAergic input has a depolarizing effect on DMG cells due to NKCC1 chloride transporter function and consequently elevated intracellular chloride concentration in DMG malignant cells. As membrane depolarization increases glioma proliferation3,6, we found that the activity of GABAergic interneurons promotes DMG proliferation in vivo. The benzodiazepine lorazepam enhances GABA-mediated signalling, increases glioma proliferation and growth, and shortens survival in DMG patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models. By contrast, only minimal depolarizing GABAergic currents were found in hemispheric HGGs and lorazepam did not influence the growth rate of hemispheric glioblastoma xenografts. Together, these findings uncover growth-promoting GABAergic synaptic communication between GABAergic neurons and H3K27M-altered DMG cells, underscoring a tumour subtype-specific mechanism of brain cancer neurophysiology.",

SPO11 is critical for meiosis in most species, but it generates dangerous DSBs with mutagenic 2 and gametocidal 3 potential. Cells must therefore utilize the beneficial functions of SPO11 while minimizing its risks 4 —how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we report reconstitution of DNA cleavage in vitro with purified recombinant mouse SPO11 bound to TOP6BL. SPO11–TOP6BL complexes are monomeric (1:1) in solution and bind tightly to DNA, but dimeric (2:2) assemblies cleave DNA to form covalent 5′ attachments that require SPO11 active-site residues, divalent metal ions and SPO11 dimerization. SPO11 can also reseal DNA that it has nicked. Structure modelling with AlphaFold 3 suggests that DNA is bent prior to cleavage 5 . In vitro cleavage displays a sequence bias that partially explains DSB site preferences in vivo. Cleavage is inefficient on complex DNA substrates, partly because SPO11 is readily trapped in DSB-incompetent (presumably monomeric) binding states that exchange slowly. However, cleavage is improved with substrates that favour dimer assembly or by artificially dimerizing SPO11. Our results inform a model in which intrinsically weak dimerization restrains SPO11 activity in vivo, making it exquisitely dependent on accessory proteins that focus and control DSB formation.",

Here, using Mus musculus SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyses break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5′ broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization for the reconstitution of two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyses DNA cleavage with an activity similar to that of SPO11 alone. However, this complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role after cleavage. We propose a model in which additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11–TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage. Our work establishes SPO11 dimerization as the fundamental mechanism that controls the induction of meiotic DSBs.",

Here we present the accurate design of ligand-binding transmembrane proteins by integrating deep learning and energy-based methods. We designed pre-organized ligand-binding pockets in high-quality four-helix backbones for a fluorogenic ligand, and generated a transmembrane span using gradient-guided hallucination. The designer transmembrane proteins specifically activated fluorescence of the target fluorophore with mid-nanomolar affinity, exhibiting higher brightness and quantum yield compared to those of enhanced green fluorescent protein. These proteins were highly active in the membrane fraction of live bacterial and eukaryotic cells following expression. The crystal and cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the designer protein–ligand complexes were very close to the structures of the design models. We showed that the interactions between ligands and transmembrane proteins within the membrane can be accurately designed.

Traditionally, TMDs are epitaxially grown on crystalline substrates by chemical vapour deposition. However, this approach requires post-growth transfer to target substrates, which makes controlling thickness and scalability difficult. Here we introduce a method called hypotaxy (‘hypo’ meaning downward and ‘taxy’ meaning arrangement), which enables wafer-scale single-crystal TMD growth directly on various substrates, including amorphous and lattice-mismatched substrates, while preserving crystalline alignment with an overlying 2D template. By sulfurizing or selenizing a pre-deposited metal film under graphene, aligned TMD nuclei form, coalescing into a single-crystal film as graphene is removed. This method achieves precise MoS2 thickness control from monolayer to hundreds of layers on diverse substrates, producing 4-inch single-crystal MoS2 with high thermal conductivity (about 120 W m−1 K−1) and mobility (around 87 cm2 V−1 s−1). Furthermore, nanopores created in graphene using oxygen plasma treatment allow MoS2 growth at a lower temperature of 400 °C, compatible with back-end-of-line processes. This hypotaxy approach extends to other TMDs, such as MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, offering a solution to substrate limitations in conventional epitaxy and enabling wafer-scale TMDs for monolithic three-dimensional integration.",

Using a point-mutation strategy, we reveal that Mg2+ is essential for the DNA-cleavage activity of this complex in vitro, as confirmed by knock-in mice carrying a point mutation in SPO11 that disrupts its binding to Mg2+, thereby abolishing DSB formation. However, the activity of the SPO11 complex is ATP-independent. We also present evidence that the mouse SPO11 complex is biochemically distinct from the ancestral topoisomerase VI.

In mammals, a single gene encodes six catalytically active domains and a flexibly tethered acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that shuttles intermediates between active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis1. FASN is an essential enzyme in mammalian development through the role that fatty acids have in membrane formation, energy storage, cell signalling and protein modifications. Thus, FASN is a promising target for treatment of a large variety of diseases including cancer, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, and viral and parasite infections2,3. The multi-faceted mechanism of FASN and the dynamic nature of the protein, in particular of the ACP, have made it challenging to understand at the molecular level. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human FASN in a multitude of conformational states with NADPH and NADP+ plus acetoacetyl-CoA present, including structures with the ACP stalled at the dehydratase (DH) and enoyl-reductase (ER) domains. We show that FASN activity in vitro and de novo lipogenesis in cells is inhibited by mutations at the ACP–DH and ACP–ER interfaces.

          "abstract": "Modular structure and function are ubiquitous in biology, from the organization of animal brains and bodies to the scale of ecosystems. However, the mechanisms of modularity emergence from non-modular precursors remain unclear. Here we introduce the principle of peak selection, a process by which purely local interactions and smooth gradients can drive the self-organization of discrete global modules. The process combines strengths of the positional and Turing pattern-formation mechanisms into a model for morphogenesis. Applied to the grid-cell system of the brain, peak selection results in the self-organization of functionally distinct modules with discretely spaced spatial periods. Applied to ecological systems, it results in discrete multispecies niches and synchronous spawning across geographically distributed coral colonies. The process exhibits self-scaling with system size and ‘topological robustness’1, which renders module emergence and module properties insensitive to most parameters. Peak selection ameliorates the fine-tuning requirement for continuous attractor dynamics in single grid-cell modules and it makes a detail-independent prediction that grid module period ratios should approximate adjacent integer ratios, providing a highly accurate match to the available data. Predictions for grid cells at the transcriptional, connectomic and physiological levels promise to elucidate the interplay of molecules, connectivity and function emergence in brains.",

When we reached the edge of the bluff and saw that big ole mess below, you’d expect a cuss word or two, ’specially this bein’ the fifth flood in less as many years. But he just whistled an’ shook his head.\n\nOver a decade ago now, when I was just a lil’ one, we lived in a small house down on the riverbank. One spring, in the middle o’ the night, them waters came for us, unexpected-like. Paw barely got me an’ sis out alive. Mama didn’t make it. Some folk still rebuild down there, stubborn as ever, but time an’ again, they get washed out an’ hafta clean up the mess or start anew elsewheres.\n\nAnyhoo, the stink o’ wet dirt was real strong in the air. Could smell a bit o’ rot as well. There was dead things down there in the mud an’ silt. Lotsa fine fish that’d be welcome in our nets was lyin’ in the mud with flies buzzin’ ’round ’em.\n\n“Paw,” I says. “Why’s it gotta be like this, anyway? They say on the news this’s ’nother one o’ them ‘hundred year’ floods. But it ain’t been a hundred years since the last one, or the one before!”\n\n“Don’t pay that any mind,” he says, shakin’ his head again. “The droughts, them rains, these floods. Just cyclical, that’s all.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“Well, if that’s true, when’s the cycle gonna end?”\n\n“Only God knows that, boy. Not them people on the news.” I could tell he didn’t wanna talk none more ’bout it, so I stopped with my questions.\n\nHe beckoned me ta follow him down to the bank, so I did. Slow goin’, on account o’ the mud an’ debris an’ such. That brown river, still flowin’ a few inches ’bove the bank, rumbled and roared, carryin’ trees, sticks an’ other bits o’ wood from far upstream. I even saw the puffed-up body of a pig float on by in the white an’ yeller foam of them rapids.\n\nPaw stopped here an’ there to twist his walkin’ stick through the mud, measurin’ the depth o’ the silt that covered the road, which had mostly been spared, by some miracle. But the fishin’ boats were gone, and all that was left o’ the docks were them posts.\n\n“It ain’t right,” I says over the sounds of the river. “Havin’ ta rebuild new docks so frequent. An’ I don’t see our boat nowhere this time.”\n\nPaw just shrugged. “We’ll build a new one.” He put a hand on my shoulder. “Look, boy. We’s fisherfolk. This’s what we do. We keep goin’. Gotta bring food ta table, an’ food ta market. Ain’t no flood’s gonna stop us.” An’ then he kept on walkin’ along the bank, shakin’ his head at the things we was seein’. I had ta wonder how long we could keep goin’ like this, determined or no.\n\nAfter we got back home an’ were eatin’ some lunch with Liz, my sis, I remind Paw that my friend Leon and his family was movin’ away the next day, an’ asked if I could go pay my respects.\n\nHe looks at me an’ nods, then he says, “Go on an’ say goodbye to yer friend.” I got up ta wash my plate and he goes, “We don’t need them rich folk anyway. They just take what they want an’ go. Always the same.”\n\nFisherfolk like me weren’t s’posed ta mix with them types, but me an’ Leon were like brothers. His paw tried ta keep us apart, but Leon wouldn’t have it, an’ he won out in the end. But now he was leavin’, and though it hurt me plenty, I was beginnin’ ta understand why they was goin’ away.\n\nLater on that evenin’, we’re in Leon’s rec room, as they calls it. We’d been havin’ fun, playin’ some card games an’ rememberin’ ole times, but he got all serious-like all’va sudden. He looked me straight in the eyes an’ he says, “This world. It’s dying, you know.”\n\nI didn’t know what ta say to that, so I just go, “Whaddaya mean, dyin’?”\n\n“We’ve ruined it.

Credit: Creative Touch Imaging Ltd./NurPhoto/Getty\n\nFive days of indulging in chocolate bars, crisps and other junk foods can lead to lingering changes in brain activity, a study shows1. The resulting brain patterns are similar to those seen in people who have obesity.\n\nA junk-food splurge shifted brain patterns in healthy young men despite their body weight and composition remaining unchanged, according to the study, published on 21 February in Nature Metabolism.\n\n“I didn’t expect the effect to be so clear in a healthy population,” says neuroscientist Stephanie Kullmann at the University of Tübingen in Germany, who led the study.\n\nBut another scientist says that there are limitations to the study, which relied on a nasal spray to deliver the digestive hormone insulin. “The authors give very large doses of insulin,” says physiologist Christoph Buettner, “four to five times the amount that a human releases into the bloodstream over 24 hours.” Buettner, at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, was not involved in the study. Kullmann responds that not all of the inhaled insulin reached the brain and that more study is needed to pinpoint how much does.\n\nChocolate and chips\n\nAfter a bite of food, the pancreas releases insulin to aid metabolism. Some of that insulin enters the brain, where it works to dampen appetite. But the brain’s response to the hormone is weakened in some people with obesity2. This ‘brain insulin resistance’ affects how the body processes food.\n\nTo learn more about the effects of insulin in the brain, Kullmann and her colleagues recruited 29 healthy male volunteers (Kullmann has a forthcoming study in women). Eighteen went on a high-calorie diet for five days. A nutritionist made customized 1,500-calorie packs of high-fat, high-sugar snacks for each participant to eat on each of the five days — but the men succeeded in increasing their caloric intake by an average of only 1,200 calories per day. “At the beginning, they were kind of excited,” says Kullmann, but by day 4, eating the extra processed food was a slog. Control participants ate their normal diet during the same period.\n\nWhat humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet",

          "title": "What sparked the COVID pandemic? Mounting evidence points to raccoon dogs",
          "authors": "Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "This time five years ago, the virus that causes COVID-19 was spreading around the globe unchecked. One of the biggest questions that remains is: where did it come from?\n\nToday, mounting evidence from more than a dozen studies points to a person, or people, catching the virus from a wild animal or animals at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak. And the animal at the top of the list is the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides).\n\n“There is a large focus on raccoon dogs,” says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California.\n\nSome scientists, including virologist Edward Holmes at the University of Sydney in Australia, have suspected raccoon dogs all along. On 21 January 2020, he sent an e-mail to Andersen and another colleague, with the subject ‘Outbreak poker’. In jest, he proposed a wager on the animal that might have carried the virus to people. “I’m betting raccoon dog,” he said. Holmes had seen raccoon dogs at the Huanan market when he travelled to Wuhan in 2014.\n\nBut part of the reason that raccoon dogs top the list of suspects is because they have been studied more than other animals, including ones also present at the market, says Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. There are yet more possible candidates, he says.\n\nMarion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, agrees. “We have to be modest about our ability to predict which animal species” sparked the COVID-19 pandemic, she says.\n\nThe origin of the pandemic is still deeply politicized, and the lack of clear answers hasn’t helped. The virus probably originated in bats living in southern China. From there, many scientists think it infected an intermediate animal that passed it to people. The virus could also have passed directly from bats, although that is considered less likely given their habitat is far from Wuhan. And some still suggest that the virus could have escaped, or been deliberately released, from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was known to be doing research on coronaviruses.\n\nViral host\n\nOne of the reasons raccoon dogs were suggested as a prime candidate early on is because they were probably involved in passing another, related, virus to people. In 2003, researchers isolated close matches of the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in several civets and a raccoon dog at a live-animal market in Guangdong, China.\n\nThis finding prompted researchers in Germany to investigate these animals’ susceptibility to SARS-CoV-21.\n\nThey found that raccoon dogs can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, and — despite not getting that sick themselves — can pass on the infection to other animals.\n\nStudies by Holmes and his colleagues have also shown that farmed and wild raccoon dogs in China are often infected with many viruses that can jump between species. “Raccoon dogs are very common viral hosts,” says Holmes.\n\nRight time, right place\n\nMany of the first cases of COVID-19 involved the Huanan market, suggesting it was the location of the viral spillover. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the first infected people, in late December 2019 and early January 2020, along with geolocation and epidemiological data, support this2.\n\nDuring the outbreak, the market was shut down by the authorities, but researchers know that raccoon dogs were being sold there, for their fur and as food. In June 2021, a study described the results of monthly surveys of live wild animals sold across four markets in Wuhan between May 2017 and November 2019, including seven stalls at Huanan3. Every month, an average of 38 raccoon dogs were sold at these markets. The most-sold species was the Amur hedgehog (Erinaceus amurensis), at an average 332 individuals a month. Masked palm civet (Paguma larvata), hog badgers (Arctonyx albogularis), Chinese bamboo rats (Rhizomys sinensis), and Malayan porcupines (Hystrix brachyura) were also regularly sold.\n\nDecember 2019 sales records from the Huanan market also list trading of live animals or products from bamboo rats, porcupines and hedgehogs, among others.\n\nFurther evidence to support the raccoon-dog theory came in 2023. Chinese researchers published genomic data of swabs taken at the Huanan market in January 2020, after it was shut down, including of stalls, rubbish bins and sewage4. Studies found mitochondrial DNA of raccoon dogs in several swabs, including those that also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Raccoon dogs and hoary bamboo rats (Rhizomys pruinosus) were the most common mammalian wildlife species detected in the mitochondrial DNA; material from civets and hog badgers was also found but not in many samples5. The findings don’t prove that the animals were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but had they been infected, this is the type of evidence you would expect to find, says Andersen.\n\nUnpublished work by Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, suggests that some of the raccoon dogs and greater hog badgers (Arctonyx collaris) at the market were probably sick, although it is not clear what virus they were infected with.\n\nOther animals at the market, which could also have been infected with the virus and possibly passed it to people, include bamboo rats, Malayan porcupines, and Amur hedgehogs. But researchers don’t know how susceptible those species are to SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread.\n\nCellular studies suggest that Himalayan palm civets can be infected with the virus, but whether they can pass the virus onto other animals hasn’t been studied, partly because such studies are expensive and weren’t a priority early in the pandemic, says Koopmans.",

However, scientists’ understanding of the process that causes static cling — contact electrification — is almost nil. Contact electrification occurs owing to the transfer of electric charge between two objects that are brought into contact and then separated. A barrier to understanding the phenomenon is the notorious inconsistency of contact-electrification experiments, in which the magnitude and even the polarity of charge transfer can vary from trial to trial. Writing in Nature, Sobarzo et al.1 report a series of clever experiments showing that, in certain situations, this apparent inconsistency actually has a hidden order that provides insights into contact electrification.",

          "abstract": "Microsoft has unveiled its Majorana 1 quantum chip.Credit: John Brecher for Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has announced that it has created the first ‘topological qubits’ — a way of storing quantum information that the firm hopes will underpin a new generation of quantum computers. Machines based on topology are expected to be easier to build at scale than competing technologies, because they should better protect the information from noise. But some researchers are sceptical of the company’s claims.\n\nThe announcement came in a 19 February press release containing few technical details — but Microsoft says it has disclosed some of its data to selected specialists in a meeting at its research centre in Santa Barbara, California. “Would I bet my life that they’re seeing what they think they’re seeing? No, but it looks pretty good,” says Steven Simon, a theoretical physicist at the University of Oxford, UK, who was briefed on the results.\n\nAt the same time, the company published intermediate results — but not the proof of the existence of topological qubits — on 19 February in Nature1.\n\nSuperconducting wire\n\nTopological states are collective states of the electrons in a material that are resistant to noise, much like how two links in a chain can be shifted or rotated around each other while remaining connected.\n\nThe Nature paper describes experiments on a superconducting ‘nanowire’ device made of indium arsenide. The ultimate goal is to host two topological states called Majorana quasiparticles, one at each end of the device. Because electrons in a superconductor are paired, an extra, unpaired electron will be introduced, forming an excited state. This electron exists in a ‘delocalized’ state, which is shared between the two Majorana quasiparticles.\n\nEvidence of elusive Majorana particle dies — but computing hope lives on\n\nThe paper reports measurements suggesting that the nanowire does indeed harbour an extra electron. These tests “do not, by themselves” guarantee that the nanowire hosts two Majorana quasiparticles, the authors warn.\n\nAccording to the press release, the team has carried out follow-up experiments in which they paired two nanowires and put them in a superposition of two states — one with the extra electron in the first nanowire, and the other with the electron in the second nanowire. “We’ve built a qubit and shown that you can not only measure parity in two parallel wires, but a measurement that bridges the two wires,” says Microsoft researcher Chetan Nayak in Redmond, Washington.\n\n“There’s no slam dunk to know immediately from the experiment” that the qubits are made of topological states, says Simon. (A claim of having created Majorana states, made by a Microsoft-funded team based in Delft, the Netherlands, was retracted in 2021.) The ultimate proof will come if the devices perform as expected once they are scaled up, he adds.",

          "title": "How scientists can drive climate action: celebrate nature and promote hope",
          "authors": "Harini Nagendra",
          "abstract": "Science is necessary, but clearly not sufficient, for conveying the climate crisis. The past two years have been the hottest on record. Denial of climate change is still widespread and false claims about products’ environmental benefits, or ‘greenwashing’, are on the rise. What can researchers do?\n\nA decade ago, many scientists tended to argue that the best way they could contribute to the climate debate was to publish good ‘policy-relevant’ research — and then leave it to governments and civil-society actors to translate this science into action. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has done tremendous work in collating evidence that demonstrates the dangers of global warming and charting pathways to action. Yet, total annual global greenhouse-gas emissions are projected to be more than 60% higher in 2025 than they were in 1990, when the first IPCC report was published.\n\nClimate scientists study a world in which change is the only constant, where the collapse of our planet’s systems is widespread and evident. Most of these researchers battle a deep sense of sadness, coupled with anxiety about the future and the young people they love and care for, who will inherit a damaged planet. We must continue to document change, model impacts and describe solutions — but we cannot stop there.\n\nYoung people are crucial to research — how can they be paid fairly?\n\nIncreasingly, many climate scientists are embracing climate activism. I am a huge admirer of those who do, and have engaged in it myself — although, some scientists critique activism for its purported bias (U. Büntgen npj Clim. Action 3, 36; 2024). But there are other things we can do, too.\n\nClimate communication is an important pathway to action that we don’t speak about enough. Many academic scientists, who are also teachers, are already deeply invested in it. But we haven’t paid enough attention to communication beyond the classroom.\n\nIn May 2019, Azim Premji University in Bengaluru, India, launched the Centre for Climate Change and Sustainability (now called the School of Climate Change and Sustainability), aiming to strengthen India’s response to the climate crisis. Over the past five years, my colleagues and I have conducted public lectures and written media articles; taught short courses to upskill professionals including climate journalists, writers and practitioners; and used illustrated books, games and videos to reach diverse audiences. Three years ago, the university launched a multilingual climate festival attended by tens of thousands of young visitors across India.\n\nThrough these experiences and experimentation — ones that are relevant to other low- and middle-income country contexts — I have gathered five important lessons for climate communication.\n\nDon’t only mourn the loss of nature\n\nClimate change, biodiversity collapse and pollution are classic ‘dismal disciplines’, which can plunge young people — the main target of our communication efforts — into depression. I have seen my own students struggle to seek hope when confronted with the realities of climate change. Public communication must move beyond stories of doom and gloom, which — although realistic — have the unfortunate effect of making many people step away, instead of engaging in the conversation.\n\nTo spur climate action, educators must get personal\n\nIn real life, people interact with nature using their senses, and that’s where climate festivals can be effective. Our festivals have included art installations, movie screenings, theatre and folk-art performances, nature walks, leaf painting and mushroom collecting, as well as traditional Indian games with seeds and shells. Such immersive approaches that engage people with nature can help visitors to go beyond passively viewing scientific information and towards a more joyous and active way of interacting with climate research. This enables individuals to personalize and internalize the elements of nature in their own minds and bodies. I hope that these experiences will remain with people for their whole lives.\n\nThe names of these events use the metaphor of the Indian festival or ‘mela’ to celebrate a different facet of nature each year. In 2022, we focused on the ‘Rivers of life’ — moving to ‘Forests of life’ in 2023, ‘Mountains of life’ in 2024 and now ‘Coasts and oceans of life’ this year. We are not being unrealistically optimistic — these festivals showcase the grim realities of vanishing forests, collapsing mountains, polluted rivers and warming oceans. But we also use photoessays and the voices of local people to document the beauty of a snow-capped mountain, the joy of an Indigenous forest festival and the intimate relationship of a shaman with her river goddess. Over time, we find that these are the areas of the festival where people linger, read and interact — their eyes lighting up with hope. Celebrations pull in the crowd — and people stay to discuss the challenges.\n\nUse multilingual communication\n\nClimate-change education is not only for those who speak English, or whatever the dominant language of a region might be. India is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world, yet most scientific discussions in India are restricted to a relatively small section of the population — those who speak English. This leaves out the majority of the country’s people, who also have a stake in India’s climate future and are often highly motivated to act.\n\nAlthough the School of Climate Change and Sustainability develops its climate material in English, it has translated it into Kannada, Hindi and Assamese, and is now interpreting it in other languages. This is not without challenges. For instance, how do you take a technical term such as ‘sustainability’ and translate it into a local Indian language? A direct translation of the term in Kannada is ‘susthirate’, which means permanence, or freedom from instability. It doesn’t work. Instead, the material contains many of these technical terms, written in local script — or uses alternative ways to communicate the same idea without using the term.\n\nAzim Premji University in Bengaluru, India, hosts an annual, multilingual climate festival.Credit: Harini Nagendra\n\nThe university casts its net widely to find people who can complete the translations. Professional translators, who are used to translating literature and poetry, often use complex language with a literary flourish. However, the comprehensibility of such language can be a barrier for children from low-income, underserved public schools, who constitute about half of the visitors at our climate-change festivals.\n\nThe festival organizers now work with committed middle- and high-school language teachers, who are used to communicating complex ideas using relatively simple vocabulary. This process helps to improve the teachers’ climate-change communication skills, and strengthens the festival’s partnership with teachers, building a larger community.\n\nInvolve young people\n\nThe success of student movements around climate change, such as Fridays for Future and the Sunrise Movement, demonstrates the importance of involving young people in climate communication. However, far too often, some scientists think of young people as recipients of their knowledge, not as communicators with unique perspectives and ways to connect with others of their generation.\n\nOver the past three years, we have worked with more than 200 young interns as part of the climate festivals, who have visited different parts of India to document climate and environmental change on the ground. This has had two important outcomes.\n\nWhy we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change\n\nFirst, it has built on their capacity and commitment to the subject, transforming them into lifelong climate champions. Some of our youngest student interns — including 14-year-olds — have delivered powerful projects, including a terrarium that was the centrepiece of our art exhibits, and a display exploring the ethics around elephant capture and training in India.\n\nAnother high-school student documented an island in the Sundarbans, a mangrove forest area in the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, that is being swallowed by rising sea levels. Realizing that the residents were also dealing with other challenges, including an inadequate public-health system, the student raised money to help the islanders. Several of our younger visitors have returned to our university, applying to undergraduate programmes and seeking to contribute to climate activities.\n\nSecond, we have found that young people are more likely to react to messages delivered by other young people, rather than to more scientifically advanced, but less accessible, lectures by trained specialists. When students see other young people who have completed exciting projects, it inspires them to join forces and contribute.\n\nElevate traditional knowledge\n\nMost efforts to communicate climate science to the public use researchers to inform and influence people. But scientists and sustainability specialists are not the only people with expert knowledge. They can learn from society, as well as inform.\n\nClimate justice is a central focus for us. Although we work with many scientists, climate practitioners and activists who are excellent at communicating with wider audiences, we have also found that preaching, moralizing and proselytizing — such as by telling people that they are ‘bad’ for consuming more, using plastic, travelling by aeroplane and so on — only turns audiences away. And students often tune these messages out.\n\nExhibitions at an annual climate festival in Bengalaru, India, are used to inspire students.Credit: Harini Nagendra\n\nRather than receiving information through didactical lectures, it is much more effective to get the audience to arrive at such conclusions for themselves — by showing them photographs of people living on the coast whose lives are affected by plastic, for instance.\n\nIndigenous communities, with their deep connection to nature and different epistemological approaches, include experts of a different kind and have been too long ignored by scientists. In November 2023, the two-week ‘Forests of life’ climate festival held at our campus, was inaugurated by Soliga tribal elders. Instead of giving a specialist talk, they performed a traditional harvest dance on stage and invited students to join them. By the end of the performance, even the teachers and security and support staff were dancing with the group, transforming the atmosphere into something transcendental and joyous — a perfect launchpad for the festival.",

          "abstract": "Emergency: COVID-19 and the Uneven Valuation of Life Claire Laurier Decoteau Univ. Chicago Press (2025)\n\nIn May 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In response, US government and public-service officials promised marginalized communities that they would make real efforts to tackle racial injustice.\n\nYet, says sociologist Claire Laurier Decoteau, both the pandemic and those promises now seem long forgotten in her hometown of Chicago, Illinois.\n\nIn Emergency, Decoteau interviews 110 of the city’s residents and 65 officials to methodically dissect COVID-19’s impact on marginalized groups. Her analysis reveals how policies that intended to tackle racial injustice instead produced an endless cycle of inequality.\n\nWhy we need a body to oversee how science is used by governments\n\nAt the time of Floyd’s death, Black Americans accounted for 60% of deaths caused by COVID-19 in Chicago, despite comprising only 30% of its population, a pattern mirrored in many other US cities and Western countries. The increased risk of death is attributable to what Decoteau calls “converging ‘demics’” — the confluence of structural injustices, including poor access to health care, housing and employment, that disproportionately affect Black, Latinx and immigrant Chicagoans.\n\nChicago’s initial response to the pandemic was poor, asserts the author. Instead of addressing systemic problems, public-health officials plugged the gap with short-term interventions, such as welfare payments to cover rent or sick days. Although such policies might have benefited less-vulnerable people, they condemned people on the margins to a “slow or quick death”.\n\nTenants who had informal landlord agreements or an undocumented status struggled to access emergency rental payments, because their landlords frequently would not comply with administrative processes. As a result, vulnerable people who should have been shielding themselves from the virus were unable to do so — instead, they had to work to minimize the risk of being evicted and becoming homeless.\n\nDecreasing the number of cases and deaths among Black and Latinx people became the focus of some public-health efforts. But that did not produce long-term changes for the communities most affected by COVID-19. Although many well-intentioned people have used statistics to show that racism is a public-health crisis, Decoteau cautions against reducing the complex history that produced today’s structural inequalities to quantifiable targets.\n\nCommunity care\n\nDecoteau’s interviews highlight how mutual-aid groups and community organizers were the pandemic’s unsung heroes, often achieving what governments could or would not. Many of the stories are bleak, illustrating how systemic discrimination, from poor housing to police brutality, has a physical and mental toll. Yet I found a hopefulness in their tales of community cooperatives that ran food banks and provided COVID-19 tests by employing people enrolled in drug-recovery programmes.\n\nIn Chicago, Illinois, community-led cooperatives, such as food banks, are a lifeline for many.Credit: Scott Olson/Getty\n\nOne volunteer at a community service proclaims: “We need more organizations like this one. We need to grow bigger. We grew up here in the struggle. We know how to cope.” I could not agree more.\n\nIn 2018, I founded a community-based organization in London called Decolonising Contraception, which ran events centred on sexual and reproductive health. Decoteau does a great job of showing what I discovered, too: a top-down approach often has minimal impact on those who require urgent assistance. Too often, red tape and bureaucracy mean that those who are most vulnerable cannot access government support and, instead, end up relying on grass-roots organizations.\n\nMisguided policies\n\nNext, Decoteau illustrates how racial ‘biocapitalism’ — the creation of wealth through the exploitation of people who have been racially categorized — produced policies that caused the death of essential, yet often poorly paid, workers, many of whom in Chicago were Black and Latinx. For example, one such policy introduced extra payments to essential workers in the city. But Candice, a Black woman and former nurse, remarks that: “Every two weeks when you got paid, you got an extra $350 but you couldn’t miss a day. So if you missed a day, you didn’t get the $350.” This policy encouraged people to lie about being unwell, increasing the risk of viral spread.",

Now they’re upending the world of video games, too.\n\nIn a study published in Nature on 19 February, a team of researchers reveals a generative AI engine that can create coherent, immersive video-game worlds that respond to player inputs1.\n\n“I knew that this could be done, but it's still impressive,” says Julian Togelius, a researcher at New York University specializing in AI in video games.\n\nLast year, researchers at Google showed that an AI engine could simulate the 1990s video game DOOM. But the ability for generative AI tools to generate fresh ideas in complex worlds has been limited. When a team led by Microsoft game-intelligence researcher Katja Hoffman interviewed game developers to find out what they wanted in AI tools, they suggested engines that can generate gameplay sequences that remain consistent with the rules and physics of the game. They also wanted the ability to tweak outputs throughout development.\n\nThe team built and trained WHAM, a generative AI system focusing on these capabilities. The researchers took the online multiplayer game Bleeding Edge, developed by a Microsoft-owned studio named Ninja Theory, and extracted video frames and controller inputs from 500,000 anonymized game sessions, which equated to more than seven years of continuous play. They trained the engine on one-second slices of gameplay involving up to 1.6 billion parameters.\n\nThe team showed that WHAM could perform well in three crucial areas. It could act within the rules of the original game (consistency) and generate a range of gameplay slices (diversity), with anything that was added to the world by the user remaining there (persistency). Together, these features demonstrate WHAM’s potential for creative ideation, the authors say.\n\nPlausible gameplay\n\nFinally, they built a concept prototype, the WHAM Demonstrator, which provides an interface for users to prompt the AI engine. In one example, the researchers showed that they could feed a single promotional image for Bleeding Edge into the Demonstrator and it would generate plausible gameplay and controller inputs. They also added a function that allows developers to drag and drop imagery into the Demonstrator, which the AI engine then incorporates directly into the generated game world. Togelius says this is the most impressive thing to emerge from the paper.",

          "authors": "Tracy Wietecha",
          "abstract": "PostdocNet represents several thousand postdocs at the Max Planck institutes and provides opportunities for professional development and community building.Credit: Swen Pfoertner/Alamy\n\nA year into my first postdoc, at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, Germany, I saw a call to join the steering group of the research institute’s PostdocNet as its financial officer. PostdocNet represents the 3,000 postdocs across Germany and a few other countries working at the Max Planck institutes, advocating for better working conditions and career development. I thought managing a budget would be a useful skill for future applications to become a research group leader. I submitted a 3-minute pitch explaining why I wanted the role, and I won the nomination.\n\nI enjoyed my 12-month term so much that I continued in the steering group as a spokesperson. In this one-year role, I represented and managed PostdocNet and headed our steering group, which aims to maximize opportunities for mentorship and academic exchange and build community among postdocs. In practice, we organized interdisciplinary meetings and discussions and represented all postdocs to the Max Planck institutes and external parties, including the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research. I was responsible for communication in the network and with external parties, including the society’s president and contacts in science, industry and politics.\n\nStress rewarded\n\nI spent about 10 hours each week fulfilling this demanding role — a mini-job alongside my postdoctoral research responsibilities, often spilling into evenings and weekends. The role could be taxing; sometimes, the stress led to sleepless nights.\n\nBut the work fulfilled me in ways my research could not. I saw the value and necessity of networks that advocate for postdocs. I wanted to pave the way for future postdocs to have better opportunities. Moreover, I could identify concrete problems, develop solutions and see the immediate impact of our efforts.\n\nThanks to this role, my confidence and professionalism have grown, and I’ve improved my communication skills. Tasks that once took hours, such as drafting official e-mails, now come easily. The connections I have made have expanded my professional network far beyond my research field. I learnt how to manage a diverse, international team, navigate conflict and lead meetings inclusively.\n\nUltimately, the extra work was worth it not just for the professional skills that I gained, but also for the personal growth that I experienced — which I will carry with me throughout my career. I have now been appointed by the Max Planck president to serve on the advisory board of the Planck Academy, which offers professional-development opportunities for specific groups of Max Planck employees. This is a service role usually given to those at mid- to senior-career stages.\n\nI am also applying for junior professorships and research-group-leader positions, and I think my PostdocNet roles made a difference in my interviews. One committee member asked me to share more about my work there. In another interview, I drew on my experiences to answer a question about how I would manage conflict in a research group. These experiences taught me that it was not enough to simply list this service role on my CV. I needed to clearly and concretely outline my responsibilities and skills to help interview committees to better understand my achievements.\n\nOvercoming the challenges of running a network\n\nOver the past year, I saw at first hand the struggles of running a successful postdoc network and taking part in academic service relatively early in my career. Here are the four biggest challenges I encountered, and how I addressed them:\n\n1. Institutional memory. Given the high turnover rate of postdocs, steering groups often consist entirely of new members each year. This year, we were fortunate that both the deputy spokesperson and I had served on the steering group previously, which helped to preserve institutional memory, or the collective knowledge and experiences of a group of people. To support the incoming steering group, we wrote a guide on standard operating procedures for the spokesperson role, made e-mail introductions to all our contacts and included the spokesperson-elect in our end-of-term meetings. I documented all activities, meetings and decisions in a comprehensive report for the new steering group. I also made myself available for any questions or enquiries, even after my term ended.\n\n2. Recruitment and participation. Many postdocs are on short-term contracts, and finding their next position is a top priority. Others might be starting families. Very few have extra time to dedicate to an academic network. Offering clear, specific tasks — along with an estimated time commitment — was the most effective way to encourage participation. For example, I estimated that it takes one hour a week to manage social-media posts, and a similar time commitment to organize a scientific talk. Specific and manageable requests yielded better engagement than did vague calls for help.\n\n3. Mentorship. Although I had experience in the steering group, the spokesperson role brought new challenges. To navigate these, I sought a mentor: I reached out to someone experienced in the society who was no longer actively involved, and they provided valuable guidance on pressing issues. Finding a mentor is often just a matter of asking — you’d be surprised by how willing experienced scholars and representatives are to help.",

          "abstract": "Early-career scientists fear that their chances of making a life in the US research scene are slipping away. Credit: Karen Ducey/Getty\n\nThe first in her family to go to university, Suzanne Autrey pushed herself to the brink chasing an academic career. She is now an assistant professor at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, and takes delight in teaching geology to other first-generation university students. “I know first-hand that a degree to them doesn’t just change their lives,” Autrey says. “It changes their families’ lives.”\n\nNow, like some other early-career scientists in the United States, Autrey feels her dream of a research career slipping away. The tick-tock of her tenure clock echoes in her ears as she checks and rechecks the status of two crucial grant applications. Both are stalled at the US National Science Foundation, an agency facing the prospect of large budget cuts. She can’t do the research needed to support her tenure bid without those grants. “I’m dead in the water if I can’t get one,” she says.\n\nRevealed: NIH research grants still frozen despite lawsuits challenging Trump order\n\nAfter a month of repeated threats to US science funding, many early-career researchers such as Autrey are fearing for their careers. These scientists are especially vulnerable: graduate students, postdocs and scientists who are just starting their own laboratories are the researchers most likely to be living pay cheque to pay cheque, most reliant on federal grants for their income and least likely to have job security. Some are considering changing jobs, leaving the country or abandoning research altogether.\n\n“Disruption and uncertainty are the enemy of science,” says Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. And when disruption and uncertainty strike, she adds, “the people who lose their jobs are students and postdocs”.\n\nIf that happens now, science in the United States could undergo its own generational shift, she says: “Early-career scientists are the future.”\n\nDiminished prospects\n\nDuring its chaotic first month, US President Donald Trump’s administration moved to sharply curtail federal funding for research. Some of the administration’s changes, such as freezing research funds and curtailing reimbursement for overhead costs on federal grants, have been temporarily blocked by the courts. But the administration’s push to shrink the size of the government is clear, and many researchers fear that the system of federal support they have come to rely on is eroding.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nTheir anxiety was on display at a protest in Washington DC on 19 February, when about 250 graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and research technicians gathered outside the US Department of Health and Human Services to protest against the chaos unleashed by mass layoffs, leadership changes and promises of budget cuts at federal agencies. “Last week aged me a year,” says Alexander Jordan Lara, a research fellow at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. Lara’s career is in limbo after his principal investigator, a high-ranking NIH scientist, abruptly retired on 11 February amid the turmoil created by the Trump team’s directives , leaving the fate of the laboratory and its members up in the air.\n\nThat fear radiates beyond employees of federal agencies. At the University of Maryland in College Park, an NIH diversity grant pays neuroscience postdoc Haroon Popal’s salary. Popal counts himself lucky: this year’s salary has already been allocated. But the Trump administration has threatened any funding that falls under the rubric of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and Popal is not counting on getting paid next year. He’s looking for other jobs now, especially any that do not rely on federal funds — even if that means leaving science. “I love my research,” he says, “but I cannot afford to lose a pay cheque.”\n\nFaced with that uncertainty, some young scientists might choose to leave the country rather than leave science, says Ginther. But the United States churned out more than 34,000 science PhD graduates in 2023. Not all of them will choose to stay in science, but whether those who do and seek to leave the United States could be absorbed by other countries is unclear. “I don’t know that the world’s scientific enterprise can absorb the potential loss of talent that we’re creating in the United States,” says Ginther.\n\nFading allure\n\nThe United States has long attracted scientific talent from around the globe. Just a few weeks ago, Adam Pavlinek, a developmental neuroscientist at King’s College London, had planned to start a postdoc at an NIH laboratory later this year. Now, he tracks the recent firings at federal agencies and waits to learn of the fate of the team that he had hoped to join.\n\nNIH pay rise for postdocs and PhD students could have US ripple effect\n\nThe instability in the United States has Pavlinek thinking twice about his plans. “I’m worried that four or five months after I move all my stuff there, I’ll be told, ‘Actually there’s no more funding,’” he says. He has started looking for positions in the United Kingdom.",

The child’s mother took the gene-targeting drug during late pregnancy, and the child continues to take it.\n\nThe “baby has been effectively treated, with no manifestations of the condition”, says Michelle Farrar, a paediatric neurologist at University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine yesterday.\n\nThe child was conceived with a genetic condition known as spinal muscular atrophy, which affects motor neurons that control movement, and leads to progressive muscle weakening. About one in every 10,000 births have some form of the condition — making it a leading genetic cause of death in infants and children.\n\nIn its most severe form, as in the case of this child, individuals lack both copies of the SMN1 gene, and have only one or two copies of a neighbouring gene, SMN2, that partially compensates for that deficiency. As a result, the body does not produce enough of the protein required for maintaining motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. This protein is most important in the second and third trimesters, and the first few months of life. Babies with severe disease don’t usually live past their third birthday.\n\nIn the past decade, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three drugs to treat newborns for spinal muscular atrophy. The oral drug used in this study, called risdiplam, manufactured by biotech firm Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, is a small molecule that works by modifying expression of the SMN2 gene so that it produces more SMN protein.\n\nUp until now, treatments for spinal muscular atrophy were given after birth. But up to half of newborns lacking both copies of the SMN1 gene, and with only two copies of the SMN2 gene, are born with some symptoms. “There was still room for improvement,” says Richard Finkel, a clinical neuroscientist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, who led the study.\n\nParent proposal\n\nThe idea of giving the drug in utero came from the parents, says Finkel. “They had already experienced a loss from this horrible disease,” he says, and wanted to know whether there were treatment options they could start before birth. The FDA approved the study for this one individual.\n\nThe mother, who was 32 weeks pregnant, took risdiplam daily for six weeks. The baby started taking the drug from roughly one week old, and will probably continue to take it for the rest of her life.",

          "abstract": "Babita Paudel travels Nepal to collect soil samples in high-altitude regions such as Annapurna and to run workshops for female scientists’ professional development.Credit: Rajaram Khang\nChangemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates people who fight racism in science and who champion inclusion. It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nDuring her PhD at the Korea Polar Research Institute in Incheon, South Korea, biochemist Babita Paudel studied antioxidant compounds from lichens and mosses that thrive in Antarctica. On returning to her home country, Nepal, she shifted to studying molecules produced by high-altitude microbes and medicinal plants found there. She co-founded the Center for Natural and Applied Sciences (CENAS) in Kathmandu, where she studies groups of bacteria called actinomycetes, known for producing compounds with antimicrobial activity. To isolate these bacteria, her team collected soil samples from extreme environments, including the base camps at Mount Everest and Annapurna, looking for potential products to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens.\n\nBeyond her research, Paudel leads efforts to boost the numbers of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers in Nepal. Supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany, her Women in STEM Nepal team travels across the country to conduct capacity-building training for early- and mid-career women. The team organizes sessions on academic writing, building CVs, professional networking and writing grant proposals. In addition, it created Nepal's Women in STEM Nepal database, listing around 650 female researchers. The initiative has connected around 3,200 women interested in STEM careers. Paudel spoke to Nature about what inspired her to take the reins of this countrywide project.\n\nWhat is the great passion that has driven you as a scientist?\n\nWhat drives me to help female students to thrive at my Ugandan university\nIt wasn’t a singular event. From the start, my passion was fuelled by strong family support. My father was the principal at a public secondary school. I was a bright student and having good scores encouraged my family to support my science education. At that time, only a small number of female students opted for science subjects. There were very few female professors teaching STEM courses, but seeing their commitment — despite the major household responsibilities that Nepalese society puts on women — inspired me to continue my career as a scientist.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor, and why?\n\nI've been fortunate to have my husband as a significant influence and mentor. We both are researchers in biochemistry, and his unwavering support has enabled me to pursue my career despite the responsibilities of raising our two children.\n\nWhen did you realize you wanted to tackle gender inequality in science?\n\nIn 2021, while participating in an event organized by the Nepal German Academic Association, an alumni body, I was asked to give a presentation on the status of women in science in Nepal. It took me a month to prepare that presentation because there wasn’t any proper database of women scientists. I had to meticulously review data from a government body, the University Grants Commission, and visit department home pages of each of Nepal’s universities to gather information. One 2010 statistic from the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO was particularly shocking: women comprised just 7.9% of the STEM workforce in Nepal, a proportion that was among the lowest in Asia. I realized the urgent need to do something about this.\n\nWere there other surprises that came out of your work?\n\nIn Nepal, there is a substantial disparity for women in STEM owing to various social norms such as domestic and childcare responsibilities, the lack of female-friendly policies in the workplace, and insufficient capacity-building activities, inspiration and motivation.\n\nI found that most Nepalese women in STEM tend to marry after completing their bachelor’s or master’s degrees. This often results in an academic break, one that often leads to a significant loss of confidence, contributing to imposter syndrome. I didn’t realize how pervasive this problem was until I started travelling the country and hearing women’s stories.\n\nAlso, Nepalese society is still patriarchal, and a lot of panel discussions at scientific conferences still tend to exclude female experts. I was surprised by the extent of this inequality. Women are expected to sacrifice the most, not just for their families, but also academically. Even women with advanced degrees often find themselves limited to sometimes entry-level, contract-limited and temporary lecturer positions in universities, with few opportunities for further promotion.\n\nHow does your initiative try to address these disparities?\n\nI’m a Palestinian scientist building a more inclusive future\nWe are building capacity for female students in STEM careers and creating networks of female researchers. In 2022 and 2023, we organized 10 capacity-building activities across 7 provinces in Nepal, engaging 421 female researchers in workshops on professional networking, how to explore work and study opportunities, CV preparation, proposal writing and plagiarism in research. In addition, we hosted ten webinars and published a comprehensive database of national and international funding agencies, scholarships and fellowships on the CENAS website.\n\nWe also created a Facebook group for team members to network, and to disseminate information on scholarships, funding agencies and opportunities. The group has more than 4,000 members. In 2022 and 2023, we also provided travel grants for 25 female students and early-career researchers to participate in and present their research at national and international conferences across Nepal.\n\nWhat is your best piece of advice to a 20-something female researcher in Nepal?",

It can also make sense of existing DNA, including hard-to-interpret ‘non-coding’ gene variants that are linked to disease.\n\n‘ChatGPT for CRISPR’ creates new gene-editing tools\n\nEvo 2, co-developed by researchers at the Arc Institute and Stanford University, both in Palo Alto, California, and chip maker NVIDIA, is available to scientists through web interfaces or by downloading the freely available software code, data and other parameters needed to replicate the model.\n\nThe developers see Evo 2 as a platform that others can adapt to their own uses. “We’re really looking forward to how scientists and engineers build this ‘app store’ for biology,” said Patrick Hsu, a bioengineer at the Arc Institute and the University of California, Berkeley, at a press briefing announcing Evo 2’s launch.\n\nOther scientists are impressed with what they’ve read about the model — which is described in a paper posted to the Arc Institute website and on the bioRxiv preprint server1. But they say they will need to test the model before coming to firm conclusions.\n\n“We’ll have to see how it holds up in independent benchmarks after the preprint is out,” says Anshul Kundaje, a computational genomicist at Stanford. So far, he has been impressed by the engineering that underpins the model.\n\nTrillions of letters\n\nIn the past few years, researchers have developed increasingly powerful ‘protein language models’, such as the ESM3 model developed by former Meta employees that, after training on millions of protein sequences, have been used to help predict protein structures and design totally new proteins, including gene editors and fluorescent molecules.\n\nAI has dreamt up a blizzard of new proteins. Do any of them actually work?\n\nUnlike these models, Evo 2 was trained on genome data that contain both ‘coding sequences’ — which carry instructions for making proteins — and non-coding DNA that includes sequences that can control when, where and how genes are active. The first version of the model, released last year, was trained on the genomes of 80,000 bacteria and archaea — simple organisms called prokaryotes — as well as those of their viruses and other sequences.\n\nThe latest model is based on 128,000 genomes, including those of humans and other animals, plants and other eukaryotic organisms. These genomes encompass a total of 9.3 trillion DNA letters. The computing power needed to devour these data and other features makes Evo 2 is the biggest biological AI model yet released, says Hsu.\n\nThe Evo Designer interface, powered by the Evo 2 AI model.Credit: Arc Institute\n\nCompared with prokaryotes, eukaryotes tend to have longer and more complex genomes: genes are made of interspersed segments of coding and non-coding regions, and non-coding ‘regulatory DNA’ can be far away from the genes it controls. To handle this complexity, Evo 2 was built so that it can learn patterns in sequences of DNA as far apart as one million base pairs.\n\nTo demonstrate its ability to make sense of complex genomes, Hsu and his colleagues used Evo 2 to predict the effects of previously studied mutations in a gene implicated in breast cancer, called BRCA1. It did nearly as well as the best biological AI models at determining whether changes to coding regions would cause diseases, said Hsu. “It’s state of the art for non-coding mutations.” In the future, the model could help to identify these hard-to-interpret changes in patients’ genomes.\n\nThe researchers also tested the model’s ability to decipher other features of complex genomes — including that of the woolly mammoth. “Evo 2 represents a significant step in learning DNA regulatory grammar,” says Christina Theodoris, a computational biologist at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, California.",

          "abstract": "Donald Trump took office as US president for the second time one month ago.Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty\n\nIn the wake of the Second World War, US leaders adopted the view that scientific progress is an “essential key to our security as a nation, to our better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to our cultural progress”. And for the next eight decades, government officials on both sides of the political aisle agreed to invest in US science. Just one month into the second administration of Republican President Donald Trump, scientists fear that that long-time consensus is disintegrating.\n\nAre the Trump team’s actions affecting your research? How to contact Nature\n\nActing with unprecedented speed, the administration has laid off thousands of employees at US science agencies and announced reforms to research-grant standards that could drastically reduce federal financial support for science. The cuts form part of a larger effort to radically reduce the government’s spending and downsize its workforce.\n\nAlthough US courts have intervened in some cases, Republicans in both chambers of the US Congress — which largely blocked Trump’s efforts to cut science funding during his first term as president from 2017 to 2021 — have mostly fallen in line with the agenda for Trump 2.0. For many researchers, this first month signals a realignment of priorities that could affect science and society for decades to come.\n\nThese actions are all “unprecedented”, says Harold Varmus, a former director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) who is now a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. “No one has ever seen a [presidential] transition in which one of the most valuable parts of our government enterprise is being taken apart.”\n\nThe Trump White House did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nHere, Nature unpacks the Trump team’s blazing-fast actions on science so far (scroll to bottom to see timeline ‘Science impacts: one month of Trump 2.0’) and talks to policy watchers about what’s next.\n\nFast and furious\n\nThe overhaul of US science kicked off within hours of Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, when he signed dozens of executive orders, which are presidential directives on how the government should operate inside existing laws.\n\nSome of those orders had been anticipated, including pulling the United States out of the 2015 Paris agreement to rein in global climate emissions and terminating the nation’s membership of the World Health Organization. Others had surprising and immediate ripple effects through the scientific community.\n\nOne order erroneously attempted to define only two biological sexes, male and female, and banned federal actions “that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology”. Biomedical-research agencies such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) scrambled to respond by, among other things, taking down data sets from their websites and pulling back manuscript submissions from scientific journals to purge terms including ‘gender’ and ‘transgender’.\n\nResearchers, clinicians and others protest the Trump administration’s actions outside the US Department of Health and Human Services in Washington DC on 19 February.Credit: Matthew Rodier/Sipa US/Alamy\n\nAnother executive order banned what Trump called “illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI)”. Any federal employee who did not report colleagues defying the DEI orders would face “adverse consequences”, according to an e-mail sent to government workers. To many scientists’ dismay, agencies began terminating DEI programmes, including environmental-justice efforts, which are programmes aimed at protecting low-income communities vulnerable to pollution and climate change. Even some scientific societies and private research organizations scrubbed DEI mentions from their websites. In one of Trump’s orders, he called for the investigation of foundations, non-profit organizations and other private entities not in compliance.\n\nOn 27 January, just one week into the new administration, Trump’s budget office froze all federal grants and loans, saying that it needed to review government spending to ensure that it aligned with the executive orders. Chaos erupted as agencies, including the NIH and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) — both major funders of basic science — halted grant payments, cancelled review panels for research-grant funding and paused communications. A federal judge temporarily blocked the order, but disruptions and confusion continue.\n\nPrincipal investigators who lead research teams are suffering in this environment, says a university scientist who requested anonymity because their research is funded by multiple US agencies. “Everything is on you to manage your grants and your team,” they say, adding that “there’s a lot of fear of people not wanting to say or do the wrong thing” and therefore lose financial support for their work. “It’s completely chaotic; I’m losing sleep.”\n\nSlash and burn\n\nTrump’s unprecedented directives landed as his partnership with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has flourished. The pair are working together to slash federal spending and dismantle agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, which funds global disease research, prevention and care.\n\nTo accomplish this goal, the Trump administration — working through the US Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk reportedly advises — has moved quickly to demoralize and gut the federal workforce, including about 280,000 scientists and engineers. Initially, a 30 January e-mail offer to all federal employees asked them to “move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector”; around 75,000 employees subsequently resigned, on the promise that they would retain their salary until September. In mid-February, layoffs began for probationary employees across the US government — those usually hired into their positions within the past two years, meaning that early-career researchers were particularly affected.\n\nTrump has partnered with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk (left) to downsize the US government.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\n“I can’t even convey how haphazard and cruel the layoffs are,” says an NIH researcher who lost members of their laboratory to the job cuts and requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak with the press. E-mails notifying workers that they were being let go reportedly gave a blanket reason of poor performance for the termination — even to those whose performance was rated ‘exceptional’ by their supervisors. “They took some of the best and brightest people who just joined the government and laid them off,” the researcher says.",

Credit: Eye Of Science/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can diagnose a range of infections and health conditions in one sweep, by screening immune-cell gene sequences in blood samples.\n\nIn a study of nearly 600 people, published in Science on 20 February1, the tool identified whether participants were healthy or had COVID-19, type 1 diabetes, HIV or the autoimmune disease lupus, as well as whether they had recently received a flu vaccine.\n\nNeuronostics: Accelerating the diagnosis of epilepsy with computer modelling\n\n“This is a one-shot sequencing approach that captures everything that your immune system has been exposed to,” says Sarah Teichmann, a molecular biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nThe tool is not yet ready for clinical use, but with more work to refine the approach, it could one day help clinicians to deal with “conditions that today don’t have definitive tests”, says study co-author Maxim Zaslavsky, a computer scientist at Stanford University in California.\n\n“From a real-world point of view, the promise would be to have one foundation model for the immune system where you can read out everything that a person has seen, and then link it to their health care,” says Teichmann. “There are a lot of steps on the pathway to realizing that down the line, but this is one step.”\n\nNatural diagnostic\n\nThe immune system holds an extensive record of past and current illnesses through its two major cell types — B cells and T cells. B cells produce antibodies that attach to viruses and harmful molecules, whereas T cells activate other responses or kill infected cells.\n\nWhen a person has an infection, or an autoimmune condition in which the body mistakenly attacks its own tissues, their B cells and T cells increase in number and start to produce specific surface receptors. Sequencing the genes that encode these receptors can unlock the person’s unique record of diseases and infections.\n\n“The immune system is a natural diagnostic, and if we just learn how it can do it, then we could also do it,” says Victor Greiff, a computational immunologist at the University of Oslo.\n\nCurrent diagnostic tools “make some but little use of the immune system’s record of disease exposures”, says Zaslavsky, but most previous efforts have focused on sequences from either B or T cells. “Combining them for this fuller picture of immune activity gives us a more complete read-out of what could be happening.”\n\nSuper-speedy sequencing puts genomic diagnosis in the fast lane\n\nZaslavsky and his colleagues built an AI tool that combines six machine-learning models to analyse gene sequences encoding key regions in B-cell and T-cell receptors, and pick out patterns associated with particular diseases.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "An artist’s impression of an asteroid.Credit: ESA-Science Office\n\nThe latest calculations indicate that the asteroid known as 2024 YR4 is much less likely to hit Earth than earlier measurements had suggested. Late on 19 February, telescopic observations of the object allowed researchers to revise down the estimated chance of impact in 2032 from 3.1% — the greatest such threat ever recorded — to a still-worrying 1.5%.\n\nAsteroid lost 1 million kilograms after collision with DART spacecraft\n\nThis value is likely to fall even further, to less than 1%, says Richard Moissl, head of the European Space Agency’s Planetary Defence Office, based in Frascati, Italy. As data flood in, uncertainty regarding 2024 YR4’s ‘impact corridor’ — the path it will take in the vicinity of Earth — is shrinking. If, as the uncertainty in an asteroid’s path gets smaller, Earth’s orbit remains within it, the likelihood of impact grows — which is why, earlier this week, space agencies reported that the risk had climbed. But now Earth is on the fringes of this region and edging out.\n\nYR4 has given researchers their first chance to test an international protocol for responding to such hazards, put in place after the Chelyabinsk meteor hit Earth in 2013 without any warning. And with new asteroid-hunting telescopes coming online all the time, astronomers are likely to see many more close calls, says Moissl. “It’s not if, it’s when.”\n\nImpact warning\n\nAsteroids appear on researchers’ radars all the time — but not ones like YR4. It was first spotted in late December, and by 27 January, the object’s likelihood of hitting Earth had crept up above 1%, which triggered the United Nations-mandated International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) to spring into action.\n\nIAWN’s network of researchers have been working overtime to precisely calculate the asteroid’s speed and path, says Moissl. It hopes to report an impact risk of below 1% before April, when YR4’s orbit will take it beyond the range of ground-based telescopes until 2028.\n\n‘Head-scratcher’: first look at asteroid dust brought to Earth offers surprises\n\nIAWN’s regular practice exercises, using hypothetical asteroids, have taught scientists to focus on quickly obtaining the most important measurements in real time — those that allow them to pinpoint when and where an asteroid could hit, and the damage it could cause, says Vishnu Reddy, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson and manager of IAWN.\n\nThis kind of rapid applied science is already familiar to meteorologists and seismologists, he says. “You have to coordinate and understand that you’re doing science to save the world, for the lack of a better term,” he says.",

          "title": "Exclusive: These universities have the most retracted scientific articles",
          "authors": "Richard Van Noorden",
          "abstract": "Two days before the end of 2021, administrators at Jining First People’s Hospital in Shandong, China, issued a highly unusual report. The hospital announced that it had disciplined some 35 researchers who had been linked to fraud in publications, such as fabricating data. These sanctions were part of a countrywide crackdown motivated by concerns about a flood of sham medical papers emanating from hospitals.\n\nThe problem was that some young physicians at hospitals had purchased fake manuscripts from paper mills: companies that churn out fraudulent scientific reports to order. These doctors were under pressure because they were required to publish papers to get jobs or earn promotions, says integrity sleuth Elisabeth Bik in California. Sleuths such as Bik soon began spotting signs of this problem, identifying duplicated images in large numbers of papers. They publicized the issue and a wave of retractions followed.\n\nThis surge can now be seen in a first-of-its-kind analysis of institutional retraction rates around the globe over the past decade, for which Nature’s news team used figures supplied by three private research-integrity and analytics firms. Jining First People’s Hospital tops the charts, with more than 5% of its total output from 2014 to 2024 retracted — more than 100 papers (see ‘Highest retraction rates’). That proportion is an order of magnitude higher than China’s retraction rate, and 50 times the global average. Depending on how one counts, the hospital could be the institution with the world’s highest retraction rate.\n\nSource: Nature analysis\n\nMany other Chinese hospitals are retraction hotspots. But universities and institutes in China, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan and Ethiopia feature in the data as well. Retractions can be for honest mistakes and administrative errors, but evidence suggests the majority of cases in these data are related to misconduct.\n\nThis type of institution-level analysis has never been done before because it is particularly challenging: retractions data are messy, there are errors in assigning author addresses to institutions, and creators of the underlying data sets make different choices about how to count institutions and published papers. So the results from the three independent analyses don’t always agree, and should be seen as preliminary.\n\nDespite those challenges, common trends emerge. They show that there is significant variation within countries: some institutions seem to be retraction hotspots, whereas others are relatively unscathed. In certain cases, that might just be because some institutions have evaded sleuths’ attention, but it might also be related to specific research environments that seem to be associated with high proportions of erroneous or fraudulent work.\n\nWhy retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science\n\n“It’s tempting to think about whether differences are related to varying incentives for researchers in different institutions,” says Ivan Oransky, co-founder of the website Retraction Watch, which maintains a public database of retractions on which the companies contacted by Nature partly depend.\n\nNature’s analysis found that, for the majority of institutions with high retraction rates, retractions are spread across many authors. This hints at a problem with research-integrity culture rather than a few rogue researchers, says Dorothy Bishop, a retired neuropsychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who investigates cases of research misconduct. This kind of analysis “could lead to some positive action” if institutions respond by examining what is leading to the patterns, she adds.\n\nIntegrity signals\n\nThe retraction data provided to Nature come from research-integrity tools that technology firms have launched over the past two years, which aim to help publishers stem a surge in fake and significantly flawed research. Among a flurry of these software products are Argos, from Scitility in Sparks, Nevada; Signals, from the firm Research Signals in London; and Dimensions Author Check, from the London-based company Digital Science. (The latter is part of Holtzbrinck, the majority shareholder in Nature’s publisher, Springer Nature. Nature’s news and features team is editorially independent of its publisher.) These three firms provided their institution-based retractions data to Nature; they also looked at countries and journals associated with retractions.\n\nTheir tools aim to alert users to potential ‘red flags’ in research articles or submitted manuscripts, such as authors who might have high numbers of misconduct-associated retractions. To build them, the firms have created internal data sets of retracted papers and their affiliations. These are largely based on Retraction Watch’s database; launched in 2018, it was acquired in 2023 for public distribution by Crossref, a US non-profit organization that indexes publishing data. This made it easier for others to use and analyse the information.\n\nJournals with high rates of suspicious papers flagged by science-integrity start-up\n\nThe firms Nature contacted have built on this data set by omitting retracted articles that lack DOIs (digital object identifiers) and adding retraction information gleaned from other online sources, such as CrossRef, the life-sciences index PubMed and journal websites. The companies shared their internal work on the condition that their data sets would not be published in full, in part because they use them for the software tools that they sell to scientific publishers and institutions.\n\nOne firm, Scitility, says it will make its institution-level figures public later this year. “We think scientific publishing will be helped if we create transparency around this,” says the firm’s co-founder Jan-Erik de Boer, a former chief information officer at Springer Nature who is based in Roosendaal, the Netherlands.\n\nThe three firms’ numbers of retracted articles are some 6–15% greater (over the past decade) than the Retraction Watch data set they build on. But in some cases, articles can be recorded erroneously in CrossRef and other online sources1, so the data might not be 100% accurate, cautions Jodi Schneider, an information-sciences researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who studies retractions.\n\nRetraction Watch staff have also manually filled in the reasons — as far as they can determine them — for each recorded retraction, indicating that the majority are due to misconduct. Those data aren’t available for the records that the firms have added.\n\nRetraction patterns\n\nData on retractions show that they are rare events. Out of 50 million or more articles published over the past decade, for instance, a mere 40,000 or so (fewer than 0.1%) have been retracted, according to the firms’ data sets. But the rise in retraction notices (by which journals announce that a paper is being retracted) is outstripping the growth of published papers — partly because of the rise of paper mills and the growing number of sleuths who spot problems with published articles.\n\nSource: Nature analysis\n\nIn 2023, as Nature reported, more than 10,000 retraction notices were issued (Nature 624, 479–481; 2023). Most of these were from Hindawi, a now-closed London subsidiary of the publisher Wiley, which found that Hindawi journals were affected by a blizzard of peer-review fraud and sham papers. (Wiley told Nature at the time that it had scaled up its research-integrity teams, put in place more rigorous processes to oversee manuscripts and removed “hundreds” of bad actors, including some guest editors, from its systems). During the past decade, the annual retraction rate — the proportion of published articles in a particular year that have been retracted — has trebled (although fewer retraction notices were issued overall in 2024 than in 2022 or 2023; see ‘A tide of retractions’). The proportion reached around 0.2% for papers published in 2022, and will rise as more articles are withdrawn (see ‘Rates on the rise’).\n\nSource: Nature analysis\n\nOver 2014–24, almost 60% of retracted articles (more than 20,000 of them) have authors with affiliations in China. Overall, about 0.3% of that country’s articles have been retracted so far — three times the global average.\n\nBut this is surpassed by retraction rates in Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia, and exceeded or rivalled (depending on the data set) by those in Iraq and Pakistan. (In the Retraction Watch data, Russia also rivals Iraq’s rates, but because many Russian retractions don’t have DOIs and aren’t in global databases, the firms omitted them from their analyses.) Meanwhile, countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have rates of around 0.04%, much lower than the global average of 0.1%, and many countries have even lower rates (see ‘Retraction rates by country’).\n\nSource: Nature analysis\n\nThe rates quoted depend on how analysts count a country’s overall number of research articles: the denominator. For instance, Signals and Argos use data from OpenAlex, a public bibliometric database, to tally published articles. But this data set’s coverage is generally larger than that of the Dimensions database, which Digital Science curates. Therefore, retraction rates are typically lower in the data from Signals and Argos.\n\nInstitutional hotspots\n\nAnalysing institutions is an even thornier task, because there are both data errors and different approaches in the underlying databases, Nature’s analysis found. To map institutional affiliations, Dimensions uses a private Global Research Identifier Database (GRID), whereas OpenAlex uses the public Research Organization Registry (ROR). Both contain quirks — affiliations can be missing or wrongly attributed (a particular issue for some smaller institutes) or the database curators might simply have made different choices about how to assign an affiliation. Accordingly, the firms’ analyses vary.\n\nStill, a general picture emerges of an institutional retraction-rate leader board that is dominated by small Chinese hospitals and medical universities. In the Dimensions data set, over 2014–24, around 70% of the 136 institutions with a retraction rate above 1% are from China, and about 60% of those are hospitals or medical universities. The Argos data set, with 186 institutions with rates above 1%, gives a similar split. Signals shared only its top-ten lists, again dominated by Chinese institutions. (Nature reached out to all of the institutions mentioned in this article for comment, and did not hear back before publication.)\n\nChina conducts first nationwide review of retractions and research misconduct\n\nChina’s science ministry and other government bodies have tried to crack down on fraud and perverse publishing incentives. In guidelines issued in 2020 and 2021, they emphasized that “research publications should not be a mandatory requirement for professional advancement,” says Shaoxiong Brian Xu at Huanggang Normal University in China, who studies retraction notices. The government agencies have also announced other sweeping investigations into research fraud. But, as Xu points out in an analysis published this January, China’s annual retraction rates have risen2. (Jining First People’s Hospital, however, has seen only three retractions of papers published in 2022, and none since.)\n\nOutside China, institutions that are notably high up on several leader boards include Ghazi University in Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan; Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia; and India’s KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology in Coimbatore. In KPR’s case, according to the Retraction Watch data set, almost all of the retractions relate to a decision by IOP Publishing (the publishing arm of the UK Institute of Physics), which in 2022 retracted 350 papers from 2 volumes of conference proceedings released the year before. The publisher cited misconduct as the reason, including “systematic manipulation of the publication process and considerable citation manipulation”. More than 100 of those papers had authors who were affiliated with KPR.\n\nTo avoid counting the smallest institutes, for which high rates reflect just a few retractions, Nature filtered out universities that produce fewer than 100 articles a year. This means, for instance, that Showa University Hospital in Tokyo — where the work of one researcher generated 124 retractions — is excluded from the list; otherwise, it would have notched up a retraction rate of almost 10%.\n\nStill, the universities that top the lists tend to be relatively small. In Ghazi University’s case, around half of its total retracted papers are by just four authors.\n\nSome sleuths have speculated that authors from Ethiopia and some other African countries that publish relatively few articles might sometimes have been added to paper-mill products that originated elsewhere, to take advantage of Hindawi’s waived open-access fee for scholars from low- or lower-middle-income countries. A spokesperson for Wiley (the owner of Hindawi) did not give details, but commented: “We are aware of authorship for sale and waiver manipulation schemes deployed by paper mills,” adding that the publisher has strengthened its internal checks.\n\nMost retractions\n\nA different way to view the data is to pick out institutions with the largest overall numbers of retractions. Most are Chinese universities, but King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, makes the top three. The institutions with the largest number of retracted papers tend not to have the highest retraction rates, because they are large and so publish a lot. The lists of highest-overall retractions also differ because for some Chinese universities — such as Jilin University — some analysts counted retractions from hospitals associated with the university, too.\n\nOne clear change on which all the analyses agree is that in the past half-decade, retractions from institutions in Saudi Arabia and India have come to the fore — largely because of paper-mill activity from Hindawi journals (see ‘Institutions with most retractions’).\n\nSource: Nature analysis\n\nAnother way to examine the overall data is though scatter charts, which highlight that there is significant variation within countries. These show, for instance, that Chinese universities tend to have a lower retraction rate than do Chinese hospitals (see ‘Retractions across research institutions’).\n\nSource: Nature analysis\nPressures to publish\n\nIn India, it’s notable that the institutes with the highest retraction rates are almost all private colleges and institutes in the state of Tamil Nadu, an education hub, says Achal Agrawal, a freelance data scientist in Raipur. That accords with his own analyses of retractions in India, which he has been posting online over the past year after founding India Research Watch (IRW), an online group of researchers and students that is trying to highlight plagiarism and other publication misconduct in the country. Working with IRW, Agrawal has also created a dashboard to visualize Retraction Watch’s data for other countries.\n\nResearchers in public universities and government institutes in India face fewer pressures to publish than do those in private universities and colleges, says Agrawal. Private institutions, he says, push students and researchers to publish many articles, and in some cases pay bonuses for papers published.",

The agency supported an estimated 24,000 students in the 2023–24 academic year, amounting to around one in five of doctoral students based in the United Kingdom.\n\nOther changes unveiled by UKRI include allowing students to take up to 28 weeks’ medical leave, more opportunities to extend studentships and greater support for students with disabilities.\n\nAnnouncing the stipend increase on 30 January, UKRI chief executive Ottoline Leyser said: “Postgraduate training is critical to building the workforce needed for an innovation-led economy and public sector, and to delivering outstanding research and innovation outcomes.\n\n“The increase in the postgraduate stipend and changes in terms and conditions we are announcing today are part of our ongoing work to forge a new deal for postgraduates, widening access to the diverse and fulfilling careers that research and innovation has to offer.”\n\nAlongside the announcement, UKRI also published a report that said there was widespread support from universities and other research organizations and UKRI grant holders for setting the stipend in line with the UK national living wage.\n\nFinancial survival\n\nSome researchers hailed the increase as a step towards helping all researchers to survive financially. But others said that much more needs to be done to help them.\n\nStephanie Buller, who researches risk management as part of a UKRI-funded PhD at Cardiff University, says the stipend hike is still too low.\n\nMany first jobs, including apprenticeships aimed at 16- and 18-year-olds that combine practical training with study, can pay more than a PhD does, she adds.\n\nBuller says: “I’ve got an undergraduate [degree], a master’s and 10 years’ experience, so my current skill set is worth £60,000. I've walked away from a very-well-paying job to be a mature student in financial hardship.\n\n“There are hundreds of PhDs up and down the country that are saying, ‘how do I keep a roof over my head and how do I pay for my next meal?’”\n\nPablo Ouro, a civil engineer at the University of Manchester who completed his PhD in 2017, says that the increase is “good news for all PhD students”, but notes that foreign students have extra costs to bear.",

There’s more research on the reproductive ecology of cheetahs, say, in remote areas, than on wildcats in Europe.\n\nWildcat populations are in sharp decline and the animals are now absent from much of their former range in the Iberian Peninsula, owing to legal predator control and illegal killings, as well as road accidents, habitat fragmentation and hybridization with domestic cats. In Mediterranean areas, a decline in their main prey — rabbits — due to viral diseases seems to be the key factor.

But it shows that prolonged stress dials back deliberate decision-making while also boosting an ‘autopilot’ mode in the brain that favours rigid, habitual behaviours.\n\nIt’s long been known that humans who face chronic stress are prone to resort to a habit, such as smoking a cigarette or eating junk food, rather than make a well-thought-out decision. The work, reported today in Nature, uncovers a biological mechanism for how stress puts its finger on the scale in favour of routine, scientists say.\n\n“It’s really a major achievement,” says Kyle Smith, a neuroscientist at Dartmouth University in Hanover, New Hampshire, who was not involved in the study. The process described “is probably not the only way in which stress increases habit formation, but it really nails down one way”.\n\nStressful studies\n\nStudy author Jacqueline Giovanniello’s interest in stress was piqued by her experience as a student, when she juggled three jobs and a full course load at university. “Something that really interested me was how these stressful experiences change your brain,” says Giovanniello, a neuroscientist now at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nTo study these changes, she and her colleagues exposed mice to an assortment of mild stressors, including damp bedding and white noise. Alongside a control group of hungry but unstressed mice, those that were both hungry and stressed learnt to press a lever to receive a treat of tasty pellets.\n\nChronic stress can inflame the gut — now scientists know why\n\nThe scientists then tested all of the animals’ ability to make flexible decisions — which, for humans, means that you “think about the consequences of your behaviour and use that information to decide what to do”, says study co-author Kate Wassum, a behavioural neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. The alternative is to fall back on habit, “an automatic, almost unconscious reflex to keep doing what you did before”, Smith says.\n\nTo test whether the animals were behaving habitually, the scientists gave the mice a hefty serving of pellets. Then, the animals were given the chance to once again press the lever. The unstressed mice that had filled up with pellets didn’t bother much with the lever — an example of their ability to make purposeful decisions, the authors say. But the stressed mice that were full kept pressing the lever many times per minute, a behaviour that is more automatic than goal-driven, the researchers add.",

          "title": "Why these scientists devote time to editing and updating Wikipedia",
          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Victoria Doronina is a member of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.Credit: Dr. Vadzim Chalau\n\nVictoria Doronina was a biology research associate in the mid-2000s when she started to become active on Wikipedia, adding to and improving pages on the Russian-language version of the online encyclopaedia.\n\nIn 2006, five years after Wikipedia’s launch, she became an administrator, after successfully completing a nomination and voting process. An admin goes beyond editing to manage pages across the site using special permissions, such as the ability to rename pages (see ‘Wikipedia made simple’ and ‘Wikipedia by the numbers’).\n\nFour years ago Doronina, who now works as a technical officer at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK, was elected to become a member of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization, registered in the United States and based in San Francisco, California, that is responsible for Wikipedia and related projects. The foundation’s trustees oversee its work.\n\nA standard question as part of the selection process was whether she had experience of living in a repressive regime. She did, being from Belarus and living there until 1998, but Doronina didn’t understand why it was relevant.\n\nAfter running for re-election in 2024, she understood why. A Russian alternative to Wikipedia, the government-funded Great Russian Encyclopedia, had shut down, following controversies that included what content should be included in scientists’ biographies, which might have contributed to it losing government funding.\n\nTwo years earlier, the Belarusian government imprisoned human-rights activist Pavel Alexandrovich Pernikaŭ for his Wikipedia edits about human-rights abuses. When Doronina made her pitch for re-election, she mentioned both her experience of “living in a totalitarian regime” and her scientific experience (including a PhD in molecular biology from the University of Edinburgh, UK, which she gained in 2001), as providing a useful perspective.\n\nScientist contributions\n\nA 2018 survey of more than 4,000 Wikipedians (as the site’s editors are called) found that 12% had a doctorate. Scientists made up one-third of the Wikimedia Foundation’s 16 trustees, according to Doronina.\n\nAlthough Wikipedia is the best-known project under the Wikimedia umbrella, there are other ways for scientists to contribute besides editing Wikipedia pages. For example, an entomologist could upload photos of little-known insect species to Wikimedia Commons, a collection of images and other media. A computer scientist could add a self-published book to the digital textbook site Wikibooks. Or a linguist could explain etymology on the collaborative dictionary Wiktionary. All of these are open access, a key part of Wikimedia’s mission.\n\nAlthough Wikipedia’s structure might seem daunting for new editors, there are parallels with academic documents.\n\nFor instance, Jess Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London, who focuses on creating and improving biographies of female scientists and scientists from low- and middle-income countries, says that the talk page, which is the behind-the-scenes portion of a Wikipedia page on which editors discuss how to improve it, is almost like the peer-review file of an academic paper.\n\nJess Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London, creates and edits biographies of female scientists.Credit: Thomas Angus, Imperial College London\n\nWell-informed Wikipedians are especially valuable in certain areas, and a key gap is content about and specific to women, says Wade. But addressing this isn’t always straightforward. To create a new Wikipedia biography, the person has to be deemed notable. But even when women meet the criteria for notability, their pages are nominated for deletion more often than are men’s1.\n\nAnd even if Wikipedia pages already exist for people from under-represented groups, Wade says, “their pages are usually shorter and have less technical detail, and are more focused on personal life”.\n\nThe gender gap extends to pages about women’s health. Doronina has seen plenty of misinformation about topics such as menopause. This is partly related to the disproportionate number of men contributing to Wikipedia. One study of the Spanish-language Wikipedia found that women made up around 11.6% of editors2. But the disparity also reflects the insufficiency of the source material, including scientific publications on women’s health. “If there is a gap in scientific literature, you cannot write a high-quality article,” Doronina says. “It’s a feedback cycle.”\n\nWhy we’re editing women scientists onto Wikipedia\n\nThere’s also a particular need for input for language versions that have small editing communities. Doronina says that the small group of contributors for such versions of Wikipedia have more power than do members of large communities.\n\nPrashanth Nuggehalli Srinivas, director of the Institute of Public Health in Bengaluru, an Indian non-profit organization, occasionally contributes to Wikipedia in Kannada, an official language of the Indian state Karnataka, but there is little information on the Kannada-language Wikipedia overall. Language remains a barrier to increasing the representation of academics from low- and middle-income countries, Srinivas says.\n\nEven languages spoken in a number of countries can be poorly supported on Wikipedia. Vinicius Siqueira Tavares Meira Silva is a primary-care physician and a PhD student at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation's Sergio Arouca National School of Public Health in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He used to frequently translate articles from English Wikipedia to the Portuguese version. But translation started to feel insufficient. Siqueira says that his current interest, Brazilian public health, often doesn’t have entries on non-Portuguese Wikipedia sites, creating a need for original articles in Portuguese.\n\nPublic good\n\n“Wikipedia articles should be based on the most reliable independent sources, and scientists seem to have a good understanding of what constitutes a reliable source within a particular field,” says Stephen Harrison, a journalist based in Dallas, Texas, who has carved out a niche writing about Wikipedia, and in 2024 published The Editors, a thriller based on the platform.\n\nHealth and medicine are particularly important areas for specialist contributors. WikiProject Medicine, a Wikipedia community focusing on medicine that launched in 2004, has more than 100 active members, including physicians, medical students and researchers. But Srinivas strikes a note of caution, warning: “While Wikipedia is such an amazing place for health-related information, by design it is not vetted by doctors.”\n\nPrashanth Nuggehalli Srinivas encourages academics to introduce Wikipedia to their students when teaching critical-thinking skills.Credit: Prashanth N S\n\nSiqueira and other Wikipedians stress that scientific expertise can definitely help to inform Wikipedia content, but ultimately contributions matter more than credentials, and it should be an egalitarian rather than an elite project. Beyond scientists, “it will be much more revolutionary if we have people from all groups committed to this work,” Siqueira emphasizes. The Wikimedia Foundation provides access to scientific journals to users with a certain level of activity, so that more editors can translate scientific publications for mass audiences. Overall, Wikipedia’s generalist editors tend to prefer systematic reviews or meta-analyses rather than primary research. “They don’t want to be dazzled by some obscure reference,” Srinivas adds.\n\nThere can be cross-benefits of Wikimedia activity and a scientific job. Doronina says that her conference organizing skills were refreshed by her role on the Wikimedia Foundation’s Board. And Wade says that practising writing neutral, jargon-free text is a useful exercise for scientists in general.\n\nMore broadly, “Wikipedia to me is particularly exciting because it spans partisan divides,” Wade comments. “From an information-sharing perspective, there’s very few places like that any more.”\n\nCaution\n\nHowever, scientists have their own biases about aspects such as how to classify certain topics. This matters, Harrison says, because “Wikipedia is intended to be a general-purpose encyclopaedia instead of a scientific encyclopaedia.”\n\nOne example is a long-standing battle over Wikipedia pages on cryptids and folklore creatures such as Bigfoot. Labels such as ‘pseudoscience’ have angered cryptid enthusiasts and raised questions about different types of knowledge. One suggestion is for the pages to feature a disclaimer that says that a topic is not accepted by mainstream science.\n\nWade raises a point about resourcing, saying it’s especially difficult for the platform to retain academics who might be enthusiastic about editing Wikipedia initially, but then drop off. One reason is time. For full-time researchers, Wikipedia editing could be an activity best left to evenings, weekends and holidays.",

          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "Few health-policy experts were surprised when US President Donald Trump last month announced that he would pull the United States out of the World Health Organization (WHO). Nor were many shocked when, a few days later, Trump said that he could reconsider the withdrawal if certain unspecified conditions were met. What might happen next is harder to predict.\n\n“His general strategy is to detonate things and then do whatever’s advantageous to him,” says Jesse Bump, a global-health-policy researcher at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “But in the case of WHO, it’s really difficult to imagine anything that would be personally advantageous to him in the short run.”\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nThe US withdrawal will not officially happen until January 2026, so there will be months of uncertainty over budgets and strategic direction at the near-80-year-old agency. Set up by the United Nations, the organization’s goals include expanding universal health coverage and coordinating the world’s response to health emergencies.\n\nNature spoke to senior figures in global health to gauge what might be next for the WHO and the field.\n\nBudget uncertainty hinders work\n\nSome remain optimistic about the WHO’s future. “It’s a pretty robust organization and I think the WHO will weather this,” says Robert Yates, a political-health economist at the London School of Economics and Political Science. “And if other Western powers step up to defend it and put more money into it, then it might come out a bit stronger.”\n\nBut given that the United States contributes about 18% of the WHO annual budget of roughly US$3.4 billion, the uncertainty is already having an impact. Opening the WHO executive board meeting this month, director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that, even before Trump’s executive order, the WHO was planning to shrink spending because of a shortfall caused by economic difficulties in many donor countries. “The US announcement has made the situation more acute, and we have announced a set of measures with immediate effect,” he said.\n\nThe result is that “WHO staff are grounded” says Ilona Kickbusch, a political scientist who specializes in health at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. “Nearly every meeting is cancelled and travel to countries is cancelled.”\n\nIs bird flu spreading among people? Data gaps leave researchers in the dark\n\nThat’s affecting the agency’s work, she adds. “If you are trying to negotiate a new set of standards or something like that it helps to be in one room.”\n\nProjects that the WHO is currently working on include a Europe-wide push to improve mental-health services and work on the ground after a surge of violence in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, providing medical assistance and supplies, supporting health workers and coordinating the emergency response.\n\nHow events will play out is hard to judge, she adds, because the WHO’s operations are more complex than its critics often realize. “For Trump, WHO is an international bureaucracy in Geneva,” Kickbusch says. “But it’s actually incredibly complicated.”\n\nTrump’s complaints about the WHO include its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the slow pace of reform and what his executive order cites as an “inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states”.\n\nRegional offices might still be funded\n\nMuch of the WHO’s work is routed through six regional offices. One of these, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), receives a separate funding stream from the US government, which could continue to be paid even after the US withdraws from the WHO proper.\n\n“There are other regional groups which the US may choose to fund bilaterally and therefore not fund through WHO,” says David Heymann, an infectious-disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. There are also dozens of designated WHO collaborating centres that conduct research at US academic institutions to support the agency’s programmes. These could continue to work with the WHO to provide technical support, he adds.\n\nWorld Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced plans for the organization to reduce spending.Credit: Lian Yi/Xinhua/Alamy\n\nBeyond the financial impacts, any US withdrawal “sets a very poor example for other countries”, he says. Argentina also said this month that it will leave the organization.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei accused the WHO of promoting “endless lockdowns without scientific support” among other claims. But Milei said that Argentina would remain part of the PAHO. Still, leaving the WHO would mean that Argentina loses international support for future pandemics and other global-health problems, says Adolfo Rubinstein, a former health minister of Argentina. “This is terrible news.”\n\nOther populist leaders could follow, says Lawrence Gostin, who directs the WHO Collaborating Center for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington DC. “But I expect the vast majority of countries to remain members and perhaps coalesce around WHO.”\n\nDisease-monitoring gaps raise risks",

In 1997, it was discovered1 that meiotic recombination is initiated by the protein SPO11, which cuts both strands of the DNA duplex at ‘hotspot’ regions in the genome. However, it has not been possible to reconstitute the DNA-cleaving activity of SPO11 using purified proteins, which has prevented the molecular characterization of this important cellular process. Writing in Nature, three research groups now report2–4 that they have finally succeeded in reconstituting DNA cleavage by purified SPO11, unlocking a new era of research in this field.",

          "authors": "Felice Frankel",
          "abstract": "One of the privileges of being on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge is seeing glimpses of the future, from advances in quantum computing and energy sustainability and production, to designing new antibiotics. Do I understand it all deeply? No, but I am able to wrap my head around much of it when I am asked to create an image to document the research.\n\nThe joy of being a science photographer is that I must learn about the things I am documenting to produce communicative and trustworthy images, intended as a form of data, for the researchers who welcome me into their laboratories.\n\nBut now, with the wide availability of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools, lots of questions must be asked. Will there be a point at which, with just a few keystrokes and prompts, a scientist can create a ‘visual’ of their research, as I do with my camera, and consider that image a record of the work? Will researchers, journals and readers be able to spot artificially created images and understand that they do not truly document the work? And finally, from a personal point of view, will there still be a place for a science photographer like me to advance the communication of research? Here’s what I have found out while experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI) image generators.\n\nReality and representation\n\nFirst, let’s remind ourselves of the differences between a photograph, in which each pixel corresponds to real-world photons, and a genAI visual, created with a diffusion model — a complex computational process that generates something that seems real but might never have existed.\n\nTo explore these differences, I decided to experiment with genAI visuals made with Midjourney and OpenAI’s DALL-E diffusion models to reproduce the work shown in one of my most popular science photographs — with help from scientific-visualization researcher Gaël McGill at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1997, Moungi Bawendi, a chemist at MIT, asked me to take a picture of his nanocrystals (quantum dots). When excited with ultraviolet light, these crystals fluoresce at different wavelengths depending on their size. Bawendi, who later shared a Nobel prize for this work, did not like the first image (see ‘Three views’), in which I had placed the vials flat on the lab bench, taking a top-down photograph. You can tell that was how I had placed them, because you can see the air bubbles in the tubes. It was intentional; I thought it made the image more interesting.\n\nCredit: Felice Frankel\n\nThe second iteration was used on the November 1997 cover of the Journal of Physical Chemistry B (see ‘Three views’). That photograph provides a straightforward record of the research and highlights the importance of collaborating with the scientist — an essential part of my process.\n\nTo generate a comparable image in DALL-E, I used the prompt “create a photo of Moungi Bawendi’s nanocrystals in vials against a black background, fluorescing at different wavelengths, depending on their size, when excited with UV light”.\n\nChina made waves with Deepseek, but its real ambition is AI-driven industrial innovation\n\nPeople might think that the image the program produced is attractive (see ‘Three views’), but it is not even close to the reality captured in the original photograph. DALL-E introduced bead-like dots that were not in the prompt. The algorithm presumably found the words ‘quantum dots’ in the data set of the AI model that underlies it and used that information to replace the words “nanocrystals”.\n\nMore troubling is the fact that, in each vial, there are dots with different colours, implying that the samples contain a mix of materials that fluoresce at a range of wavelengths — this is inaccurate. Furthermore, some of the dots are shown lying on the surface of the table. Was that an aesthetic decision made by the model? I find the resulting visual fascinating (see Supplementary Information).\n\nThe results of my AI experimentation are often cartoon-like images that can hardly pass as reality — let alone documentation — but there will be a time when they will be. In conversations with colleagues in research and computer-science communities, they all agree that we should have clear standards on what is and is not allowed. In my opinion, a genAI visual should never be allowed as documentation.\n\nManipulated versus AI generated\n\nThe advent of AI means that we need to clarify three core issues related to visual communication: the difference between illustration and documentation, the ethics of image manipulation and the desperate need for visual-communication training for scientists and engineers.\n\nDecisions about how to frame an image — what to include or leave out — are already a manipulation of reality. The tools that people decide to use are also part of the manipulation. Each digital camera creates a distinct photograph. An Apple iPhone’s algorithm enhances image colours differently to that of a Samsung phone. Similarly, the near-infrared images produced by the James Webb Space Telescope are designed to be different from, yet complement, the Hubble Space Telescope’s optical scans.\n\nHow AI is unlocking ancient texts — and could rewrite history\n\nTaking the point even further, the colours we see in all of those amazing images of the Universe are digitally enhanced and give us yet more renditions of reality. Seen through this lens, it is clear that humans have been, in effect, artificially generating images for years, without necessarily labelling them as such. However, there is a crucial difference between enhancing a photograph with software to depict reality and creating a reality from trained data sets.\n\nAs a science photographer, I am acutely aware of the difference between an illustration and a documentary photograph, but I am less confident that AI programs can make this distinction. An illustration or diagram is a representation of something, subjectively translating and visually describing a concept or structure using notations, colours, shapes and so on. A documentary optical photograph, or one made using scanning or transmission electron microscopy, is created with photons and electrons and is therefore a representation of an item, even if it is not the item itself. The difference between the two is in the intent.\n\nWith illustration, the intent is to describe and clarify the work. GenAI visuals will probably excel in that task. But for a documentary photograph, the intent is to bring us as close to reality as we can. Both are, in essence, already a form of manipulation or an act of artificial generation, and therein lies the importance of defining and discussing their ethics before we include genAI tools.\n\nPublishers now have software in place to identify various manipulations in images that already exist (see Nature 626, 697–698; 2024), but, frankly, AI programs will eventually be able to circumvent these fail-safes. There are efforts under way to find ways to trace the provenance of a photograph or to document any manipulation of the original. For example, the forensic photography community, through the global Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, provides technical information to camera manufacturers regarding the ability to trace the provenance of a photograph by keeping a record in the camera of any manipulation. As one can imagine, not all manufactures are on board.\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nThe scientific community still has time to create a system of transparency and form guidelines regarding AI-generated images. At a minimum, every genAI visual should be clearly labelled as such, and the process and tools used to create it should be clearly stated and include, where possible, credit for any source images provided to the AI engine. However, listing the sources poses a challenge.\n\nTwo articles have raised an important issue by highlighting potential privacy and copyright violations when using diffusion models (N. Carlini et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/grqmsb (2023); and see go.nature.com/4jqyevn). Credit is only feasible in a closed system (which diffusion models are not) for which the training data are known and fully documented. For example, Springer Nature, which publishes Nature (Nature is independent of its publisher), has recently included an exception into its policy for Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold program to cover this sort of use (for models trained on a specific set of scientific data). However, people should keep in mind that AlphaFold is not a genAI tool that creates images — it generates structural models (coordinate data) that are then turned into images by people (not by genAI tools).\n\nHappily, efforts are addressing privacy issues. Creators can now use a kind of ‘tamper-evident’ metadata called Content Credentials to, as Adobe explains in its manual, “obtain proper recognition and promote transparency in the content creation process” (see go.nature.com/3wx92ng).\n\nEthical standards\n\nFor years, I have suggested that scientists need to be trained in the ethics of visual communication, and the easy availability of AI image-creation software adds urgency to this discussion.\n\nFor example, I recall one experience with an engineer who altered a photograph that I had made of their research and wanted to publish it, along with the submitted article (see Supplementary Information). The researcher did not consider that altering the image was, in fact, similar to changing their data because they had not been taught the basic ethics of image manipulation and visual communication.",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "The main historical building on the campus of the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.Credit: Grandbrothers/Alamy\n\nAbout a month after Donald Trump took office as the 47th US president, almost all grant-review meetings remain suspended at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), preventing the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research from spending much of its US$47-billion annual budget.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next\n\nThese review panels are suspended because the Trump administration has barred the agency from taking a key procedural step necessary to schedule them. This has caused an indefinite lapse in funding and left scientists facing difficult decisions about the future of their research programmes.\n\nThe Trump administration issued an order on 27 January freezing payment on all federal grants and loans, but lawsuits challenging its legality were filed soon afterwards, putting the order on hold. However, payments are still not going out, because Trump’s team has halted grant-review meetings, exploiting a “loophole” in the process, says Aaron Hoskins, an RNA biochemist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who has had to reconsider hiring graduate students because of a frozen grant application. “It’s really quite nefarious.”\n\nSome legal scholars say that this ‘back-door’ approach to freezing funding is illegal. That’s because the US Constitution gives Congress, not the president or his team, the power to appropriate funds, says David Super, an administrative-law specialist at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington DC. Blocking “advisory-committee meetings that are legally required to make payments is no different in effect than simply refusing to sign contracts or issue cheques”, he says.\n\nThe NIH, which is based in Bethesda, Maryland, did not respond to Nature’s queries about the freeze, its legality or when the freeze would be lifted.\n\nA loophole in the process\n\nTo gain approval, NIH research-grant applications are considered in two steps, by two separate panels. The first is a study section, which is a group of independent scientists who convene to score applications. The second is a meeting of the agency’s advisory council, which is a separate group of external and internal scientists and advisers that acts as a final check on an application before a funding decision is made.\n\nAre the Trump team’s actions affecting your research? How to contact Nature\n\nTo run either of these grant-review sessions, the agency must post its meeting plans at least 15 days in advance on the Federal Register, which is the official daily publication of the US government. Trump’s team has barred NIH officials from making these posts, according to e-mail correspondence that Nature has obtained. The NIH has posted no notices on the Federal Register since Trump took office; during the same period in 2024, the agency posted more than 150 notices.\n\nAccording to the e-mail, the Trump administration will, in future, require that these notices be posted at least 35 days before grant-review meetings, instead of the standard 15 in effect previously. This means that, even if these notices were allowed again from today, the earliest date on which a new grant-review meeting could be scheduled is 28 March.\n\nA small number of study sections have convened since Trump took office, but only because a Federal Register notice was posted to schedule them before his inauguration. The continuing cancellation of these meetings has had a snowball effect, and there is now an enormous backlog of applications (see ‘Trend reversal’).\n\nSource: NIH RePORTER database/Nature analysis (see code here)\nAn untenable backlog\n\nAdvisory councils at 23 of the NIH’s institutes and centres usually meet only once every four months to discuss grant applications. The first council gatherings for 2025, which were scheduled to be held between late January and early February, were cancelled by the new administration during a ‘communications pause’.\n\n‘Devastating’ cuts to NIH grants by Trump’s team put on hold by US judge\n\n“As we get more backed up, there will reach a point where it’ll be impossible to do peer review in time for the [second] council meeting date,” says an NIH scientific review officer, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence (ages 10–24) is characterized by cognitive, behavioural and social development. Childhood environments are typically centred on home and care settings, whereas adolescents increasingly engage with peer and community environments. These changing environments confer risks of experiencing specific adversities at different ages. Despite the unique characteristics of adversities in adolescence and potential associations with lifespan outcomes, few frameworks exist to systematize adversities in adolescents. Here we review current research and propose an approach specific to this developmental period: the adverse adolescent experiences (AAEs) framework. Building on existing models (for example, the adverse childhood experiences framework), the AAEs focus on potentially traumatizing experiences during adolescence. The framework builds on Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory to conceptualize adversities at intrapersonal, interpersonal, community and societal levels. We argue that this approach can enhance our understanding of adolescent adversity, facilitate the study of its potential effects, and guide prevention and intervention efforts.",

          "abstract": "To build and establish essential international networks, gain international experience and secure a position on the academic tenure track, early-career researchers are increasingly seeking employment opportunities abroad1,2. Relocation to a foreign country — particularly one with a different culture and language — is an inherently challenging undertaking. Early-career researchers often encounter difficulties even before departing. A typical example would be the frustrating cycle between residence permit and employment contract: in many cases, obtaining a visa or residence permit is necessary to secure an employment contract. However, without proof of employment and a rental agreement, obtaining a visa can be difficult. In situations in which institutions fail to provide specialized and dedicated support, delays in the researcher’s arrival may occur that limit the ability of the early-career researcher to achieve and show their full potential within the host institution.\n\nAfter arrival, those who do not speak the local language may face additional challenges3. Although researchers typically use a common language (often English), administrative staff of the employing institutions might not, which makes tasks such as completing paperwork and reading email correspondence difficult. These activities frequently require help from a bilingual third party, which is not always available or advisable for sensitive matters. Furthermore, such challenges often extend beyond the walls of the institution into daily life, including in finding accommodation, setting up a local bank account, navigating taxes, and scheduling private or occupational medical appointments.",

Substantial changes to current systems of care, including regulatory approvals, clinical training and access will all be required to accommodate PAT, a multimodal therapy that combines pharmacological and psychotherapy components that are not routinely available outside clinical research settings. Implementation science can help to reduce the gap in a way that maintains scientific rigour by simultaneously examining the safety, effectiveness and implementation of PAT. Specifically, precision implementation science methods (for example, sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designs), hybrid study designs, valid measurement of fidelity and use of theory-based models and frameworks for treatment development will accelerate the process of implementation while balancing safety and quality.

This directional nature suggests that advanced, specific skills and knowledge are often built upon broader, fundamental ones. We examine 70 million job transitions to show that human capital development and career progression follow this structured pathway in which skills more aligned with the nested structure command higher wage premiums, require longer education and are less likely to be automated. These disparities are evident across genders and racial/ethnic groups, explaining long-term wage penalties. Finally, we find that this nested structure has become even more pronounced over the past two decades, indicating increased barriers to upward job mobility.",

We found that people rated true news as more accurate than false news (Cohen’s d = 1.12 [1.01, 1.22]) and were better at rating false news as false than at rating true news as true (Cohen’s d = 0.32 [0.24, 0.39]). In other words, participants were able to discern true from false news and erred on the side of skepticism rather than credulity. We found no evidence that the political concordance of the news had an effect on discernment, but participants were more skeptical of politically discordant news (Cohen’s d = 0.78 [0.62, 0.94]). These findings lend support to crowdsourced fact-checking initiatives and suggest that, to improve discernment, there is more room to increase the acceptance of true news than to reduce the acceptance of fact-checked false news.",

Variant-level fine mapping prioritized potential causal variants and functional genomic analysis identified variants that regulate the binding of transcription factors. We validated that 80% of the identified functional variants are regulatory variants, and expression quantitative trait loci analysis uncovered the potential target genes regulated by the prioritized risk variants. Gene-level analysis, including transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies, colocalization and Mendelian randomization-based analyses, prioritized potential causal genes and drug targets. Gene prioritization analyses highlighted likely causal genes, including TMEM106B, CTNND1, AREL1 and so on. Pathway analysis indicated significant enrichment of depression risk genes in synapse-related pathways. Finally, knockdown of Tmem106b in mice resulted in depression-like behaviours, supporting the involvement of Tmem106b in depression.

          "abstract": "Adaptation is the process by which we adjust internal models of the body, world and mind in response to sensory feedback. Although adaptation is studied extensively in the context of motor control, there is limited evidence that cognitive functions such as working memory are subject to the same error-driven adaptive control mechanism. To examine the possibility that internal spatial representations undergo adaptation, we had participants perform a task that interleaved a perceptual discrimination task and a spatial working memory task. Perceptual discrimination trials (85% of trials) presented an initial peripheral cue to exogenously capture attention, immediately followed by a displaced target stimulus. This sequence of events served to repeatedly induce a covert attentional allocation error. Interleaved spatial working memory trials (15% of trials) presented a stimulus at a pseudorandom peripheral location followed by a delay interval. On half of the working memory trials, the stimulus was surreptitiously presented at the same location as the initial attentional cue. We found that as attentional errors accumulated over the course of the experiment, participants’ spatial recall shifted to counteract the attentional error. The magnitude of this shift was proportional to the number of induced errors. Recall performance recovered rapidly following the offset of error trials. Multiple control experiments ruled out alternative explanations for these results, such as oculomotor confounds and attentional biases unrelated to error. These findings indicate that the computational mechanisms governing the adaptation of motor commands appear to similarly serve to adjust and calibrate spatial cognition.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: As LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two measures: LLM Word Association Test, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Relative Decision Test, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in contextual decisions. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Word Association Test adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Relative Decision Test operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). These prompt-based measures draw from psychology’s long history of research into measuring stereotypes based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.",

We review the case for and against this hypothesis, arguing previous research has not sufficiently attended to reasons why listening may not enhance persuasion. We test this hypothesis using a preregistered, well-powered field experiment in which trained professional canvassers, acting as confederates, had ∼10 min video conversations with U.S. participants ( N = 1,485) about unauthorized immigration, a salient topic of disagreement. We independently randomized whether confederates shared a persuasive narrative about an undocumented immigrant and whether they practiced high-quality nonjudgmental listening to participants’ opinions. We measured outcomes immediately after the conversation and again five weeks later. Sharing a persuasive narrative meaningfully and durably reduced prejudice and changed policy attitudes. The listening manipulation also successfully improved perceptions of the persuader and increased processing. Surprisingly, however, the listening manipulation did not enhance persuasion: Sharing a persuasive narrative was just as effective in the absence of high-quality listening. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.",

          "abstract": "A weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has been found to be globally beneficial by economic assessments. This result emerges because AMOC weakening would cool the Northern Hemisphere, thereby reducing expected climate damages and decreasing estimates of the global social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC). There are, however, many other impacts of AMOC weakening that are not yet taken into account. Here, we add a second impact channel by quantifying the effects of AMOC weakening on ocean carbon uptake, using biogeochemically-only coupled freshwater hosing simulations in the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. Our simulations reveal an approximately linear relationship between AMOC strength and carbon uptake reductions, constituting a carbon cycle feedback that leads to higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and stronger global warming. This AMOC carbon feedback, when incorporated into an integrated climate-economy model, leads to additional economic damages of several trillion US dollars and raises the SCC by about 1%. The SCC increase is similar in magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the SCC effect of Northern Hemisphere cooling. While there are many other potentially relevant economic impact channels, the AMOC carbon feedback alone could thus flip the consequences of AMOC weakening into a net cost to society.",

          "abstract": "The conservation of biodiversity represents a global challenge as the world experiences its sixth mass extinction. Understanding how conservation efforts are allocated is paramount to effectively protect threatened species. We analyzed ~14,600 conservation projects over a 25-y period, revealing substantial taxonomic biases in funding. When matched with formal assessments of species’ threat status, several highly threatened groups such as amphibians receive little and ever-decreasing support. Within particular groups (e.g., Mammalia, Reptilia), funding is directed to a very narrow selection of taxa, leaving the majority of their threatened species with limited or no support. More attention is urgently needed to assess the extinction risks of neglected taxa, especially smaller species. Paradoxically, while approximately 6% of species identified as threatened were supported by conservation funds, 29% of the funding was allocated to species of “least concern”. A more holistic distribution of conservation funding is, therefore, urgently needed if we are to protect biodiversity efficiently. We suggest avenues and mechanisms for a more balanced coverage of threatened species within conservation programs and highlight some of the benefits that could be derived from such an approach.",

          "abstract": "Cell populations must adjust their phenotypic composition to adapt to changing environments. One adaptation strategy is to maintain distinct phenotypic subsets within the population and to modulate their relative abundances via gene regulation. Another strategy involves genetic mutations, which can be augmented by stress-response pathways. Here, we studied how a migrating bacterial population regulates its phenotypic distribution to traverse diverse environments. We generated isogenic Escherichia coli populations with varying distributions of swimming behaviors and observed their phenotype distributions during migration in liquid and porous environments. We found that the migrating populations became enriched with high-performing swimming phenotypes in each environment, allowing the populations to adapt without requiring mutations or gene regulation. This adaptation is dynamic and rapid, reversing in a few doubling times when migration ceases. By measuring the chemoreceptor abundance distributions during migration toward different attractants, we demonstrated that adaptation acts on multiple chemotaxis-related traits simultaneously. These measurements are consistent with a general mechanism in which adaptation results from a balance between cell growth generating diversity and collective migration eliminating underperforming phenotypes. Thus, collective migration enables cell populations with continuous, multidimensional phenotypes to flexibly and rapidly adapt their phenotypic composition to diverse environmental conditions.",

Previous studies showed that therapeutic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies with α2,6-sialyl complex type (SCT) glycan attached to Fc-Asn297 exhibited optimal binding to the Fc receptors on effector cells associated with ADCC, ADCP, and ADVE. However, the production of antibodies with homogeneous Fc-SCT glycan requires multiple in vitro enzymatic and purification steps. In this study, we report two cell-based methods to produce Fc-GlcNAc antibody and Fc-SCT-enriched antibodies with improved effector functions. First, we expressed endoglycosidase S2 in Expi293F GnT1- cells to trim all N-glycans to Fc-GlcNAc antibody for in vitro transglycosylation to generate homogeneous antibodies with well-defined Fc glycan. Second, we engineered the glycosylation pathway of HEK293T cells through knock-out of undesired glycosyltransferases and knock-in of desired glycosyltransferases to produce Fc-SCT-enriched antibodies and evaluated their binding to Fc receptors, and we found that the Fc-SCT-enriched antibody is like or better than the homogeneous Fc-SCT antibody in binding to the Fc receptors associated with ADCC, ADCP, and ADVE.",

          "abstract": "Processivity clamps mediate polymerase switching for translesion synthesis (TLS). All three Escherichia coli TLS polymerases interact with the β 2 processivity clamp through a conserved clamp-binding motif (CBM), which is indispensable for TLS. Notably, Pol IV also interacts weakly with the rim of the clamp through non-CBM residues. Ablating this “rim contact” in cells results in selective sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, raising the question how the rim contact contributes to TLS. Here, we show that the rim contact is critical for TLS past a strong replication block but barely necessary for a weak blocking lesion. Within the in vitro reconstituted E. coli replisome, the rim mutation compromises Pol IV-mediated TLS past 3-deaza-methyl dA, a strong block, whereas barely affecting TLS past N 2 -furfuryl dG, a weak block. Similar observations are also made in E. coli cells bearing a single copy of these lesions in the genome. At lesion-stalled replication forks, single-stranded DNA binding protein locally enriches Pol IV, enabling it to bind the low-affinity rim site. This interaction poises Pol IV to better compete with Pol III, the replicative polymerase, which competitively inhibits Pol IV from interacting with the clamp through its CBM. We propose that this bipartite clamp interaction enables Pol IV to rapidly resolve lesion-stalled replication at a strong block through TLS, which reduces damage-induced mutagenesis.",

          "authors": "Yang Cheng, Xuesong Wang, Yike Ding, Houhong Zhang, Zhenyu Jia, Alexander S. Raikhel",
          "abstract": "Female mosquitoes are vectors of many devastating human diseases because they require blood feeding to initiate reproduction. Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms managing female mosquito reproduction is essential. Although the regulation of gene expression during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle has been studied in detail, how this process is controlled at the chromatin level remains unclear. Chromatin must be accessible for transcription factors (TFs) governing gene expression. A specialized class of TFs, called pioneer factors (PFs), binds and remodels closed chromatin, permitting other TFs to bind DNA and activate the gene expression. Here, we identified a homolog of the vertebrate PF FoxA in the mosquito Aedes aegypti and used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate mosquitoes deficient in AaFoxA . We found that ovary development was severely retarded in mutant females. Multiomics and molecular biology analyses have shown that AaFoxA increased histone acetylation and decreased methylation of H3K27 by controlling the chromatin accessibility of histone modification enzymes and chromatin remodelers. AaFoxA is bound to the loci of chromatin remodelers, changing their chromatin accessibility and modulating their temporal expression patterns. AaFoxA increased the accessibility of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and E74 loci, indicating the important role of AaFoxA in the hormonal regulation of mosquito reproductive events. Further, the CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq analyses revealed that AaFoxA temporarily bound closed chromatin, making it differentially accessible during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle. Hence, this study demonstrates that AaFoxA modulates chromatin dynamics throughout female mosquito reproduction.",

          "abstract": "Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is a highly aggressive T cell malignancy characterized by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. ATL has a very poor prognosis and lacks satisfactory treatments; therefore, it is critical to identify potential targets in ATL cells in order to develop effective targeted therapeutics. Here, we report the identification of two oncogenes, AK4 and RHOC, as target genes of miR-455-3p, a tumor-suppressive microRNA in ATL patients. Importantly, AK4 and RHOC are highly expressed in ATL and exhibit oncogenic potentials in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal a functional overlap of AK4 and RHOC, including activating oncogenic pathways such as Myc targets and deregulating lipid metabolism such as enhancing the production of sphingomyelin, a tumor-promoting lipid. In particular, compared to other types of T cell malignancy such as T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), ATL is sensitive to sphingomyelin inhibition and AK4 or RHOC depletion. Altogether, we report a distinct dependency of ATL on AK4 and RHOC oncogenes and an oncometabolite sphingomyelin, which together represent targetable vulnerabilities of ATL that could be exploited for developing effective therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Groundwater is essential to urban water supplies throughout the world, but we do not understand how quantity and quality issues may jeopardize the ability of cities to meet their water needs. Here, we present a national analysis of both quantity and quality challenges facing China’s urban groundwater supply security, using high-resolution groundwater depletion modeling and a recently compiled dataset detailing quality violations in drinking groundwater sources. We estimate that 180 cities (about half of the prefecture-level-and-above cities), accounting for 311 million urban residents, face at least one groundwater pressure between 2016 and 2021. Cities that face dual quantity and quality pressures pinpoints hotspots of intense groundwater threats— Specifically, 40 cities, mainly situated in Northeast China and the middle to lower reaches of the Yellow River, are exposed to dual groundwater pressures. The results highlight the interconnected and possibly mutually reinforcing nature of groundwater depletion and quality issues. The logistic regression models indicate that groundwater depletion and quality violations are associated with natural water endowment and anthropogenic factors. Particularly, drinking groundwater quality issues are clustered in relation to socioeconomic gaps, with larger, wealthier cities being less prone to such problems. We argue that securing drinking water sources in small and poor cities through integrated groundwater management and economic assistance should be an important national priority for achieving groundwater supply sustainability.",

Our method, called Learning-based Inference of Longitudinal imAge Changes (LILAC), performs a pairwise comparison of longitudinal images in order to make a temporal difference prediction. LILAC employs a convolutional Siamese architecture to extract feature pairs, followed by subtraction and a bias-free fully connected layer to learn meaningful temporal image differences. We first showcase LILAC’s ability to capture key longitudinal changes by simply training it to predict the temporal ordering of images. In our experiments, temporal ordering accuracy exceeded 0.98, and predicted time differences were strongly correlated with actual changes in relevant variables (Pearson Correlation Coefficient r = 0.911 with embryo phase change, and r = 0.875 with time interval in wound healing). Next, we trained LILAC to explicitly predict specific targets, such as the change in clinical scores in patients with mild cognitive impairment. LILAC models achieved over a 40% reduction in root mean square error compared to baseline methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that LILAC effectively localizes and quantifies relevant individual-level changes in longitudinal imaging data, offering valuable insights for studying temporal mechanisms or guiding clinical decisions.",

          "abstract": "Electrocatalytic reduction (ECR) of furfural represents a sustainable route for biomass valorization. Unfortunately, traditional Cu-catalyzed ECR suffers from diversified product distribution and industrial-incompatible production rates, mainly caused by the intricate mechanism−performance relationship. Here, we manipulate hydrogenation pathways on Cu by introducing ceria as an auxiliary component, which enables the mechanism switching from proton-coupled electron transfer to electrochemical hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) and thus high-speed furfural-to-furfuryl alcohol electroconversion. Theoretical and kinetic analyses show that oxygen-vacancy-rich ceria delivers an efficient formation−diffusion−hydrogenation chain of H* by diminishing H* adsorption. Spectroscopic characterizations indicate that Cu/ceria interfacial perimeter enriches the local furfural, synergistically lowering the barrier of the rate-determining HAT step across the perimeter. Our Cu/ceria catalyst realizes high-rate HAT-dominated ECR for electrosynthesis of single-product furfuryl alcohol, achieving a high production rate of 19.1 ± 0.4 mol h −1 m −2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97 ± 1% at an economically viable partial current density of over 0.1 A cm −2 . Our results demonstrate a highly efficient route for biofeedstock valorization with enhanced techno-economic feasibility.",

          "abstract": "While it is known that endocannabinoids (eCB) modulate multiple neuronal functions, the molecular mechanism governing their release and transport remains elusive. Here, we propose an “ on-demand release ” model, wherein the formation of microvesicles, a specific group of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is an important step. A coculture model system that combines a reporter cell line expressing the fluorescent eCB sensor, G protein-coupled receptor-based (GRAB) eCB2.0 , and neuronal cells revealed that neurons release EVs containing 2-AG, but not anandamide, in a stimulus-dependent process regulated by protein kinase C, Diacylglycerol lipase, Adenosinediphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), and which was sensitive to inhibitors of eCB facilitated diffusion. A vesicle contained approximately 2,000 2-AG molecules. Accordingly, hippocampal eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity was modulated by Arf6 and transport inhibitors. The “ on-demand release ” model, supported by mathematical analysis, offers a cohesive framework for understanding eCB trafficking at the molecular level and suggests that microvesicles carrying signaling lipids in their membrane regulate neuronal functions in parallel to canonical synaptic vesicles.",

          "authors": "Spencer P. Alliston, Chris Dames, Matthew J. Powell-Palm",
          "abstract": "Predictive synthesis of aqueous organic solutions with desired liquid–solid phase equilibria could drive progress in industrial chemistry, cryopreservation, and beyond, but is limited by the predictive power of current solution thermodynamics models. In particular, few analytical models enable accurate liquidus and eutectic prediction based only on bulk thermodynamic properties of the pure components, requiring instead either direct measurement or costly simulation of solution properties. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple modification to the canonical ideal solution theory accounting for the entropic effects of dissimilar molecule sizes can transform its predictive power. Incorporating a Flory-style entropy of mixing term that includes both the mole and volume fractions of each component, we derive size-dependent equations for the ideal chemical potential and liquidus temperature, and use them to predict the binary phase diagrams of water and 10 organic solutes of varying sizes. We show that size-dependent prediction outperforms the ideal model in all cases, reducing average error in the predicted liquidus temperature by 59% (to 5.6 K), eutectic temperature by 45% (to 9.7 K), and eutectic composition by 43% (to 4.7 mol%), as compared to experimental data. Furthermore, by retaining the ideal assumption that the enthalpy of mixing is zero, we demonstrate that, for aqueous organic solutions, much of the deviation from ideality that is typically attributed to molecular interactions may in fact be explained by simple entropic size effects. These results suggest an underappreciated dominance of mixing entropy in these solutions, and provide a simple approach to predicting their phase equilibria.",

          "abstract": "Many insect migrants rely on favorable seasonal winds to carry out long-range latitudinal migrations. In East China, the annual advance and retreat of the East Asian summer monsoon produces ideal conditions for seasonal range expansion and contraction of many migratory crop pests. However, climate-induced changes in the strength, timing, and location of the monsoon are impacting wind systems which may, in turn, affect migration patterns. We investigated these questions in the rice leafroller (RLR) moth, a severe pest of rice that annually invades the Lower Yangtze River Valley (LYRV) of China from winter-breeding areas further south. Using a 24-y dataset of RLR population dynamics from 31 monitoring stations across Southeast China, we investigated the impact of changes in monsoon wind regimes on fall migration patterns of the pest. Historically, RLR emigrated from the LYRV to South China on the favorably directed winds produced by the retreat of the monsoon at the end of the outbreak season (from mid-August onward). We show that in the recent 12-y period, prevailing late-season winds remain northward for longer than previously, preventing locally produced moths from emigrating southward. Additionally, winds now facilitate mass late-season immigrations into the LYRV, creating an ecological trap, as immigrants do not have time to produce another generation. As a consequence of the changing wind patterns, pest pressure is declining, and climate-induced changes to the East Asian summer monsoon result in seasonal migration becoming a riskier strategy. Such changes in insect migration patterns have severe implications for the population dynamics of windborne migrants, ecosystem functioning, and pest management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Brain age (BA), distinct from chronological age (CA), can be estimated from MRIs to evaluate neuroanatomic aging in cognitively normal (CN) individuals. BA, however, is a cross-sectional measure that summarizes cumulative neuroanatomic aging since birth. Thus, it conveys poorly recent or contemporaneous aging trends, which can be better quantified by the (temporal) pace P of brain aging. Many approaches to map P , however, rely on quantifying DNA methylation in whole-blood cells, which the blood–brain barrier separates from neural brain cells. We introduce a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to estimate P noninvasively from longitudinal MRI. Our longitudinal model (LM) is trained on MRIs from 2,055 CN adults, validated in 1,304 CN adults, and further applied to an independent cohort of 104 CN adults and 140 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In its test set, the LM computes P with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 y (7% mean error). This significantly outperforms the most accurate cross-sectional model, whose MAE of 1.85 y has 83% error. By synergizing the LM with an interpretable CNN saliency approach, we map anatomic variations in regional brain aging rates that differ according to sex, decade of life, and neurocognitive status. LM estimates of P are significantly associated with changes in cognitive functioning across domains. This underscores the LM’s ability to estimate P in a way that captures the relationship between neuroanatomic and neurocognitive aging. This research complements existing strategies for AD risk assessment that estimate individuals’ rates of adverse cognitive change with age.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the evolving dynamics of the brain throughout life is pivotal for anticipating and evaluating individual health. While previous research has described age effects on spectral properties of neural signals, it remains unclear which ones are most indicative of age-related processes. This study addresses this gap by analyzing resting-state data obtained from magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 350 adults (18 to 88 y). We employed advanced time-series analysis at the brain region level and machine learning to predict age. While traditional spectral features achieved low to moderate accuracy, over a hundred time-series features proved superior. Notably, temporal autocorrelation (AC) emerged as the most robust predictor of age. Distinct patterns of AC within the visual and temporal cortex were most informative, offering a versatile measure of age-related signal changes for comprehensive health assessments based on brain activity.",

DDFs are often essential scaffolding domains in receptors, adaptors, or effectors of these pathways by mediating homo- and hetero-oligomerization including helical filament assembly. At the downstream ends of these pathways, effector oligomerization by DDFs brings the enzyme domains into proximity for their dimerization and activation. Hundreds of structures of these domains have been solved. However, a comprehensive understanding of DDFs is lacking. In this article, we report the curation of a DDF structural atlas as a public website (deathdomain.org) and deduce the common and distinct principles of DDF-mediated oligomerization among the four families (death domain or DD, death effector domain or DED, caspase recruitment domain or CARD, and pyrin domain or PYD). We further annotate DDFs genome-wide based on AlphaFold-predicted models and protein sequences. These studies reveal mechanistic rules for this widely distributed domain superfamily.",

          "abstract": "Karrikin Insensitive 2 (KAI2), identified as the receptor protein for karrikins (KARs), which are smoke-derived seed germination stimulants, belongs to the same α/β-hydrolase family as D14, the receptor for strigolactones (SLs). KAI2 is believed to recognize an endogenous butenolide (KAI2 ligand; KL), but the identity of this compound remains unknown. Recent studies have suggested that ligand hydrolysis by KAI2 is a prerequisite for receptor activation to induce interaction with the target proteins, similar to the situation with D14. However, direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we designed KAI2 ligands (carba-dMGers) whose butenolide rings were modified so that they cannot be hydrolyzed or dissociated from the original ligand molecule by KAI2, by structurally modifying dMGer, a potent and selective KAI2 agonist. Using these dMGer analogs, we found that the strongly bioactive ligand, (+)-dMGer, was hydrolyzed by KAI2 at a lower enzymatic rate compared with the weakly bioactive ligand, (+)-1′-carba-dMGer, and the hydrolyzed butenolide ring of (+)-dMGer was transiently trapped in the catalytic pocket of KAI2. Additionally, structural analysis revealed that (+)-6′-carba-dMGer bound to the catalytic pocket of KAI2 in the unhydrolyzed state. However, this binding did not induce the interaction between KAI2 and SMAX1, indicating that ligand binding to the receptor alone was not sufficient for KAI2 signaling. This study showed experimental data from a ligand structure–activity study that ligand hydrolysis and subsequent covalent adduct formation with the catalytic triad plays a key role in KAI2 activation, providing insight into the chemical structure of the Arabidopsis KL.",

          "abstract": "Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus, pose significant public health threats globally. Extensive efforts have led to the development of promising highly active compounds against DENV targeting viral non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) protein. However, due to the cocirculation of flaviviruses and to prepare for emerging flaviviruses, there is a need for more broadly acting antivirals. Host-directed therapy where one targets a host factor required for viral replication may be active against multiple viruses that use similar replication strategies. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 library that we designed to target the druggable genome and identified signal peptide peptidase (SPP, encoded by Histocompatibility Minor 13, HM13), as a critical host factor in DENV infection. Genetic knockout or introducing mutations that disrupt the proteolytic activity of SPP markedly reduced the replication of multiple flaviviruses. Although their substrates differ, SPP has structural homology with γ-secretase, which has been pursued as a pharmacological target for Alzheimer’s disease. Notably, SPP-targeting compounds exhibited potent anti-DENV activity at low nanomolar concentrations across multiple primary and disease-relevant cell types, acting specifically through SPP inhibition rather than γ-secretase inhibition. Importantly, SPP inhibitors were active at low nanomolar concentrations against flaviviruses other than DENV including ZIKV while DENV NS4B inhibitors lost activity. This study emphasizes the strong potential of SPP as a pan-flaviviral target and provides a framework for identifying host druggable targets to screen for broad-spectrum antivirals.",

We share a set of visualization, histogram, and profiling tools for interpreting these positions and orientations. We model the distributions based on the polarization-dependent efficiency of excitation and detection of emitted fluorescence, using coarse-grained representations we call orientation distribution functions (ODFs). We apply ODFs to create physics-informed models of image formation with spatio-angular point-spread and transfer functions. We use theory and experiment to conclude that light-sheet tilting is a necessary part of our design for recovering all three-dimensional orientations. We use our system to extend known two-dimensional results to three dimensions in FM1-43-labeled giant unilamellar vesicles, fast-scarlet-labeled cellulose in xylem cells, and phalloidin-labeled actin in U2OS cells.

          "abstract": "Chromatin architecture facilitates accurate transcription at a number of loci, but it remains unclear how much chromatin architecture is involved in global transcriptional regulation. Previous work has shown that rapid depletion of the architectural protein CTCF in cell culture alters global chromatin organization but results in surprisingly limited gene expression changes. This discrepancy has also been observed when other architectural proteins are depleted, and one possible explanation is that full transcriptional changes are masked by cellular heterogeneity. We tested this idea by performing multiomics analyses with sorted juvenile postmitotic mouse rods, which undergo synchronized development, and we identified CTCF-dependent regulation of global chromatin accessibility and gene expression. CTCF depletion leads to dysregulation of ~20% of the entire transcriptome (&gt;3,000 genes) and ~41% of genome accessibility (&gt;27,000 sites) before any prominent cellular or physiological phenotypes arise. Importantly, these changes are highly enriched for CTCF occupancy at euchromatin, suggesting direct CTCF binding and transcriptional regulation at these active loci. CTCF mainly promotes chromatin accessibility and frequently inhibits expression of these direct binding targets, which are enriched for binding motifs of transcription repressors. These findings provide different and sometimes opposite conclusions from previous studies, emphasizing the need to consider cellular heterogeneity and cell-type specificity when performing multiomics analyses. CTCF knockout rods undergo complete degeneration by adulthood, indicating an essential role for their viability. We conclude that the architectural protein CTCF binds chromatin and regulates global chromatin accessibility and transcription during rod development.",

Thereby they harbor great potential for being targeted in vaccination, autoimmunity, and cancer. Here, we use fate mapping, functional analyses, and comparative cross-species transcriptomics to show that RORγt + DCs are a conserved, functionally versatile, and transcriptionally distinct type of DCs. RORγt + DCs entail various populations described in different contexts including Janus cells/RORγt-expressing extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs), subtypes of Thetis cells, RORγt + -DC (R-DC) like cells, cDC2C and ACY3 + DCs. We show that in response to inflammatory triggers, RORγt + DCs can migrate to lymph nodes and in the spleen can activate naïve CD4 + T cells. These findings expand the functional repertoire of RORγt + DCs beyond the known role of eTACs and Thetis cells in inducing T cell tolerance to self-antigens and intestinal microbes in mice. We further show that RORγt + DCs with proinflammatory features accumulate in autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice and men. Thus, our work establishes RORγt + DCs as immune sentinel cells that exhibit a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing peripheral T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment.",

Structural variants (SVs), arising from copy-number-imbalanced and -balanced DNA rearrangements, are a major driver of tumor evolution, yet understudied posttherapy. Here, we adapted single-cell template-strand sequencing (Strand-seq) to a HER2+ breast cancer model to investigate the formation of doxorubicin-induced de novo SVs. We coupled this approach with nucleosome occupancy (NO) measurements obtained from the same single cell to enable simultaneous SV detection and cell-type classification. Using organoids from TetO-CMYC/TetO-Neu/MMTV-rtTA mice modeling HER2+ breast cancer, we generated 459 Strand-seq libraries spanning various tumorigenesis stages, identifying a 7.4-fold increase in large chromosomal alterations post-doxorubicin. Complex DNA rearrangements, deletions, and duplications were prevalent across basal, luminal progenitor (LP), and mature luminal (ML) cells, indicating uniform susceptibility of these cell types to SV formation. Doxorubicin further elevated sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), indicative of genomic stress persisting posttreatment. Altered nucleosome occupancy levels on distinct cancer-related genes further underscore the broad genomic impact of doxorubicin. The organoid-based system for single-cell multiomics established in this study paves the way for unraveling the most important therapy-associated SV mutational signatures, enabling systematic studies of the effect of therapy on cancer evolution.",

We show that this analysis allows determination of the structure of both mycobacterial ATP synthase and the supercomplex of respiratory complexes III and IV in their native membrane. The latter structure reveals that the enzyme malate:quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo) physically associates with the respiratory supercomplex, an interaction that is lost on extraction of the proteins from the lipid bilayer. Mqo catalyzes an essential reaction in the Krebs cycle, and in vivo survival of mycobacterial pathogens is compromised when its activity is absent. We show with high-speed spectroscopy that the Mqo:supercomplex interaction enables rapid electron transfer from malate to the supercomplex. Further, the respiratory supercomplex is necessary for malate-driven, but not NADH-driven, electron transport chain activity and oxygen consumption. Together, these findings indicate a connection between the Krebs cycle and aerobic respiration that directs electrons along a single branch of the mycobacterial electron transport chain.",

          "abstract": "Generation of membrane curvature is fundamental to cellular function. Recent studies have established that the glycocalyx, a sugar-rich polymer layer at the cell surface, can generate membrane curvature. While there have been some theoretical efforts to understand the interplay between the glycocalyx and membrane bending, there remain open questions about how the properties of the glycocalyx affect membrane bending. For example, the relationship between membrane curvature and the density of glycosylated proteins on its surface remains unclear. In this work, we use polymer brush theory to develop a detailed biophysical model of the energetic interactions of the glycocalyx with the membrane. Using this model, we identify the conditions under which the glycocalyx can both generate and sense curvature. Our model predicts that the extent of membrane curvature generated depends on the grafting density of the glycocalyx and the backbone length of the polymers constituting the glycocalyx. Furthermore, when coupled with the intrinsic membrane properties such as spontaneous curvature and a line tension along the membrane, the curvature generation properties of the glycocalyx are enhanced. These predictions were tested experimentally by examining the propensity of glycosylated transmembrane proteins to drive the assembly of highly curved filopodial protrusions at the plasma membrane of adherent mammalian cells. Our model also predicts that the glycocalyx has curvature-sensing capabilities, in agreement with the results of our experiments. Thus, our study develops a quantitative framework for mapping the properties of the glycocalyx to the curvature generation capability of the membrane.",

          "abstract": "Natural selection often acts on multiple traits simultaneously. For example, the virus HIV-1 faces pressure to evade host immunity while also preserving replicative fitness. While past work has studied selection during HIV-1 evolution, as in other examples where selection acts on multiple traits, it is challenging to quantitatively separate different contributions to fitness. This task is made more difficult because a single mutation can affect both immune escape and replication. Here, we develop an evolutionary model that disentangles the effects of escaping CD8 + T cell–mediated immunity, which we model as a binary trait, from other contributions to fitness. After validation in simulations, we applied this model to study within-host HIV-1 evolution in a clinical dataset. We observed strong selection for immune escape, sometimes greatly exceeding past estimates, especially early in infection. Conservative estimates suggest that roughly half of HIV-1 fitness gains during the first months to years of infection can be attributed to T cell escape. Our approach is not limited to HIV-1 or viruses and could be adapted to study the evolution of quantitative traits in other contexts.",

Impaired trafficking to the plasma membrane was the most common cause of LOF across all channel domains, often but not always coinciding with protein instability. However, many LOF variants, particularly in transmembrane domains, trafficked normally, but when coexpressed with KCNE1 exhibited impaired conductance, altered voltage dependence, or abnormal gating kinetics, highlighting diverse pathogenic mechanisms.

However, the evolutionary origins of HPQs remain unresolved. Here, we characterize the structure and biosynthetic pathway of an ancestral HPQ, methyl-plastoquinone (mPQ), that is unique to bacteria of the phylum Nitrospirota . mPQ is structurally related to the two previously known HPQs, plastoquinone from Cyanobacteriota /chloroplasts and ubiquinone from Pseudomonadota /mitochondria, respectively. We demonstrate a common origin of the three HPQ biosynthetic pathways that predates the emergence of Nitrospirota , Cyanobacteriota , and Pseudomonadota . An ancestral HPQ biosynthetic pathway evolved ≥ 3.4 billion years ago in an extinct lineage and was laterally transferred to these three phyla ~2.5 to 3.2 billion years ago. We show that Cyanobacteriota and Pseudomonadota were ancestrally aerobic and thus propose that aerobic metabolism using HPQs significantly predates Earth’s surface oxygenation. Two of the three HPQ pathways were later obtained by eukaryotes through endosymbiosis forming chloroplasts and mitochondria, enabling their rise to dominance in modern oxic ecosystems.",

Our understanding of Enterobacter virulence is limited, hindering the development of new prophylactics and therapeutics targeting infections caused by Enterobacter species. In this study, we assessed the virulence of contemporary clinical Enterobacter hormaechei isolates in a mouse model of intraperitoneal infection and used comparative genomics to identify genes promoting virulence. Through mutagenesis and complementation studies, we found two porin-encoding genes, ompC and ompD , to be required for E. hormaechei virulence. These porins imported clinically relevant carbapenems into the bacteria, and thus loss of OmpC and OmpD desensitized E. hormaechei to the antibiotics. Our genomic analyses suggest porin-related genes are frequently mutated in E. hormaechei , perhaps due to the selective pressure of antibiotic therapy during infection. Despite the importance of OmpC and OmpD during infection of immunocompetent hosts, we found the two porins to be dispensable for virulence in a neutropenic mouse model. Moreover, porin loss provided a fitness advantage during carbapenem treatment in an ex vivo human whole blood model of bacteremia. Our data provide experimental evidence of pathogenic Enterobacter species gaining antibiotic resistance via loss of porins and argue antibiotic therapy during infection of immunocompromised patients is a conducive environment for the selection of porin mutations enhancing the multidrug-resistant profile of these pathogens.",

The gelation dynamics and adhesive properties can be systematically tuned by varying the hydrogel composition, polymer architecture, and thiol availability, with gelation timescales adjustable from seconds to hours, and values of elastic modulus, failure stress, and debonding work spanning orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the functionality of these gels in two applications: as tissue adhesives, using porcine skin as a proxy for human skin, and as bioactive surface coatings to prevent bacterial colonization.

          "abstract": "Bone calcification is essential for vertebrate life. The mechanism by which mineral ions are transported into collagen fibrils to induce intrafibrillar mineral formation requires a calcium binding biopolymer that also has highly selective binding to the collagen fibril hole zones where intrafibrillar calcification begins, over other bone extracellular matrix components. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) has been shown to be a candidate biopolymer for this process and we show here that PAR has high affinity, highly conserved binding sites in the collagen type I C-terminal telopeptides. The identification of these PAR–collagen binding sites gives insights into the chemical mechanisms underlying bone calcification and possible mechanisms behind pathologies where there is dysfunctional bone calcification.",

          "abstract": "Viral proteins frequently mutate to evade host innate immune responses, yet the impact of these mutations on the molecular energy landscape remains unclear. Epistasis, the intramolecular communications between mutations, often renders the combined mutational effects unpredictable. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a major virulence factor of the influenza A virus (IAV) that activates host PI3K by binding to its p85β subunit. Here, we present a deep analysis of the impact of evolutionary mutations in NS1 that emerged between the 1918 pandemic IAV strain and its descendant PR8 strain. Our analysis reveals how the mutations rewired interresidue communications, which underlie long-range allosteric and epistatic networks in NS1. Our findings show that PR8 NS1 binds to p85β with approximately 10-fold greater affinity than 1918 NS1 due to allosteric mutational effects, which are further tuned by epistasis. NMR chemical shift perturbation and methyl-axis order parameter analyses revealed that the mutations induced long-range structural and dynamic changes in PR8 NS1, relative to 1918 NS1, enhancing its affinity to p85β. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations and graph theory-based network analysis for conformational dynamics on the submicrosecond timescales uncover how these mutations rewire the dynamic network, which underlies the allosteric epistasis. Significantly, we find that conformational dynamics of residues with high betweenness centrality play a crucial role in communications between network communities and are highly conserved across influenza A virus evolution. These findings advance our mechanistic understanding of the allosteric and epistatic communications between distant residues and provide insight into their role in the molecular evolution of NS1.",

          "abstract": "Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are sets of often heterologous genes that are genetically and functionally linked. Among eukaryotes, BGCs are most common in plants and fungi and ensure the coexpression of the different enzymes coordinating the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites. Here, we report the identification of a withanolide BGC in Physalis grisea (ground-cherry), a member of the nightshade family ( Solanaceae ). A combination of transcriptomic, epigenomic, and metabolic analyses revealed that, following a duplication event, this BGC evolved two tissue-specifically expressed subclusters, containing several pairs of paralogs that contribute to related but distinct biochemical processes; this subfunctionalization is tightly associated with epigenetic features and the local chromatin environment. The two subclusters appear strictly isolated from each other at the structural chromatin level, each forming a highly self-interacting chromatin domain with tissue-dependent levels of condensation. This correlates with gene expression in either above- or below-ground tissue, thus spatially separating the production of different withanolide compounds. By comparative phylogenomics, we show that the withanolide BGC most likely evolved before the diversification of the Solanaceae family and underwent lineage-specific diversifications and losses. The tissue-specific subfunctionalization is common to species of the Physalideae tribe but distinct from other, independent duplication events outside of this clade. In sum, our study reports on an instance of an epigenetically modulated subfunctionalization within a BGC and sheds light on the biosynthesis of withanolides, a highly diverse group of steroidal triterpenoids important in plant defense and amenable to pharmaceutical applications due to their anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, and anticancer properties.",

          "abstract": "Successful tuberculosis therapy requires treatment with an unwieldy multidrug combination for several months. Thus, there is a growing need to identify novel genetic vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to develop new, more effective antitubercular drugs. Consequently, recent efforts to optimize tuberculosis (TB) therapy have exploited Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) chemical genetics to identify pathways influencing antibiotic efficacy, novel mechanisms of antibiotic action, and new targets for TB drug discovery. However, the influence of the complex host environment on these interactions remains largely unknown, leaving the therapeutic potential of the identified targets unclear. In this study, we leveraged a library of conditional mutants targeting 467 essential Mtb genes to characterize the chemical–genetic interactions (CGIs) with TB drugs directly in the mouse infection model. We found that these in vivo CGIs differ significantly from those identified in vitro. Both drug-specific and drug-agnostic effects were identified, and many were preserved during treatment with a multidrug combination, suggesting numerous strategies for enhancing therapy. This work also elucidated the complex effects of pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that relies on aspects of the infection environment for efficacy. Specifically, our work supports the importance of coenzyme A synthesis- inhibition during infection, as well as the antagonistic effect of iron limitation on PZA activity. In addition, we found that inhibition of thiamine and purine synthesis increases PZA efficacy, suggesting additional therapeutically exploitable metabolic dependencies. Our findings present a map of the unique in vivo CGIs, characterizing the mechanism of PZA activity in vivo and identifying potential targets for TB drug development.",

However, observed increases in algal biomass do not consistently correlate with air temperature or precipitation, and evidence is lacking for a causal effect of climate or the nonlinear dynamics needed to demonstrate regime shifts. We modeled the causal effects of climate on annual lake chlorophyll (a measure of algal biomass) over 34 y for 24,452 lakes across broad ecoclimatic zones of the United States and evaluated the potential for regime shifts. We found that algal biomass was causally related to climate in 34% of lakes. In these cases, 71% exhibited abrupt but mostly temporary shifts as opposed to persistent changes, 13% had the potential for regime shifts. Climate was causally related to algal biomass in lakes experiencing all levels of human disturbance, but with different likelihood. Climate causality was most likely to be observed in lakes with minimal human disturbance and cooler summer temperatures that have increased over the 34 y studied. Climate causality was variable in lakes with low to moderate human disturbance, and least likely in lakes with high human disturbance, which may mask climate causality. Our results explain some of the previously observed heterogeneous climate responses of lake algal biomass globally and they can be used to predict future climate effects on lakes.",

This study allows a rigorous determination of the electronic structure of a nonheme Fe IV =O center and its comparison to an Fe IV =O heme site using 1s2p resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and Fe L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Further, variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VT-MCD) of the ligand field transitions, combined with nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy of the two S=1 Fe IV =O systems show that the equatorial ligand field decreases from a nonheme to a heme Fe IV =O site. Alternatively, RIXS and Fe L-edge XAS combined with MCD show that the Fe d π orbitals are unperturbed in the Fe IV =O heme relative to the nonheme site because the strong axial Fe-O bond uncouples the Fe d π orbitals from the porphyrin π -system. As a consequence, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the H-atom abstraction reactions are actually very similar for heme compound II and nonheme Fe IV =O active sites.",

          "abstract": "A key limitation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapy is their reduced efficacy toward cancers with a low tumor mutational burden (TMB). Since low-TMB tumors express fewer neoantigens, they are less responsive to ICI therapy like anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. In preclinical immunocompetent mouse models of low-TMB melanoma, we recently demonstrated that exposure to 6-thioguanine (6TG) significantly improved tumor control by increasing TMB and creating a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment. The combination of 6TG with anti-PD-1 further improved tumor control, although it did not fully inhibit tumor growth. We here investigated additional ICI combinations, assessing anti-CTLA-4 with anti-PD-1 to improve efficacy. ICI eliminated tumors in 6TG-exposed mice when ICI treatment was initiated at tumor volumes of 20 mm 3 , stopped tumor growth at volumes of 120 mm 3 , and had no effect at volumes of 300 mm 3 . Finally, we showed that mice achieving complete tumor regression with 6TG and ICI treatment exhibited lasting immune memory, which effectively suppressed tumor growth at relapse upon re-exposure to tumor cells. These findings may pave the way to effective application of ICI to low-TMB cancers, when initiated at low tumor volume.",

          "abstract": "Larger, longer-lived species are expected to have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller, shorter-lived species owing to the greater number of cell divisions that occur during their lifespan. Yet, to date, no evidence has been found to support this expectation, and no association has been found between cancer prevalence and body size across species—a phenomenon known as Peto’s paradox. Specifically, while anticancer mechanisms have been identified for individual species, wider phylogenetic evidence has remained elusive. Here, we show that there is no evidence for Peto’s paradox across amphibians, birds, mammals, and squamate reptiles: Larger species do in fact have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller species. Moreover, we demonstrate that the accumulation of repeated instances of accelerated body size evolution in mammals and birds is associated with a reduction in the prevalence of neoplasia and malignancy, suggesting that increased rates of body size evolution are associated with the evolution of improved cellular growth control. These results represent empirical evidence showing that larger body size is related to higher cancer prevalence, thus rejecting Peto’s paradox, and demonstrating the importance of heterogenous routes of body size evolution in shaping anticancer defenses.",

          "abstract": "Dark-field microscopy is a technique used in optical microscopy to increase the contrast in unstained samples, making it possible to observe details that would otherwise be difficult to see under bright-field microscopy; thus, it has been widely employed in biological research, material science, and medical diagnostics. However, most dark-field microscopy methods cannot overcome the optical diffraction limit and require a bulky dark-field condenser and precise alignment of each optical element. In this study, we introduce a planar photonic device that can produce random speckles for dark-field illumination and improve the optical resolution. This planar device is made of random distribution fibers for injection of a laser beam, a scattering layer to produce random speckles, a one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPC) to produce a hollow cone of light, and a metallic film to increase the energy efficiency. This planar device can work as a substrate for conventional microscopy. Taking advantage of the hollow cone of light with random speckles generated by the proposed planar device, we achieve a high-contrast, label-free image with a 1.55-fold improvement in spatial resolution. Furthermore, random evanescent speckles can be generated on the 1DPC just through tuning the incident wavelength, which demonstrates the ability for optical surface imaging beyond the diffraction limit. The advantage of this technique is that it does not require complex optical system or precise knowledge of the illumination pattern. This study will expand the potential applications of dark-field microscopy and provide insights into samples that might otherwise be invisible under traditional dark-field microscopy.",

          "abstract": "The cGAS–STING pathway mediates innate immune responses to cytosolic DNA. In addition to its well-established role in inducing inflammatory cytokines, activation of the cGAS–STING pathway also induces noncanonical autophagy, a process involving the conjugation of the ATG8 family of ubiquitin-like proteins to membranes of the endolysosomal system. The mechanisms and functions of STING-induced autophagy remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that STING activation induced formation of pH-elevated Golgi-derived vesicles that led to ATG16L1 and V-ATPase-dependent noncanonical autophagy. We showed that STING-induced noncanonical autophagy resulted in activation of the MiT/TFE family of transcription factors (TFEB, TFE3, and MITF), which regulate lysosome biogenesis. We found that lipidation of the ATG8 proteins, particularly GABARAPs, inhibited phosphorylation of MiT/TFE transcription factors by mTORC1. The lipidated GABARAPs bound to the Folliculin-interacting proteins (FNIPs), thereby sequestering the FNIP-folliculin protein complexes from activating mTORC1, resulting in dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of MiT/TFE transcription factors. Furthermore, we found that STING-induced autophagy activated Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease, through GABARAPs lipidation. We further showed that STING-induced autophagy induced ALIX-mediated ESCRT machinery recruitment to mitigate endolysosomal perturbation. These results reveal the multifaceted functions of STING-induced noncanonical autophagy in regulating endolysosomal homeostasis.",

Moreover, the steroid hormone ecdysone, which is mainly synthesized in the female ovary during sexual maturation, acts on LK neurons via the ecdysone receptor to suppress sexual receptivity. We further found that LK suppresses female receptivity through its receptor LKR in central pC1 neurons, a decision center for female sexual behavior.

To understand the geometrical and topological complexity of the packings, we first deploy X-ray computerized tomography to unveil the structure of the packing. This allows us to directly visualize the spatial variations in density, orientational order, and the entanglement, a mesoscopic field that we define in terms of a local average crossing number, a measure of the topological complexity of the packing. We find that increasing the aspect ratio of the constituent rods in a packing leads to a proliferation of regions of strong entanglement that eventually percolate through the system and correlated with a sharp transition in the mechanical stability of the packing. To corroborate our experimental findings, we use numerical simulations of contacting elastic rods and characterize their stability to static and dynamic loadings. Our experiments and computations lead us to an entanglement phase diagram which we also populate using published experimental data from pneumatically tangled filaments, worm blobs, and bird nests along with additional numerical simulations using these datasets. Together, these show the regimes associated with mechanically stable entanglement as a function of the statistics of the packings and loading, with lessons for a range of systems from reconfigurable architectures and textiles to active morphable filamentous assemblies.",

The consistent dip inclinations, absence of dissection by fluvial channels along the extended traverse, and low permittivity of the sediments are consistent with terrestrial coastal deposits—and discount fluvial, aeolian, or magmatic origins favored elsewhere on Mars. The structure, thickness, and length of the section support voluminous supply of onshore sediments into a large body of water, rather than a merely localized and short-lived melt event.

In contrast, more abstract behavioral variables that are independent of stimulus selection, such as stimulus–response mapping, are thought to be encoded by neurons outside of sensory cortex. We show that information about such mapping is robustly encoded in the responses of neurons in primate visual cortex. Monkeys were trained to alternate between two tasks that differed in the rule governing the mapping of a remembered visual cue onto an eye movement response. During the memory-delay period, neurons in area V4 reliably signaled the remembered cue location in both tasks. However, the encoding of cue location depended critically on the stimulus–response mapping rule. Thus, V4 delay activity encoded the mapping rule and signaled the preparation of the appropriate motor response rather than spatial working memory per se, contrary to previous assumptions. In addition, we probed the origins of motor-related delay activity and found that it was reduced during local inactivation of the frontal eye field (FEF). The results demonstrate that behavioral modulation of visual cortical activity is not solely related to the selection of sensory stimuli but instead reflects a distinct mechanism for sensory-guided motor output.",

Furthermore, despite the rich 5th to 6th centuries current era (CE) archaeological record of the Carpathian Basin, the cultural elements of connections with the steppe are limited to few findings and even fewer solitary eastern-type burials. In this study, we coanalyze archaeological evidence with 35 newly sequenced and published genomic data for a total of 370 individuals—from 5th to 6th century CE contexts in the Carpathian Basin including 10 Hun-period eastern-type burials, 2nd to 5th century sites across Central Asia and 2nd c. before current era (BCE) to 1st c. CE Xiongnu period sites across the Mongolian steppe. We find no evidence for the presence of a large eastern/steppe descent community among the Hun- and post-Hun-period Carpathian Basin population. We also observe a high genetic diversity among the eastern-type burials that recapitulates the variability observed across the Eurasian Steppe. This suggests a mixed origin of the incoming steppe conquerors. Nevertheless, long-shared genomic tracts provide compelling evidence of genetic lineages directly connecting some individuals of the highest Xiongnu-period elite with 5th to 6th century CE Carpathian Basin individuals, showing that some European Huns descended from them.",

          "abstract": "The escalating demand for rare earth elements (REEs) highlights the necessity for their sustainable recovery from waste streams and secondary resources. However, this process requires materials with exceptional selectivity and capacity for REEs due to their low concentration and high presence of interfering ions. Herein, we synthesized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and subsequently modified it with tributyl phosphate (TBP) to enhance its affinity and selectivity for the recovery of REEs. The distribution coefficients ( K d ) of ZIF-8-TBP for REEs (neodymium, Nd, and dysprosium, Dy) were orders of magnitude higher than the K d of main interfering ions (e.g., Mg, Ni Al, and Fe). Particularly, the maximum sorption capacities ( q m ) for Nd and Dy were 475 and 529 mg g −1 , respectively. In addition, the separation factor between Dy (a representative of heavy REE) and Nd (a representative of light REE) reached 24, greatly exceeding the figures reported previously. Importantly, the outstanding ability of ZIF-8-TBP for selective separation and recovery of REEs was demonstrated via its application to real samples including mining wastewater, and leaching solutions from REE filter cakes and discarded NdFeB magnets. Multiscale simulations reveal that ZIF-8-TBP possessed a stronger binding strength and greater sorption energy for REE ions. These results indicate that ZIF-8-TBP could effectively harvest REEs from wastes and offers an efficient alternative for industrial applications in REE recovery.",

          "abstract": "Humans often take actions to assist others experiencing unresponsiveness, such as transient loss of consciousness. How other animals react to unresponsive conspecifics—and the neural mechanisms driving such behaviors—remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that mice exhibit rescue-like social behaviors toward unresponsive conspecifics, characterized by intense physical contact and grooming directed at the recipient’s facial and mouth areas, which expedite their recovery from unresponsiveness. We identified the medial amygdala (MeA) as a key region that encodes the unresponsive state of others and drives this head-directed physical contact. Notably, the behavioral responses toward unresponsive conspecifics differed from those directed at awake, stressed individuals, and these responses were differentially represented in the MeA. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying prosocial responses toward unresponsive individuals.",

At the same time, quantum computing likely will not supplant classical computing in the foreseeable future—after all, quantum computing architectures are best equipped to solve certain problems, but not every problem. Quantum computers almost certainly will work in concert with classical processing, where each computing architecture will handle those parts of a calculation that it is best suited to tackle. For that to happen, the quantum computing hardware will require software that combines quantum with classical computing. It also must be devised in a user-friendly way so that nonquantum scientists and software developers working on problems such as modeling molecules with unprecedented accuracy and calculating interesting properties of structured datasets can run quantum computational tasks without having in-depth knowledge of quantum computing.",

We report that mice exhibit stereotypic behaviors toward unconscious or dead social partners, which escalate from sniffing and grooming to more forceful actions such as mouth or tongue biting and tongue pulling. The latter intense actions, more prominent in familiar pairs, begin after prolonged immobility and unresponsiveness and cease when the partner regains activity. Their consequences, including improved airway opening and clearance and accelerated recovery from unconsciousness, suggest rescue-like efforts. Oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus respond differentially to the presence of unconscious versus active partners, and their activation, along with oxytocin signaling, is required for the reviving-like actions. This tendency to assist unresponsive members may enhance group cohesion and survival of social species.",

While cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. Here, we reveal a bacterial anti-phage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine 5′-triphosphate (dITP) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates downstream effector to mediate cellular NAD + depletion, resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular dAMP, the precursor of dITP messengers. Our findings uncover a nucleobase modification-based anti-phage signaling pathway, establishing noncanonical nucleotides as a new type of immune messengers in bacteria.",

Promoters such as cesium, rhenium, and molybdenum each add a few percent of selectivity enhancements to achieve 90% overall, but their codependence on Cl makes optimizing and understanding their function complex. We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O 2 ) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O 2 on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity.",

Using high-speed x-ray imaging, we demonstrate that the flow vortex–induced protrusion on the rear keyhole wall is crucial in initiating keyhole instability. Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect–induced Lorentz force’s direction. We show that at LPBF length scales, electromagnetic damping is weak, and for alloys with a large Seebeck coefficient, TEMHD becomes the dominant mechanism controlling flow behind the keyhole.",

We achieve this in a material-like robotic collective by modulating the interunit tangential forces to control topological rearrangements of units within a tightly packed structure. This allows local control of rigidity transitions between solid and fluid-like states in the collective and enables spatiotemporal control of shape and strength. We demonstrate structure-forming and healing and show the collective supporting 700 newtons (500 times the weight of a robot) before “melting” under its own weight.",

The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change.

Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, the ice quake cascades appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity.

          "abstract": "Prokaryotes have evolved diverse defense strategies against viral infection, including foreign nucleic acid degradation by CRISPR-Cas systems and DNA and RNA synthesis inhibition through nucleotide pool depletion. Here, we report an antiviral mechanism of type III CRISPR-Cas–regulated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion in which ATP is converted into inosine triphosphate (ITP) by CRISPR-Cas–associated adenosine deaminase (CAAD) upon activation by either cA 4 or cA 6 , followed by hydrolysis into inosine monophosphate (IMP) by Nudix hydrolase, ultimately resulting in cell growth arrest. The cryo–electron microscopy structures of CAAD in its apo and activated forms, together with biochemical evidence, revealed how cA 4 or cA 6 binds to the CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domain and abrogates CAAD autoinhibition, inducing substantial conformational changes that reshape the structure of CAAD and induce its deaminase activity. Our results reveal the mechanism of a CRISPR-Cas–regulated ATP depletion antiviral strategy.",

HARMONI operates at subsecond resolution, estimating 3D mesh representations and spatial interactions of humans, and adapts to challenging natural environments using an environment-targeted synthetic data generation module. Deployed on 500 hours from the SEEDLingS dataset, HARMONI generates detailed quantitative measurements of 3D human behavior previously unattainable through manual efforts or 2D methods. HARMONI identifies longitudinal trends in child-caregiver interaction, including child movement, body pose, dyadic touch, visibility, and conversational turns. The integrated visual and audio analysis further reveals multimodal trends, including associations between child conversational turns and movement. Open-sourced for large-scale analysis, HARMONI facilitates advancements in human development research. HARMONI achieves 63 to 80% consistency on key attributes with human annotators on SEEDLingS and 84 to 93% consistency on videos taken from a laboratory setting while achieving &gt;100 times savings in time.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are emerging as a promising platform for epitaxial growth, largely free from the constraints of lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficient mismatches. Among them, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), known for their superior electrical properties, are ideal for ultrathin semiconductor applications. Their unique epitaxial characteristics enable seamless integration with 3D materials, facilitating the development of gate stacks and heterojunction devices. In this regard, developing a process for growing high-quality 3D epitaxial materials before and after the growth of 2D TMDs and understanding the 2D/3D interface are crucial. This study demonstrates the sequential growth of fully epitaxial ZnSe/MoSe 2 /ZnSe heterostructures using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. ZnSe and MoSe 2 , sharing chalcogen elements, enable large-area quasi van der Waals epitaxy with sharp interfaces without intermediate phase. Multiscale analysis involving transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals lattice commensurability, van der Waals gaps, termination, and interfacial reconstruction. Understanding these interactions is crucial for advancing multidimensional integration of 2D and 3D materials.",

In a liquid crystal (LC), the topological nature of disclination lines and colloids induces chiral colloidal entanglements. How the chirality of the entanglements is deterministically created and how the chirality conversion is actuated in the disclinations with Möbius strip topology have never been explored. Here, we create colloidal entanglements with designed chirality in the nematic disclination loops with Möbius topology. An irreversible process of chirality change is revealed if we move the colloidal entanglement along the loops. A nonreciprocal chirality conversion in the dynamical colloidal entanglements is demonstrated, which is induced by the interplay between topological profiles and the geometrical curvature of the disclination loop. Colloidal entanglements in opposite chirality are templated in arbitrary shapes of disclination lines. This work opens opportunities to design smart colloidal materials.",

          "abstract": "Marine photoautotrophs have evolved to exploit the ocean’s variable light conditions, with chromatic acclimators being able to adjust their pigment content to better match the ambient light color. The impact of chromatic acclimation on phytoplankton distribution and competition is not well understood despite its global importance. This study explores chromatic acclimation’s role in shaping the biogeography of Synechococcus , a widespread cyanobacterium. We integrated three pigment types into a global ecosystem model: a green-light specialist, a blue-light specialist, and a chromatic acclimator. Laboratory studies defined each type’s specific absorption properties. Our results indicate that chromatic acclimation offers an evolutionary advantage by enabling Synechococcus to adapt to varying light environments. This ability to mimic blue- and green-light specialists and enhance absorption at intermediate states, particularly in areas with high seasonal light variations, increases Synechococcus distribution and biomass. Thus, chromatic acclimation affects ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical processes in the ocean.",

          "abstract": "Most wounds form scars without hair follicles. However, in the wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN) model of skin regeneration, wounds regenerate hair follicles if tissue rigidity is optimal. Although WIHN depends on Wnt signaling, whether Wnt performs a mechanoregulatory role that contributes to regeneration remains uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that Wnt signaling affects mechanosensitivity at both cellular and tissue levels to drive WIHN. Atomic force microscopy revealed an attenuated substrate rigidity response in epidermal but not dermal cells of healing wounds. Super-resolution microscopy and nanoneedle probing of intracellular compartments in live human keratinocytes revealed that Wnt-induced chromatin remodeling triggers a 10-fold drop in nuclear rigidity without jeopardizing the nucleocytoskeletal mechanical coupling. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling orchestrated a massive reorganization of actin architecture and recruited adherens junctions to generate a mechanical syncytium—a cohesive contractile unit with superior capacity for force coordination and collective durotaxis. Collectively, our findings unveil Wnt signaling’s mechanoregulatory role that manipulates the machinery of mechanotransduction to drive regeneration.",

          "abstract": "Internal tides profoundly influence diapycnal mixing and marine ecosystems in oceans worldwide. Previous estimates on internal tides focused regionally spanning a decade, leaving a knowledge gap regarding their long-term global behavior, especially over centuries. Because of limited long-term observations, a critical question arises: How will global warming affect internal tides? Using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the High-Resolution Empirical Tidal (HRET) model, we identify a robust accelerating trend in globally averaged internal tide speeds. This trend, increasing from historical rates (0.4 centimeters per second per decade) to future projections (2.0 centimeters per second per decade), is primarily driven by intensified upper-ocean stratification, with background currents playing a secondary role. Our findings suggest that internal tides propagate faster in a warming climate, potentially influencing energy cascade and marine biological productivity.",

Herein, we theoretically propose a form of electromagnetic toroidal vortex solutions that uniquely integrates both scalar and vector characteristics, challenging the prevailing notion of their mutual exclusivity. We also present an experimental generation of hybrid toroidal vortex pulses by a compact coaxial horn emitter augmented with a radial metasurface. These topological pulses exhibit peculiar electromagnetic features, such as vortex streets, skyrmions, and transverse orbital angular momentum, and may present advantages when propagating through perturbations, opening avenues for enhanced free-space information transmission, topologically nontrivial light-matter interaction, and microscopy techniques.",

Yet, plasticity rules operating on one-shot episodic memory timescales rarely depend on both pre- and postsynaptic spiking, challenging Hebbian theory in this crucial regime. Here, we present an episodic memory model governed by a simpler rule depending only on presynaptic activity. We show that this rule, capitalizing on high-dimensional neural activity with restricted transitions, naturally stores episodes as paths through complex state spaces like those underlying a world model. The resulting memory traces, which we term path vectors, are highly expressive and decodable with an odor-tracking algorithm. We show that path vectors are robust alternatives to Hebbian traces, support one-shot sequential and associative recall, along with policy learning, and shed light on specific hippocampal plasticity rules. Thus, non-Hebbian plasticity is sufficient for flexible memory and learning and well-suited to encode episodes and policies as paths through a world model.",

          "abstract": "Osteoporosis and bone injury healing in elderly patients are major medical challenges, often exacerbated by the accumulation of senescent cells. Herein, we show that TPE-Gal, which contains a tetraphenylethene unit and a galactose moiety, offers a promising molecular therapy designed to light up and eliminate senescent cells through a hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by β-galactosidase, an enzyme overexpressed in senescent cells. The reaction produces TPE-OH, which, in turn, increases reactive oxygen species levels within the senescent cells, leading to noninflammatory apoptosis of senescent cells. This targeted clearance mechanism helps to alleviate osteoporosis symptoms and promotes bone injury healing. Moreover, apoptotic vesicles, which are generated during the process, are partly phagocytosed by macrophages, mimicking physiological metabolic processes.

          "abstract": "Coherent evolution is punctuated by dynamical processes such as chemical exchange, conformational transformation, or site hopping in many important problems ranging from biomolecular function to ion trap quantum computation. One well-explored example is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, where experimental development is grounded in decades-old theory, but structural dynamics are not easily integrated into this picture. Here, we introduce an approach that selectively excites NMR resonances that undergo chemical exchange while suppressing the signal arising from nondynamic components of the system. We show that for exchange rates spanning more than four orders of magnitude, one can still selectively excite spins undergoing exchange while suppressing static resonances. Generalizing this approach, to selectively excite (or selectively preserve) only members of an ensemble that have undergone exchange or rearrangement, has the potential to improve the analytical power of many spectroscopic techniques.",

          "abstract": "In the process of DNA replication, the first steps in restoring the chromatin landscape involve parental histone recycling and new histone deposition. Disrupting histone recycling to either the leading or lagging strand induces asymmetric histone inheritance, affecting epigenome maintenance and cellular identity. However, the order and kinetics of these effects remain elusive. Here, we use inducible mutants to dissect the early and late consequences of impaired histone recycling. Simultaneous disruption of both leading (POLE4) and lagging strand (MCM2-2A) recycling pathways impairs the transmission of parental histones to newly synthesized DNA, releasing some parental histones to the soluble pool. Subsequently, H3K27me3 accumulates aberrantly during chromatin restoration in a manner preceding gene expression changes. Loss of histone inheritance and the ensuing chromatin restoration defects alter gene expression in embryonic stem cells and challenge differentiation programs and cell viability. Our findings demonstrate the importance of efficient transmission of histone-based information during DNA replication for maintaining chromatin landscapes, differentiation potential, and cellular viability.",

These activated APCs effectively initiate the TLS de novo neogenesis by acting as lymphoid tissue inducer cells that secrete lymphotoxin α and tumor necrosis factor α while normalizing the intratumoral vasculatures. In addition, they induce robust in situ adaptive immune responses by presenting the antigens released from the M1 cell–destroyed tumors and transporting them to the nearby TLS. Therefore, the development of tumors in mice, especially immune-cold tumors, was efficiently prevented, providing a promising strategy for promoting cancer immunotherapy.",

A promising mechanism for large-scale natural H 2 generation is serpentinization of exhumed mantle material. We study this serpentinization-related H 2 generation during rifting and subsequent rift-inversion orogen development using numerical geodynamic models. Serpentinization-related H 2 generation is best known from rifted margins and spreading ridges. However, because orogens are colder than rift environments, conditions for serpentinization and natural H 2 generation are considerably better in orogenic settings: We find that yearly H 2 generation capacity from serpentinization in the overriding mantle wedge during rift inversion may be up to 20 times larger than during rifting. Moreover, suitable reservoirs and seals required for economic H 2 accumulations to form are readily available in rift-inversion orogens but are likely absent during bulk serpentinization in rift settings. Together with indications of ongoing natural H 2 generation in the Balkans and Pyrenees, our model results provide a first-order motivation for natural H 2 exploration in rift-inversion orogens.",

Here, we report that during oxidative stress, TDP-43 becomes SUMO2/3-ylated by the SUMO E3 ligase protein PIAS4 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4) and enriches in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). Upon pharmacological inhibition of TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation or PIAS4 depletion, TDP-43 enrichment in SGs is accompanied by irreversible aggregation. In cells that are unable to assemble SGs, SUMO2/3-ylation of TDP-43 is strongly impaired, supporting the notion that SGs are compartments that promote TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation during oxidative stress. Binding of TDP-43 to UG-rich RNA antagonizes PIAS4-mediated SUMO2/3-ylation, while RNA dissociation promotes TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation. We conclude that SUMO2/3 protein conjugation is a cellular mechanism to stabilize cytosolic RNA-free TDP-43 against aggregation.",

Owing to the high Li affinity of Sn single atoms, Sn/CS@SC can promote storage of quasi-metallic Li within the inner void space other than direct plating of metallic Li on the outer surface. Moreover, the subnanopores with a strong spatial confinement effect can prevent the penetration of ester electrolyte for reduced side reactions.

We find that the nuclear lamina proteins of the CRWN family are degraded in an SCF RMF -dependent manner in this process.

Here, we report a nitrene-mediated glycosylation strategy using regular aryl sulfide glycosyl donors and easily accessible 3-methyl dioxazolone as an activator under the catalysis of iron or ruthenium. The iron-catalyzed system demonstrates exceptional catalytic reactivity, requiring as little as 0.1 mole % of catalyst at room temperature, and works well for complex peptide substrates. The ruthenium-catalyzed system can accommodate acid-sensitive functional groups and challenging low-reactivity acceptors.

We show that large closed-basin lakes can combine high P concentrations at steady state with extremely high rates of biological productivity. Our case study is Mono Lake in California, which has close to 1 millimolar dissolved P at steady state despite extremely high rates of biological productivity, in contrast to smaller closed basins where life is scarce. Hence, large closed-basin lakes offer an environment where high rates of prebiotic P productivity can plausibly coexist with high steady-state P concentrations. Such lakes should have readily formed on the heavily cratered and volcanically active surface of early Earth.",

However, the mechanisms enabling heterotrophic diazotrophs to thrive in cold high-latitude waters and their contribution to the global nitrogen budget are unknown. Using a data-driven cell-based metabolic model, we show that heterotrophic bacteria inside sinking particles can fix N 2 over a wide range of temperatures, explaining their ubiquitous presence in the oceans. We estimate that heterotrophic diazotrophs account for about 10% of global marine N 2 fixation, with the highest contribution in oxygen minimum zones. These findings call for a reassessment of the N 2 fixation patterns and the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in the global ocean.",

In-depth functional studies in vitro and in vivo further reveal that specific ncUCEs can be enhancers of tumor suppressors (such as ARID1B) and silencers of oncogenic proteins (such as RPS13). Moreover, several miRNAs located in ncUCEs are recurrently mutated. Mutations in miR-142 locus can affect the Drosha-mediated processing of precursor miRNAs, resulting in the down-regulation of the mature transcript.

Here, we unveil a single-protein mechanism for ionic strength sensing and mitigation in animal cells, one that is notably different from the analogous high osmolarity glycerol kinase cascade in yeast. The Rel family transcription factor NFAT5 directly senses intracellular ionic strength using a C-terminal prion-like domain (PLD). In response to elevated intracellular ionic strength, this PLD is necessary and sufficient to coordinate an adaptive gene expression program by recruiting the transcriptional coactivator BRD4. The purified NFAT5 PLD forms condensates in response to elevated solution ionic strength in vitro, and human NFAT5 alone is sufficient to reconstitute a mammalian transcriptional response to ionic stress in yeast.

Moreover, the ethylene-inducible transcription factors NON-RIPENING, RIPENING INHIBITOR, and FRUITFULL1 coordinately regulate the expression of GAME31 , GAME40 , GAME5 , and the glycoalkaloid transporter gene GORKY , whereas jasmonic acid–induced MYC2 modulates the transcription of GAME36 .

By analyzing satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis, here we show that near-surface weather only partially captures wildfire occurrence and intensity across the daily to seasonal timescales. Beyond near-surface weather, convection and fuel abundance play a complementary role in regulating burning processes. Specifically, enhanced atmospheric convection is identified for over 40% of the low-human-impact regions and 61% of global burnable areas during wildfire ignition and spreading periods. Meanwhile, 56% of shrublands and 54% of grasslands see higher fuel load with actual occurrence of fire.

The crucial role of acetone in accelerating methanol direct dehydration to DME is highlighted as the obvious destabilization effect for the adsorbed methanol cluster with strong hydrogen bonds and the subsequent traction of water during DME formation.

          "abstract": "Data-driven models widely used for assessing landslide susceptibility are severely limited by the landslide and environmental data needed to create them. They rely on inventories of past landslide locations, which are difficult to collect and often nonrepresentative. Furthermore, susceptibility maps are most needed in regions without the means to assemble an inventory. To overcome these challenges, we develop a method for assessing shallow landslide susceptibility based on a probabilistic morphometric analysis of the landscape’s topography, rather than the characteristics of landslides. The model assumes that hillslopes with higher relief and gradient compared to the surrounding landscape are more prone to landslides. We demonstrate the superior performance of this approach over contrasting data-driven models across the northwestern United States. As our morphometric model only requires elevation data, it overcomes the major limitations of data-driven models and facilitates the creation of effective susceptibility models in areas where it was previously unfeasible.",

Sediment-loaded plumes discharged by flashfloods deposit onto the seabed. Burrowing animals disrupt these flood layers, erasing the paleorainfall record. Fortuitously, we discovered an anoxic deep-sea brine pool sited close enough to shore to chronicle floods, yet be otherwise undisturbed by animals. Cores retrieved from the pool delivered a 1600-year rainfall record. We merge these core-layer histories with modern rainfall statistics, satellite observations, and simulations to deliver a high-resolution quantitative Late Holocene hydroclimate record for Arabia. We find that the modern era is 2.5 times drier than the last 1.6 thousand years. The Little Ice Age stands out as particularly wet. That period experienced a fivefold increase in rainfall intensity compared to today. Though hyperarid now, the flood layers demonstrate that climate shifts can generate weather conditions unwitnessed in the modern era. Such long-range insight is crucial for framing uncertainties surrounding future hydroclimate forecasts.",

This protocol enables the simultaneous transmission of information and key exchange using the same single photons and is robust against loss and error because it uses error correction and spectrum expansion techniques. In a proof-of-principle demonstration using weak coherent pulses, the system achieved a real-time secure transmission rate of 2.38 kilobits per second over a 104.8-kilometer standard telecommunication fiber, which set world records in both aspects.

We uncover multiple roles for N2G, including its activity as an F-actin bundler, an adapter that activates kinesin-1 motors, and a mediator of cytoskeletal cross-talk. Notably, N2G directly links kinesin-1 to F-actin, enabling the transport of actin filaments along microtubule tracks, establishing active cross-talk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.

However, the function and mechanism of posttranscriptional chemical modifications, especially the newly identified N 4 -acetylcytidine (ac 4 C) modification catalyzed by N -acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), are unknown. In this study, we developed a low-input ac 4 C sequencing technology, ac 4 C LACE-seq, and mapped 8241 ac 4 C peaks at the whole-transcriptome level using 50 mouse oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage. Oocyte-specific Nat10 knockout wiped out ac 4 C signals in oocytes and caused severe defects in meiotic maturation and female infertility. Mechanically, Nat10 deletion led to a failure of ac 4 C deposition on mRNAs encoding key maternal factors, which regulate transcriptome stability and maternal-to-zygotic transition. Nat10 -deleted oocytes showed decreased mRNA translation efficiency due to the direct inhibition of ac 4 C sites on specific transcripts during meiotic maturation. In summary, we developed a low-input, high-sensitivity mRNA ac 4 C profiling approach and highlighted the important physiological function of ac 4 C in the precise regulation of oocyte meiotic maturation by enhancing translation efficiency.",

We present previously unknown observational evidence that the atlantification processes are strengthening in the eastern Eurasian Basin. The primary example is the diminishing sea ice, which is related to a powerful ocean-heat/ice-albedo feedback, which accelerates sea-ice losses. Furthermore, we observe that atlantification is extending far beyond the Lomonosov Ridge into the Makarov Basin of the Arctic Ocean where upper ocean ventilation creates a new and unique ecological environment. The eastern part of the Siberian Arctic Ocean is still strongly stratified, but the atlantification-driven shoaling of warm, salty, and nutrient-rich intermediate waters already has important ecological consequences there. Disentangling the role of atlantification in multiple and complex high-latitude changes should be a priority in future modeling and observational efforts.",

We characterize the platform and then demonstrate its modularity by using 16 affinity domains against four different antigens with minimal protocol optimization. We show that TLISA is suitable for POC use by sensing human biomarkers in serum and saliva with a colorimetric readout within 1 hour and by demonstrating functionality after lyophilization.

Engineered mutant null alleles of cadherins were analyzed for defects in morphology, behavior, neuronal soma positions, neurite neighborhood topology and fasciculation, and localization of synapses in many parts of the nervous system. This analysis revealed a restricted pattern of neuronal differentiation defects at discrete subsets of anatomical scales, including a novel role of cadherins in experience-dependent electrical synapse formation.

We confirm our theoretical findings in the microwave experiment by measuring the extinction spectra of subwavelength Mie-resonant ceramic rings.

Our analysis revealed the CD43+CD71+IgG+ activated B cell subset, highly enriched for SARS-CoV-2 specificities, as a juncture for ASC and MBC differentiation, with CD86+ phenotypically similar to ASCs and CD86− to IgG+ MBCs. Moreover, subpopulations within IgG+ MBCs were further identified based on CD73 and CD24 expression. Activated MBCs (CD73−/CD24lo) were predominantly SARS-CoV-2-specific, while resting MBCs (CD73+/CD24hi) recognized prepandemic antigens. A CD95− subcluster within resting MBCs accounted for over 40% of prepandemic-specific cells, indicating long-lasting memory.

In this study, we suppress first-cycle voltage hysteresis and irreversible O 2 evolution in Li-rich oxide cathodes through covalency competition induced by the substitution of electropositive groups. We found that the nonequivalent electron distribution within an asymmetric M A -O-M B backbone (metal-to-metal charge transfer via oxygen ligands) increases electron density on electronegative transition metal ions, preventing them from reaching unstable oxidation states within an operating voltage range. This phenomenon is observed across diverse transition metal combinations, providing insights into controlling unnecessary oxygen redox activity. Our findings open new avenues for controlling intrinsic redox chemistry and enabling the rational design of high–energy density Li-rich oxide cathodes.",

To address this, we used immunopeptidomic analysis and RNA sequencing on five metastatic OC samples, which identified 311 cryptic peptides (40 to 83 per patient). Despite comprising less than 1% of total peptides, cryptic peptides from noncoding transcripts emerged as the predominant antigen class when compared to the other major classes of known tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens in OC samples.

Alteration in microglial numbers has been associated with abnormal behaviors akin to those observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. Consequently, establishing the appropriate microglial numbers during development is crucial for ensuring normal cortical function. Here, we uncovered a dynamic relationship between pyramidal cells and microglia that tunes microglial numbers and development through distinct phases of mouse postnatal development. Changes in pyramidal cell activity during development induce differential release of activity-dependent proteins such as Activin A, which, in turn, adjusts microglial numbers accordingly. Decoupling of this relationship not only changes microglial numbers but has a long-term consequence on their role as synaptic organizers, which ultimately affects cortical function. Our findings reveal that microglia adapt their numbers to changes in pyramidal cell activity during a critical time window in development, consequently adjusting their numbers and function to the demands of the developing local circuits.",

The size of the developed CUS is only 2.5 millimeters in radius and 850 micrometers in height. Animal experiments demonstrated that the CUS, with a high sensitivity (−22.96 millivolts per kilopascal), can monitor thoracic pressure to assist in diagnosing different heart diseases, including cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction.

We found that under anoxia, APM significantly stimulated microbial eukaryote gene expression, particularly genes involved in anaerobic energy metabolism and phagocytosis, and increased the relative abundance of 18 S rRNA from known predatory clades. We additionally confirmed that APM promoted the reproduction of benthic foraminifera under anoxia with higher-than-expected net growth efficiencies. Overall, our findings suggest that algal biomass exported to the Neoproterozoic benthos stimulated the ecology of benthic predatory protists under anoxia, thereby creating more modern food webs by enhancing the transfer of fixed carbon and energy to eukaryotes occupying higher trophic levels, including the earliest benthic metazoans.",

While the sequence-dependent propensities for a helix to either translocate through the translocon or insert into the membrane have been codified into numerical hydrophobicity scales, the corresponding propensity to partition into the membrane interface remains unrevealed. By engineering diagnostic glycosylation sites around test peptide sequences inserted into a host protein, we devised a system that can differentiate between water-soluble, surface-bound, and transmembrane (TM) states of the sequence based on its glycosylation pattern. Using this system, we determined the sequence-dependent propensities for transfer from the translocon to a TM, interfacial, or extramembrane space and compared these propensities with the corresponding probability distributions determined from the sequences and structures of experimentally determined proteins.",

Here, we show a fully biobased hair conditioner based on micellar lignin gels that stabilize emulsions with triglyceride oils. We demonstrate competitive emulsion stability, rheological properties, and performance relative to an off-the-shelf commercial product. Lignin gel emulsion with a 6% weight fraction of coconut oil effectively lubricates damaged hair, confirmed by a 13% reduction in wet combing force and validated through multiscale microscopy analysis. Notably, organic solvent-free production simplifies the ingredient list and offers an environmentally benign route for lignin utilization in hair care.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial tRNA taurine modifications mediated by mitochondrial tRNA translation optimization 1 ( Mto1 ) is essential for the mitochondrial protein translation. Mto1 deficiency was shown to induce proteostress in embryonic stem cells. A recent finding that a patient with MTO1 gene mutation showed severe anemia led us to hypothesize that Mto1 dysfunctions may result in defective erythropoiesis. Hematopoietic-specific Mto1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice were embryonic lethal and showed niche-independent defect in erythroblast proliferation and terminal differentiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes were severely impaired in the Mto1 cKO fetal liver, and this was followed by cytosolic iron accumulation. Overloaded cytosolic iron promoted heme biosynthesis, which induced an unfolded protein response (UPR) in Mto1 cKO erythroblasts. An iron chelator or UPR inhibitor rescued erythroid terminal differentiation in the Mto1 cKO fetal liver in vitro. This mitochondrial regulation of iron homeostasis revealed the indispensable role of mitochondrial tRNA modification in fetal hematopoiesis.",

          "abstract": "Molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) has long been predicted to exhibit superfluidity—a state of zero viscosity—at extremely low temperatures. However, its existence remains under debate despite several experimental reports. In this study, we investigated the infrared transitions of methane embedded in clusters of parahydrogen molecules at 0.4 K using high-resolution helium nanodroplet spectroscopy. Our results revealed fully quantized rotational states of methane with minimal interference from surrounding H 2 molecules, enabling precise determination of the rotational constant for each hydrogen cluster. The cluster-size dependence of the determined rotational constant aligns with behavior predicted by path-integral Monte Carlo simulations, indicating that more than 60% of the hydrogen molecules in the clusters participate in quantum bosonic exchanges, a characteristic feature of superfluidity. This work provides strong experimental evidence for the existence of a superfluid phase of molecular hydrogen at 0.4 K, representing a major step forward in understanding quantum behaviors in molecular systems.",

However, generating complex polarization-entangled states has long been constrained by the available nonlinear susceptibility tensor of natural materials, necessitating cumbersome setups for additional coherent superposition or postselection. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons using a plasmonic metasurface strongly coupled to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material. By engineering a resonance at the pump wavelength and leveraging the field enhancement provided by the ENZ effect, the photon pair generation efficiency of the 68-nanometer-thick metasurface is substantially boosted compared to that of an unpatterned indium tin oxide film. More notably, the ENZ metasurface platform facilitates versatile manipulation of the system’s anisotropic second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, enabling direct control over the polarization states of the photon pairs and generating a polarization-entangled Bell state without additional components. This approach enables simultaneous photon pair generation and quantum state engineering in a compact platform.",

          "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where pathogenic autoantibodies target the water channel aquaporin-4 on human astrocytes causing neurological impairment. Autoantibody binding leads to complement-dependent and complement-independent cytotoxicity, ultimately resulting in astrocyte death, demyelination, and neuronal loss. Aquaporin-4 assembles in astrocyte plasma membranes as symmetric tetramers or as arrays of tetramers. We report molecular structures of aquaporin-4 alone and bound to Fab fragments from patient-derived NMO autoantibodies using cryogenic electron microscopy. Each antibody binds to epitopes comprised of three extracellular loops of aquaporin-4 with contributions from multiple molecules in the assembly. The structures distinguish between antibodies that bind to the tetrameric form of aquaporin-4 and those targeting higher-order orthogonal arrays of tetramers that provide more diverse bridging epitopes.",

          "abstract": "Oocytes naturally present mechanical defects that hinder their development after fertilization. Thus, in the context of assisted reproduction, oocyte selection based on their mechanical properties has great potential to improve the quality of the resulting embryos and the success rate of these procedures. However, using mechanical properties as a quantifiable selective criterion requires robust and nondestructive measurement tools. This study developed a constriction-based microfluidic device that monitors the deformation of mouse oocytes under controlled pressure. The device can distinguish mechanically aberrant oocyte groups from healthy control ones. On the basis of a mathematical model, we propose that deformability measurements infer both oocyte tension and elasticity, elasticity being the most discriminating factor in our geometry. Despite force transmission during oocyte deformation, no long-term damage was observed. This noninvasive characterization of mouse oocyte deformability in microconstrictions allows for a substantial advance in assessing the mechanical properties of mammalian oocytes and has potential application as a quantifiable selective criterion in medically assisted reproduction.",

          "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) represents a promising gene-specific therapy against tumors. However, its clinical translation is impeded by poor performance of lysosomal escape and tumor targeting. This challenge is especially prominent in glioblastoma (GBM) therapy, necessitating the penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leveraging the intrinsic tumor-targeting and BBB traversing capability of human H-ferritin, we designed a series of ferritin variants with positively charged cavity and truncated carboxyl terminus, termed tHFn(+). These nanocarriers respond to weak acid and disassemble in endosomal compartments, exposing the internal positive charges to facilitate the lysosomal escape of loaded small interfering RNA (siRNA). Functioning as universal siRNA nanocarriers, tHFn(+) significantly enhanced the uptake of different siRNAs and suppressed gene expressions associated with GBM progression. Furthermore, tHFn(+) traversed the BBB and targeted glioma in vivo by binding to its receptors (e.g., transferrin receptor 1). tHFn(+)-delivered siRNAs exhibited exceptional therapeutic effects against glioma in vivo, advancing RNAi therapeutics beyond GBM for the treatment of various diseases.",

Here, we identify various polariton states via electrical bias within a monolayer of n-type MoS 2 . The MoS 2 channel was squeezed within a distributed Bragg reflector microcavity which was combined with a transparent graphene gate-electrode and a hexagonal boron nitride insulator. We observe trion polaritons with distinct lower polariton branch (LPB) and upper polariton branch (UPB). This allows us to modulate the intensity and energy switchings via gate bias: At gate bias below threshold voltage, both polaritons are decoupled, and above threshold voltage, they are coupled to form LPB-UPB pair, and at high bias, complex polaritons (CPB) emerge due to polariton screening, a phenomenon consistent with Rabi splitting. Further, we observe a peculiar nonlinearity at intermediate power regime.",
