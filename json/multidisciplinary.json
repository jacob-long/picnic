          "abstract": "The Great Fear of 1789, a wave of panic and unrest in rural France fuelled by the spreading of rumours, was an important moment at the onset of the French Revolution, marking the collapse of feudalism and the rise of the new regime1. The Great Fear provides a vivid example of the role the spreading of rumours has in driving political changes that might be relevant today2,3. Here, we collect existing historical records related to the Great Fear and use epidemiology tools and models4 to reconstruct the network of its transmission from town to town. In this way, we quantify the spatiotemporal spread of the rumours and compute key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number. Exploiting information on the structure of the road network in eighteenth century France5, we estimate the most probable diffusion paths of the Great Fear and quantify the distribution of spreading velocities. By endowing the nodes in our reconstructed network with indicators related to the institutional, demographic and socio-economic conditions of the time6, including literacy, population size, political participation, wheat prices7,8, income and ownership laws9, and the unequal distribution of land ownership, we compute factors associated with spread of the Great Fear. Our analysis sheds light on unresolved historiographic issues on the significance of the Great Fear for the French Revolution, providing a quantitative answer to the unresolved debate between the role of emotions and rationality in explaining its diffusion.",

          "abstract": "Bipedalism is a human-defining trait1,2,3. It is made possible by the familiar, bowl-shaped pelvis, whose short, wide iliac blades curve along the sides of the body to stabilize walking and support internal organs and a large-brained, broad-shouldered baby4,5,6. The ilium changes compared with living primates are an evolutionary novelty7. However, how this evolution came about remains unknown. Here, using a multifaceted histological, comparative genomic and functional genomic approach, we identified the developmental bases of the morphogenetic shifts in the human pelvis that made bipedalism possible. First, we observe that the human ilium cartilage growth plate underwent a heterotopic shift, residing perpendicular to the orientation present in other primate (and mouse) ilia. Second, we observe heterochronic and heterotopic shifts in ossification that are unlike those in non-human primate ilia or human long bones. Ossification initiates posteriorly, resides externally with fibroblast (and perichondral) cells contributing to osteoblasts, and is delayed compared with other bones in humans and with primate ilia. Underlying these two shifts are regulatory changes in an integrated chondrocyte–perichondral–osteoblast pathway, involving complex hierarchical interactions between SOX9–ZNF521–PTH1R and RUNX2–FOXP1/2. These innovations facilitated further growth of the human pelvis and the unique formation of the ilium among primates.",

          "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is the primary target of the partial agonist Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the psychoactive constituent of marijuana1. Here we report two agonist-bound crystal structures of human CB1 in complex with a tetrahydrocannabinol (AM11542) and a hexahydrocannabinol (AM841). The two CB1–agonist complexes reveal important conformational changes in the overall structure relative to the antagonist-bound state2, including a 53% reduction in the volume of the ligand-binding pocket and an increase in the surface area of the G protein-binding region. Furthermore, a twin toggle switch of Phe2003.36 and Trp3566.48 (where the superscripts denote Ballesteros–Weinstein numbering3) is experimentally observed and seems to be essential for receptor activation. The structures reveal important insights into the activation mechanism of CB1 and provide a molecular basis for predicting the binding modes of Δ9-THC, and endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids. The plasticity of the binding pocket of CB1 seems to be a common feature among certain class A G protein-coupled receptors. These findings should inspire the design of chemically diverse ligands with distinct pharmacological properties.",

          "abstract": "Chemical feedback is ubiquitous in physiology but is challenging to study without perturbing basal functions. One example is addictive drugs, which elicit a positive-feedback cycle of drug-seeking and ingestion by acting on the brain to increase dopamine signalling 1–3 . However, interfering with this process by altering basal dopamine also adversely affects learning, movement, attention and wakefulness 4 . Here, inspired by physiological control systems, we developed a highly selective synthetic physiology approach to interfere with the positive-feedback cycle of addiction by installing a cocaine-dependent opposing signalling process into this body–brain signalling loop. We used protein engineering to create cocaine-gated ion channels that are selective for cocaine over other drugs and endogenous molecules. Expression of an excitatory cocaine-gated channel in the rat lateral habenula, a brain region that is normally inhibited by cocaine, suppressed cocaine self-administration without affecting food motivation. This artificial cocaine-activated chemogenetic process reduced the cocaine-induced extracellular dopamine rise in the nucleus accumbens. Our results show that cocaine chemogenetics is a selective approach for countering drug reinforcement by clamping dopamine release in the presence of cocaine. In the future, chemogenetic receptors could be developed for additional addictive drugs or hormones and metabolites, which would facilitate efforts to probe their neural circuit mechanisms using a synthetic physiology approach. As these chemogenetic ion channels are specific for cocaine over natural rewards, they may also offer a route towards gene therapies for cocaine addiction.",

          "abstract": "Generative models cover various application areas, including image and video synthesis, natural language processing and molecular design, among many others 1–11 . As digital generative models become larger, scalable inference in a fast and energy-efficient manner becomes a challenge 12–14 . Here we present optical generative models inspired by diffusion models 4 , where a shallow and fast digital encoder first maps random noise into phase patterns that serve as optical generative seeds for a desired data distribution; a jointly trained free-space-based reconfigurable decoder all-optically processes these generative seeds to create images never seen before following the target data distribution. Except for the illumination power and the random seed generation through a shallow encoder, these optical generative models do not consume computing power during the synthesis of the images. We report the optical generation of monochrome and multicolour images of handwritten digits, fashion products, butterflies, human faces and artworks, following the data distributions of MNIST 15 , Fashion-MNIST 16 , Butterflies-100 17 , Celeb-A datasets 18 , and Van Gogh’s paintings and drawings 19 , respectively, achieving an overall performance comparable to digital neural-network-based generative models. To experimentally demonstrate optical generative models, we used visible light to generate images of handwritten digits and fashion products. In addition, we generated Van Gogh-style artworks using both monochrome and multiwavelength illumination. These optical generative models might pave the way for energy-efficient and scalable inference tasks, further exploiting the potentials of optics and photonics for artificial-intelligence-generated content.",

They are characterized by topological boundary modes that remain stable under symmetry respecting perturbations 1–4,6–8 . In clean, gapped systems without disorder, the stability of these edge modes is restricted to the zero-temperature manifold; at finite temperatures, interactions with mobile thermal excitations lead to their decay 9–11 . Here we report the observation of a distinct type of topological edge mode 12–14 , which is protected by emergent symmetries and persists across the entire spectrum, in an array of 100 programmable superconducting qubits. Through digital quantum simulation of a one-dimensional disorder-free stabilizer Hamiltonian, we observe robust long-lived topological edge modes over up to 30 cycles for a wide range of initial states. We show that the interaction between these edge modes and bulk excitations can be suppressed by dimerizing the stabilizer strength, leading to an emergent U(1) × U(1) symmetry in the prethermal regime of the system. Furthermore, we exploit these topological edge modes as logical qubits and prepare a logical Bell state, which exhibits persistent coherence, despite the system being disorder-free and at finite temperature. Our results establish a viable digital simulation approach 15–18 to experimentally study topological matter at finite temperature and demonstrate a potential route to construct long-lived, robust boundary qubits in disorder-free systems.",

          "abstract": "The mechanical properties of metallic materials often degrade under harsh cryogenic conditions, posing challenges for low-temperature infrastructures 1 . Here we introduce a dual-scale atomic-ordering nanostructure, characterized by an exceptionally high number density of co-existing subnanoscale short-range ordering (approximately 2.4 × 10 26 m −3 ) and nanoscale long-range ordering (approximately 4.5 × 10 25 m −3 ) domains, within a metallic solid-solution matrix in a CoNiV-based alloy to improve the synergy of strength and ductility at low temperatures. We observe an ordering-induced increase in dislocation shear stress as well as a more rapid dislocation multiplication owing to the dislocation blocking effect of nanoscale long-range ordering and the associated generation of new dislocations. The latter effect also releases stress concentrations at nanoscale long-range-ordered obstacles that otherwise would promote damage initiation and failure. Consequently, the alloy shows a strength–elongation product of 76 GPa % with a yield strength of approximately 1.2 GPa at 87 K, outperforming materials devoid of such ordering hierarchy, containing only short-range ordered or coherent precipitates of a few tens of nanometres. Our results highlight the impact of dual co-existing chemical ordering on the mechanical properties of complex alloys and offer guidelines to control these ordering states to enhance their mechanical performance for cryogenic applications.",

          "abstract": "To orchestrate ribosomal peptide synthesis, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) must be aminoacylated, with activated amino acids, at their 2′,3′-diol moiety 1,2 , and so the selective aminoacylation of RNA in water is a key challenge that must be resolved to explain the origin of protein biosynthesis. So far, there have been no chemical methods to effectively and selectively aminoacylate RNA-2′,3′-diols with the breadth of proteinogenic amino acids in water 3–5 . Here we demonstrate that (biological) aminoacyl-thiols ( 1 ) react selectively with RNA diols over amine nucleophiles, promoting aminoacylation over adventitious (non-coded) peptide bond formation. Broad side-chain scope is demonstrated, including Ala, Arg, Asp, Glu, Gln, Gly, His, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser and Val, and Arg aminoacylation is enhanced by unprecedented side-chain nucleophilic catalysis. Duplex formation directs chemoselective 2′,3′-aminoacylation of RNA. We demonstrate that prebiotic nitriles, N -carboxyanhydrides and amino acid anhydrides, as well as biological aminoacyl-adenylates, all react with thiols (including coenzymes A and M) to selectively yield aminoacyl-thiols ( 1 ) in water. Finally, we demonstrate that the switch from thioester to thioacid activation inverts diol/amine selectivity, promoting peptide synthesis in excellent yield. Two-step, one-pot, chemically controlled formation of peptidyl-RNA is observed in water at neutral pH. Our results indicate an important role for thiol cofactors in RNA aminoacylation before the evolution of proteinaceous synthetase enzymes.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear due to incomplete circuit-level MPF characterization7. Here, using integrated neuroanatomical, physiological and behavioural approaches, we construct a comprehensive wiring diagram of the MPF, focused on the dorsal peduncular area (DP)—a poorly understood prefrontal area. We identify its deep (DPd) and superficial (DPs) layers, along with the infralimbic area, as major components of the visceromotor cortex that directly project to hypothalamic and brainstem structures to govern neuroendocrine, sympathetic and parasympathetic output. Notably, the DP functions as a network hub integrating diverse cortical inputs and modulating goal-directed behaviour through a largely unidirectional cortical information flow. On the basis of the mesoscale MPF connectome, we propose a unified network model in which distinct MPF areas orchestrate physiological and behavioural responses to internal and external stimuli.",

          "abstract": "The armoured ankylosaurian dinosaurs are best known from Late Cretaceous Northern Hemisphere ecosystems, but their early evolution in the Early–Middle Jurassic is shrouded in mystery due to a poor fossil record1,2. Spicomellus afer was suggested to be the world’s oldest ankylosaur and the first from Africa, but was based on only a single partial rib from the Middle Jurassic of Morocco3. Here we describe a new, much more complete specimen that confirms the ankylosaurian affinities of Spicomellus, and demonstrates that it has uniquely elaborate dermal armour unlike that of any other vertebrate, extant or extinct. The presence of ‘handle’ vertebrae in the tail of Spicomellus indicates that it possessed a tail weapon, overturning current understanding of tail club evolution in ankylosaurs, as these structures were previously thought to have evolved only in the Early Cretaceous4. This ornate armour may have functioned for display as well as defence, and a later reduction to simpler armour with less extravagant osteoderms in Late Cretaceous taxa might indicate a shift towards a primarily defensive function, perhaps in response to increased predation pressures or a switch to combative courtship displays.",

One such uncharacterized metabolism is the coupling of sulfide oxidation with iron( iii ) oxide reduction, a ubiquitous environmental process hitherto considered to be strictly abiotic 7,8 . Here we present a comprehensive genomic analysis of sulfur metabolism across prokaryotes, and reveal bacteria that are capable of oxidizing sulfide using extracellular solid phase iron( iii ). Based on a phylogenetic framework of over hundred genes involved in dissimilatory transformation of sulfur compounds, we recorded sulfur-cycling capacity in most bacterial and archaeal phyla. Metabolic reconstructions predicted co-occurrence of sulfur compound oxidation and iron( iii ) oxide respiration in diverse members of 37 prokaryotic phyla. Physiological and transcriptomic evidence demonstrated that a cultivated representative, Desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus , grows autotrophically by oxidizing dissolved sulfide or iron monosulfide (FeS) to sulfate with ferrihydrite as an extracellular iron( iii ) electron acceptor. The biological process outpaced the abiotic process at environmentally relevant sulfide concentrations. These findings expand the known diversity of sulfur-cycling microorganisms and unveil a biological mechanism that links sulfur and iron cycling in anoxic environments, thus highlighting the fundamental role of microorganisms in global element cycles.",

Hundreds of synthetic studies towards this end have been disclosed thus far, yet, a fully modular and scalable approach to the family remains elusive4-12.

Yet globally consistent LSP mapping has been hampered by methods that struggle to represent the full range of seasonal phenologies occurring across terrestrial biomes 14 , especially the subtle and complex phenologies of many arid and tropical ecosystems 1,15,16 . Here, using a data-driven analysis of satellite imagery to map LSP worldwide, we provide insights into Earth’s phenological diversity, documenting both intercontinental convergence between similar climates and regional heterogeneity associated with topoclimate, ecohydrology and vegetation structure. We then map spatial phenological asynchrony and the modes of asynchronous seasonality that control it, identifying hotspots of asynchrony in tropical mountains and Mediterranean climate regions and reporting evidence for the hypothesis that climatically similar sites exhibit greater phenological asynchrony within the tropics. Finally, we find that our global LSP map predicts complex geographical discontinuities in flowering phenology, genetic divergence and even harvest seasonality across a range of taxa, establishing remote sensing as a crucial tool for understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of allochrony by allopatry.",

Although epidemiological studies have suggested an association between PS and a higher risk of eczema in children3,4,5,6, no causative biological link has yet been identified. Here we show that eczema at birth originates from molecular dysregulations of neuroimmune circuits in utero, triggered by fluctuations in the maternal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. We found that offspring of stressed pregnant dams have dysregulated mast cells and skin-projecting neurons and quickly develop eczema in response to harmless mechanical friction. We demonstrated that PS transiently modulates amniotic fluid corticosterone concentrations, which directly alters the activation program of skin mast cells expressing the glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 and the adjacent sensory neurons conveying mechanosensation. Therapeutic normalization of maternal corticosterone concentrations or genetic depletion of Mcpt5+ mast cells during stressed gestation prevents fetal immune dysregulation and protects against eczema development after birth. Our findings support a new model in which early-onset paediatric eczema originates from dysregulations in the fetal immune system, caused by fluctuations in maternal glucocorticoids induced by stress.",

          "abstract": "Many chirality-sensitive light–matter interactions are governed by chiral electron dynamics. Therefore, the development of advanced technologies making use of chiral phenomena would critically benefit from measuring and controlling chiral electron dynamics on their natural attosecond timescales. Such endeavours have so far been hampered by the lack of characterized circularly polarized attosecond pulses, an obstacle that has recently been overcome 1,2 . Here we introduce chiroptical spectroscopy with attosecond pulses and demonstrate attosecond coherent control over photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) 3,4 , as well as the measurement of chiral asymmetries in the forward–backward and angle-resolved photoionization delays of chiral molecules. We show that co-rotating attosecond and near-infrared (IR) pulses can nearly double the PECD and even change its sign compared with single-photon ionization. We demonstrate that chiral photoionization delays depend on both polar and azimuthal angles of photoemission in the light-propagation frame, requiring 3D momentum resolution. We measure forward–backward chiral-sensitive delays of up to 60 as and polar-angle-resolved photoionization delays of up to 240 as, which include an asymmetry of about 60 as originating from chirality in the continuum–continuum transitions. Attosecond chiroptical spectroscopy opens the door to quantitatively understanding and controlling the dynamics of chiral molecules on the electronic timescale.",

This raises questions about the universality of such hierarchical structures. Here we examined the large-scale functional organization for vision in one of the closest living relatives to primates, the tree shrew. We performed Neuropixels recordings 3,4 across many cortical and thalamic areas spanning the tree shrew ventral visual system while presenting a large battery of visual stimuli in awake tree shrews. We found that receptive field size, response latency and selectivity for naturalistic textures, compared with spectrally matched noise 5 , all increased moving anteriorly along the tree shrew visual pathway, consistent with a primate-like hierarchical organization 6,7 . However, tree shrew area V2 already harboured a high-level representation of complex objects. First, V2 encoded a complete representation of a high-level object space 8 . Second, V2 activity supported the most accurate object decoding and reconstruction among all tree shrew visual areas. In fact, object decoding accuracy from tree shrew V2 was comparable to that in macaque posterior IT and substantially higher than that in macaque V2. Finally, starting in V2, we found strongly face-selective cells resembling those reported in macaque inferotemporal cortex 9 . Overall, these findings show how core computational principles of visual form processing found in primates are conserved, yet hierarchically compressed, in a small but highly visual mammal.",

Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2 high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.",

This necessitates a one-size-fits-all hardware solution that can be adaptively reconfigured within this wide spectrum to support full-band coverage and dynamic spectrum management 4 . However, existing electrical or photonic-assisted solutions face a lot of challenges in meeting this demand because of the limited bandwidths of the devices and the intrinsically rigid nature of system architectures 5 . Here we demonstrate adaptive wireless communications over an unprecedented frequency range spanning over 100 GHz, driven by a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic wireless system. Leveraging the Pockels effect and scalability of the TFLN platform, we achieve monolithic integration of essential functional elements, including baseband modulation, broadband wireless–photonic conversion and reconfigurable carrier and local signal generation. Powered by broadband tunable optoelectronic oscillators, our signal sources operate across a record-wide frequency range from 0.5 GHz to 115 GHz with high-frequency stability and consistent coherence. Based on the broadband and reconfigurable integrated photonic solution, we realize full-link wireless communication across nine consecutive bands, achieving record lane speeds of up to 100 Gbps. The real-time reconfigurability further enables adaptive frequency allocation, a crucial ability to ensure enhanced reliability in complex spectrum environments. Our proposed system represents a marked step towards future full-spectrum and omni-scenario wireless networks.",

Among the gain media for solution-processed lasers, metal halide perovskites stand out as an exceptional class because of their ability to achieve wavelength-adjustable, low-threshold lasing under optical pumping 1–8 . Despite the progress in this field, electrically driven lasing from perovskite semiconductors remains a critical challenge. Here we demonstrate an electrically driven perovskite laser, constructed by vertically integrating a low-threshold single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit with a high-power microcavity perovskite LED (PeLED) sub-unit. Under pulsed electrical excitation, the dual-cavity perovskite device shows a minimum lasing threshold of 92 A cm −2 (average threshold: 129 A cm −2 , at about 22 °C, in air), which is an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art electrically driven organic lasers 9,10 . Key to this demonstration is the integrated dual-cavity device architecture, which allows the microcavity PeLED sub-unit to deliver directional emission into the single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit (at a coupling efficiency of about 82.7%) to establish the lasing action. An operational half-life ( T 50 ) of 1.8 h (6.4 × 10 4 voltage pulses at 10 Hz) is achieved, outperforming the stability of electrically pumped organic lasers 9,10 . The dual-cavity perovskite laser can be rapidly modulated at a bandwidth of 36.2 MHz, indicating its potential for data transmission and computational applications.",

However, the vast excess of niche cells relative to HSCs challenges this perspective. To rigorously define the role of niche size in regulating HSC numbers, we developed a femur-transplantation system, enabling us to increase available HSC niches. Notably, the addition of niches did not alter the total HSC numbers in the body, suggesting the presence of a systemic mechanism that limits HSC numbers. Additionally, HSC numbers in transplanted wild-type femurs did not exceed physiological levels when HSCs were mobilized from defective endogenous niches to the periphery, indicating that HSC numbers are constrained at the local level as well. The notion of dual restrictions at systemic and local levels was further supported by other experimental approaches, including parabiosis and non-conditioned transfer of HSCs after bone transplantation. Moreover, we found that thrombopoietin has a pivotal role in determining the total number of HSCs in the body, even in the context of increased niche availability. Our study redefines key principles underlying HSC number regulation, providing insights into this critical biological process.",

This exploration–exploitation dilemma has been studied extensively in paradigms involving positive outcomes, and neural correlates have been identified in frontal cortices and subcortical structures2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, including the amygdala12. Importantly, exploration is just as essential for survival or well-being when trying to avoid negative outcomes, yet we do not know whether the single-neuron mechanisms that drive exploration are shared across positive and negative environments. Here we examined the dynamics of exploration when human participants engaged in a probabilistic learning task with intermixed loss and gain trials, while simultaneously recording single-neuron activity. We show that neurons of the amygdala and temporal cortex modulate their activity before a decision to explore in both loss and gain. Moreover, we find that humans exhibit more exploration when trying to avoid losses, and that an increase in the levels of noise in amygdala neurons contributes to this behaviour. Overall, we report that human exploration is driven by two distinct neural mechanisms, a valence-independent rate signal and a valence-dependent global noise signal. The results suggest a link between the heightened amygdala activity observed in mood disorders13,14 and higher exploration rates15,16,17 that underlie maladaptive and even pathological behaviours.",

          "abstract": "Quantum mechanics is unquestionably a robust and successful theory — so far, all its predictions have held, and scientists can build powerful technologies based on it. Yet, understanding what it tells us about the nature of reality and how we experience it has proven tricky. Physicists and philosophers have been grappling with it for a century, ironing out some of the early ambiguities, but some conceptual problems remain. And the non-intuitive nature of quantum physics makes it fertile ground for misunderstandings. Here, six physicists explore the origins of widespread myths about quantum history, theory and applications.\n\nMARIA VIOLARIS: Has quantum physics made time travel possible?\n\nIf you’ve been following quantum-science announcements in the past few years, you might think that experiments have managed to send quantum particles back in time. But despite intriguing theoretical proposals and experimental studies, that has not been achieved (yet).\n\nThe idea relies on exploiting quantum ‘time loops’ — hypothetical twists in space-time that allow a particle, or anything else, to come out of the loop at an earlier time than when it went in. These loops could exist in the Universe, for example through tunnels in the fabric of space-time.\n\nA century of quantum physics\n\nThe recent proposals were based on quantum teleportation of qubits, in which the state of a qubit is transported from one location to another, without physically moving between them. This can be done by using an entangled pair of qubits, one at each location.\n\nHowever, to avoid violating core principles, such as no faster-than-light communication, quantum teleportation can be successful at most only one-quarter of the time. For the remainder, the receiver needs to correct its teleported qubit using information from the sender. But researchers are looking into an alternative approach, in which they discard these failed cases, keeping only the successful one-quarter.\n\nThis selective version of teleportation has been proposed as a model for a quantum universe that allows time travel. Such a Universe could have laws of physics that automatically discard any paradoxical outcome arising from something changing the past. By following a similar protocol, but instead manually discarding certain measurement outcomes, researchers have achieved a quantum advantage in the field of metrology (the science of making precise measurements).\n\nThe experimental results look identical to those that would come from a real time loop, but the behaviour has been engineered from quantum entanglement. So, no one has really sent a particle to the past quite yet. But the general theory of relativity allows for time travel — and quantum models give promising ways to resolve its paradoxes. Quantum mechanics therefore could yet make time travel possible — but I’d need to read a paper sent back from the future to be sure.\n\nESTELLE INACK: Can quantum computers guarantee speedier calculations?\n\nThe promise of quantum computers and their abilities to solve a host of intensive computational problems — from how the quantum behaviour of electrons affects chemical reactions to optimizing routes in logistics — has spurred a booming industry that is attracting billions of dollars of investor cash. As excitement has grown, so has a misunderstanding about how quantum computers work, why they are potentially so powerful and fast at making calculations and what their limitations might be. It’s one thing to have a quantum computer, but another to extract the right answer for a complex calculation out of it. And it won’t simply speed up every existing application — we are not likely to need ‘quantum Word’ or ‘quantum Zoom’. Instead, they are promising tools for exploring very complex systems.\n\nQuantum devices are sometimes said to offer power and speed by relying on quantum bits (qubits) that are both 0 and 1 at the same time; by contrast, classical bits are either 0 or 1. This is misleading. What happens instead is that a qubit exists in a superposition of 0 and 1 classical states. And each time a measurement is taken, it has a probability of being measured as either 0 or 1.\n\nCould the Universe be a giant quantum computer?\n\nWhen putting many qubits together, say N of them, to form a quantum computer, their quantum superposition spans the same mathematical space as 2N classical bits; this is often referred to as quantum parallelism with exponential speed-up. When a quantum computation is performed, the system outputs one single state from those 2N possible ones.\n\nThe computation must be repeated many times (although fewer than 2N times, which would be impossible when N is large) to build a probabilistic picture of the system: the outcome with the highest probability gives you the correct answer. This overhead could reduce the advantages of quantum computers over classical computers. Algorithms that increase the probability of obtaining the correct (most likely) outcomes from each calculation are crucial.\n\nAnother limitation of quantum computers is that quantum states are very fragile and need to be protected from interactions with their environment, which can disrupt them. Researchers are exploring clever ways to do this through error-mitigating algorithms.\n\nThus, quantum computers are indeed powerful machines that rely on quantum superposition and parallelism — but innovations in algorithms, hardware and software are also needed to harness their full potential.\n\nSABINE HOSSENFELDER: Did Einstein reject the idea of entanglement?\n\nYou might have heard that what Albert Einstein referred to as ‘spooky action at a distance’ is technically known as ‘entanglement’, and that he insisted that entanglement couldn’t exist. Neither is true.\n\nThe ‘spooky action’ quote is a direct translation of the German phrase spukhafte Fernwirkung, which Einstein wrote in a 1947 letter to fellow physicist Max Born. He was referring to an idea that had long intrigued him — how to interpret the measurement process in quantum mechanics, which he had earlier described as relying on a “peculiar mechanism of action at a distance” (G. Bacciagaluppi and A. Valentini Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/p2ns; 2006).\n\nMathematically, the measurement process in quantum mechanics is instantaneous. Say you want to measure the position of a particle. Before you do so, the equations allow the particle to be in several places at the same time. Observe or measure it, however, and suddenly it is in only one place.\n\nDon’t believe the hype — quantum tech can’t yet solve real-world problems\n\nThis issue of reality apparently suddenly materializing out of uncertainty when you observe it is known as the measurement problem. The update happens faster than light, seemingly violating Einstein’s special theory of relativity, which says that no signal can exceed light speed. Of course, Einstein didn’t like it. That is why, together with physicists Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, Einstein argued in 1935 that quantum mechanics must be an “incomplete” theory (A. Einstein et al. Phys. Rev. 47, 777; 1935), in which measurement is just a probabilistic description of an underlying physical reality.\n\nThat same year, Erwin Schrödinger coined the term ‘entanglement’ to describe a correlation between two or more objects about which one has incomplete knowledge. You could, for example, have two particles, one on the left and one on the right, that can each have a state (usually physicists consider the property of ‘spin’, but it could be something else, such as momentum) of either +1 or –1, and both values must add up to 0. So, either the left particle has spin –1 and the one on the right spin +1, or the other way around.\n\nIn an experiment, you can flip the spin of one particle, say the left one, even without knowing what it is. If it was –1, it is now +1; if it was +1, it is now –1. If you do that, what happens to the particle on the right side? Nothing. The other particle itself has not changed, and the two particles are still entangled — just the correlation between them has changed. You have changed an entangled system into a different, also entangled system. There is no ‘spooky action’ in entanglement, no exchange of information that is faster than the speed of light.\n\nI think the reason why even some physicists get this mixed up is that in their 1935 paper, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen used what we now call ‘entangled particles’ to illustrate the problem with the instantaneous update of a system on measurement. The two concepts — measurement and entanglement — became entangled, so to speak.\n\nEinstein never claimed that entanglement, or quantum physics itself, is wrong. What he did was question the physical interpretation of the measurement: that a quantum system seems to exist in several possible superposed states but updates to a different state as soon as you observe it. That is an issue that still hasn’t been resolved.\n\nIllustration: Sandro Rybak\nNORMA SANCHEZ: Is general relativity irreconcilable with quantum physics?\n\nPhysicists have devised two grand theories to understand reality. The general theory of relativity dominates how things happen at large scales, such as across the cosmos. Quantum mechanics, meanwhile, covers atom-sized forces or smaller. Many physicists quibble that they might never be reconciled — although we have no real indication that it is not possible. In the past few years, progress and the potential for new observations, such as those of gravitational waves, gives me hope that we won’t need a completely new theory to encompass both.\n\nIn their current form, these theories produce pictures that are completely at odds with each other, impractical or unintelligible. Gravity, for example, is well explained by the general theory of relativity as a curvature of space-time in the presence of massive bodies. But because this formalism considers particles to have non-zero mass concentrated to a single point (with zero volume), following it at subatomic scales would make gravity infinite, which makes no sense.\n\nThe ‘quantum’ principle that says why atoms are as they are\n\nThere have been many attempts to reconcile the two frameworks. One is string theory — in which particles and forces arise from the vibrations of tiny one-dimensional ‘strings’. But this theory has run into problems: it does not explain the observed expansion of the Universe, or its structure, and no direct experiments have supported it. Other approaches that start with classical gravity and try to ‘quantize’ it have not succeeded either.",

          "title": "How did life get multicellular? Five simple organisms could have the answer",
          "authors": "Alla Katsnelson",
          "abstract": "For some three billion years, unicellular organisms ruled Earth. Then, around one billion years ago, a new chapter of life began. Early attempts at team living began to stick, paving the way for the evolution of complex organisms, including animals, plants and fungi.\n\nAcross all known life, the move to multicellularity happened at least 40 times, suggests one study1. But, in animals, it seems to have occurred only once.\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s, researchers interested in this remarkable event made a series of unexpected discoveries. The prevailing view held that a flood of genes had to evolve to enable the key properties of multicellularity2: the ability of cells to stick together, communication using molecular signals and the coordinated regulation of gene expression that causes each cell to specialize and take its position in the organism. But studies found that some unicellular organisms express a slew of proteins that control key properties of multicellularity in animals3,4. The molecular toolkit required for multicellularity seems to have existed well before the first animals came to be.\n\n“This work has rewritten our understanding of animal origins,” says William Ratcliff, an evolutionary biologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. “And it makes us ask different questions.”\n\nThe two teams behind much of this research were led by evolutionary biologist and geneticist Nicole King at the University of California, Berkeley, and by evolutionary biologist Iñaki Ruiz-Trillo at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, Spain. They have since expanded into a small community of scientists that has developed more than a dozen of these species into model organisms. All of these species are eukaryotes, which are distinct from prokaryotes in that they have a nucleus, and belong to lineages closely related to animals: choanoflagellates, filastereans, ichthyosporeans and corallochytreans (see ‘Animals’ unicellular relatives’). Many of the model species dabble in multicellularity by occasionally forming colonies.\n\nSource: Ruiz-Trillo, I. et al. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 77, 499–516 (2023).\n\nPart of what makes these organisms so interesting is how different they are — in appearance, life stages and genetic make-up — researchers say. Each of the organisms, five of which are featured here, offers a peek into the evolutionary paths that could have led to animals. Looking across several lineages to piece together this event has become “the philosophy of this scientific community”, says molecular biologist Elena Casacuberta, who jointly runs the laboratory in Barcelona with Ruiz-Trillo. “Only with a comparative approach can we attempt to have a more accurate picture.”\n\nThe top model\nWhen the single-celled choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta divides in the presence of bacteria, its daughter cells form a rosette pattern.Credit: Mark Dayel\n\nSalpingoeca rosetta was among the organisms that King investigated in her early work on multicellularity. It belongs to the choanoflagellates, which are the closest living relatives of animals. This group diverged from a common ancestor with animals more than 600 million years ago.\n\nLike other choanoflagellates, S. rosetta has a spherical cell body that sports a collar of thin membrane protrusions called microvilli, which are used to capture bacteria swept up for dinner by a long tail (known as a flagellum). It was isolated in 2000 from mudflats off the coast of Virginia; researchers haven’t managed to find it again in the wild. Under certain environmental conditions, S. rosetta cells divide clonally, producing genetically identical daughter cells that form colonies by circling up in a rosette pattern, with flagella undulating outward. But when King first started working with the organism in the lab, she could not budge it from its unicellular form. A chance experiment revealed that secretions by a specific prey bacterium act as a signal for the cells to start dividing.\n\nA ‘lost world’ of early microbes thrived one billion years ago\n\nIn addition to forming rosettes, the organism has at least one other multicellular conformation and a few distinct free-living cell types. When confined to a tight space, for example, S. rosetta cells withdraw their flagella and become amoeboid, lacking a firm shape and extending slender tentacles called filopodia to pull themselves along.\n\n“It has such an amazing diversity in response to a myriad of environmental cues,” says David Booth, a biochemist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn 2003, King and her colleagues reported the presence of proteins involved in cell adhesion and cell signalling in choanoflagellate species3. They later identified a more in-depth toolkit for multicellularity when they sequenced the genome of S. rosetta5.\n\nSalpingoeca rosetta is the Drosophila of choanoflagellates — the most widely studied species and the one for which researchers have developed the most extensive tools for directly altering the genome. In 2018, during a postdoc in King’s lab, Booth and his colleagues managed to add DNA encoding fluorescent proteins into S. rosetta6 and, in 2020, found ways to edit its genome using CRISPR7. Such methods have made it possible to tinker directly with genes that researchers say could be key to multicellularity — and to study the proteins that those genes express.\n\nWith the tools’ help, microbiologist Arielle Woznica at the University of Texas at Austin, a former graduate student in King’s lab, is exploring how choanoflagellates respond to bacterial attackers. Biochemist Florentine Rutaganira, a former postdoc in King’s lab now at Stanford University in California, is investigating enzymes called tyrosine kinases — linchpins of cell signalling in animals that are present in similar numbers in S. rosetta.\n\nMaster aggregator\nEnvironmental cues can trigger aggregation in Capsaspora owczarzaki.Credit: H. Suga et al./Nature Commun.\n\nCapsaspora owczarzaki is a member of the filasterean lineage, which diverged from a common ancestor with animals perhaps a couple of hundred million years earlier than did choanoflagellates.\n\nRuiz-Trillo first became interested in the organism as a postdoc, just as King’s lab was setting up to study S. rosetta. He and his colleagues found that C. owczarzaki, too, seemed to be closely related to animals4. Ruiz-Trillo set out to study lineages other than choanoflagellates, because investigating several lineages could provide a fuller picture of the shared ancestor with animals. After sequencing the genome of C. owczarzaki, Ruiz-Trillo and his team reported in 2013 that it has many genes related to multicellularity, including some that choanoflagellates lack — such as those that encode cell-surface proteins called integrins, which help cells to stick to each other and to their environment8.\n\nThese bizarre ancient species are rewriting animal evolution\n\nDiscovered in 2002 inside a freshwater snail, C. owczarzaki spends most of its life cycle as a unicellular amoeba, but environmental cues can push the cells into a multicellular phase in which clusters swarm together and fuse into increasingly large aggregates. This path to multicellularity is different from the clustering through clonal division observed in choanoflagellates. Ruiz-Trillo says that clonal division is “the standard way in which people were thinking animals evolve”.\n\nDuring development in animals, a single cell divides into many cells with identical genomes, a process that probably avoids any genetic conflict arising between cells. It’s therefore an easy leap to assume that clonal division was also the evolutionary path to the first animals, Ruiz-Trillo says. But aggregation exists in many eukaryotic lineages as a fast and easy way for cells to form 3D structures, and he thinks this mechanism deserves a closer look.\n\nRuiz-Trillo and his colleagues found that C. owczarzaki uses some key genes related to multicellularity during this aggregated phase9. Perhaps aggregation was the essential step in the evolution of animals, Ruiz-Trillo says, or perhaps it was just one part of the process.\n\nCapsaspora owczarzaki is one of a handful of unicellular species that Casacuberta and Ruiz-Trillo happily send to other labs on request.\n\nThe dualist\nIn water from a tide pool, a colony of Choanoeca flexa cells that has taken on a cupped shape reverses its curvature. Another colony joins it, and their curvatures reverse again.Credit: Benjamin T. Larson\n\nThe serendipitous discovery in 2017 of another species of choanoflagellate, Choanoeca flexa, demonstrated how much variation exists in this group alone. Thibaut Brunet, an evolutionary cell biologist now at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, found C. flexa in Curaçao, with his colleagues while attending a workshop as postdoc in King’s lab. After collecting water samples from shallow marine tide pools while touring the island, he and his colleagues gaped at the scene under the microscope.\n\nIndividual cells, which look much like S. rosetta cells, form a cupped monolayer sheet, with all the flagella pointing in the same direction10. In response to light or darkness, “they could reverse their curvature in a few seconds, flipping inside out like a child’s toy or an umbrella”, says Brunet. “We were screaming and jumping up and down when we saw it — we were probably ridiculous.”\n\nThe secret lives of cells — as never seen before\n\nAlthough researchers are still developing methods to manipulate its genome, C. flexa has at least one big benefit as a model organism. Other organisms have been studied only in the lab after they were discovered, says evolutionary biologist Núria Ros-Rocher, a postdoc in Brunet’s lab. Researchers don’t know how or where to find them again. But C. flexa has been retrieved repeatedly from the tide pools in which it was first found. “We were very lucky, because we could go back to the natural environment to understand how it’s linked to the organism’s multicellular behaviour,” says Ros-Rocher.\n\nThose pools face whiplash changes — water often heats up and evaporates within days, leaving the organism afloat in sharply elevated salinity or beached on dried mud before the tide submerges it again. Brunet and his team found that C. flexa, like S. rosetta, can go from a unicellular to multicellular state by clonal division. But it can use aggregation, too, and sometimes combines both strategies at once.",

It examined the proportion of people in those couples who had one of nine psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance-use disorder and anorexia nervosa.\n\nScientists lack a definitive understanding of what causes people to develop psychiatric disorders — but genetics and environmental factors are both thought to play a part.\n\nThe team found that when one partner was diagnosed with one of the nine conditions, the other was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with the same or another psychiatric condition. Spouses were more likely to have the same conditions than to have different ones, says co-author Chun Chieh Fan, a population and genetics researcher at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\n“The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations,” Fan says. Even changes in psychiatric care over the past 50 years have not shifted the trend, he notes.\n\nOnly OCD, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa showed different patterns across countries. For instance, in Taiwan, married couples were more likely to share OCD than were couples in Nordic countries.\n\nThe study separated people into birth cohorts, from the 1930s to the 1990s, spanning ten-year intervals. For most disorders, the chances of partners sharing a diagnosis increased slightly with each decade, particularly for those with disorders related to substance use.\n\nWhat’s behind the trend?\n\nAlthough the study did not investigate what causes the phenomenon, Fan says three theories could help to explain it. First, people might be attracted to those who resemble them. “Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering, so they attract each other,” he says.\n\nSecond, a shared environment could make partners more alike — a process known as convergence. And third, the societal stigma of having a psychiatric disorder narrows a person’s choice of spouse.\n\nJan Fullerton, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that social and environmental stressors could contribute to a new diagnosis in a previously unaffected partner, particularly if they had milder, undiagnosed symptoms.",

Just as beers come in different flavours, so do beer enthusiasts. That’s according to researchers who found that beer drinkers tasting a series of lagers fall into two distinct categories: those who prefer strong-flavoured chemicals and those who prefer mellow ones.\n\nThe team reported its findings on 18 August at the American Chemical Society meeting in Washington DC.\n\nHow we taste sweetness: long-sought structure of human receptor mapped at last\n\nWhen taste-testing a new beer, researchers tend to rely on trained panelists who can pick out citrus or floral notes in the same way a sommelier can with wine. Devin Peterson, a food scientist at the Ohio State University in Columbus, wanted to go beyond the professionals, to learn what the average beer enthusiast is drawn to, for a better “understanding of what’s driving consumer behaviour”, he told Nature.\n\nSo he and his colleagues tasked about 135 self-proclaimed beer enthusiasts with trying 18 different lagers across 3 tasting sessions and rating them. To level the playing field, the team ensured that the competing beers contained similar percentages of alcohol and had somewhat similar levels of bitterness. Participants evaluated characteristics such as the beers’ sweetness and aroma intensity, and the researchers used mass spectrometry to determine each beer’s predominant flavour chemicals.\n\nThe tasters split into two factions on the basis of their beer rankings, the team found. For the group that preferred stronger flavours, brands such as Samuel Adams and Brooklyn were at the top of the list, and Budweiser was near the bottom. Those who enjoyed a mellower-tasting beer placed the same brands in nearly opposite spots. The two groups are “polar opposites in how they’re responding to the product”, Peterson said during the presentation.",

          "authors": "Elena Hoffer",
          "abstract": "The professional-networking site LinkedIn can be useful for finding like-minded people around the globe.Credit: Yalcin Sonat/Alamy\n\nWhen I started my PhD in 2018, I thought LinkedIn was for only business people — dry, corporate and dominated by people bragging about their latest achievement. I couldn’t imagine spending time on it. But by the end of my PhD in 2023, the networking site had opened doors I didn’t even know existed. So what changed?\n\nDuring my doctorate at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, I helped to organize careers events for PhD students, inviting speakers who had transitioned into jobs outside academia.\n\nI did this because I had seen so many brilliant scientists leave academia not because they weren’t good enough, but because they were exhausted or felt unsupported. But when they tried to leave, there was no guidance or roadmap.\n\nI realized that, if I cared so much about this issue, maybe I should do something about it, so I founded a company to provide a better support system.\n\nBuilding a company means building connections, and I had been told repeatedly: ‘Without a network, you won’t get anywhere.’ So I started looking for one — and that’s how I ended up on LinkedIn.\n\nIt felt a little scary at first — a global platform with one billion users, but with an open structure in which technically anyone can interact with anyone. I started using LinkedIn to find other company founders and like-minded people. One of these was Angela Priest, a hiring manager with two decades of experience building high-performing teams in industry. We met online and both knew right away that we were a great match. We shared professional values, drive and a deep desire to make things better.\n\nWe co-founded Alma.Me in 2024. Our mission is to provide early-career researchers with the tools and knowledge they need to quickly land a job in industry. We do this mainly through suggesting improvements to industry CVs, interview preparation and one-to-one coaching, guiding PhD graduates on how to effectively market themselves to a business audience.\n\nFounding Alma.Me opened the next door. It brought me back to the Karolinska Institute and to its head of doctoral education, Robert (Bob) Harris, who had placed my doctor’s hat on my head during the PhD graduation ceremony six months earlier — a monumental moment for me. I remember thinking: ‘This is the man I need to talk to.’ He’s in charge of doctoral education, so I knew I needed to get him to understand how important career preparation is for new graduates.\n\nBut how do you reach someone like him once you’ve left the university? The answer was through LinkedIn. I started by commenting on a few of his posts, and eventually suggested meeting up for a chat over coffee.\n\nThat conversation changed everything. Bob agreed with Alma.Me’s mission. He truly cares about students. Thanks to him, Alma.Me now offers a career-development course — accredited by the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System —at the Karolinska, something I had never imagined would be possible.\n\nAt that point, I had already achieved some important goals: launching a business with Angela, providing services to help PhD students to transition into careers and getting our course included at a prominent medical university.\n\nBut I didn’t stop there. Bob and I shared a vision for something bigger. Career development was one piece of the puzzle, but we both knew there was more to improve. The question was: how can one or two voices make a difference? We imagined a global collective of people who wanted to rethink the academic ecosystem. So we turned to our networks — especially LinkedIn — and, almost magically, we started finding them.\n\nThat’s how the Academic Think Tank (TATT) was born earlier this year. TATT brings together a select group of researchers, educators and entrepreneurs from all corners of the world with a shared vision of rethinking what academia 2.0 could look like: inclusive, sustainable and human.\n\nWe met five of our ten TATT members through LinkedIn. Our one selection criterion was simple: you have to care. You have to want to improve things and deeply want to make a difference for the people in the system. Our members span the globe — from Texas to Osaka, Japan. I would never have met these people in real life, but LinkedIn made it easy.\n\nElena Hoffer used LinkedIn to help build her business Alma.Me.Credit: Angela Priest",

          "title": "Trial and error: research and the criminal justice system",
          "authors": "Esme Hedley",
          "abstract": "Influenced by economic, social and environmental factors, criminal behaviour is a complex phenomenon. Academics across disciplines as varied as sociology, geography, mathematics and psychology work to understand why and how individuals become involved in and experience the criminal justice system. They also seek to develop strategies for crime prevention, intervention and rehabilitation, and to understand the effectiveness of criminal-justice policies.\n\nIt is important work: globally, around 11 million people are held in penal institutions. And in much of the world, numbers are rising. Many of these correctional facilities are severely overcrowded and deny incarcerated individuals access to food and basic medical care. Estimated government spending per person in prison per day is around €13 (US$15) in Bulgaria, compared with €532 in Norway. Such differences can reflect a country’s approach to punishment and rehabilitation.\n\nScience diversified: The roads less travelled to research careers\n\nThe hidden costs of incarceration include financial and economic pressures faced by family members with a loved one in prison, as well as the psychological toll and social stigma that can come from being incarcerated. In the United States alone, mass incarceration costs the federal government and the families of those involved with the justice system at least $182 billion every year, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a public-policy think tank in Easthampton, Massachusetts.\n\nUndertaking research projects with incarcerated individuals can be particularly affecting. “One of the most significant difficulties as a researcher is navigating the tension between academic objectivity and the emotionally charged narratives that you encounter,” says Kanupriya Sharma, a criminologist at the University of Nottingham, UK, who interviewed imprisoned women in India as part of her PhD work at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nStrong networks are essential for this work, and are often used to find and build trust with those working in, or interacting with, the justice system.\n\nNature’s Careers team spoke to three academics who study crime and criminal-justice systems to gain a better understanding of what it is like to work in these complex and often politicized areas of research.\n\nSADÉ LINDSAY: The pendulum of support\n\nSociologist and assistant professor of public policy and sociology at the Brooks School of Public Policy, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.\n\nMy connection to criminal justice and criminology comes from growing up in a highly disadvantaged and racially segregated neighbourhood in Columbus, Ohio. I have family members who have been caught in a cycle that has shifted them in and out of the prison system. My work revolves around that same system, focusing particularly on how policies and practices, mainly in the context of the United States, shape individuals’ opportunities, health and well-being. These strategies dictate, for example, where people can work after they have been incarcerated, and whether they have access to public goods and services. I tend to focus on racial and ethnic inequalities in these policies, and around drugs and substance use, as well as on alternatives to incarceration.\n\nSade Lindsay is studying the impacts of racial and ethnic disparities in drug-diversion programmes in the United States.Credit: Christian Harsa\n\nI’m currently working on a project with Ohio State University in Columbus looking at the causes and consequences of racial and ethnic disparities in drug-diversion programmes. These offer long-term drug treatment and court supervision instead of a jail sentence. They emerged out of the crack-cocaine epidemic in the 1980s and really took off during the current opioid crisis in the United States. But despite this crisis starting to affect Black and Hispanic folks more than white individuals, especially in Ohio, people of colour are very under-represented in these programmes. Instead, they’re often simply sent to prison, where they might receive treatment but only after completing most or all of their sentence. We’re trying to understand why, through qualitative interviews with participants in the drug courts, and by talking to the judges, coordinators, counsellors and probation officers who run them.\n\nPolitical support for prison reform can swing like a pendulum. We’re seeing the pendulum swing now; the will to support people with criminal records is weakening. There was a real risk of our grant being targeted by one of US President Donald Trump’s many executive orders, especially given that the same funding mechanism was discontinued during Trump’s first term, and we’ve had to change some of our reporting to comply with new federal rules.\n\nScience behind bars: How a Turkish physicist wrote research papers in prison\n\nOur role as researchers is to keep doing the work and keep collecting the evidence, even when the political winds aren’t blowing in our favour. Because that’s how real, lasting change happens — not just through policy changes, but through persistent effort that outlasts any single administration that might come and undo things. It might get trickier to find funding for my research, but there are still foundations and private philanthropists who deeply value this work and are committed to supporting it. The real challenge might be whether drug-treatment courts will remain as willing to open their doors and share their expertise. But that’s exactly why this research is so important.\n\nI’m a researcher because I’m a problem solver. The opportunity to use my research to elevate the voices of folks who would otherwise not be in policy conversations is one of my favourite parts of the job.\n\nI run into lots of people at conferences now who have a connection to the justice system, through their own experience or by way of family or friends. It’s a great thing in criminal-justice work that more of the people doing the research are those who have been affected.\n\nKANUPRIYA SHARMA: Listen to your gut\n\nCriminologist and postdoctoral research fellow in the School of Sociology and Social Policy at the University of Nottingham, UK.\n\nWhile conducting fieldwork in India for my master’s degree at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, I visited women’s prisons thinking that I would hear stories of pain and trauma. Instead, I found that all the women wanted to talk about was love. Many had regained their sense of agency and a feeling of freedom while in prison by entering into romantic relationships with men — whether ones held in different jails, or male security guards or men outside. How imprisoned women formed these relationships intrigued me and became central to my research, and through my PhD thesis I aimed to understand this phenomenon more deeply. I interviewed 127 women across Punjab and Rajasthan, who were imprisoned in barracks located inside male prison complexes or in open, gender-neutral prisons, to explore their pathways to prison and experiences of incarceration.\n\nKanupriya Sharma, a criminologist at the University of Nottingham, UK, highlighted the tensions that can arise between academic objectivity and ‘emotionally charged narratives’.Credit: Kanupriya Sharma\n\nMy doctorate looked at how these women leveraged their social networks, inside and outside prison, to forge intimate relationships with men. Many of the women I spoke with, regardless of whether they were housed in women’s barracks inside male prison complexes or in all-women facilities, encountered male prisoners during court visits when they were transported in the same prison van or held in the same court lock-up during their hearing. They also communicated with men through letters exchanged across facilities, and were often introduced to men outside during visitation hours by fellow female prisoners. Many of the women I spoke to used these relationships to navigate the constraints of imprisonment, reclaim their identities and be accepted by the community when they are released.\n\nIn India, there is so much taboo around extramarital relationships and a woman’s choice, or lack of choice, of a partner. The women I met are challenging patriarchal institutions, prison and society by forming these relationships in a space that deprives them of both these freedoms.\n\nMoving from prison to a PhD",

The findings1 were published in PLoS Biology this week.\n\nThe worm (Paralvinella hessleri) is the only creature to inhabit the hottest part of deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Okinawa Trough in the western Pacific Ocean. The hot, mineral-rich water that shoots up from the sea floor contains high levels of toxic sulfide and arsenic.\n\nResearchers found that the worm accumulates microscopic particles of arsenic on its outer skin cells as well as along its internal organs. This reacts with sulfide from the hydrothermal vent to form small clumps of orpiment, fashioning a microscopic armour around the worm that protects it from the toxic environment.\n\nOrpiment is a naturally occurring arsenic sulfide mineral, often found in hydrothermal and magmatic ore deposits.\n\nThe findings came as a surprise to the research group. In the deep sea, creatures dwell in total darkness and are typically greyish white or adorned in hues of orange to dark red, says co-author Hao Wang, a deep-sea biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Qingdao. It “doesn’t make any sense to make pigment in total darkness,” Wang says.\n\nUnknown mechanism\n\nThe team is yet to discover how arsenic is transported into the creature’s internal organs.",

GHGSat, an emissions-monitoring company in Montreal, Canada, tracks methane leaks from landfill sites and oil rigs. Earth-imaging firm Planet in San Francisco, California, uses more than 200 satellites to record land and infrastructure for the energy, insurance and maritime sectors. Data-analytics company Spire in San Francisco converts radio signals from navigation satellites into estimates of ocean height and wind speed to support weather forecasts. European aerospace firm Airbus operates radar satellites that can be used to study volcanoes, wetlands and sea ice.\n\nSpace agencies are taking note, and several, including the European Space Agency and NASA, are incorporating commercial data into their portfolios to make them available to researchers. Both agencies have defined processes for evaluating externally produced data, providing science-based assessments of the accuracy, geographical targeting and usability of the observations.\n\nGoogle AI model mines trillions of images to create maps of Earth ‘at any place and time’\n\nAs an academic researcher, I have been excited to participate in efforts to increase the adoption of data from commercial satellites to complement publicly provided information. For example, supported by NASA, I have begun to apply GHGSat data to estimate methane emissions from a landfill site in Brazil. I am also exploring how to use data from companies such as Spire to support hurricane risk-reduction efforts in Puerto Rico and Mexico.\n\nI have found that data gathered by commercial organizations are innovative and useful. But I also know that private companies alone cannot provide all the Earth-observation data that the world needs. Nor should they.\n\nAs governments debate science budgets and consider the role of the public and private sectors in environmental monitoring, it can be tempting to look for ways to increase efficiency and move public-sector operations to the private sector. The progress of commercial satellite operators might seem to provide evidence that NASA will not need to operate as many satellites in the future as it does now. Indeed, US President Donald Trump’s budget request for the 2026 fiscal year proposes to cancel NASA funding for several government-operated Earth-observation missions. But this is the wrong lesson to learn from private-sector progress.\n\nInstead, governments and researchers should continue to pursue a balance between the contributions of the commercial and public sectors to environmental monitoring. Satellite-based Earth-observation missions operated by the public sector remain relevant, because they have several unique features.\n\n‘We dissent’: NASA staff declare opposition to Trump cuts\n\nFirst, such missions are set up to answer scientific questions or to maintain public services, such as weather forecasts or flood-response systems. Although commercial Earth-observation companies can contribute, governmental entities should take the lead to ensure that publicly controlled and validated data, models and forecasts are produced — and trusted.",

          "authors": "Freda Kreier",
          "abstract": "The more the body is exposed to extreme heat, the more biological ageing is accelerated.Credit: Patricia de Melo Moreira/AFP via Getty\n\nLong-term exposure to extreme heat events accelerates the body’s ageing process and increases vulnerabilities to heath issues, finds a long-term study of 24,922 people in Taiwan.\n\nThe study, published today in Nature Climate Change1, suggests that moderate increases in cumulative heatwave exposure increase a person’s biological age — to an extent comparable to regular smoking or alcohol consumption. The more extreme-heat events that people were exposed to, the more their organs aged. This is the latest study to show that extreme heat can have invisible effects on the human body and accelerate the biological clock.\n\nExposure to extreme heat, especially over long periods of time, strains organs and can be lethal, but “the fact that heatwaves age us is surprising”, says Paul Beggs, an environmental-health scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who was not involved in the research. “This study is a wake-up call that we are all vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change on our health. It reinforces calls for urgent and deep reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions,” he adds.\n\nAccelerating ageing\n\nAge isn’t just a result of time. Previous studies have linked a number of factors — including environmental and social stress, genetics and medical interventions — to signs of ageing-related physiological changes. This puts people at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and dementia2.\n\nTo study the long-term impacts of heatwaves on ageing, the researchers analysed data from medical examinations between 2008 and 2022. During that time, Taiwan experienced around 30 heatwaves, which the study defined as a period of elevated temperature over several days. The researchers used results from several medical tests, including assessments of liver, lung and kidney function, blood pressure and inflammation, to calculate biological age. They then compared biological age with the total cumulative temperature that participants were probably exposed to on the basis of their address in the two years before their medical visit.\n\nThe study found that the more extreme-heat events that people experienced, the faster they aged — for every extra 1.3 °C a participant was exposed to, around 0.023–0.031 years, on average, was added to their biological clock.\n\n“While the number itself may look small, over time and across populations, this effect can have meaningful public-health implications,” says Cui Guo, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, who led the study.\n\nManual workers and people living in rural areas experienced the largest health impacts, probably because these groups are less likely to have access to air conditioning. But there was an unexpected upside: the impact of heatwaves on ageing decreased over the 15-year study period. The reasons behind this heat adaptation are unclear, but improved access to cooling technology could play a part, Guo says.\n\nStill, “the message is that heat makes you age a bit faster than you normally would, and that this is something you would like to avoid”, says Alexandra Schneider, an environmental epidemiologist at Helmholtz Munich in Germany, who was not involved in the study.\n\nScientists estimate that climate change has made heatwaves 30 times more likely to occur.Credit: Perry Svensson/Alamy",

To collect precious fragments of new coral life, she must carefully synchronize her activities to the Moon’s phases.\n\nCorals breed at or near a full moon, releasing a blizzard of sperm and eggs into shimmering waters, but the unpredictability of which full moon corals choose makes fieldwork a gamble. On one trip “we dove for 60 nights straight” before capturing the magic moment, Hagedorn says.\n\nThe patience and persistence required to collect coral sperm, cryopreserve it, transport it to the laboratory for rearing coral larvae and then releasing them into the ocean could serve her well for another planned mission: a literal moonshot to preserve threatened organisms.\n\nWorking Scientist career profiles\n\nHagedorn, a research scientist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Kāne‘ohe, Hawaii, is part of an interdisciplinary team proposing to build a frozen repository in a permanently shadowed polar area on the far side of the Moon. Initially, the effort would focus on cryopreserving a veritable Noah’s ark of Earth’s animal life. It would start by banking tissue samples from endangered and threatened animals, as well as from priority species. These would include pollinators and ecosystem engineers such as beavers, that, through dam-building, create whole systems of aquatic environments for other organisms. Hagedorn and ten collaborators published the lunar biorepository idea in 2024 in the journal BioScience as a backup plan for biodiversity — a way to introduce life back to Earth, or to other planets, in the event of catastrophic loss (M. Hagedorn et al. BioScience 74, 561–566; 2024).\n\nShe likens the planned repository to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Arctic Norway, which stores seeds of genetic importance for food, agriculture and biodiversity in a rocky cavern deep under an icy mountain held at −18 °C. It’s an ambitious idea that faces many challenges, including a political climate in which science in the United States and beyond is being undermined and underfunded, especially when related to the impacts of climate change. Nevertheless, the lunar biorepository idea is gaining traction and being given serious consideration.\n\n“We wanted something that could act like Svalbard,” but there’s no place on Earth that is naturally cold enough, says Hagedorn. Even Svalbard needs refrigeration to keep its samples frozen. In 2016, extraordinarily warm winter temperatures sent a flood of melt water into the vault’s entrance. It was a wake-up call for a facility thought to be a fail-safe because it is surrounded by permafrost.\n\nThinking big, and extraterrestrially, Hagedorn reasoned that the lunar south pole is spared the vagaries of climate and temperature (see ‘Quick-fire Q&A’). Being stored under the Moon’s surface, also protects the samples from another damaging factor: radiation. Another advantage is the Moon’s lack (so far) of war, violence, natural disasters, overpopulation and resource depletion. Samples could be stored and retrieved using robots similar to the Mars rovers.\n\nAddressing criticism that retrieving samples could be challenging, Hagedorn responds that, barring an apocalypse, “we will be travelling into space regularly in the future”.\n\nQuick-fire Q&A\nIf you could do a site visit for a biorepository on the Moon, would you go?\n\nIn a heartbeat. I would love to go into space. I actually applied to be an astronaut with NASA, but my eyesight was not good enough.\n\nEvery author on our 2024 BioScience paper proposing the biorepository is like me — they’re frustrated astronauts, sci-fi buffs or both.\n\nHow did your biorepository team come together?\n\nAround 2015, I was giving a talk in London about biorepositories in general. I said, “you know, one of the best places we could probably have a biorepository is on the Moon”.\n\nThen, I brought this concept up at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, and the response of my colleagues there was, “this is really stupid — don’t do this”. So I didn’t pursue it, for about four years. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, I had some time, and I decided to get a group together, meeting on Zoom. It just grew from there.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge to getting this project off the ground?\n\nMoney. This project is going to cover so many different areas, from space engineering to ethics, and there are going to be a lot of scientific changes and breakthroughs.\n\nIt’s all new territory; I think that is going to be very exciting. We just have to be patient and try to get some small grants to keep us going. There will be a way.\n\nComposite image of the lunar south pole.Credit: Stocktrek Images/Getty\nLocation, location, location\n\nOne favoured site for a lunar bio-repository lies in a crater some 6 kilometres deep, “way deeper than the Grand Canyon” in Arizona, Hagedorn says. In this permanently shadowed space, the temperature is stable — at or below −196 °C.\n\nProtecting Earth’s life must be a top priority in the rush to stake out lunar sites for industry and research, argue Hagedorn and her co-authors, whose expertise encompasses cryobiology, medicine, engineering, atmospheric research, coral and fish biology, and law and policy. They issued an open call for others to collaborate on this ambitious, decades-long programme.\n\nThe process would start by banking skin samples that contain fibroblast cells. Those fibroblasts are isolated from a cell-culture process, and then cryopreserved. They can later be thawed and transformed into sperm and egg cells from the specific species. Eventually, whole organisms could be reintroduced into their natural habitat.\n\nA sit in the sauna can save endangered frogs\n\nAs proof of concept, the team will test one species on the International Space Station. The researchers plan to cryopreserve pelvic fins from a coral-reef dwelling fish aptly named the starry goby (Asterropteryx semipunctata), and test them in space for sensitivity to radiation and microgravity. They will also refine the optimal storage materials for cryopreserved cells and study how frozen storage in space affects DNA and the ability to derive and culture cells from thawed fin samples.\n\nOnce the team works out the kinks for starry gobies, it wants to expand to other species. There are plans to collaborate with continental-scale sampling already being undertaken by entities such as the National Ecological Observatory Network, which is funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and collects 100,000 biological samples annually from freshwater and terrestrial habitats.\n\nCryobiology, corals and lunar missions were not always Hagedorn’s focus. After earning a PhD in marine biology at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, in 1983, Hagedorn next studied the physiology of electric fishes and a cichlid fish (Astatotilapia burtoni) as a postdoctoral fellow. That research abruptly ended after a boating accident in the Peruvian Amazon claimed the lives of two colleagues. Hagedorn could not bring herself to go back, but realized she wanted to work on the impacts of warming oceans, which led her to bleached and dying coral — the ocean’s canary in the coal mine.\n\nAn article by Canadian molecular physiologist Ken Storey, on the ability of tree frogs to freeze solid in winter and thaw again in spring (K. B. Storey and J. M. Storey Sci. Am. 263, 92–97; 1990), sparked the idea of using cryobiology for ocean conservation work. “Nothing had been done at the time with cryo-preservation of corals,” says Hagedorn. She received a mid-career fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC in 1996 to start work on fish-embryo cryopreservation. In 2004, she transferred her lab group to Hawaii, expanding the scope of her work to include developing techniques for coral cryopreservation.\n\nThe lunar biobank could start with tissue samples from corals and other endangered species.Credit: Andrew Heyward, AIMS\n\nMehmet Toner, a biomedical engineer at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who has known Hagedorn for more than 30 years, says: “I don’t think there’s anyone else in the world who knows coral biology and cryobiology like her.”\n\nToner, Hagedorn and their colleagues are funded by the NSF as part of the ATP-Bio programme, which brings together partners from industry, academia, the non-profit sector and government to investigate how to cryo-preserve and store samples ranging from cells to whole organisms.\n\nToner’s cryobiology research includes work to understand how to freeze and thaw cells without damaging them. “When I learned about the southern lunar pole being in cryogenic temperatures, it sparked my interest,” says Toner, a co-author of the lunar biorepository proposal.\n\nMoonstruck collaborators\n\nThe cryobiology involved in preserving life across a spectrum of biodiversity is extremely complex, he explains. “You’re taking a living thing to −196 °C and bringing it back” to the temperature of its habitat, alive. “I call that a miracle.” At the same time, he notes that cryobiology techniques have advanced significantly in the past 20–30 years. “It’s much more predictable and doable now,” he says.\n\nToner notes that their team is not the only one vying for lunar real estate. “That part of the Moon is becoming very popular,” with scientists also proposing polar craters as sites for mines, telescopes and temporary human habitation. Indeed, NASA’s Artemis programme, which aims to land humans on the Moon again, is encouraging the exploration of lunar resources.\n\nJohn Bischof, a bioengineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and the director of ATP-Bio, notes Hagedorn’s talent for identifying scientists to join their team. “She’ll bring you into the collaboration, show you exactly where you can make the contribution, and explain why it’s so important. So, even before you do anything, you’re just so pumped up,” he says, describing her as enthusiastic and empathetic. “It’s fun to be around somebody like Mary,” says Bischof, describing her as “untethered in a good way”.\n\nThis company claimed to ‘de-extinct’ dire wolves. Then the fighting started\n\nClaire Lager, Hagedorn’s lab manager since 2016, and once her graduate student, notes that “somebody who wants to put things on the Moon has to be optimistic, enthusiastic and very, very charismatic”, and that Hagedorn ticks all the boxes.",

          "abstract": "Revolutionaries in Paris stormed the Bastille as rumours of aristocratic conspiracy swirled in French towns and villages. Credit: Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty\n\nIn 1789, rumours spread like a virus across France: gangs of bandits were attacking villages, destroying crops and terrorizing peasants, mobilized by nobles trying to suppress political unrest. None of it was true. But the resulting panic and upheaval, called the Great Fear, helped to fuel the French Revolution — and provoked a debate that still divides historians.\n\nDid a deliberate effort to advance revolution drive the rumours? Or did they emerge spontaneously, driven by genuine terror? Now, scientists have used the methods of epidemiology to solve the mystery. Drawing on historical records and models developed to trace epidemics, researchers conclude that the fearmongering had rational, not emotional, roots1. “We managed to identify the logic behind the dissemination of the Great Fear,” says Antoine Parent, an economist at University Paris 8 and a co-author of the study, published today in Nature.\n\nUsing data to objectively measure societal events “is the new paradigm for studying human dynamics”, says Walter Quattrociocchi, a computer scientist specializing in complex systems at Sapienza University of Rome, who has studied the spread of misinformation online. The study focuses on “something that we can measure”, he notes. “So, it’s science. It’s not only speculation.”\n\nRevolutionary rumours\n\nThe conspiratorial hearsay that spread across France in July and August of 1789 led peasants to invade castles and destroy land registers, which, in some places, were crucial for the local lord’s claim to authority over estates. The events were among the defining moments of the early days of the French Revolution, a movement that abolished the country’s monarchy, ended feudalism and transformed its political system.\n\nHow conspiracies took root in our culture\n\nParent, whose work involves applying complex system analysis to the study of history, met his co-authors, physicist Stefano Zapperi and pathologist Caterina La Porta at the University of Milan, Italy, at a conference. When he shared his plans to investigate the spread of rumours during the Great Fear, La Porta had an idea. “I said, ‘Why don’t we use the techniques that we use to study epidemics?’”\n\nAs the basis of their analysis, the authors relied on a 1932 book by French historian Georges Lefebvre, who compiled letters and other documents indicating how the rumours travelled from one location to another.\n\nThey also used historical road maps to identify the possible dissemination routes. The information allowed the authors to create a detailed map of the stories’ movement from town to town. “We treated it as a transmission network for an epidemic,” Zapperi says.\n\nThen, the team used a mathematical model developed to study the spread of pathogens to analyse how quickly the alarming stories travelled, the routes they followed and which locations were most susceptible to being ‘infected’ by the tall tales.\n\nGoing viral",

          "abstract": "Researchers and academics have flocked to Bluesky. Credit: Matteo Della Torre/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nPosts about research on Bluesky receive substantially more attention than similar posts on X, formerly called Twitter, according to the first large-scale analysis of science content on Bluesky1. The results suggest that Bluesky users engage with posts more than do users of X.\n\nBluesky has more than 38 million users and shares many features with X, which fell out of favour with some scientists when it was bought by entrepreneur Elon Musk in October 2022. A survey of Nature readers earlier this year suggested that many prefer Bluesky over X to discuss and disseminate their work.\n\nA team of researchers from the United Kingdom and China analysed 2.6 million Bluesky posts published from January 2023 to July 2025. Together, these referenced 532,000 academic articles. The results were posted as a preprint on arXiv last month and have not been peer reviewed.\n\n‘A place of joy’: why scientists are joining the rush to Bluesky\n\nThe team found that almost half of the posts about science on Bluesky garnered at least ten likes, and that one-third were reposted ten or more times. Previous research on X has shown that the proportion of science posts receiving at least ten likes varied between 4% and 7.5%, and that the proportion receiving ten or more reposts ranged from 1.4% to 4.4%2. Interactions on Bluesky were an order of magnitude higher than on X, the researchers said. Quotes — whereby users share posts and add their own text — and replies were nearly two orders of magnitude greater on Bluesky than on X, they said.\n\nThe team also reported that nearly half of Bluesky posts summarized academic articles and that only 6.3% simply mentioned the article name and journal. By contrast, 92% of original X posts about life and earth sciences and 17% of those in engineering and physical sciences referred to little more than the study title, according to a 2018 study in the Journal of Infometrics3. This suggests that research content on Bluesky is more original, says Er-Te Zheng, the latest study’s first author and a PhD student at the University of Sheffield, UK. “While X has primarily served as a dissemination tool, Bluesky may support a more interpretive, reflective mode of science communication.”",

          "authors": "Gareth Thompson",
          "abstract": "A Year with Gilbert White: The First Great Nature Writer Jenny Uglow Faber & Faber (2025)\n\nThe first person to identify harvest mice (Micromys minutus), Gilbert White was an eighteenth-century English curate and naturalist who has been called the ‘father of ecology’. Yet records from his student days show that he was not so much a quiet country gentleman as a lad about town, losing money at cards and buying fancy waistcoats. In her grandly illustrated book A Year with Gilbert White, historian Jenny Uglow looks between these extremes to investigate who White really was.\n\nShe depicts a self-taught biologist who not only enjoyed wining and dining, but also took natural history out of stuffy dissecting rooms and into the wild. Spurning the dry descriptions of wildlife commonly used at the time, White’s only book, The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789), brought colourful character to its scientific records of plants and animals. In doing so, it transformed the art of nature writing.\n\nSwarming bees and greedy sheep\n\nBorn in 1720, White was educated at the University of Oxford, UK, before settling at The Wakes — his family home in Selborne, UK — in around 1757. Then, from 1768, he worked for 25 years on his Naturalist’s Journal, a columnar diary in which each page covered a week of observations on fruit and vegetable experiments, local creatures and weather conditions.\n\nWhite’s daily entries in Selborne were often haiku-like in their simplicity. He described “vast rocklike, distant clouds” or simply stated “Bees swarm much. Sheep are shorn.”\n\nGilbert White added entries to his Naturalist’s Journal every day for 25 years. Credit: Culture Club/Getty\n\nUglow’s book examines one year of journal entries, from 1781. She chose this year for two reasons: it was the mid-point in White’s writing of his book, and a year after Timothy the tortoise arrived, a pet inherited by White that was later found to be female. Timothy often featured in the journal entries, being suspected of amorous longings whenever it wandered off.\n\nUglow compares White’s year in nature with personal sightings at her own home in the Lake District, UK. In January, centuries and miles apart, White logs the chatter of nuthatches (Sitta spp.) while Uglow searches for eelworms (nematodes). Originally, Uglow thought of toadflax (Linaria spp.) as a weed, but White’s delight in its loveliness makes her reconsider. They share a gardener’s irritation with field mice. They each find beauty in autumnal beeches (Fagus spp.). Tulips in both of their gardens are destroyed — White’s by rain, Uglow’s by greedy sheep about whom she jibes, “They have left the daffodils, in disdain”.\n\nShould we treat rivers as living things?\n\nSelborne was not a safe haven for animals, it was a working community. For low-paid labourers, it was a case of human rights over nature’s rites. Birds were routinely shot if they were harmful to crops or livestock. “The air crackles with fear and rage,” writes Uglow, as she relays White’s account of a farmer and his hens tormenting a captured hawk to death.\n\nUglow also traces the publication of White’s book from its germination to its blossoming. It has remained in print since 1789 and came about when White realized the literary potential of the letters he’d written to fellow naturalists Daines Barrington and Thomas Pennant. For publication, he revised these old letters and added entries from his journals to give an intricate view of Selborne’s natural world. The work inspired a youthful Charles Darwin, who went on a pilgrimage to Selborne in 1857.\n\nBut perhaps White’s greatest legacy lies in the chronicling of avian sights and sounds. He kept lists of which birds sang until midsummer and which all year round. Detecting the nocturnal stone-curlew’s cry, he surmised that night-time fliers sent noisy signals to keep their flocks together after dark. Birdsong so obsessed White that he identified three different species of leaf warbler (the chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix) and willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus)) by their tunes.\n\nBirds from Gilbert White’s journals feature in a stained-glass window in a Selborne church.Credit: RDImages/Epics/Getty",

          "title": "Autism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "On 16 April, Robert F. Kennedy Jr held a press conference about rising diagnoses of autism. The US Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary pointed to new data showing that autism prevalence in the United States had risen steeply from one in 150 eight-year-olds in 2000 to one in 31 in 2022. He called it an “epidemic” caused by “an environmental toxin” — and said he would soon be announcing a study to find the responsible agent.\n\nThe next month, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the department that Kennedy leads, announced the Autism Data Science Initiative (ADSI). The initiative offered up to US$50 million to fund studies on the causes of autism. The winning applications are expected to be announced in September.\n\nUsually, big investments in research are welcomed by scientists — but not this time. Many were dismayed that these developments seemed to ignore decades of work on the well-documented rise in autism diagnoses and on causes of the developmental condition. Although Kennedy said that environmental factors are the main cause of autism, research has shown that genetics plays a bigger part. Population studies1 have linked a handful of environmental factors — mostly encountered during pregnancy — to increased chances of autism, but their precise role has been hard to pin down. More than anything, research has shown that the drivers of autism are fiendishly complicated. “There will never be a sound-bite answer to what causes autism,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist who studies neurodevelopmental conditions at Boston University, Massachusetts.\n\nHow to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes\n\nThe rise in prevalence, many researchers say, is predominantly caused by an increase in diagnoses rather than a true rise in the underlying symptoms and traits. “We don’t see an epidemic of autism, but we see an ‘epidemic’ of diagnoses,” says Sven Bölte, a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatric science at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Researchers are concerned that Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate, will use the ADSI to promote the disproven idea that vaccines are linked to autism.\n\nKennedy’s comments prompted equally strong reactions from autistic people and autism groups, says Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, a non-profit research and advocacy group in New York City. Autistic people have a wide range of traits and symptoms — that means that many live and work independently, whereas others need intensive support. Some people want more research into the causes, she says, and others don’t.\n\nBut many people in the autism community found it demeaning and offensive when Kennedy said at the press conference that “these are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job”. These factors do not determine a person’s value, Halladay says — and many autistic people are employed and pay taxes.\n\nScientists and autistic people alike are also concerned that the administration of US President Donald Trump is actually cutting the overall amount of money going towards autism research and support for autistic people, including through cancelled or delayed grants. “Everyone is really, really upset that money is being taken away from these important research projects,” Halladay says.\n\nWhat explains the rise?\n\nMany studies suggest that the prevalence of autism is rising, and not just in the United States. The trend has been observed in other high-income countries, including the United Kingdom, Denmark, South Korea and Japan. “Everywhere people are doing research and are looking at the numbers, [they] are going up,” Bölte says (see ‘Tallying autism diagnoses’). In some less wealthy countries, however, a lack of health services and data mean that prevalence is difficult to assess.\n\nSource: Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring NetworkSource: Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network\n\nThere are several reasons to think that a rise in diagnoses explains a large part of this trend. One is that the diagnostic criteria have changed over time in two periodically updated tools used by health professionals: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), used mainly in the United States, and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).\n\nThese describe autistic people generally as showing differences in social interaction and communication, as well as having ‘restricted and repetitive behaviours and interests’. But until the early 1990s, the manuals had a narrow definition for autism, says Diana Schendel, an epidemiologist who studies autism at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For instance, the third edition of the DSM recognized autism only in young children and required that they meet a minimum number of criteria.\n\nUpdated versions of both handbooks — ICD-10 in 1990 and DSM-IV in 1994 — broadened the diagnostic criteria so that they could be applied to people with fewer symptoms and of different ages. “That dramatically changed the opportunity for individuals to be classified under the autism umbrella,” says Schendel. In 2013, DSM-V dropped some separate diagnoses, such as Asperger’s syndrome, and subsumed them under the term autism spectrum disorder. Autism is commonly diagnosed with co-occurring conditions, such as intellectual disability or attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nHow to be a brilliant ally to your neurodivergent lab mate\n\nA 2015 study that Schendel co-authored tried to quantify the causes of increased autism prevalence among Danish people born between 1980 and 1991, and diagnosed up to 2011. The authors estimated that 60% of the increase could be explained by changes in the early 1990s to diagnostic criteria and to the way in which diagnoses were reported to national health registries2.\n\nDiagnoses have also risen as health professionals have adjusted how they interpret and apply the criteria, and as they have adopted improved standardized diagnostic tools, such as structured interviews and observations. Eva Loth, a cognitive neuroscientist at King’s College London, says that she now diagnoses people in research projects whom she would have excluded ten years ago. “Our understanding of what autism is has changed,” says Loth.\n\nThe other change that has turbocharged diagnoses, researchers say, is increased awareness of autism and declining stigma among teachers, health professionals and the broader public, alongside increased availability of diagnostic and support services. Parents are more likely to observe signs of autism in children and are often incentivized to seek a diagnosis if it can help their child to access support, such as at school. “Where before a child might be classified as difficult, problematic in a classroom, now they might go seek a diagnosis,” says Nick Puts, who studies neurodevelopment at King’s College London and is autistic.\n\nChildren are also receiving diagnoses at a younger age than in the past. More adults are seeking diagnoses, and they have become more common in girls and women, in whom autism has historically been overlooked.\n\nBölte argues that the high demands of modern schools — such as extensive group work and digital information — could also play a part. “The learning environment is extremely complex today,” he says, “and there’s more and more children with maybe lesser traits or symptoms who are just kind of overwhelmed.” Similarly, more adults — navigating a highly complex world — might be seeking help and advice, leading to more autism diagnoses.\n\nHow much of the rise in autism is accounted for by increased diagnoses and awareness? “It’s certainly the vast majority,” Schendel says, although the exact proportion is difficult to calculate.\n\nHow prevalent is autism now?\n\nThe figure that Kennedy cited — a prevalence of one in 31 among eight-year-olds — stems from an April report by the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network3, a US surveillance programme that tallies autism in children using health and education records (see ‘Autism prevalence across the United States’). These show who has received a diagnosis and who is eligible for autism-related education. The results from this type of study are sometimes called registry or administrative prevalence, because they are based on administrative databases.\n\nSource: Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring NetworkSource: Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network\n\nBut some researchers view such studies with caution, says Damian Santomauro, a mental-health epidemiologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. Identification of autism can come from various sources, including psychiatrists, psychologists and educational settings. Some children who have extra behavioural or educational needs might be included in an administrative database, but would not meet stringent criteria for diagnosis in an independent clinical evaluation, Santomauro says. Conversely, some people with undiagnosed autism might be excluded from registries.\n\nA more accurate way to estimate prevalence is through a population survey, in which researchers screen everyone in a representative group of children or adults for autism. Santomauro led the most recent report on autism by the Global Burden of Disease study (the largest scientific project on impacts of health conditions), which is based only on survey data. This estimated that autism spectrum disorder had a prevalence of one in 127 people globally (less than 1%) in 2021. That’s 62 million people overall4.\n\nHow to speak to a vaccine sceptic: research reveals what works\n\nA long-term study of Swedish children, published this year, compared registry and survey prevalence in children who were born between 1993 and 2001. It found that the prevalence of autism symptoms that parents reported when their children reached 18 had remained stable, even as the prevalence of registered diagnoses had gone up5. And most of the increase in prevalence seen in studies comes from diagnoses of autistic people who do not have language impairment or a co-occurring intellectual disability, Tager-Flusberg says, whereas numbers of diagnosed autistic people with these conditions have changed little, if at all. All of this adds weight to the argument that spiking autism statistics are driven mostly by improved detection and diagnoses.\n\nBut Santomauro says that other high-quality surveys have made him think twice. A study published in 2020 that used rigorous survey methods reported a prevalence of more than 3% in five-year-old children in Japan — higher than previous estimates for autism in some other Asian countries6. So, although Santomauro agrees that most of the rise in autism is explained by increased detection and diagnosis, he says it remains possible that something could be pushing up “true prevalence” as well. But what?\n\nWhat causes autism?\n\nResearchers have been hunting for the causes of autism for decades — and have run up against difficulties at every step. “We just don’t really understand a lot about how any human brain functions,” says James Cusack, chief executive of Autistica, a UK autism research and campaigning charity in London, who has worked in autism research and is autistic. “So trying to find causal mechanisms for autism is, I think, much harder than people thought it was going to be 20 years ago.”\n\nOne broad conclusion to emerge from the available data is that genetics plays a huge part. “Family-history risk is probably the strongest risk factor there is,” says Schendel.\n\nResearchers capture the genetic contribution using measures of heritability – an estimate of how much of the differences in autism traits between individuals can be explained by inherited genes rather than by environmental factors. A large, five-country study7 published in 2019 estimated the heritability of autism as about 80% — equivalent to the heritability of height. For comparison, the heritability estimates for depression are roughly 30–50%.\n\nIdentifying the individual genes involved, however, has proved tough. “The genetics themselves are wildly complex,” says Craig Newschaffer, an autism researcher at Pennsylvania State University in University Park.\n\nResearchers have sought genes by comparing the genomes of autistic people and people who are not autistic in families and in bigger population studies. These have helped to pinpoint a selection of rare genetic variants — variations in DNA sequence — that cause a relatively large increase in the chances of autism. Many of these are de novo mutations that probably arose in a sperm or egg cell and were passed to a child. These large-impact variants are thought to be a major driver of autism in an estimated 10–20% of autistic people.\n\nBut “the genetic architecture is very different from one individual to another”, says geneticist Thomas Bourgeron, who studies autism at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Researchers have also found that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of common variants have a tiny effect individually — making them hard to pinpoint — but a big effect when combined. If someone has enough variants, they could end up with symptoms and a diagnosis.\n\nAfter genetics, environmental factors are “a smaller slice of the pie” in driving autism, Schendel says, although there is debate about the size of the slice. Some researchers argue that the influence of environmental factors is vanishingly small, and others disagree. Most research suggests that any environmental factors exert their influence before birth, however, and studies have convincingly shown no link to vaccines8,9.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr held an April press conference about the increase in autism prevalence.Credit: Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters\n\nMany studies suggest that older parental age — for mothers or fathers — is linked to an increased likelihood of autism in children10. The average childbearing age has been increasing in many high-income countries, so this could be playing a small part in increasing autism prevalence, researchers say. One possible explanation is that children of older parents are more likely to have de novo mutations than are children of younger parents.\n\nInfections during pregnancy have also been linked in many studies to a greater chance of autism, as has exposure to air pollution before birth. For instance, a US study published in June, involving more than 8,000 children and their mothers, found that exposure to higher levels of ozone was associated with autism11.",

          "title": "Why scientists are flocking to Substack",
          "authors": "Hannah Docter-Loeb",
          "abstract": "Adapted from Filo/Getty\n\nLike many epidemiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic, Katelyn Jetelina turned to social media to help keep people informed. It was the spring of 2020, and Jetelina, then at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, frequently posted content on viral transmission and vaccines to her Facebook and Instagram pages. That is, until she was hacked.\n\nIn February 2021, a group of anti-vaccine activists found a way into both accounts, using her platform to post and promote a different rhetoric. They even asked her followers to upload their COVID-19 vaccination cards for a chance to win US$1,000, in a bid to gain personal information. It was at this point that Jetelina decided she had to make a change. “It was heartbreaking to me: I had lost all of my content, and all of the blood, sweat and tears I had put into it,” she recalled. “I decided to move on to a platform where I had a whole lot more ownership.”\n\nScientists are falling victim to deepfake AI video scams — here’s how to fight back\n\nThe most obvious choice for her was Substack, an independent writing and e-mailing platform. It’s lauded for its newsletter features — sending posts into the inboxes of subscribers — but content is also available on the site, as with a standard blog. One feature she especially liked, given her past experiences, was that her data was transferable: if you decide to leave, or have to leave, you can take a list of subscriber e-mails with you. On 8 February 2021, Jetelina started putting more energy into her Substack publication, which she calls Your Local Epidemiologist.\n\nAlthough she eventually regained control of her social-media accounts, and her team still posts infographics and videos there, Jetelina says Substack enables her to connect with followers in a different way. As she explains it, the e-mail newsletter platform is more conducive to longer-form and more-nuanced discussions, which aren’t always possible on other forms of social media. Readers subscribe to her specifically, and content goes directly to their inbox, fostering more intimate and close-knit interactions. She says she’s come to know the readers well. “I can now have a two-way relationship with the audience, engaging with them through the comment and chat sections.”\n\nOver the past few years, the newsletter has garnered a strong following and now has more than 400,000 subscribers. What was once a one-woman show is now run by a team of copy editors, social-media creators, administrative assistants and other contributors. It’s also now Jetelina’s main job, she says. And as the pandemic public-health emergency has “faded into the rear-view mirror”, her content has had to change. Jetelina now aims to show the community that public health goes beyond a pandemic and infectious diseases, and writes about topics such as reproductive health, gun violence and mental health. “I’m really trying to focus on how to equip people with the tools to live an evidence-based life,” she says.\n\nKatelyn Jetelina switched to Substack after a group of anti-vaccine activists hacked her Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nFounded in 2017, Substack is meant to give a platform to independent writers, and provides a means for them to monetize their work through paywalls and donations. It’s grown rapidly and now has tens of millions of subscribers, and more than five million paid subscribers. The platform also raised $100 million to expand operations, giving the company a value of $1.1 billion. And it’s not exclusively for scientists: many other academics, as well as journalists and even novelists, have built up a community on the platform.\n\n“Substack is home to a growing number of respected academics and researchers who use the platform to share evidence-based work directly with the public,” a spokesperson told Nature. “For many, it’s a way to reach people more quickly and openly, while still maintaining depth and rigour.”\n\nNot every scientist has a following as large as that of Your Local Epidemiologist, which currently ranks number one on the list of paid science newsletters on Substacks. But other academics and scientists across various disciplines have gravitated towards the platform as a way to promote research and connect with the public.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nNonetheless, the site has its drawbacks. It can take a while to build a following, and making a profit can be hard work. Not only that, but many of the platform’s top science and health-politics newsletters promote anti-vaccine ideology or pseudoscience. “It’s the wild, wild west being on Substack, but right now this is the same on any sort of social-media platform,” says Jetelina. (A Substack spokesperson said that it would be inaccurate to characterize “a majority” of the top science writers as anti-vax.)\n\nStacking up\n\nSubstack and other subscription-based content services — such as Ghost, Mailchimp, Patreon, Beehiiv and Medium — market themselves as being more effective at reaching people than are conventional social media. This is partially backed by marketing data. According to Mailchimp, a US e-mail marketing platform, about 35% of users open e-mails from companies in the education and training sector; for other industries, the proportion is 30–40%. In a recent thread on Substack, writers shared the rates at which their subscribers opened their newsletters, and the proportions ranged from 30% to 70%.\n\nKimberly Nicholas, a sustainability researcher at Lund University, Sweden, whose Substack publication We Can Fix It approaches the climate crisis “with facts, feelings, and action”, says her e-mail newsletters are clicked on and opened more than her social-media posts.\n\nThe site also helps to foster an environment of community engagement. For Jonathan Tonkin, an ecologist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, the social-media platform X “was a really useful tool for scientists to communicate with other scientists, but in terms of reaching the public it wasn’t happening, to be honest”. Tonkin now authors a Substack publication called Predirections. “It’s good, I think, for reaching people who are interested in science and are not scientists,” he says.\n\nJonathan Tonkin found that Substack was much more effective than the social-media platform X as a means of engaging with interested non-scientists.Credit: Prime Minister’s Science Prizes Secretariat\n\nAccording to Similarweb, a traffic-analytics website, Substack’s audience is pretty evenly split between men and women. It skews a bit towards younger readers: the largest group consists of those aged 25–34. Users also tend to be based in the United States, with with about 62% of traffic coming from there in July 2025.\n\n“Scientific subjects are nuanced, and trying to distill that into 140 characters doesn't work very well, or leaves people confused,” adds Hannah Ritchie, a data scientist at the University of Oxford, UK. Ritchie’s Substack publication, Sustainability by Numbers, looks at potential routes to sustainability through an evidence-based lens. Putting together an e-mail, she says, “gives scientists a bit more room to describe the nuances”.\n\nHannah Ritchie points out that Substack frees writers from the constraints associated with more-formal means of publication, such as journals.Credit: Angela Catlin\n\nThen there’s the potential for monetization. Most of the scientists Nature spoke to emphasized that their content is free, but the site gives writers the ability to set up paywalls. According to Jetelina, 7% of her subscribers pay for her content. Although the platform takes a cut, she’s been able to generate enough revenue to quit her full-time job and focus mainly on the newsletter. (Jetelina did not want to share her earnings with Nature, but in 2022, the monthly magazine Vanity Fair reported that she made about $300,000 in the publication’s first nine months).\n\nScientists also highlight that Substack offers more freedom than do other modes of publishing science — in journals, for example, or through guest contributions to online publications such The Conversation. As Ritchie explains, there’s often a lengthy editorial process in these more-formal systems, and writers can be constrained by the requirements of the publication. “The timeline is massively extended compared to what you can do on Substack, where you can have your own audience: you can say what you want, when you want to say it.”",

          "authors": "Jonathan O’Callaghan",
          "abstract": "The mission control room in Houston, Texas, after Apollo 11 touched landed on the Moon in 1969 carrying Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong.Credit: NASA\n\nSome 650 million people around the world watched with bated breath as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin touched down on the Moon in 1969. With just seconds of fuel remaining, the success of the nail-biting Apollo 11 landing was sealed with a single line uttered by Armstrong: “Houston, Tranquility Base here,” he radioed back to mission command’s base in Texas. “The Eagle has landed.”\n\nThat immortal moment highlights the ever-present role that Texas has had in space flight. “Everyone recognizes Texas as a space leader,” says Mitrah Avini, a policy adviser for the Dallas-based non-profit organization Texas 2036.\n\nAnd the state’s space sector is rapidly expanding. The World Economic Forum predicts that the global space economy will grow from US$630 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2035, driven by rising commercial investment and demand for space-based services, and Texas wants a part of that action. Today, the state hosts more than 10% of the US aerospace workforce, around 200,000 workers, behind only California and Washington.\n\n“The Texas legislature has invested a significant amount of money into the space industry,” says Kyle DeMars, an aerospace engineer at Texas A&M University in College Station. “If I were a student looking to break into the space industry, I would follow the innovation, and Texas is where that is.”\n\nStellar prospects\n\nAlready, 18 of the 20 largest aerospace manufacturing companies in the United States operate in Texas, and the state has seen a proliferation of smaller start-up firms. Drawn by the allure of large parcels of land for building facilities, and by proximity to renowned institutions such as NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, more than 500 space-sector companies have set up shop in Texas since 2019, taking the state’s total to around 2,000.\n\nNature Career Guide: Texas\n\nIn July 2024, Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, said the company would shift its headquarters from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, a purpose-built facility in Boca Chica, on the Gulf Coast of South Texas. The most valuable space company in the world, SpaceX has been using the facility to develop and launch its Starship rocket, designed to take humans to the Moon and eventually Mars. Musk cited ideological differences with California’s state governor as the reason behind the relocation.\n\nTexas’s tax advantages also make it an attractive destination for high earners and big businesses. Currently, Texas has no state income tax, and it imposes a relatively low corporate levy through its ‘franchise tax’ — which, for most companies, is 0.75% of their revenue. California, by contrast, has a state income-tax rate of 13.3% on its highest earners, and an 8.84% profit-based corporate tax levy.\n\nFurther sweetening the deal, the Texas House of Representatives approved a bill in May that exempts from franchise tax all businesses operating spaceports used by the US Department of Defense. State Representative Stan Gerdes said the measure was expected to attract more business and talent to the state. However, companies will still have to pay Texas property taxes, which are some of the highest in the country.\n\nNASA astronaut Jessica Watkins trains for a spacewalk at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.Credit: Norah Moran/NASA/Johnson Space Center\n\nAttracting companies such as SpaceX creates an incentive for other firms to move there, says Avini. “When you have leaders in a particular industry located in the state, it gives the impression it is a hub of activity,” she says. “It attracts interest from start-ups and others.”\n\nTexan companies also benefit from NASA’s strong presence in the state, which opens opportunities for commercial partnerships and access to federal contracts. In 2023, NASA awarded 10% of its procurement contracts, worth around $2.3 billion, to businesses that operate in Texas: $53million went to Boeing, and $18.9 million to KBR Wyle Services in Houston; the agency also supported 2,997 federal employees and 17,359 Texan-based contractors.\n\nHere’s how to break into the Texas space industry\n\nLike many government agencies, however, NASA faces deep cuts to its funding, especially to its scientific-research arm. In May, the White House released a budget proposal that would have cut NASA’s overall funding by 24%. Two months later, on 10 July, the US Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill to maintain current levels of NASA funding, rejecting the proposed cuts. The bill, which will shape NASA’s 2026 spending allocations, will now move to the full Senate and the House of Representatives for consideration, and is due to be finalized later this year.\n\nYet parts of NASA have found a reprieve with the release of the federal government’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’, a budget reconciliation bill signed into law by President Donald Trump on 4 July. The space agency is set to receive $10 billion in funding over the next six years from the bill, which includes allocations for the Moon-exploration programme Artemis and around $300 million for upgrades to the JSC.\n\nCasey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a space advocacy organization based in Pasadena, California, says that Trump’s NASA budget proposal would have phased out key Artemis components, including the Space Launch System, the Orion crewed spacecraft and the Gateway space station. This would have had “significant impacts” for Texas — as would cutting staff numbers by “upwards of 20%” at the JSC. “However, the recent ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ countermanded that proposal and provided billions of additional dollars to those projects, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars for infrastructure and construction at the JSC.”\n\nSpaceX launches Starship in Texas in 2024.Credit: Joe Marino/UPI/Shutterstock\n\nIn the commercial sector, a shift in funding would probably favour big industry players while disadvantaging others, says Dreier. “Generally, the commercial space industry retains a lot of support in the White House proposal. But it’s important to note that the commercial industry does not provide services for free: NASA is their customer, so any reductions in spending could impact businesses in the private sector as well.”\n\nWhen it comes to the country’s proposed exploration of the Moon and Mars, Dreier says that a few firms — such as SpaceX, or Blue Origin in Kent, Washington — could theoretically deliver cargo and crew to these target destinations. But the capabilities don’t yet exist, he adds, and would be a gamble to develop without long-term government support.\n\nNew offerings\n\nDespite cuts to the public sector, the growth of the overall space sector in Texas is “exponential” at the moment, says Clint Dawson, chair of the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin. This has had a knock-on effect for academia.\n\n“We’ve seen tremendous growth in applications to aerospace programmes,” he says. “Last year we got about 2,000 applicants for roughly 200 freshman slots,” signalling a shift in student priorities from previous years. “This year it’s closer to 3,000 applicants.”\n\nThis increase in demand prompted Texas governor Greg Abbott to call last March for more universities in the state to offer space-engineering programmes. Texas A&M obliged: it now offers “a very specific space-engineering degree programme at both undergraduate and graduate levels”, says former astronaut Nancy Currie-Gregg, an engineer at Texas A&M who is also on the board of directors for the Texas Space Commission. “We expect the first students will start in 2026.” The new programme will focus on the growing space industry in Texas, and will include an Introduction to Space course covering orbital mechanics and environmental control systems.\n\n“There are plenty of degree programmes, including here at Texas A&M, that focus on things like propulsion and hypersonics — the things that get you to and from space — and even on the space environment, but this would be one of the first undergraduate degrees that focuses on the multidisciplinary engineering nature of what happens once you get there,” says Demars.\n\nTexas A&M Space Institute director Nancy Currie-Gregg with deputy director Robert Ambrose.Credit: Yi-Chin Lee/Houston Chronicle via Getty\n\nCurrie-Gregg adds that demand is already high for courses such as this. “Every seat is filled” in her space-engineering courses, she says. “I have 100 students this semester, and not everybody could get into the class that wanted to.”",

          "abstract": "Credit: Xijing Hospital of the Air Force Medical University/Xinhua via Alamy\n\nA lung from a genetically modified pig has been transplanted into a person for the first time1. The recipient, a 39-year-old man in China, was brain dead, but the organ survived for nine days.\n\nAt least half a dozen people in the United States and China have received organs from genome-edited pigs, including hearts, kidneys, livers and a thymus. The latest procedure suggests that almost any pig organ could be transplanted into people, researchers say. They hope that such organs might one day save the thousands of people who die each year while waiting for a donor organ.\n\nLungs are the most difficult organ to transplant, says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a surgeon and researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, who in 2022 led the first pig-heart transplant into a living person. Lungs have the most blood vessels of any transplantable organ, so are more prone to attack from the immune system, which can lead to blood clots and tissue damage, says Mohiuddin. “I applaud their effort,” he says: “it’s a first step” towards lung xenotransplantation, the use of organs from other species in humans. US clinical trials for pig livers and pig kidneys were approved this year.\n\nProof of concept\n\nThe transplanted left lung was taken from a pig with six genomic edits that was created by research firm Chengdu Clonorgan Biotechnology in China. This included removing three genes to reduce the risk of the organ triggering an immune response and adding three human genes to protect the organ from rejection. In the proof-of-concept trial, the lung was transplanted on 15 May last year by researchers at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China. Their findings were published this week in Nature Medicine.\n\nThe team reports that there were no signs of rejection, infection or graft failure in the first three days after surgery. However, 24 hours after the transplant, the researchers noticed that the lung was swelling, and that the tissue had been damaged after going without oxygen for a period of time during the transplant procedure. They also observed damage caused by antibodies attacking the organ on days three and six, but noted that the damage to the lung had reduced on day nine, when the study was stopped at the request of the recipient’s family.",

          "abstract": "Postdoctoral researcher Srihari Menon says having a diverse skill set is an advantage in the space industry.Credit: Srihari Menon\n\nThey say everything is bigger in Texas — and the aerospace industry is no different. A report1 published this year by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) ranked Texas as the top US state for aerospace manufacturing attractiveness. PwC, a multinational services firm based in London, scores each state on metrics such as industry growth, the local economy and tax policies. The sector itself is expanding; the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that countrywide employment for aerospace engineers will grow faster than average between 2023 and 2033, with more than 4,000 job openings expected each year.\n\nNature Career Guide: Texas\n\nAlthough proposed NASA budget cuts from the administration of US President Donald Trump, which are due to be ratified later this year, will probably reverberate across the industry, they are likely to be ameliorated by the country’s status as the global leader in military spending. One-quarter of that spending is devoted to the aerospace and defence sector, according to PwC. Texas’s economy is especially bolstered by the commercial space industry — 18 of the largest aerospace companies call the region home — and by increased investment from the Texas Space Commission, which was launched in March last year.\n\nHere, four space specialists talk about the evolution of the state’s aerospace industry and the advice for those looking to enter the field.\n\nDAVID SILVA: The importance of being a life-long learner\n\nProfessor of physics and astronomy and director of the Center for Space Technology and Operations Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\nFor undergraduate students, I think it’s beneficial to start their careers here in Texas because the cost of a degree is more affordable compared with in other states. The state subsidizes higher education through state support and reinvestment of fossil-fuel and mineral-extraction fees: the annual in-state college tuition in Texas is roughly US$1,500 less than the national average.\n\nUnlike academia, the private industry is not necessarily looking for people with post-doctoral experience. Companies want people as early as they can get them, both because they like the energy of recently trained engineers, but also because there’s a certain amount of retraining or training that an individual will need to complete when a company has a specific mission. In the next few years, Texas will be proving the economic business case of this industry, but I think that there’s going to be enough demand driven by national-security objectives for students to find opportunities irrespective of the NASA funding cuts. It might be that the total federal investment in space technology will increase over time, especially in the military and intelligence fields.\n\nDavid Silva (centre) says that there are plenty of opportunities for recently trained engineers in the Texas space industry.Credit: Ryan Schoensee\n\nIn my experience, space enterprise start-up companies in the state are looking for graduates who can cover a large variety of engineering fields, including electronics, power, structures and artificial intelligence, but they’re also looking for scientists who are willing to work on not only basic research but also on applied science and technical problems. A nice example of this type of problem is building habitats on the Moon. You need to understand the geophysical, chemical and structural properties of the lunar surface and how this evolved from impacts by solids and solar wind to answer questions such as, ‘Can a given material be used to build habitats?’ or ‘How do you form bricks that are stable in an environment without an atmosphere or water?’\n\nA common thread is that these companies are really looking for people who are willing to be life-long learners. This means that graduates with a variety of science and engineering backgrounds can make great candidates for working in the space industry. It also means that students with a more conventional space-industry experience might not want to focus on one field but instead be generalists. Some advice that I would give to students is that during your scientific training, the more you can work on actual projects and get out of the classroom, the more attractive you're going to be in the marketplace. It’s my experience that potential employers care a lot more about actual experience than they do about grades. At the University of Texas at San Antonio, this is something we’ve leaned into by making sure that our engineering students are doing senior projects on challenges set by local companies, so that in the final year of their degrees they’re working on an applied project.\n\nLLOYD WENDT: Landing the first gig\n\nSenior recruiter at Venus Aerospace in Houston, Texas.\n\nWe see new recruits with backgrounds that run the gamut, including expertise in propulsion, aeronautics and astronautics, software engineering and mechanical engineering. At Venus, where we work to develop reusable hypersonic technologies — such as rocket engines — junior-level roles might require a bachelor’s degree but mid- to top-level roles are typically filled by candidates with a master’s or PhD in that niche area.\n\nAs a senior recruiter, Lloyd Wendt suggests that joining clubs and connecting with alumni can help to secure work experience.Credit: Rachael Yates\n\nIn these specialized areas, such as vehicle engineering, it can be beneficial to bring a multifaceted skill set, for example an understanding of not just the analysis and design of a vehicle but also the mechanical engineering knowledge of how to build it. However, focusing your expertise too narrowly on a specific fuel or material might not be useful because these are likely to change over time, especially in the case of fuels — different types of which might be phased out as more are developed.\n\nIrrespective of what role you’re interested in, it’s always beneficial to have real-world experience in that area, this can include internship experience or a thesis project at university. However, we recognize that internship opportunities can receive thousands of applicants for only a handful of roles. Therefore, joining clubs, reaching out to alumni or asking to shadow a professional at a space company can all be good starting places. The toughest gig is your first, but once you get in and start making connections, recruiters will be eating you up.\n\nSRIHARI MENON: Developing diverse skills\n\nPostdoctoral researcher at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute in College Station, Texas.\n\nWhen it comes to space, Texas is unique: we have NASA and private industry in our backyard.\n\nYour job as an early-career researcher is simply to develop your skills across the spectrum. Eventually, if your skill set is sufficiently diverse, you will find utility in any industry. These skills need not be trendy, because aerospace as an industry is much too mature to latch onto trends that don’t last longer than five years.\n\nAfter completing a master’s degree in computational fluid dynamics for propulsion and atmospheric re-entry, I pivoted to the study of computational injury biomechanics, which uses engineering models to evaluate injury risks. Combining these areas, I was qualified to start my doctoral studies in spacecraft occupant safety. In the future, this diverse skill set could help me to market myself in fields outside conventional aerospace, such as at automotive companies, civil-aviation firms and injury-research laboratories.\n\n‘We dissent’: NASA staff declare opposition to Trump cuts\n\nFor industry networking, if you’re early on in your career, you might want to go to conferences such as ASCEND. This is an interesting event for people who are trying to break into the space industry, because it brings policymakers, aerospace companies, scientists and early-career researchers into one place. In addition to ASCEND, I would also recommend networking at NASA conferences, such as the Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop, and at the Pumps and Pipes annual event that will take place in December in Houston, Texas, for professionals working at the intersection of medicine, space and engineering.",

          "abstract": "Humans have been walking on two legs for millions of years. Credit: Nick Veasey/SPL via Alamy\n\nAll vertebrate species have a pelvis, but there is only one that uses it for upright, two-legged walking. The evolution of the human pelvis, and our two-legged gait, dates back 5 million years, but the precise evolutionary process that allowed this to happen has remained a mystery.\n\nNow, researchers have mapped the key structural changes in the pelvis that enabled early humans to first walk on two legs and accommodate giving birth to a big-brained baby. The study, published in Nature on 27 August1, compared the embryonic development of the pelvis between humans and other mammals. They found two key evolutionary steps during embryonic development — related to the growth of cartilage and bone in the pelvis — which put humans on a separate evolutionary path from other apes.\n\n“Everything from the base of our skull to the tips of our toes has been changed in modern humans in order to facilitate bipedalism,” says Tracy Kivell, a palaeoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\n\nKivell says the study offers a new understanding of how some of those changes came about, not just in living humans, but also in fossils from ancient hominins such as Denisovans. “I think it’s exciting in terms of moving forward this area of functional genomics,” she says.\n\nTwo small steps for evolution\n\nAs modern humans evolved, our pelvises developed the wide, bowl-like shape needed to allow upright, two-legged walking — but it is unclear exactly how that happened. “The human pelvis is dramatically different than what you see in chimpanzees and gorillas, so we wanted to set out to try and understand what’s happening there,” says study co-author Terence Capellini, a developmental geneticist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nTo investigate, the researchers studied anatomical, histological and genomic changes in samples of human pelvis from different stages of development. They then compared human pelvic development with the process in mouse embryos and other primate species, including gibbons and chimpanzees.\n\nThe researchers focussed their analysis the formation of the ilium; one of the pelvic bones that supports internal organs and anchors the gluteal muscles to stabilise walking. The team collected samples of primate embryos from museums, where they had been preserved in some cases for hundreds of years. “These museum collections are exceptionally precious; they were collected in the last hundred to two hundred years”, says Capellini.\n\nComplex genetic and molecular changes to a bone called the ilium have helped to shape the human pelvis in a way that allows us to walk on two legs.Credit: Massimo Brega/Science Photo Library\n\nThe analysis identified two key steps in the development of the human ilium which enabled its characteristic shape and therefore its ability to support bipedalism.\n\nThe first step occurs during early development of the ilium cartilage. Early bone development begins as a vertical rod of cartilage, 7 weeks after gestation. This process is similar in non-human primates. But what happens next sets the human pelvis apart from other primates — in humans, the ilium cartilage rotates 90 degrees shortly after its formation. This ultimately makes the pelvis short and broad.\n\nThe second step unique to humans occurs later in development, at 24 weeks after gestation, when the ilium cartilage ‘ossifies’ and is replaced by bone cells. In humans, some of these bone cells form much later than in other primates, which allows the cartilage cells to maintain the shape of the pelvis while it grows.\n\nTogether, these developmental quirks help to create a pelvis with the perfect shape for bipedalism.",

          "abstract": "Global warming has accelerated in the past decade, with the world’s average surface temperature in 2024 surpassing pre-industrial levels by 1.5 °C1. Although, so far, human activities have been largely responsible2, the factors behind recent record-breaking temperatures remain to be understood. Are human activities amplifying warming faster than scientists expected, or might natural changes in the Earth system have a stronger role than presumed? Researchers and policymakers need answers fast.\n\nTo quantify the causes and effects of climate change, the climate-research community relies mainly on three types of information sources. First, model simulations provide insights and predictions on timescales from one year to decades, through initiatives such as the World Climate Research Programme’s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)3 and Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change activities4. Second, snapshots of global climate are tracked through various observed and model-based indicators5. Third, climate reanalyses such as ERA5 (see go.nature.com/3hxepxf) and MERRA-2 (see go.nature.com/41x7k24), which assimilate historical observations into models, are widely used for monitoring and research to understand how the Earth system has evolved.\n\nGoogle AI model mines trillions of images to create maps of Earth ‘at any place and time’\n\nAlthough these and other analyses by climate researchers use the most up-to-date observations, model simulations tend to lag. Models are driven by estimates of natural and human influences on Earth’s climate system — known as forcings data — that are based on analyses of a wide range of observations, covering temperatures, greenhouse gases and more. Almost all Earth system models use the same forcing data sets, which are formally updated every five to seven years to support successive phases of the CMIP6. Thus, the inputs to drive the models are based on older or approximate data that might not reflect conditions today.\n\nAnnual updates to the forcing data sets are urgently needed to enable researchers to understand and explain unfolding changes in the world’s climate in near-real time7. Here, we and our co-signatories (see Supplementary information) set out how that can be done.\n\nRecognize the need for speed\n\nForcing data sets are built using a variety of climate observations and products derived from them (see Supplementary information). The data sets include: emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols; concentrations of greenhouse gases and substances that deplete ozone; aerosols ejected by volcanoes; as well as measures of incoming solar radiation, land-use changes, sea surface temperatures and sea ice. The resulting files must be prepared in standard data formats and disseminated on a stable, accessible and robust platform. All of this takes time.\n\nClimate scientists push for access to world’s biggest supercomputers to build better Earth models\n\nOver the past decade, the production of forcing data sets has become more coordinated. Before the CMIP’s fifth phase (CMIP5; 2008–13), they were developed in an ad hoc way, mostly in-house at modelling centres. CMIP6 (2014–21) spawned a system under which the data sets were developed by specialists based elsewhere8. This work was brought together in 2022 under the CMIP Forcings Task Team (see go.nature.com/3jxaqgf) to support the ongoing CMIP79. Earlier this year, the latest forcings data sets were delivered10, most of which span from 1850 to the early 2020s.\n\nBut climate conditions can vary a lot over five to seven years, influenced by volcanic eruptions, large wildfires, or even pandemics or policy interventions. Annual updates to forcings data sets would better align model simulations and observations. Progress in four areas is needed for this to happen.\n\nSecure, reliable observations\n\nA sustained and robust stream of observations is essential for accurate and timely updates. Three actions are needed. First, researchers and governments must enhance and maintain comprehensive long-term global observational networks to ensure consistent coverage of climate-relevant variables. Second, institutions around the world should align observational efforts, share data, enhance data availability and quality, and coordinate funding. Third, a sustainable source of funding is needed for the long-term production of forcings data sets, including the augmenting of existing work on data-format and quality standards, and documentation that enhances downstream use.\n\nBalance research and applications\n\nThe generation of forcings data sets is a continuous process, involving research and refinement before the final products are compiled and disseminated. The data sets have a range of uses, from real-time applications such as air-quality forecasting and the detection and tracking of emission events, including those from volcanic eruptions and wildfires, to comprehensive historical analyses. Each use has different requirements.\n\nGovernments must stop hoarding climate data",

          "abstract": "Gigantic trenches known as gullies are opening up in cities in Africa, swallowing up homes and businesses, sometimes in an instant, a study has found1.\n\nAbout 118,600 people, on average, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) alone were displaced between 2004 and 2023, according to researchers reporting their findings in Nature.\n\nWithout urgent action, researchers estimate that hundreds of thousands of people across Africa are likely to be displaced within the next 10 years, including more than one-quarter of the 770,000 or so people in the DRC living in the expected expansion zone of these gullies.\n\n“It’s an underestimated and severely under-researched hazard,” says study co-author Matthias Vanmaercke, a geographer at the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. It is caused by “a combination of natural and human factors”, he says, but this is “not at all unavoidable”.\n\nExpanding gullies\n\nGullies are expanding across cities that are built on sandy soils and lack adequate drainage. When there are heavy rains, water accumulates on roads and rooftops. When the drainage systems are inadequate, the water finds its way into unprotected ground, carving deep holes that can stretch for hundreds of metres. Over time, the gullies swallow houses and other infrastructure, and sometimes even result in deaths.\n\nVanmaercke and his colleagues used satellite images taken between 2021 and 2023 to identify 2,922 urban gullies in 26 of 47 cities, covering a cumulative distance of nearly 740 kilometres. The team cross-checked these images with historical aerial photographs stored at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium and found that only 46 of the gullies were present in the 1950s. This “gave the first clear indication that this is indeed attributable to the ongoing urbanization”, Vanmaercke says.\n\nIn 99% of cases, the gullies had expanded by at least 10 square metres between 2004 and 2023. The average gully was 253 metres long and 31 metres across at its widest point, and nearly all of them were linked to the road network. “The water cannot infiltrate, and it concentrates along these roads which basically become big canals that turn into rivers,” says Vanmaercke.\n\nThe researchers then combined data on population density with the gully maps. This enabled them to estimate that an average of 118,600 people were displaced because of gullies over the period — with displacement rates more than doubling after 2020.\n\nHazardous science that helps to save and improve lives needs more support\n\nGuy Ilombe Mawe, a geomorphologist at the Official University of Bukavu in the DRC and a co-author of the paper says that the widening of gullies can be catastrophic and even fatal, and that families living near gullies often have no safe alternatives.\n\nIn November 2019, the researchers visited Kinshasa, the DRC’s capital and one of the most affected cities, with 868 urban gullies stretching over a total of 221 kilometres. There they met a mother whose home stood near a gully edge. Two days later, several of her children were killed while sheltering at a relative’s house, when an expanding gully collapsed overnight. At least 40 people in Kinshasa died that night.",

          "abstract": "University students might soon have something other than black-light posters to brighten their dorm rooms. Researchers have created glow-in-the-dark plants by injecting succulents with materials similar to those that make the posters light up. The fleshy plants shine as brightly as a night light, and can be made to do so in a wide variety of colours — a first for glowing houseplants, according to the team.\n\nGlow way! Bioluminescent houseplant hits US market for first time\n\nThe researchers, led by Xuejie Zhang, a materials scientist at the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou, describe today how they produced the plants in the journal Matter1. They have applied for a patent on the technology, which they hope will lead to decorative installations and living lighting.\n\nThe idea of making glowing plants has captivated scientists since the late 1980s, when researchers made the first bioluminescent plant2 by inserting a gene from a firefly (Photinus pyralis) into a type of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). This work laid the foundation for the first genetically engineered luminescent houseplant to come on the market in the United States, last year. The biotechnology firm Light Bio in Sun Valley, Idaho, sells the petunia (Petunia hybrida), which glows a very faint green thanks to genes from a light-emitting mushroom.\n\nLeafy greens … and blues and reds\n\nUnlike the petunia, which emits light through chemical reactions in its cells, the succulent glows because of materials injected into its leaves. These materials — phosphor particles made of strontium and aluminium dosed with other metals — absorb energy from light at one wavelength, store some of that energy and then slowly re-emit it at a different wavelength for several hours. For instance, one material the scientists injected into their succulents absorbs ultraviolet and blue light, and re-emits it as green light.\n\nThis type of ‘afterglow’ phosphor is used in glow-in-the-dark toys and paints, and as an imaging tracer for laboratory animals. Whereas genetically engineered bioluminescent plants are, so far, limited in the range of colours they emit, afterglow phosphors span a wide variety of hues, including red and blue, and they can be combined to produce a white glow.\n\nThis video shows how the tiny phosphor particles spread through the succulent leaves after they are injected.Credit: Liu et al./Matter\n\nThe researchers purchased phosphors containing strontium aluminate and ground them down to particles of various sizes before injecting them into an assortment of plants. They found that particles around 7 micrometres in diameter glowed more brightly than did nanoparticles in plants, and were able to fill up the interior tissues of succulent leaves for a stronger, more uniform glow. By contrast, plants with simple leaf structures, such as tobacco plants and pak choi, emitted a more patchy glow.\n\nThe plant favoured by the team is the succulent Echevaria ‘Mebina’, a common houseplant that grows rosettes of dense, fleshy leaves. To make every leaf glow, the researchers had to inject each one with phoshor particles, a process that takes about ten minutes. The luminescence — which the team generated in hues of blue-green, blue-violet, green, red and white — lasted as long as 120 minutes after exposing the plant to tailored wavelengths of light or sunlight, and could be triggered again and again over the 10 days of the study.",

          "abstract": "An AI tool can screen thousands of journals, and identify ones that violate quality standards.Credit: PaulPaladin/Alamy\n\nResearchers have identified more than 1,000 potentially problematic open-access journals using an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that screened around 15,000 titles for signs of dubious publishing practices.\n\nThe approach, described in Science Advances on 27 August1, could be used to help tackle the rise in what the study authors call “questionable open-access journals” — those that charge fees to publish papers without doing rigorous peer review or quality checks.\n\nPredatory publishers’ latest scam: bootlegged and rebranded papers\n\nNone of the journals flagged by the tool has previously been on any kind of watchlist, and some titles are owned by large, reputable publishers. Together, the journals have published hundreds of thousands of research papers that have received millions of citations.\n\nThe study suggests that “there’s a whole group of problematic journals in plain sight that are functioning as supposedly respected journals that really don’t deserve that qualification”, says Jennifer Byrne, a research-integrity sleuth and cancer researcher at the University of Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe tool is available online in a closed beta version, and organizations that index journals, or publishers, can use it to review their portfolios, says study co-author Daniel Acuña, a computer scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. But, he adds, the AI sometimes makes mistakes, and is not designed to replace detailed evaluations of journals and individual publications that might result in a title being removed from an index. “A human expert should be part of the vetting process” before any action is taken, he says.\n\nScreening journals\n\nThe AI tool can analyse a vast amount of information from journals’ websites and the papers they publish, and search for red flags — such as short turnaround times for publishing articles and high rates of self-citation. It also assesses whether members of a journal’s editorial board are affiliated with well known, reputable research institutions, and checks how transparent publications are about licensing and fees. Several of the criteria used to train the tool come from best-practice guidance developed by the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), an index of open-access journals run by the non-profit DOAJ Foundation in Roskilde, Denmark.\n\nCenyu Shen, the DOAJ’s deputy head of editorial quality, who is based in Helsinki, says that the number of problematic journals is rising, and that their “tactics are becoming more sophisticated”. “We are observing more instances where questionable publishers acquire legitimate journals, or where paper mills purchase journals to publish low-quality work,” she adds. (Paper mills are businesses that sell fake papers and authorships.)\n\nI’m worried I’ve been contacted by a predatory publisher — how do I find out?\n\nThe DOAJ’s own quality checks on journals are done mostly manually and are initiated only after receiving complaints. In 2024, the directory investigated 473 journals, a rise of 40% compared with 2021. “The time our team spent on these investigations also grew significantly by nearly 30%, to 837 hours,” says Shen.\n\nAI tools could help to speed up some of these assessments, Acuña says. He and his colleagues trained their model on 12,869 journals that are currently indexed in the DOAJ as legitimate, as well as 2,536 that the directory had flagged as violating its quality standards.\n\nWhen the researchers asked the AI to evaluate 15,191 open-access journals listed in the public database Unpaywall, it identified 1,437 journals as questionable. The team estimated that some 345 of these were mistakenly flagged: they included discontinued titles, book series and journals from small, learned-society publishers. The researchers also found that the tool had failed to flag a further 1,782 questionable journals, based on estimates of error rates.",

          "abstract": "The use of complementary, alternative and integrative medicine (CAIM) is highly prevalent among autistic individuals, with up to 90% reporting having used CAIM at least once in their lifetime. However, the evidence base for the effects of CAIM for autism remains uncertain. Here, to fill this gap, we conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism across the lifespan and developed a web platform to disseminate the generated results. Five databases were searched (up to 31 December 2023) for systematic reviews with meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism. Independent pairs of investigators identified eligible papers and extracted relevant data. Included meta-analyses were reestimated using a consistent statistical approach, and their methodological quality was assessed with AMSTAR-2. The certainty of evidence generated by each meta-analysis was appraised using an algorithmic version of the GRADE framework. This process led to the identification of 53 meta-analytic reports, enabling us to conduct 248 meta-analyses exploring the effects of 19 CAIMs in autism. We found no high-quality evidence to support the efficacy of any CAIM for core or associated symptoms of autism. Although several CAIMs showed promising results, they were supported by very low-quality evidence. The safety of CAIMs has rarely been evaluated, making it a crucial area for future research. To support evidence-based consideration of CAIM interventions for autism, we developed an interactive platform that facilitates access to and interpretation of the present results ( https://ebiact-database.com ).",

Focusing on three national registries, we performed a large-scale analysis on spousal correlations across nine psychiatric disorders. We obtained the trait correlations from five million spousal pairs in Taiwan and then compared them with estimates from the Danish national registry (571,534 pairs) and with published results from the Swedish national registry (707,263 pairs). Generational changes in Taiwan for people born after the 1930s were investigated as well.

While structural and interpersonal racism are well-established components of systemic racism, cultural racism—a system of beliefs (ideology) and societal way of life (culture)—has been less robustly described and currently lacks a validated measure. We conducted confirmatory factor analysis on nine key indicators to define a cultural racism latent measure. In an analysis of US mortality data between 2018 and 2021 obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s WONDER system, each unit increase in the cultural racism factor was associated with ~136 (95% confidence interval, 90 to 182) all-cause deaths per 100,000 and a one-year decline in life expectancy (~−1 (−2 to −1)); these associations were consistent for both Black and white adults. The cultural racism factor substantially advances the science of racism and health and provides an empirical basis for efforts to address US health inequities.",

Here we synthesized the effects of debiasing training in educational settings. Our systematic review found 54 randomized controlled trials consisting of 383 effect sizes and 10,941 participants. Our meta-analysis of educational interventions showed a small, yet significant, improvement in reducing the likelihood of committing biases compared with control conditions (g = 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.39), 160 effects from 41 studies, P < 0.001). Most studies focused on reducing the likelihood of committing biases (for example, confirmation bias) using cognitive strategies. Some biases seemed difficult to overcome (for example, representativeness heuristic), and questions remain about the depth and transferability of learning beyond classroom settings. All studies had unclear or high risk of bias and there was some risk of publication bias. While evidence suggests that educational interventions can reduce bias on targeted tasks, more research is needed to determine whether these improvements translate to meaningful changes in real-world decision-making and to identify which paedagogical approaches are most effective for reducing the influence of cognitive biases.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to infectious disease in early life may have long-term ramifications for health and lifespan. However, reducing pathogen exposure may not be uniformly beneficial. The rise of modern sanitation and reduction of infectious diseases has been implicated in increasing levels of allergy and immune dysregulation: termed, the “hygiene hypothesis.” This study leverages quasi-experimental variation from combining precampaign hookworm exposure with the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission’s deworming campaign in the early 20th century to rigorously examine the impacts of childhood hookworm exposure on adult lifespan and morbidity. Findings show deworming before age five leads to 2.5 additional months of life in a large sample of adult death records. Further, decreasing hookworm exposure is related to improvements in biomarkers for inflammation and skin-tested allergies, in contrast to predictions of the “hygiene hypothesis.” Placebo tests using health outcomes that should not be affected by deworming do not show similar patterns. Overall, childhood deworming leads to improvements in morbidity and lifespan decades later.",

However, positive social emotions like ingroup solidarity may also drive social media engagement, particularly after major threats such as military invasions or terror attacks. In this preregistered study, we examine the socioemotional drivers of engagement following group threats in the context of the US 2024 presidential campaign trail, where both major political parties faced crises in July of 2024. We test how ingroup solidarity and outgroup hostility predicted social media users’ engagement with 62,118 posts by 484 US partisan accounts before and after the first Trump assassination attempt (July 13) and Biden’s re-election campaign suspension (July 21). We find that, while outgroup hostility is typically the dominant predictor of engagement, interactions with ingroup solidarity surged among Republicans after the Trump shooting and among Democrats after Biden’s withdrawal. We show that negativity toward other groups is not always key to going viral. Rather, positive ingroup emotions appear to play a leading role in times of crisis.",

          "abstract": "Cooperation often requires individuals to balance personal risk with mutual gain. The Stag Hunt game provides a well-established paradigm for studying such decision-making. Prior research suggested that verbal communication about the game correlated with participants finding the optimal coordinated solution, but these studies either did not manipulate communication directly or informed participants of the payoff structure in advance. This study examined whether communication improves cooperative decision-making among college students under conditions in which the payoff structure had to be inferred through repeated play. A total of 127 same-sex dyads ( M age = 22.8 y, 51.2% female) played 40 rounds of an online Stag Hunt game, with dyads randomly assigned to either a no communication or communication condition. Participants were not informed about the game’s payoff structure in advance and had to infer it during play. Results showed that coordination on the payoff-dominant outcome (Stag–Stag) increased across trials, but only when communication was possible. No significant sex differences were observed. These findings highlight the central role of communication in fostering cooperation, particularly in environments in which information must be jointly discovered. This is an important consideration for developing and interpreting future research. Moreover, subsequent research should explore how the content, timing, and relevance of communication shape cooperative outcomes over time.",

          "authors": "Valentina Canessa-Pollard, Andrey Anikin, David Reby",
          "abstract": "For over 5,000 y, chanting has been practiced across many Western and Eastern traditions. However, there is hardly any empirical research on 1) whether chants from across the globe share common acoustic properties, 2) whether these acoustic features make them distinct from other human vocalizations, and 3) the extent to which they may positively impact listeners’ well-being. Here, we collected 242 chants belonging to seven distinct traditions and associated with a wide range of language families, and compared them acoustically to a large corpus of song (n = 126) and speech (n = 616) samples from across 14 linguistic and 12 geographical regions. We show that, irrespective of language and geographical origin, chants share distinctive acoustic traits, namely relatively flat and slow-changing intonation and steady, unbroken voicing in a comfortable, rather low pitch range with a prevalence of mid-central vowels. Thus, chants are produced in a relaxed vocal tract configuration with minimal articulation. Additionally, playback experiments involving original chants (with a participant pool of 61 listeners), resynthesized chants (with 114 listeners), and fully synthetic chants (with 80 listeners) demonstrate that these acoustic characteristics enhance listeners’ perceived sensations of relaxation. Specifically, relatively flat and slow-changing intonation, combined with vowel production in a relatively relaxed vocal tract configuration, resulted in higher overall relaxation ratings. Together these results hint at a specific function of chants’ acoustic commonalities: the enhancement of well-being through relaxation.",

We analyzed 38 million obituaries from the United States to examine how personal values are encoded in individual and collective legacies. Using Schwartz’s theory of basic human values, we found that tradition and benevolence dominated legacy reflections, while values like power and stimulation appeared less frequently. Major cultural events—the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic—were systematically linked to changes in legacy reflections about personal values, with security declining after 9/11, achievement declining after the financial crisis, and benevolence declining for years after COVID-19 began and, to date, not yet returning to baseline. Gender and age of the deceased were also linked to differences in legacy: Men were remembered more for achievement , power , and conformity , while women were remembered more for benevolence and hedonism . Older people were remembered more for tradition and conformity than younger people. These patterns shifted dynamically across the lifespan, with obituaries for men showing more age-related variation than legacies for women. Our findings reveal how obituaries serve as psychological and cultural time capsules, preserving not just individual legacies, but also indicating what US society values collectively regarding a life well lived.",

          "abstract": "Rapid global expansion of protected areas is critical for safeguarding biodiversity but depends on political action for successful implementation. Following widespread ratification of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, an unprecedented increase in area-based conservation is required to reach its target of conserving 30% of land, waters, and seas by 2030. These expansions prompt difficult trade-offs between conservation, social, and economic interests. A key factor in securing legitimacy and practical feasibility for expansion regimes is understanding what factors determine public support for them. Using survey and experimental data, we show that in eight countries across five continents, public opinion is 1) strongly in favor of the “30-by-30”-target and 2) highly consistent regarding policy priorities for the design of international- and domestic-level expansion regimes. We find that for international-level policy regimes, support increases with protection responsibilities equally split between countries, rich countries bearing higher costs, more countries actively cooperating, and placement trade not allowed. For domestic-level policy regimes, support generally increases when nature values are prioritized over social or economic values and, in many countries, decreases when costs are borne by a general tax increase, parks are managed by private companies, and when access to parks is restricted. Together, these results demonstrate how protected area expansion policies can be shaped to facilitate reaching 30% protected areas by 2030.",

          "abstract": "Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data are available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our minimal hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation–integration transition even with memory-less agents. While residential segregation is a multifactorial phenomenon, this physics analogy suggests a simple mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood’s population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract spaces.",

Here, we show using solution-scattering, steady-state kinetic, and crystallographic approaches that the protease from Thomasclavelia ramosa , representing the uncharacterized third family, has a truly modular and minimizable protein architecture. This analysis also revealed a unique metal-associated domain that likely functions as a molecular spacer and generated a working hypothesis detailing the structural mechanism behind the enzyme’s high substrate specificity.

Here, we found that arrestin domain containing 4 (ARRDC4), a critical regulator of glucose metabolism, senses influenza A virus (IAV) infection by interacting with viral PA protein. Upregulated ARRDC4 increases the enzymatic activity of phosphofructokinase, muscle type (PFKM) via binding its His298 site to promote the production of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Consequently, FBP inhibits the K48-linked ubiquitination degradation of HSP90β, subsequently enhances its interaction with IKKβ and IKKε, and enhances NF-κB- and IRF7-mediated antiviral innate immunity, respectively. Importantly, FBP supplementation enhanced IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight a unique immunometabolic regulatory mechanism in which ARRDC4 senses IAV infection and regulates antiviral innate immunity through the PFKM-FBP metabolic axis and provide a strategy for manipulating FBP-related metabolism to treat viral infection.",

          "abstract": "Street art murals are increasingly recognized as valuable contemporary artworks, often attaining significant artistic, historical, and social importance. As these murals become integral parts of cultural heritage, finding efficient strategies for their conservation is crucial. However, their typical large surface areas, heterogeneous materials, and high variability in exposure to environmental and pollution factors pose significant challenges in establishing appropriate analytical strategies to obtain the necessary information. This study proposes a multiscale and multitechnique noninvasive approach to investigate and monitor street art murals in situ. By combining portable point techniques—such as external reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy—with visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging, the mural’s composition across a square meter surface could be analyzed. Additionally, multispectral imaging mounted on a drone provided a global reconstruction and characterization of the overall mural. This method was complemented by microdestructive laboratory analyses of selected samples, using pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector and tandem mass spectrometry, to further investigate selected samples and support noninvasive results. The approach was applied to the iconic mural “Musica Popolare” (2017) by Orticanoodles in Milan, Italy, revealing detailed information about its pigments, binders, fillers, and degradation. The findings demonstrate the potential of this integrated methodology for the effective material identification, conservation assessment, and short-and long-term monitoring of urban heritage.",

          "abstract": "Soil microbial diversity is crucial to sustaining ecosystem productivity and improving carbon sequestration. Global temperature continues to rise, but how climate warming affects microbial diversity and its capacity to sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) remains uncertain. Here, by conducting a global meta-analysis with 251 paired observations from 102 studies, we showed that, on average, warming reduced bacterial and fungal diversity (measured by richness and Shannon index) by 16.0 and 19.7%, respectively, and SOC by 18.1%. The negative responses of both soil bacterial and fungal diversity to warming became more pronounced with increasing warming magnitude, experimental duration, and decreasing soil nitrogen availability. Under the worst-case climate warming scenario (2010 to 2070, 3.4 increase in °C), soil bacterial diversity and fungal diversity are projected to reduce by 56% and 81%, respectively, over 60 y. Importantly, in addition to the direct impact of warming on SOC, warming-induced declines in microbial diversity also contributed to SOC losses. We highlight that prolonged warming could substantially reduce soil microbial diversity and decrease SOC sequestration, accelerating future warming and underscoring the urgent need for decisive actions to mitigate global climate change.",

The condition was reported to be familial, consistent with a genetic element. This hypothesis, however, has never been tested. Using an erythrocyte FAD-dependent glutathione reductase activity assay, we identified individuals with flavin-deficient erythrocytes (FDE) in Ferrara, Italy (23% of 150 individuals screened), and in Huye, Rwanda (13% of 169 individuals). None of the individuals with FDE had a dietary riboflavin deficiency. Importantly, FDE from individuals in Ferrara, as well as erythrocytes depleted of flavins in vitro by riboflavin starvation, inhibited the intraerythrocytic proliferation of Plasmodium falciparum . We provide evidence that these erythrocytes are susceptible to oxidative stress, potentially explaining their inhibitory effect on parasite proliferation. Genetic analysis identified mutations in the FAD synthase gene of three individuals with FDE from Huye, consistent with a potential genetic basis.",

We show how the ϵ = d − 2 expansion and the 1 / d expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent y depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension.

          "abstract": "In mammals, a hierarchically organized circadian timing system orchestrates daily rhythms of nearly all physiology. A master pacemaker in the brain’s suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes subsidiary clocks in most peripheral organs. By driving anabolic and catabolic cycles of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates and by detoxifying endo- and xenobiotic components, the liver plays an important role in adapting the metabolic needs to rest-activity rhythms. In keeping with these functions, the liver expresses many clock-controlled genes that are required for these processes. Remarkably, however, this organ also fluctuates in size and morphological parameters. In mice, the mass of the liver increases and decreases by 30 to 40% during the 24-h day. The oscillation in liver mass is accompanied by daily rhythms of similar amplitudes in hepatocyte cell size and global RNA and protein accumulation. The number of ribosomes, which parallels the ups and downs of liver size, appears to be the rate-limiting factor in driving the diurnal rhythms of overall protein synthesis. Obviously, the rapid increase in hepatocyte size within the liver engenders mechanical stress, which must be dealt with by increasing the physical robustness of cells. Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton of hepatocytes undergoes dramatic polymerization cycles. Thus, massive intracellular and subcortical F-actin bundles are assembled during the night, at which the liver reaches its maximal size. In turn, the oscillation in actin polymerization elicits rhythms in myocardin-related transcription factors-serum response factor signaling, which participate in the circadian transcription of the core clock gene Per2 and thereby contribute to the synchronization of hepatocyte clocks.",

          "abstract": "Mutation rates have long been measured as averages across many genomic positions. Recently, a method to measure the rates of individual mutations was applied to a narrow region in the human hemoglobin subunit beta ( HBB ) gene containing the site of the hemoglobin S (HbS) mutation as well as to a paralogous hemoglobin subunit delta ( HBD ) region, in sperm samples from sub-Saharan African and northern European donors [Melamed et al ., Genome Res. 32 , 488–498 (2022)]. The HbS mutation, which protects against malaria while causing sickle-cell anemia in homozygotes, originated de novo significantly more frequently in the HBB gene in Africans compared to the other three test cases combined (the European HBB gene and the European and African HBD gene). Here, we apply this approach to the human apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) gene containing the site of the G1 1024A→G mutation, which protects against African sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense while causing a substantially increased risk of chronic kidney disease in homozygotes. We find that the 1024A→G mutation is the mutation of highest de novo origination rate and deviates most from the genome-wide average rate for its type (A→G) compared to all other observable mutations in the region and that it originates de novo significantly more frequently in Africans than in Europeans—i.e., in the population where it is of adaptive significance. The results are unexpected given the notion that the probability of a specific mutational event is independent of its value to the organism and underscore the importance of studying mutation rates at the individual-mutation resolution.",

          "abstract": "Despite sharing fewer than 10 core genes, the hyperdiverse Nucleocytoviricota phylum (ranging from poxviruses to giant viruses) universally assembles viral factories (VFs) resembling biomolecular condensates. Regardless, it is unclear how these viruses achieve such a level of functional conservation without clear conserved genetic information. We demonstrate that the VFs produced by amoeba-infecting viruses have liquid-like properties and identify a conserved molecular grammar governing viral factory scaffold protein: charge-patterned intrinsically disordered regions that drive phase separation independently of sequence homology. This grammar predicts functional scaffold proteins across the 15 viral families, revealing evolutionary constraints invisible to sequence or structural analysis. Strikingly, VFs exhibit subcompartmentalization analogous to nuclei, segregating transcription and mRNA processing (inner condensates) from replication (interphase zones) and translation (host cytoplasm). Our work establishes phase separation as a fundamental organizational principle bridging extreme genomic diversity, explaining how biological complexity emerges without gene conservation. This grammar is likely also conserved in non-amoeba-infecting members of the phylum and thus may represent a primordial solution for organelle-like organization, with broad implications for antiviral targeting.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria have several nucleotide second messengers, most of which act as global regulators to control a wide range of bacterial physiological processes. Studies usually focus on a single second messenger, and the mechanisms and physiological significance of the cross-regulation between different nucleotide second messengers are often unclear. Here, we show that Shewanella putrefaciens can form biofilms in both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor media. While both are controlled by c-di-GMP, the regulatory models differ. Under low nutrient conditions, cross-regulation of cAMP-CRP and c-di-GMP occurs at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels, thereby controlling biofilm development. During the early stages of biofilm development, cAMP-CRP directly promotes the transcription of a PDE gene, lrbR , by LrbA. Additionally, cAMP-CRP recruits LrbR to BpfD to suppress early biofilm formation via LrbR-dependent local degradation of c-di-GMP. Finally, as intracellular LrbR levels decrease, cAMP-CRP-BpfD enables a rapid shift to biofilm development and supports biofilm maintenance. Under high nutrient conditions, this cross-regulation does not occur, resulting in a positive correlation between global c-di-GMP levels and biofilm biomass. The identification of distinct modes of biofilm regulation in different nutrients will provide a theoretical basis for future targeted control of biofilm formation in different nutrient environments.",

We addressed the role of immune surveillance in 76 cervical biopsies (normal = 23, HPV+ benign = 16, HPV+ precancer = 37) by studying the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and the expression of the immune modulators PDL1, ICOSL, and miR-155 and compared the data to 101 cervical squamous cell carcinomas. In the normal cervix, ICOSL expression was restricted to the endocervical epithelia whereas neither miR-155 nor PDL1 were detected. MiR-155 was up-regulated in both the benign (88%) and precancerous (92%) HPV squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and colocalized to cells in the upper part of the lesion that is the area with productive viral infection. Both PDL1 (95%) and ICOSL (89%) were only evident in the precancerous SIL and each localized to squamous cells in the basal aspect that lacked replicating virus. In both microinvasive and invasive cervical squamous cell cancer miR-155 expression remained high (83%) as did PDL1 expression (80%) but ICOSL detection was reduced to 17%. Infiltration by CD8+ T cells was intense in the invasive lesions and these cells were mostly inactive as determined by the lack of granzyme B colocalization. It is concluded that miR-155 expression is a marker of HPV infection in both benign and precancerous lesions, whereas the approximately 10% of the latter lesions that progress to cancer gain PDL1 and lose ICOSL expression, which are important factors in avoiding immune surveillance.",

Activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2) is the only type I receptor among the seven TGF-β type I receptors that interacts with both activin and BMP ligands. With BMPs, ALK2 acts as a signaling receptor to activate small mothers against decapentaplegic 1 (SMAD1)/5/8 signaling. Alternatively, with activins, such as Activin A (ActA), ALK2 forms nonsignaling complexes that negatively regulate ALK2 and ActA signaling. To gain insight into how ALK2 interacts with two distinct classes of ligands, we resolved the cryoelectron microscopy structure of ALK2 in complex with the type II receptor, ActRIIB, and the ligand, BMP6, in parallel with the corresponding structure with ALK3 for direct comparison. These structures demonstrate that ALK2 and ALK3 utilize different mechanisms to interact with BMP6 at the wrist interface, with ALK2 relying on BMP6 glycosylation and ALK3 relying on a salt bridge. Modeling of ALK2:ActA reveals that binding relies on ActA’s fingertip region, mirroring the interaction of ActA with its other receptor, ALK4. Our results demonstrate that ALK2 is a “hybrid” receptor that incorporates features of BMP type I receptors such as ALK3 at the wrist interface and an activin type I receptor such as ALK4 at the fingertip.",

The scarcity of verified Denisovan fossils makes it challenging to study their anatomy, and how well they were adapted to their environment.

Here, we scan the Middle Pleistocene fossil record for crania matching the predicted Denisovan morphology and might therefore be related to Denisovans. We developed quantitative measures to assess both the proportion and extent of matches. These analyses revealed that the East Asian specimens of Harbin and Dali show an exceptionally high concordance with the Denisovan profile, surpassing all other examined Middle Pleistocene hominin specimens, including Neanderthals. Specifically, 15 out of 18 of Dali ’s features and 16 out of 18 of Harbin ’s matched Denisovan predictions. These findings are robust to overall skull size and to correlations between phenotypes. We also found that Kabwe 1 shows a strong affinity to the Denisovan–Neanderthal clade and might be placed near its root.

However, a major hurdle for the clinical translation of genome editing is safe, efficient delivery to disease-relevant tissues. A modality-agnostic reporter animal model that facilitates rapid, precise, and quantifiable assessment of functional delivery and editing could greatly enhance the evaluation and translation of delivery technologies. Here, we present the development of the tdTomato in vivo genome-editing reporter (TIGER) mouse, a reporter strain that harbors an integrated and constitutively expressed mutated tdTomato gene in the Polr2a locus. The mutations (Q115X, Q357X) abolish fluorescence, but successful adenine base editing (ABE) or prime editing (PE) restores tdTomato fluorescence. This mouse model facilitates the tissue- and cell type–specific assessment of genome editing agent delivery. We describe several editing strategies validated in vitro and demonstrate efficient ABE and PE in vivo using viral and nonviral delivery vectors targeting four cell types within the mouse eye: the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors, Müller glia, and the trabecular meshwork. We show direct editing characterization in the ocular tissues via in vivo and ex vivo two-photon confocal microscopy and verify the spectral and fluorescence lifetime properties of tdTomato reporter in other mouse tissues. Additionally, we demonstrate successful adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated PE of extraocular tissues, including hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, and brain neurons by intravenous injection. Thus, the TIGER mouse facilitates the direct development, comparison, and optimization of delivery platforms for efficient and productive ABE or PE broadly applicable in vivo across multiple tissues tested in this study.",

          "abstract": "Global demand for wood products is increasing forest harvest. One understudied consequence of logging is that it accelerates mobilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils to aquatic ecosystems where it is more easily rereleased to the atmosphere. Here, we tested how logging changed DOM in headwaters of hardwood-dominated catchments in northern Ontario, Canada. We applied a before-after-control-impact experiment across four catchments for 3 y and measured DOM monthly during ice-free seasons. DOM concentration in streams from logged catchments quadrupled, on average, only for the first 2 mo postharvest, but resulting changes to the molecular composition of DOM persisted for at least 2 y. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that DOM composition within logged streams became more available for microbial use and chemically diverse than in controls, with novel highly unsaturated polyphenols, carboxylic-rich alicyclic, and nitrogen-containing formulae. The molecular composition of stream DOM measured fortnightly postharvest was most similar to the DOM composition of surrounding soils, likely due to increased hydrological connectivity. Alongside carbon being more likely to be released into the atmosphere, we estimate that selective logging increased the total flux of dissolved organic carbon in streams by 6.4% of the carbon extracted as timber. Although these estimates are short-lived, they should affect the millions of hectares that are logged annually. Carbon accounting of forestry, including as a natural climate solution, must now consider the transport and fate of DOM from land into water.",

However, whether this linear trend will continue or life expectancy gains will decelerate in the near future remains unclear. To answer this question, we apply multiple established and recently developed mortality forecasting methods to estimate cohort life expectancy for individuals born between 1939 and 2000 in 23 high-income countries. Across all forecasting methods, our results robustly and consistently indicate a deceleration in cohort life expectancy. The previously observed pace of improvement, 0.46 y per cohort, declines by 37% to 52%, depending on the method used. Robustness checks suggest that these findings are unlikely to be solely due to downward bias in cohort life expectancy forecasts. Furthermore, an age-decomposition analysis indicates that this deceleration is primarily driven by a slower pace of mortality improvement at very young ages. Over half of the total deceleration is attributable to mortality trends under age 5, while more than two-thirds is explained by mortality trends under age 20. This pattern had already emerged in the observed data for the cohorts included in our analysis. Thus, even if these estimates turned out to be overly pessimistic, it is unlikely that the deceleration will reverse in the near future.",

Using convex relaxation, bimodularity can be optimized with the singular value decomposition of the directed modularity matrix. Subsequently, we propose an edge-based clustering approach to reveal the directed communities including their mappings. The feasibility of the framework is illustrated on a synthetic model and further applied to the neuronal wiring diagram of the Caenorhabditis elegans , for which it yields meaningful feedforward loops of the head and body motion systems. This framework sets the ground for the understanding and detection of community structures in directed networks.",

          "abstract": "Aqueous foams are solid materials composed of gases and liquids, exhibiting a large gas/liquid surface area and enabling dynamic exchanges between their fluid components. The structure of binary-gas foams, whose bubbles consist of a mixture of two gases having different affinities with the liquid, thus offers real potential for the dynamic separation of these gases at low cost. In single-gas foams, the structure evolves under the effect of gas flow induced by Laplace pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble size. This leads to the well-documented Ostwald ripening. In addition to these capillary effects, the structure of binary-gas foams can evolve under the effect of gas flow induced by partial pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble composition. We experimentally investigate the shrinking of CO 2 -laden 2D foams exposed to air, observing a crust of tiny bubbles at the front. We derive a nonlinear diffusion model for the gas in the foam and propose a description of the whole foam as an effective, homogeneous medium, the key parameter being the gas permeability ratio across the foam’s soap films (≠1 for CO 2 /air). The effective diffusivity of the gas in the foam emerges from the coupling between foam structure and gas transport across soap films. We extrapolate it for various permeability ratios and show that it can vary continuously between the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid and that of the gas in the atmosphere, enabling tunable gas retention and release by controlling the composition of the atmosphere.",

Our previous work demonstrated the ability to achieve optical transparency in live mice using intensely absorbing dye molecules, which created transparency in the red spectrum while blocking shorter-wavelength photons. In this paper, we extend this capability to achieve optical transparency across the entire visible spectrum by employing molecules with strong absorption in the ultraviolet spectrum and sharp absorption edges that rapidly decline upon entering the visible spectrum. This color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency method enables optical transparency for imaging commonly used fluorophores in the green and yellow spectra. Notably, this approach facilitates tissue transparency for structural and functional imaging of the live mouse brain labeled with yellow fluorescent protein and GCaMP through the scalp and skull. We show that this method enables longitudinal imaging of the same brain regions in awake mice over multiple days during development. Histological analyses of the skin and systemic toxicology studies indicate minimal acute or chronic damage to the skin or body using this approach. This color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency technique opens opportunities for noninvasive deep-tissue optical imaging, enabling long-term visualization of cellular structures and dynamic activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and chronic tracking capabilities.",

          "abstract": "Streptomyces are naturally endowed with the capacity to produce a wide array of natural products with biomedical and biotechnological value. They have garnered great interest in synthetic biology applications given the abundance of uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, progress has been hindered by the limited availability of genetic tools for manipulating these bacteria. Several representative CRISPR-Cas systems have been established in Streptomyces to streamline experimental workflows and improve editing efficiency. Nevertheless, their broader applicability has been constrained by issues such as nuclease activity-related cytotoxicity and the large size of effector proteins. To address these challenges, we present Streptomyces -compatible TnpB-assisted genome editing (STAGE), a genetic toolkit based on ISDra2 TnpB, which is approximately one-third the size of Cas9 and enables precise, site-specific gene editing. We demonstrated that STAGE introduces genetic mutations with high efficiency and minimal off-target effects in two industrially important Streptomyces strains. Building on this platform, we developed STAGE-cBEST and STAGE-McBEST, enabling single and multiplexed C·G-to-T·A base editing, respectively, with editing efficiencies exceeding 75%. To further enhance performance, we engineered the ISDra2 TnpB system using an AI-assisted protein engineering framework, resulting in two variants that achieve nearly 100% genome editing efficiency. Additionally, through sequence homology analysis, we identified a TnpB ortholog from the same biological origin of ISDra2 TnpB, which also functions effectively as a gene editing tool. Our study establishes STAGE as a highly precise, programmable, and versatile genome editing platform for Streptomyces , paving the way for advanced genetic manipulation and synthetic biology applications in these industrially important bacteria.",

          "abstract": "Precise, noninvasive drug delivery to small but important brain regions is challenging and highly desired given the brain’s inherent complexity and heterogeneous nature. Here, we report an approach utilizing focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with nanobubbles to successfully navigate this challenge. Compared to traditional microbubbles, nanobubbles exhibit superior acoustic properties. The nanobubbles, when exposed to FUS, induce a highly localized and reversible opening of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) with significantly enhanced precision (up to fourfolds compared to microbubbles, as measured by the precision loss metric). Repeated multitarget FUS-NB precisely delivers macromolecular human-derived anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) into the small brain region within a 2-h half-life window per opening. Fluorescence images confirm HuMAb retention in the brain parenchyma for at least 10 d postadministration. With this approach, we targeted the lateral habenula, a small but effective brain target for antidepressant treatments, and significantly alleviated depression-like symptoms at least 2 wk in a mouse model (tail suspension test/forced swim test: P &lt; 0.01/0.05). Moreover, minimal red blood cell extravasation (0.9‱ affected area) was observed in the treated region after multiple FUS treatments, indicating the safety and tolerability of FUS-nanobubble-mediated BBB opening. The enhanced delivery precision, coupled with a favorable safety profile, positions our approach as a promising strategy for antibody therapy with significant clinical translation potential.",

          "abstract": "Arsenite (As III ) is toxic to all organisms due to its ability to tightly bind exposed thiols within cells. An important As III resistance mechanism in prokaryotes involves proteins encoded by the ars operon. A central component of the ars operon in many bacteria is the cytoplasmic ATPase, ArsA, which orchestrates a series of nucleotide-dependent handoffs, starting with the capture of As III by the ArsD metallochaperone and culminating in its removal from the cell by the ArsB efflux pump. Although the mechanism of ArsA has been widely studied, the molecular details of how nucleotide hydrolysis modulates these events remain unclear. ArsA is an archetypal member of the intradimeric Walker A (IWA) family of ATPases, implicated in a diversity of complex biological functions. Conformational changes typical of IWA ATPases have been postulated to drive these molecular events but have not been demonstrated. We report cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ArsA in MgADP-bound and MgATP-bound open states, as well as a distinct closed MgATP-bound state liganded to As III . X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirmed three-coordinate binding of As III to the conserved cysteines at the metalloid-binding site of the closed state. Coupled with biochemical characterization, our cryo-EM structures reveal key conformational changes in the ArsA catalytic cycle consistent with other IWA ATPases and provide the structural basis for allosteric activation of nucleotide hydrolysis by As III . This work establishes how the nucleotide state of ArsA transiently creates a high-affinity binding site that can sequester metalloid within the cell, followed by a nucleotide-driven handoff to ArsB for efflux.",

          "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) aerosols exacerbate air pollution and climate warming, but their climatic impacts and sources are poorly constrained by bottom–up emission inventories (EIs). China’s Clean Air Action (CAA), which was launched in 2013, provides an excellent opportunity for investigating interannual variations in source contributions and validate the accuracy of EIs. Here, we present an 11-y (2008–2018) record of the BC concentration and its source-diagnostic radiocarbon ( 14 C) and stable carbon isotope ( 13 C) signatures at a receptor site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, South China. The results revealed that the implementation of the CAA (2014–2018) led to a 41% reduction in the BC concentration compared with that in the preaction period (2008–2013). There is a large and systemic discrepancy over the whole period in the contribution of biomass burning to BC in South China between predictions from technology-based EIs (4 to 9%) and these source-diagnostic dual-isotopic fingerprints of actual ambient aerosols (21 to 32%). Observational constraints by source-diagnostic δ 13 C/Δ 14 C isotope measurements revealed that the reduction in biomass burning contributed 22% to the decrease in BC associated with the CAA, whereas predictions from EIs assigned a much smaller fraction. These results emphasize the need for observation-based source diagnostics of changing BC emission sources. Detailed source apportionment using independent δ 13 C/Δ 14 C isotope methodology is crucial for refining air pollution control strategies and improving the accuracy of models used for assessing the air quality and climate effects of BC in China and elsewhere.",

Patients in this group are highly prone to develop embryonal tumors, most commonly medulloblastoma arising from the cerebellar granule cell progenitors (GCPs). GCPs undergo high proliferation in the postnatal cerebellum under Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) activation, but the type of DNA lesions that require the function of the BRCA2 to prevent tumorigenesis remains unknown. To identify such lesions, we assessed both GCP neurodevelopment and tumor formation using a mouse model with deletion of exons three and four of Brca2 in the central nervous system, coupled with global Trp53 loss. Brca2 Δex3-4 ;Trp53 −/− animals developed SHH subgroup medulloblastomas with complete penetrance. Whole-genome sequencing of the tumors identified structural variants with breakpoints enriched in areas overlapping putative G-quadruplexes (G4s). Brca2 -deficient GCPs exhibited decreased replication speed in the presence of the G4-stabilizer pyridostatin. Pif1 helicase, which resolves G4s during replication, was highly upregulated in tumors, and Pif1 knockout in primary medulloblastoma tumor cells resulted in increased genome instability upon pyridostatin treatment. These data suggest that G4s may represent sites prone to replication stalling in highly proliferative GCPs and without BRCA2, G4s become a source of genome instability. Tumor cells upregulate G4-resolving helicases to facilitate rapid proliferation through G4s highlighting PIF1 helicase as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of BRCA2-deficient medulloblastomas.",

Spins existing widely in biological systems offer a unique degree of freedom for detecting such interactions. However, most previous studies have been largely confined to ensemble-level detection in the spin degree. Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving ∼ 10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we reexamined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers. This methodology holds promise for applications in molecular screening, identification, and kinetic studies at the single-molecule level, offering critical insights into molecular function and activity mechanisms.",

Here, we systematically mapped the ligand specificities of selected extracytoplasmic sensory domains from twenty members of the human gut microbiota, with a primary focus on the abundant and physiologically important class of Clostridia. Twenty-five metabolites from different chemical classes—including amino acids, nucleobase derivatives, amines, indole, and carboxylates—were identified as specific ligands for fifteen sensory domains from nine bacterial species, which represent all three major functional classes of transmembrane receptors: chemotaxis receptors, histidine kinases, and enzymatic sensors. We have further characterized the specificity and evolution of ligand binding to Cache superfamily sensors specific for lactate, dicarboxylic acids, and for uracil and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Structural and biochemical analysis of the dCache sensor of uracil and SCFAs revealed that its two different ligand types bind at distinct sensory modules. Overall, combining experimental identification with computational analyses, we were able to assign ligands to approximately half of the Cache-type chemotaxis receptors found in the eleven gut commensal genomes from our set, with carboxylic acids representing the largest ligand class. Among these, the most commonly found ligand specificities were for lactate and formate, indicating a particular importance of these metabolites in the human gut microbiota and consistent with their observed growth-promoting effects on selected bacterial commensals.",

Collectively, the robust organoid culture system and biologically relevant expression profiles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 make nasal organoids present a correlate of in vivo protection of neutralizing mAbs exclusively.

The cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal silence depend on both Aβ and tau protein pathologies, with an unknown role of Aβ. Here, by using single-cell-initiated rabies virus (RV) tracing in mouse models of β-amyloidosis, we demonstrate that the presynaptic connectivity of silent, but not that of hyperactive, neurons is severely disrupted. Furthermore, silent neurons display a major spine loss and strongly suppressed synaptic activity.

That perinatally produced Tregs persist for a protracted period in peripheral lymphoid organs has been well documented, as has their superior ability to protect the organism from many autoimmune diseases. However, their contribution to pools of nonlymphoid-tissue Tregs and their homeostatic functions therein have been little studied. We show that perinatal Tregs preferentially derive from a CD25 + Foxp3 − thymocyte progenitor; that they seed and persist to varying degrees in every nonlymphoid tissue examined; and that transient depletion of perinatally generated Tregs in adults, but not in neonates, is followed by poor reconstitution of Treg numbers and phenotypes in epididymal visceral-adipose tissue (eVAT) and the skin but not in several lymphoid and other nonlymphoid tissues. Potential clinical implications of such a deficiency are highlighted by findings on mice subjected to weight cycling: Imposing a low-fat–high-fat–low-fat diet regimen in adult, but not juvenile, mice results in an impoverished eVAT, but not spleen, Treg compartment, accompanied by normal weight gain and glucose tolerance but profound insulin resistance.

          "abstract": "Life thrives due to its remarkable ability to create complex structures through the self-assembly of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules. Achieving such complex assemblies with the same level of fidelity, reproducibility, and advanced functionality in synthetic systems, however, has remained a grand challenge. One outstanding problem is the presence of parasitic products and long-lived intermediate states that slow the reaction process and limit the yield of the final product. Biology overcomes this challenge by proofreading to recognize and disassemble parasitic products. Such local checks, however, are currently difficult to implement in available self-assembly platforms. Here, we overcome this challenge by implementing a proofreading mechanism in a self-assembly platform. Specifically, we design intermediate states that strongly couple to an external force but a final product that is decoupled and thus highly stable to external driving, such that application of external forces selectively dissociates parasitic products. To implement this idea, we introduce lithographically patterned magnetic dipoles and an applied magnetic field to drive an assembly process similar to thermal self-assembly, but with additional controls. By applying patterns of magnetic driving that selectively destabilize parasitic states, we effectively implement a proofreading strategy to enable high-yield, time-efficient self-assembly. This realization of a general proofreading mechanism bridges the gap between artificial and biological self-assembly, paving the way for advanced self-assembled materials, with applications in next generation responsive materials, biomimetic devices, and microscale machines.",

          "abstract": "Biological flyers periodically flap their appendages to generate aerodynamic forces. Extensive studies have made significant progress in explaining the physics behind their propulsion in cruising by developing scaling laws of their flight kinematics. Notably Strouhal number ( St ; ratio of flapping frequency times stroke amplitude to cruising speed) has been found to fall in a narrow range for animal cruising flights. However, St exhibits strong correlation to flight conditions; as such, its universality has been confined to preferred flight conditions. Since the leading-edge vortices (LEV) on flapping appendages generate the majority of propulsive forces, here we take the perspective of LEV circulation maximization, which generalizes the dimensionless vortex formation time to flapping flight. The generalized vortex formation time scales the duration of vorticity injection with the rate of total vorticity growth inside the LEV and the maximum vorticity allowed inside it. By comparing the new scaling with St of previously reported animal cruising flights of 28 species, we show that the generalized vortex formation time is consistent across different animals and cruising locomotion, independent of flight conditions. This finding advances the fundamental principles underlying the complex wing kinematics of biological flyers and highlights a unifying framework for understanding biolocomotion.",

          "abstract": "Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a Ca 2+ -sensing protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The depletion of ER Ca 2+ stores induces a large conformational transition of the cytosolic STIM1 C-terminus, initiated by the dimerization of the transmembrane (TM) domain. We use the AI-guided transition path sampling algorithm aimmd to extensively sample the dimerization of STIM1-TM helices in an ER-mimicking lipid bilayer. In nearly 0.5 ms of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations without bias potentials, we harvest over 170 transition paths, each about 1.2 μs long on average. We find that STIM1 dimerizes into three distinct and coexisting configurations, which reconciles conflicting results from earlier crosslinking studies. The dominant X-shaped bound state centers around contacts supported by the SxxxG TM interfacial motif. Mutating residues in this contact interface allows us to tune the STIM1-dimerization propensity in fluorescence experiments. From the trained model of the committor probability of dimerization, we identify the transition state ensemble for TM-helix dimerization. At the transition state, interhelical contacts in the luminal halves of the two monomers dominate, which likely enables the luminal Ca 2+ -sensing domain in STIM1 to condition the dimerization of the TM helices. Our work demonstrates the unique power of AI-guided simulations to sample rare and slow molecular transitions and to produce detailed atomistic insight into the mechanism of STIM1 TM-helix dimerization as a key step in ER Ca 2+ -sensing.",

Here, we use the Drosophila ovary as a model to study the role of cytonemes in bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling–directed germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance and dedifferentiation of germ cells to GSCs. We provide evidence that differentiating germ cell cysts extend longer cytonemes that are more polarized toward the niche during dedifferentiation to reactivate BMP signaling. The presence of additional somatic cells in the niche is associated with a failure of germ cell dedifferentiation, consistent with the formation of a physical barrier to cytoneme–niche contact and outcompetition of germ cells for BMP. Using BMP beads in vitro, we show that these are sufficient to induce cytoneme-dependent contacts in Drosophila tissue culture cells. We demonstrate that the Enabled (Ena) actin polymerase is localized to the tips of germ cell cytonemes and is necessary for robust cytoneme formation, as its mislocalization reduces the frequency, length, and directionality of cytonemes. During homeostasis, specifically perturbing cytoneme function through Ena mislocalization impairs GSC fitness by reducing GSC BMP signaling and niche occupancy. Disrupting cytonemes by targeting Ena during dedifferentiation reduces germ cell BMP responsiveness and the ability of differentiating cysts to dedifferentiate. Overall, our results provide evidence that cytonemes play a fundamental role in establishing polarized signaling and niche occupancy during stem cell maintenance and dedifferentiation.",

We find that the process of flu transcription, both in the presence and absence of viral replication, is a key contributor to interferon induction.

          "abstract": "The glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) pathway is central to the synthesis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and glycerophospholipids, essential for membrane biogenesis and lipid storage. The first and rate-limiting step in this pathway is catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs), with microsomal GPAT3 and GPAT4 being evolutionarily conserved and predominant in most tissues. While previous studies have implicated Calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1) as a cofactor for GPAT4, the broader role of CHP1 in regulating microsomal GPATs and TAG biosynthesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CHP1 is a critical regulator of both GPAT3 and GPAT4, essential for their stability, enzymatic activity, and lipid droplet (LD) localization. Structural modeling and mutational analyses identified key hydrophobic interfaces mediating the CHP1–GPAT interaction, which are required for optimal GPAT activity and LD growth. Loss of CHP1 impairs LD expansion and disrupts the localization of GPAT3/4 and downstream enzymes in the TAG synthesis pathway, including 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3 (AGPAT3) and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). Mechanistically, CHP1 helps circumvent seipin-mediated restriction of late LD-targeting enzymes, facilitating their access to mature LDs. Together, our findings reveal CHP1 as a dual-function regulator that stabilizes and activates microsomal GPATs while enabling the coordinated recruitment of TAG biosynthetic enzymes to LDs. This work uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating LD growth and glycerolipid metabolism, with broad implications for lipid homeostasis and metabolic diseases.",

          "abstract": "Membrane active peptides (MAPs) represent a diverse group of agents that disrupt the integrity of lipid membranes. One class of MAPs, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), destroy bacteria by transiently porating the bacterial membrane causing leakage of cellular contents. Transient leakage is classified as “graded,” where all vesicles in a population leak partially, or “all-or-none,” where some vesicles leak completely. However, the molecular interactions underlying transient leakage have eluded experimental determination. Here, dye leakage experiments with the AMP piscidin 1 (P1) show that graded leakage can be converted to all-or-none by simply adding a defect-promoting lysophospholipid. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that area stress arising from membrane asymmetry decreases the energy of pore formation and is highly lipid dependent. Furthermore, lipids and peptides translocate the bilayer through these pores, leading to area-relaxed states where poration is highly unfavorable. Even pores too small to leak dye relieve area stress; they are the “none” component of all-or-none release. These observations lead to development of a quantitative model where graded and all-or-none leakage are treated as a continuum explained by a single mechanism that accounts for the local peptide concentration and probabilities of different pore sizes. This unified model accurately reproduces the P1 dye leakage data and provides an explanation for varying pore energy, size, and probability within the framework of asymmetry-driven poration. This model is expected to be applicable to other MAPs, including cell-penetrating peptides, and could provide a framework for designing peptides with greater cellular specificity, a long-sought outcome.",

Mineral–organic interactions in frozen environments, such as soils and permafrost, are crucial for explaining the flux of soluble iron during melting events, yet the mechanisms remain misunderstood. This study elucidates the unique roles of freezing in the dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles (α–FeOOH) by oxalate, a low molecular weight dicarboxylate, under acidic conditions. From time-resolved experiments conducted over 4 d, we demonstrate that soluble iron was released through reactions in minute volumes of liquid water trapped between ice micrograins. Freeze concentration of nanoparticles, oxalate, and protons into this liquid water drove oxalate- and proton-promoted dissolution reactions at temperatures as low as −30 °C. Remarkably, ice at −10 °C dissolved more iron than liquid water at 4 °C under high oxalate loadings, and even more than at 25 °C under low oxalate loadings. In contrast, high salinity subdued dissolution. Also, sequential freeze-thaw cycles enhanced dissolution by releasing unreacted oxalate that was previously locked in ice. By resolving the chemical controls on mineral dissolution in ice, this work can help explain how freeze-thaw events are supplying new fluxes of soluble iron to nature.",

We examine two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, on story generation and discover that LLM-generated stories often consist of plot elements that are echoed across a number of generations. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Sui Generis score, an automatic metric that measures the uniqueness of a plot element among alternative storylines generated using the same prompt under an LLM. Evaluating on 100 short stories, we find that LLM-generated stories often contain combinations of idiosyncratic plot elements echoed frequently across generations and across different LLMs, while plots from the original human-written stories are rarely recreated or even echoed in pieces. Moreover, our human evaluation shows that the ranking of Sui Generis scores among story segments correlates moderately with human judgment of surprise level, even though score computation is completely automatic without relying on human judgment.",

Its response to osmotic stress shares similarities with the function of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. In this study, we show that Yoda1, a Piezo1 agonist, activates WNK1 downstream kinase targets oxidative stress-responsive 1 (OSR1) and STE20/SPS1-related serine, proline-, and alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) in endothelial cells within minutes. Ionophore-induced Ca 2+ influx similarly triggers their activation. Comparable responses were observed in HDMEC, HUVEC, A549, MDA-MB-231, and HeLa cells. Hypotonic stress also enhances SPAK and OSR1 phosphorylation, which is attenuated by WNK1 inhibition or Piezo1 knockdown, whereas hypertonic stress-induced phosphorylation is not affected by Piezo1 knockdown. Chelating Ca 2+ or depleting intracellular stores prevents their activation, while increasing intracellular Ca 2+ via the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger or thapsigargin enhances it. ER-released Ca 2+ is sufficient to activate SPAK and OSR1 even in the absence of extracellular Ca 2+ , and this effect is diminished by Piezo1 knockdown. Both Yoda1 and ionomycin promote phosphorylation of WNK1 at serine 382, a modification that increases its catalytic activity. These findings identify Piezo1 as an activator of WNK1, linking Ca 2+ dynamics to WNK1-OSR1/SPAK signaling.",

It was traditionally thought that the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event enabled the origin of animals in marine environments, followed by their persistence in aerobic marine habitats ever since. However, recent studies of redox proxies (e.g., Fe, Mo, Ce, I) have suggested that low dissolved oxygen levels persisted in the deep ocean until the Late Devonian, when the first heavily wooded ligniophyte forests raised atmospheric O 2 to modern levels. Here, we present a Paleozoic redox proxy record based on selenium enrichments and isotope ratios in fine-grained siliciclastic sediments. Our data reveal transient oxygenation of bottom waters around the Ediacaran–Cambrian boundary, followed by predominantly anoxic deep-water conditions through the Early Devonian (419 to 393 Ma). In the Middle Devonian (393 to 382 Ma), our data document the onset of permanent deep-ocean oxygenation, coincident with the spread of woody biomass across terrestrial landscapes. This episode is concurrent with the ecological occupation and evolutionary radiation of large active invertebrate and vertebrate organisms in deeper oceanic infaunal and epifaunal habitats, suggesting that the burial of recalcitrant wood from the first forests sequestered organic carbon, increased deep marine oxygen levels, and was ultimately responsible for the “mid-Paleozoic marine revolution.”",

          "abstract": "Human learning embodies a striking duality: Sometimes, we can rapidly infer and compose logical rules, benefiting from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly conflicting behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems—one for rapid, rule-based inferences (e.g., in working memory) and another for slow, incremental adaptation (e.g., in long-term and procedural memory). It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of in-context learning (ICL)—the ability to flexibly infer the structure of a new task from a few examples. In contrast to standard in-weight learning (IWL), which is analogous to synaptic change, ICL is more naturally linked to activation-based dynamics thought to underlie working memory in humans. Here, we show that the interplay between ICL and IWL naturally ties together a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, including curriculum effects on category-learning tasks, compositionality, and a trade-off between flexibility and retention in brain and behavior. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering an integrative perspective on dual-process theories of human cognition.",

Migration behavior thus plays a fundamental role in the life cycle and Darwinian fitness of many organisms. While the influence of migration on early-life survival and reproduction is well documented, its effects on senescence (aging) in advanced age remain largely unexplored. Using a unique 44-y ring-resighting dataset from a long-lived, partially migratory bird species, the Greater Flamingo ( Phoenicopterus roseus ), we demonstrate that migration plays a key role in shaping age-specific trajectories of mortality and reproduction. Resident flamingos exhibit higher early-life demographic performances, with lower baseline mortality than migrants, resulting in longer adult lifespan. Residents also have a higher probability of breeding than migrants, though their breeding success is similar. However, residents seem to pay for their early-life advantages in old age, experiencing accelerated actuarial and reproductive senescence compared to migrants. Overall, our study highlights the critical impact of migration on survival and reproduction throughout life, thereby illustrating the role played by behavioral decisions in the biology of aging in long-lived vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "The fungal species Candida albicans and the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis are members of the human gut microbiome. To explore the range of interactions between these two species, we utilized dual RNA-sequencing to transcriptionally profile both C. albicans and E. faecalis during coculture (compared with monoculture controls) under two conditions: 1) an in vitro setting that mimics certain features of the gut environment and 2) a gnotobiotic mouse gut model. RNA-seq analysis revealed a large number of gene expression changes induced by one species in the presence of the other. More specifically, both species highly upregulate citrate-metabolizing genes during coculture: C. albicans upregulates CIT1 (citrate synthase) which produces citrate, while E. faecalis upregulates its cit operon, which breaks down citrate. In vitro analysis showed directly that citrate cross-feeding (production of citrate by C. albicans and breakdown by E. faecalis) enhances growth of E. faecalis . A main byproduct of citrate metabolism in E. faecalis is formate, a short chain fatty acid toxic to fungi. Our RNA profiling revealed that C. albicans upregulates three formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) during coculture; we show that the FDH genes confer a growth advantage to C. albicans when E. faecalis (or simply formate) is present. These findings reveal a metabolically driven cycle between C. albicans and E. faecalis in the mouse gut and in vitro, where cross-feeding of citrate and detoxification of formate facilitates the growth of both species when they are cultured together.",

          "abstract": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in PTPN11 (protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 11) which encodes for the protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2. Approximately 85% of NSML patients develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Here, we show that SHP2 is recruited to tyrosyl phosphorylated protein-zero related (PZR) in NSML mice. This recruitment is required for the Iroquois homeobox (IRX) transcription factors 3 and 5 to suppress BMP10 which negatively regulates postnatal cardiac growth. The protein expression of IRX3 and IRX5 was elevated in hypertrophied NSML hearts. IRX3 and IRX5 upregulation was rescued in NSML mice harboring a knock-in mutation of PZR that fails to become tyrosyl phosphorylated and recruit SHP2. NSML mice treated with low-dose dasatinib also exhibited normalized IRX3 and IRX5 expression levels. Consistent with this, BMP10 expression levels were reduced in NSML mice and rescued in PZR tyrosyl phosphorylation-deficient and low-dose dasatinib-treated NSML mice. A crystal structure of the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2 bound to tyrosyl phosphorylated PZR reveals that recruitment constrains the open SHP2 conformation to facilitate cellular-Src (c-Src) binding. Disruption of c-Src binding to SHP2 abolished IRX activation and failure to suppress BMP10. Hence, NSML-associated SHP2 genetic variants disrupt IRX transcription factor signaling to BMP10, implicating this axis as a target for RASopathy-associated HCM.",

Nonetheless, these scholars continue to debate over when people first started foraging for grass seeds, when they began to readily utilize sickles, how prominent the early selection pressures were, and when the first traits of domestication fully introgressed into the cultivated grass population. Here, we present complementary archaeobotanical and archaeological (stone tool) evidence for cereal foragers from Toda-1 Cave in the Surkhan Darya, dating to 9200 cal BP. We conclude that early Holocene foragers were processing grains along with nuts and fruits as far north as the rich river valleys of southern Uzbekistan. These data expand the known range that preagricultural cereal foragers covered in the early Holocene, adding to our understanding of the cultural processes that led to farming. Additionally, we present the earliest evidence for people interacting with the progenitors for pistachios and apples (or a close apple relative). The complex foraging behaviors that led to cultivation were being undertaken by people during the early Holocene across a wider area of Eurasia than previously thought.",

However, there is a shortage of molecular tools that enable the discovery of potential drug targets within schistosomes. Thus, praziquantel has remained the frontline treatment for schistosomiasis despite known liabilities. Here, we have conducted a genome-wide study in Schistosoma mansoni using the human druggable genome as a bioinformatic template to identify essential genes within schistosomes bearing similarity to catalogued drug targets. Then, we assessed these candidate targets in silico using a set of unbiased criteria to determine which possess ideal characteristics for a ready-made drug discovery campaign. Following this prioritization, we pursued a parasite p97 ortholog as a bona-fide drug target for the development of therapeutics to treat schistosomiasis. From this effort, we identified a covalent inhibitor series that kills schistosomes through an on-target killing mechanism by disrupting the ubiquitin proteasome system. Fascinatingly, these inhibitors induce a conformational change in the conserved D2 domain P-loop of schistosome p97 upon modification of Cys519. This conformational change reveals an allosteric binding site adjacent to the D2 domain active site reminiscent of the “DFG” flip in protein kinases. This allosteric binding site can potentially be utilized to generate new classes of species-selective p97 inhibitors. Furthermore, these studies provide a resource for the development of alternative therapeutics for schistosomiasis and a workflow to identify potential drug targets in similar systems with few available molecular tools.",

          "abstract": "Emergence of quantum orders with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. In this context, recently discovered chiral loop-current order in kagome metals has garnered significant attention. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) observed in CsV 3 Sb 5 , which provides compelling evidence for the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, the origin of the eMChA and its fundamental connection to the loop-current remain highly elusive, as the loop-current itself preserves inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that the loop-current phase breaks inversion symmetry in the presence of the experimentally observed stripe charge-density wave, leading to finite eMChA coefficient γ eM . In this mechanism, γ eM is proportional to the product of the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization, M orb 0 , and the lifetime of conduction electrons, τ . Therefore, γ eM is reversible by the magnetic fields, and it takes large value in kagome metals with τ v Fermi ≫ a 0 (=lattice constant). Surprisingly, the quantum metric, which defines a fundamental geometric aspect of Bloch wavefunctions, acquires significant momentum dependence in the loop-current phase, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of eMChA by ∼100 times. This research not only clarifies the fundamental symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals but also opens a path for exploring quantum metric–induced phenomena arising from exotic quantum phase transitions in various metals.",

However, empirical and theoretical treatments of the niche are mostly performed at the species level, neglecting individuals as important units of ecological and evolutionary processes. So far, a formal mathematical link between individual-level niches and higher organismal-level niches has been lacking, hampering the unification of ecological theories and more accurate forecasts of biodiversity change. To fill in this gap, we propose a bottom–up approach to derive population and higher organismal-level niches from individual niches. We demonstrate the power of our framework by showing that 1) the statistical properties of higher organismal-level niches (e.g., niche breadth, skewness, etc.) can be partitioned into individual contributions and 2) the species-level niche shifts can be estimated by tracing the responses of individuals. By using individual-level GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking data from three different species, we show that climate change could have contrasting consequences on population-level niche shift depending on individual niche compositions. Our method paves the way for a unifying niche theory and enables mechanistic assessments of organism–environment relationships across organismal scales.",

Unique for seahorses, pygmy seahorses retain juvenile paedomorphic stunted snouts, resembling the coral’s polyps. We analyzed the tiny seahorse’s genome revealing the genomic bases of several adaptations to their mutualistic life including substantial reductions in conserved noncoding elements that are associated with genes in the vicinity of those CNEs that are known to play a role in growth and metamorphosis-related pathways. Comparative RNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses during their ontogeny suggest that their stunted snout might result from craniofacial remodeling associated with hoxa2b defunctionalization. This is consistent also with findings from in situ hybridization and CRISPR experiments. Their immune system shows extremely low numbers of MHC genes and additional considerable losses of other immune-related genes. This is likely facilitated by the host coral’s antimicrobial metabolites and by the earlier evolution of male pregnancy that requires immunotolerance.",

          "abstract": "Inadequate response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) frequently arises in prostate cancer, driven by cellular mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics to define the transcriptional, epigenetic, and spatial basis of cell identity and castration response in the mouse prostate. Leveraging these data along with a meta-analysis of human prostates and prostate cancer (PCa), we identified cellular orthologs and key determinants of ADT response and resistance. Our findings reveal that mouse prostates harbor lobe-specific luminal epithelial cell types distinguished by unique gene regulatory modules and anatomically defined androgen-responsive transcriptional programs, indicative of divergent developmental origins. Androgen-insensitive, stem-like epithelial populations—resembling human club and hillock cells—are notably enriched in the urethra and ventral prostate but are rare in other lobes. Within the ventral prostate, we also uncovered two additional androgen-responsive luminal epithelial cell types, marked by Pbsn or Spink1 expression, which align with human luminal subsets and may define the origin of distinct PCa subtypes. Castration profoundly reshaped luminal epithelial transcriptomes, with castration-resistant luminal epithelial cells activating stress-responsive and stemness programs. These transcriptional signatures are enriched in tumor cells from ADT-treated and castration-resistant PCa patients, underscoring their likely role in driving treatment resistance. Temporal tracking of cells will precisely map disease-associated cellular transitions, and our technical framework facilitates such interrogations. Collectively, our comprehensive cellular atlas of the mouse prostate illuminates the importance of lobe-specific contexts for PCa modeling and reveals potential therapeutic targets to counter castration resistance.",

This study introduces charge-patterned mosaic membranes (CMMs) that selectively transport divalent asymmetric salts by leveraging a net-neutral membrane–solution interface. This mechanism, dictated by the charge ratio of positive and negative domains on the membrane surface and the balance of cations and anions in the salt, is supported by analytical, numerical, and experimental results. Analytical solutions identified cationic domain coverages ( f + ) of 33%, 50%, and 66% as optimal for the selective transport of +2:−1 salts, +1:−1 salts, and +1:−2 salts, respectively, under conditions where the pattern size ( L ) is significantly larger than the Debye length. Numerical simulations and experiments using CMMs with alternating charged-stripes inkjet-printed onto nanostructure copolymer substrates confirmed these findings. By varying stripe widths to control f + , pressure-driven filtration experiments demonstrated selective enrichment of MgCl 2 and K 2 SO 4 at the predicted f + values, with deviations from these values leading to salt rejection. These results highlight the pivotal role of a net-neutral interface in enabling asymmetric salt enrichment.

This family of biomacromolecules modulates binding to calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) in low free energy reactions that influence biochemical processes from cell signaling and anticoagulant efficacy to biomineralization. Despite their ubiquity, the thermodynamic basis for how heparans and similarly functionalized biomolecules regulate Ca 2+ interactions is not yet established. Using heparosan (Control) and heparins with different positions of sulfate groups, we quantify how SO 3 − and COO − content and SO 3 − position modulate Ca 2+ binding by isothermal titration calorimetry. The free energy of all heparin-Ca 2+ interactions (Δ G rxn ) is dominated by entropic contributions due to favorable water release from polar, hydrophilic groups. Heparin with both sulfate esters ( O -SO 3 − ) and sulfamides ( N -SO 3 − ) has the strongest binding to Ca 2+ compared to heparosan and to heparin with only O -SO 3 − groups (~3X). By linking Ca 2+ binding thermodynamics to measurements of the interfacial energy for calcite (CaCO 3 ) crystallization onto polysaccharides, we show molecule-specific differences in nucleation rate can be explained by differences in water structuring during Ca 2+ interactions. A large entropic term (- T Δ S rxn ) upon Ca 2+ –polysaccharide binding correlates with high interfacial energy to CaCO 3 nucleation. Combining our measurements with literature values indicates many Ca 2+ –polysaccharide interactions have a shared thermodynamic signature. The resulting enthalpy–entropy compensation relationship suggests these interactions are generally dominated by water restructuring involving few conformational changes, distinct from Ca 2+ –protein binding. Our findings quantify the thermodynamic origins of heparin-specific interactions with Ca 2+ and demonstrate the contributions of solvation and functional group position during biomacromolecule-mediated ion regulation.",

Haze events characterized by high particulate matter (PM) levels in China are not only of enormous magnitude but also represent a distinct chemical regime. Once driven by direct emissions, these high-PM episodes are now more affected by secondary aerosol, especially secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This Review synthesizes the state of the science of SOA formation in urban China, specifically (i) how the dominance of anthropogenic precursors affects SOA formation, (ii) what are the prevailing SOA formation mechanisms, and (iii) how important are the multipollutant and multiphase processes in SOA formation and evolution.

We report the discovery of kilometer-scale heterogeneities throughout Mars’ mantle, detected seismically through pronounced wavefront distortion of energy arriving from deeply probing marsquakes. These heterogeneities, likely remnants of the planet’s formation, imply a mantle that has undergone limited mixing driven by sluggish convection. Their size and survival constrain Mars’ poorly known mantle rheology, indicating a high viscosity of 10 21.3 to 10 21.9 pascal-seconds and low temperature dependence, with an effective activation energy of 70 to 90 kilojoules per mole, suggesting a mantle deforming by dislocation creep. The limited mixing, coupled with ubiquitous, scale-invariant heterogeneities, reflects a highly disordered mantle, characteristic of the more primitive interior evolution of a single-plate planet, contrasting sharply with the tectonically active Earth.",

On-chip precise synchronization between classical headers and quantum payloads enables dynamic routing and networking of high-fidelity entanglement guided by classical light. The quantum states are preserved through real-time error mitigation, relying solely on classical signal readout without disturbing quantum information.

In this study, we generated 61 capture-enriched M. columbi mitogenomes from the Basin of Mexico, in Central Mexico. Our analysis reveals that these mitogenomes belong to a mitochondrial lineage distinct from other North American mammoths. These divergent mitogenomes suggest a deep population structure in their ancestors, and challenge prior assumptions based on geographically restricted samples.

Septal adipose tissue macrophages (sATMs), marked by CD209b and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, were long-lived and positioned in close proximity to adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) within the WAT septum. Within this shared niche, sATMs instructed the differentiation of ASCs into white adipocytes through transforming growth factor–β1 (TGFβ1). Depletion of sATMs, or the selective loss of TGFβ1 within tissue-resident macrophages, redirected ASC fate toward thermogenic adipocytes, enhancing WAT beiging and protecting against diet-induced obesity.

Cryo–electron microscopy analysis of UBR4 in complex with its cofactors KCMF1 and CALM1 reveals a massive 1.3-megadalton ring structure, featuring a central substrate-binding arena and flexibly attached catalytic units. Our structure shows how UBR4 binds substrate and extends lysine-48–specific ubiquitin chains. Efficient substrate targeting depends on both preubiquitination and specific N-degrons, with KCMF1 acting as a key substrate filter. The architecture of the E4 megacomplex is conserved across eukaryotes, but species-specific adaptations allow UBR4 to perform its precisely tuned quality control function in diverse cellular environments.",

We assessed carbon and nitrogen dynamics across the northern Yellowstone ecosystem, where one of the last remaining large migratory populations resides. Bison stabilized net aboveground production while accelerating nitrogen turnover, increasing aboveground nitrogen pools while carbon pools remained stable, which improved landscape nutritional quality. Effects were strongest in wet, nutrient-rich habitats that received higher bison densities and grazing than is recommended in rangeland management, while soil and plant conditions suggested landscape resilience. Restoration should embrace heterogeneity in densities and effects across habitats and spatial scales beyond those guiding most current recovery efforts.",

We detected a signature of positive selection at ZFPM1 —known to be a modulator of behavior in mice—occurring ~5000 years ago (ya), suggesting that taming was one of the earliest steps toward domestication of horses. Intensive selection at GSDMC began ~4750 ya with the domestication bottleneck, leading regulatory variants to high frequency by ~4150 ya. GSDMC genotypes are linked to body conformation in horses and to spinal anatomy, motor coordination, and muscular strength in mice.

We also used conditional genetics in mouse embryos and stem cells and found that the TFs SP5 and SP8 regulate cilia formation and gene expression. In embryos lacking Sp5 and Sp8 , primary and motile cilia were shorter than normal and reduced in number across cell types, contributing to situs inversus and hydrocephalus.

Constraining land availability to avoid unintended albedo-induced warming and safeguard water and biodiversity (389 million hectares available for forestation globally) would sequester 39.9 petagrams of carbon by 2050, substantially below previous estimates. This estimate drops to 12.5 petagrams of carbon with land further limited to existing policy commitments (120 million hectares).

Functional gain-/loss-of-function studies in murine kidney disease models demonstrated a substantial renoprotective function of tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR. Mechanistically, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR assembled stable G-quadruplex structures and sequestered pseudouridine synthase 7 (PUS7), preventing catalytic pseudouridylation of histone mRNAs. The resulting pseudouridylation deficiency directed histone mRNAs to the autophagosome-lysosome pathway, triggering RNA autophagy.

Notably, the apparent sinuosity of rivers, derived from the variance of sediment accretion direction measured in rocks, substantially increased when land plants evolved, around 425 million years ago. This led to the hypothesis that the rise of vegetation triggered river meandering. Recent studies of barren, meandering rivers challenge this notion, but the Paleozoic shift in the geometry of river deposits remains unexplained. Here, we suggest that it occurred because vegetation changes how river bends move through space. Using satellite images to monitor river migration, we found that bank vegetation alters the orientation of point bar accretion, resulting in a 62% increase in the inferred variance of flow direction. These results explain why meandering rivers have been underrecognized in prevegetation stratigraphy.",

          "abstract": "We investigate how to counter misinformation about voter and election fraud using data from the US and Brazil. Our study first compares two types of messages countering claims of widespread fraud: (i) retrospective corrections from credible sources speaking against interest and (ii) prebunking messages that prospectively warn of false claims about future elections and provide information about election security practices. In the US, each approach immediately increased election confidence and reduced fraud beliefs, with prebunking showing somewhat more durable effects. In Brazil, prebunking had positive immediate effects across measured outcomes, whereas those of the credible source corrections were less consistent. We then conducted an experiment in the US randomizing exposure to a persuasion forewarning before election security information is provided. Prebunking again increased confidence and decreased fraud beliefs but only when the forewarning was omitted, suggesting that novel factual information is responsible for the observed effects of the prebunking treatment.",

          "abstract": "When speakers of different languages are in contact, they often borrow features like sounds, words, or syntactic patterns from one language to the other. However, the lack of historical data has hampered estimation of this effect at a global scale. We overcome this hurdle by using genetic admixture and shared geohistorical location as a proxy for population contact. We find that language pairs whose speaker populations underwent genetic admixture or that are located in the same geohistorical area exhibit notable similar increases in shared linguistic patterns across world regions and different demographic relationships, suggesting a consistent trend in borrowing rates. At the same time, the effect varies strongly across specific linguistic features. This variation is only partly explained by cognitive differences in lifelong learnability and by social functions of signaling assimilation through borrowing, leaving much randomness in which specific features are borrowed. Additionally, we find that, for some features, admixture decreases sharing, likely reflecting signals of divergence (schismogenesis) under contact.",

          "abstract": "In the vertebrate brain, neural stem cell (NSC) quiescence is necessary for stemness maintenance. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in the zebrafish adult telencephalon, we identified different molecular clusters of quiescent NSCs, interpreted to sign different quiescence depths. Here, we show that these clusters, when challenged in vivo with an inhibitor of Notch signaling, a major quiescence promoting pathway, unfold different behaviors. Notably, deeply quiescent NSCs with astrocytic features display a unique activation phenotype that combines the maintenance of astrocytic markers with the rapid up-regulation of activation and neuronal commitment genes, reminiscent to murine periventricular astrocytes activating upon lesion. In contrast, an NSC cluster predicted to be in the deepest quiescence state resists Notch blockade, and we demonstrate that the transcription factor Nr2f1b mediates this resistance to activation in vivo. These results together link the molecular heterogeneity of quiescent NSCs with bona fide biological properties and their molecular regulators.",

          "abstract": "The resolution of a measurement system is fundamentally constrained by the wavelength of the used wave packet and the numerical aperture of the optical system. Overcoming these limits requires advanced interferometric techniques exploiting quantum correlations. While quantum interferometry can surpass the Heisenberg limit, it has been confined to the optical domain. Extending it to x-rays enables sub-angstrom spatial and zeptosecond temporal resolution, unlocking atomic-scale processes inaccessible to existing methods. Here, we demonstrate x-ray quantum interferometry using 17.5–kilo–electron volt ( λ = 70 picometers) photon pairs. Our approach introduces a phase measurement technique with exceptional noise resilience, mitigating the impact of mechanical instabilities, vibrations, and photonic noise—key challenges in x-ray interferometry. By generating and using entangled x-ray photons, we lay the foundation for next-generation techniques with unprecedented phase precision. This breakthrough carries far-reaching consequences for fundamental physics, high-resolution imaging, and spectroscopy, bringing to light quantum optical effects never before accessed in the x-ray regime.",

          "abstract": "The autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is a primary immunodeficiency, which originates from heterozygous missense mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) gene. It is accepted that most STAT3 variants causing AD-HIES are dominant negative. Whether haploinsufficient mutations cause a phenotype in humans is still debated. We report on a family with a heterozygous STAT3 nonsense mutation that led to rapid decay of the mutant mRNA and protein, leading to haploinsufficiency. To explore STAT3 heterozygosity, we created a Stat3 haploinsufficient ( Stat3 +/− ) mouse model in which we found that Stat3 +/− mice had increased IgE serum levels, reduced T H 17 cell differentiation, and were susceptible to a cutaneous Staphylococcus aureus infection. Together, our findings provide mechanistic evidence for the impact of haploinsufficiency in STAT3 with residual protein expression as an important cause for immune deficiency. The implications extend to the diagnosis of immunodeficiency disorders and to the design of gene therapy in situations where gene dosage matters.",

          "abstract": "The measurement of three-dimensional genome folding in the nucleus, mostly through Hi-C methods, is expressed as contact frequencies between genomic segments, without anchoring to physical axes of the spherical nucleus. Here, we mapped the chromatin contacts along nuclear radial axis and built radial score by factoring in contact frequencies. The chromatin high-order structures exhibit rich diversity along radial axis. Furthermore, the proximal trans contacts retrieved by radial score reveal conserved active/inactive chromatin segregation across intra- and interchromosomal interactions. Ablation of CTCF proteins disrupts chromatin loops with mild changes to chromatin radial positioning. By acutely perturbing multiple transcription factor (TF) occupancy, chromatin loop dissolutions are often accompanied by radial dissociations between two anchors. Our work provides a genome architecture reference map adhering to nuclear physical axis and suggests that multiple architectural TFs collectively shape nuclear positioning of chromatin and their contacts, with contacts serving as forces on chromatin positioning as well.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal death in stroke and other conditions stems in part from stimulation of N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA)–type glutamate receptors. This induces neuronal production of both nitric oxide and superoxide, which together induce oxidative cell injury. Nitric oxide can readily cross lipid membranes, but superoxide, being an anion, cannot. Using primary neuronal cultures, we show that superoxide enters neurons through volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs). Oxidative injury produced by either exogenous superoxide or NMDA receptor stimulation is prevented by the VRAC inhibitor [4-(2-butyl-6,7-dichlor-2-cyclopentylindan-1-on-5-yl)oxybutyric acid] (DCPIB) and by disruption of the essential VRAC subunit, leucine-rich repeat–containing 8A (LRRC8A). In mouse cortex, neuronal oxidative injury induced by either NMDA or transient ischemia is likewise blocked by both DCPIB and LRRC8A disruption. Selective expression of LRRC8A/C and LRRC8A/D but not LRRC8A/D subunits conferred superoxide conductance in HeLa cells. Superoxide entry through VRACs is thus a requisite step in excitotoxic neuronal injury, and interventions affecting VRAC subunit composition, localization, or opening could influence neuronal survival.",

Here, we reconstruct up to 200 years of coral calcifying fluid Ω Ar , using Raman spectroscopy techniques, at approximately monthly resolution in two Porites sp. skeletal cores from the Coral Sea region to investigate (i) the regulation of coral calcifying fluid Ω Ar and (ii) the skeletal calcification response to industrial-era ocean acidification.

Our findings show that several disorders were associated with increased AD/PD risk before diagnosis, with variation in the strength and timing of associations across conditions. Polygenic risk scores reveal lower genetic predisposition for AD/PD in individuals with co-occurring disorders. Moreover, the proteomic profile of AD/PD cases was influenced by comorbid gut-brain axis disorders.

However, efficiency of snap-through energy release is challenging to improve because of the inherent trade-off between initial curvature and stiffness. Here, spatial programming of stiffness variation in the azobenzene-functionalized liquid-crystalline polymer (Azo-LCP) addresses this limitation and achieves efficient photomechanical jumping. Introduction of stiffness mismatch induced localized curvature, which preserved the initial curvature and simultaneously enhanced photomechanical strain responsivity. By programming for symmetry of stiffness variation, we achieved directional or vertical jumping via strategic placement of the rigid region, with corresponding stress accumulation behaviors corroborated by finite element simulations. Integration of patterned stiffness variation with geometric asymmetry enabled both vertical and horizontal jumping within a single structure, without compromising performance. This dual-mode jumper also demonstrated sequential and consecutive jumps under continuous light exposure.",

We distinguished two performance levels: the coupling dependent inversion of polarization and the full bilinear π-rotation capability. In addition, all four essential variants of bilinear π rotations—BIRD d , BIRD r , BIRD d , X , and BIRD r , X filters—were given for all cases studied. In the first step, adiabatic CHIRP-type and BUBI/BUBU pulses lead to improved robustness with respect to offset/detuning effects and variations in B 1 -field strengths. In the second step, we optimized time-optimal coupling–compensated BIRD elements. Together with correspondingly optimized pulse shapes, we established fully coupling, offset, and B 1 -compensated bilinear π-rotation (COB-BIRD) elements and characterized them in theory and experiment. Overall, this demonstrated the use of the robust bilinear rotation capability on a partially aligned sample in a homodecoupled two-dimensional NMR experiment.",

          "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxin serotype B1 (BoNT/B) is a highly potent neurotoxin and therapeutic agent. Here, we present the structure of the complete 14-subunit (780 kDa) progenitor toxin complex (L-PTC) and of five subcomplexes. The structures show how the toxin interacts with its associated components in their role to protect and deliver BoNT/B across epithelial barriers. Each subcomplex, including the M-PTC, M-PTC–HA70, NTNH-HA70, and HA70 trimer, provides detailed understanding of the assembly mechanism, in which the NTNH-nLoop adopts a unique fold that locks the M-PTC into a central pore formed by HA70. The HA subcomplex presents a tripod architecture with flexible legs that may adapt to the rugged cell surface. Mass photometry reveals the pH dependence of BoNT/B release from the complex which is unexpectedly influenced by the presence of HA70. This study provides the complete L-PTC structure, offering insights into its assemblage and supporting the development of countermeasures and therapeutic applications.",

          "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) hijacked by intracellular bacteria contribute to pathogen dissemination and immunopathology. How bacteria achieve DC subversion remains largely unknown. Here, we describe the mechanism used by tularemia agent Francisella tularensis exploiting host mitochondrial anaplerosis. Shortly after internalization, Francisella associates with DC mitochondria, which leads to the rapid repurposing of their oxidative metabolism for production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Mitochondrial metabolic rewiring is orchestrated by the intramitochondrial signaling mediated by protein acetylation and involves switching to glutamate as the primary substrate for DC tricarboxylic acid cycle. Rather than killing the bacterium, glutamate-fueled mtROS production activates p38-dependent proinflammatory gene expression. Blocking of glutamate utilization prevents DC activation and bacterial dissemination and alleviates inflammation in vivo. Our findings underscore the importance of metabolic plasticity in antibacterial DC response and open up potential avenues for therapies targeting host metabolism.",

The synchrotron x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy results confirmed the selective formation of ketyl radicals. The noninteger charge transfer between graphdiyne and metal atoms promotes the continuous selectivity and efficient activation of aldehydes and C─C coupling of ketyl radicals.

Despite medical advances, the absence of broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAs) prevents rapid responses to emerging viral threats. This is largely due to the lack of universal drug targets across diverse viral families and high variability among viral proteins. In this study, we evaluated 57 synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs) for antiviral activity in cellulo using pseudotyped virus particles (PVPs) from six high-risk viruses across three families: Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, and Coronaviridae. Four SCRs inhibited all tested PVPs, and their efficacy was confirmed against live viruses including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, EBOV, MARV, NiV, and HeV. Notably, SCR005 and SCR007 , which exhibited minimal toxicity, significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in a severe animal model with a single dose. Mechanistic studies suggested that SCRs bind viral envelope N-glycans, blocking viral attachment and/or fusion. These results identify conserved viral N-glycans as promising BSA targets and establish SCRs as candidate prophylactic agents against enveloped viruses with pandemic potential.",

We quantify dynamic changes to northern terrestrial carbon stocks from the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years) until present at millennial time steps using a combination of paleo-data and climate-biome modeling. During the deglaciation, northern land carbon storage declined by &gt;300 petagrams of carbon with a minimum around 11,000 years, followed by progressively higher land carbon stocks during the Holocene. We find evidence that dynamic changes in terrestrial land carbon stocks were of a scale to exert large influence on atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and that postglacial terrestrial carbon stock dynamics were dominated by losses from permafrost-affected loess and gains into peatlands.",

These intriguing molecules are rare instances of stable CO diborylation products that were made accessible by direct CO capture. While the monocarbonyl product shows remarkable thermal stability, the dicarbonyl product rearranges into a bicyclic tetraborylethylene structure under thermal stress. Combined analytical and theoretical efforts clearly highlight the unique electronic, spectroscopic, and structural characteristics of these carbonyl compounds. The cyclopentanone analog engages in stepwise one- and two-electron reduction processes to yield radical monoanion and dianion species while preserving the five-membered ring structure and the boron-boron bonds. Together, these boron heterocycles expand the limited class of stable boryl ketones containing direct boron-carbonyl carbon bonds, thus offering valuable opportunities for exploring the fundamental chemistry and synthetic applications of this functionality.",

The BoNT/A–NTNH complex protects the toxin from adverse environment, while the complex consisting of HA proteins facilitates toxin absorption during oral intoxication. How these two independent modules assemble into the L-PTC remains unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the BoNT/A–NTNH–HA70 complex at ~2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals that the BoNT/A–NTNH complex is anchored into a concentric double β-barrel channel of trimeric HA70 through a short β-hairpin of NTNH (termed nLoop), resembling a nut-and-bolt attachment. We find that the nLoop of NTNH is strictly conserved across HA-containing BoNT complexes and that NTNH–HA70 binding is interchangeable among them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nLoop functions as a minimal motif enabling attachment of a protein-of-interest to the HA complex, with potential applications in oral biologics delivery.",

Here, we demonstrate tunable SHG enhancement using virtual coupling effects between quasi-bound state in the continuum (qBIC) optical resonances and tunable excitons in high-index WS 2 metasurfaces with crescent meta-atoms. These metasurfaces promote a magnetic-type qBIC resonance, enabling control over nonlinear optical processes in the visible spectrum. The used qBIC resonance at half the exciton energy increases SHG efficiency by 98-fold compared to monolayer WS 2 and by four orders of magnitude relative to an unpatterned WS 2 film. The enhancement is tunable with temperature and incident light polarization, allowing the dynamic control of virtual coupling and SHG efficiency, thereby paving the way for next-generation reconfigurable metaoptics devices.",

While the role of these genes has been extensively studied in neurons, microglial functions such as phagocytosis are also dependent on cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that disturbance of actin cytoskeletal regulation in microglia, modeled by genetically impairing the scaffold protein Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), which integrates actin-binding proteins, causes a shift in actin regulatory balance favoring filopodial versus lamellipodial actin organization. The resulting microglia-specific dysregulation of actin dynamics leads to excessive uptake of synaptic proteins. Genetically engineered DISC1-deficient mice show diminished hippocampal excitatory transmission and associated spatial memory deficits. Reintroducing wild-type microglia-like cells via bone marrow transplantation in adult DISC1-deficient mice restores the synaptic function of neurons and rescues cognitive performance. These findings reveal a pivotal role for microglial actin cytoskeletal remodeling in preserving synaptic integrity and cognitive health.

Genetic evidence implicates impaired mitophagy in Parkinson’s disease, making its pharmacological enhancement a promising therapeutic strategy.

Both compounds lower the threshold for mitochondrial toxins to induce PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. However, global proteomics revealed that FB231 and MTK458 independently induce mild mitochondrial stress, resulting in impaired mitochondrial function and activation of the integrated stress response, effects that result from PINK1/Parkin-independent off-target activities. We find that these compounds impair mitochondria by distinct mechanisms and synergistically decrease mitochondrial function and cell viability in combination with classical mitochondrial toxins.

Loss of MAEA impairs RAD51 recruitment at stalled RFs, leading to increased sensitivity to RS-inducing agents and excessive degradation of nascent DNA strands.

We lack a mechanistic understanding of how environmental changes reshape the resulting bimodal rest-activity pattern. Here, we uncover a seasonal switch mechanism that remodels the evening bout of activity. Under temperate summer-like conditions, levels of the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptide diminish, triggering a cascade. Lowered PDF receptor (PDFR) signaling disinhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3/SHAGGY to advance the evening output, and in parallel, weakens the siesta-promoting vc DN1p-SIF amide axis to expand the evening peak. Under these conditions, vc DN1p takes over the evening pacemaker role by exerting control over the dorsal lateral oscillator neurons. Our findings elucidate how environment-induced changes in PDFR signaling tip the balanced output of the clock network, aligning daily rhythms with seasonal time. Neuropeptide-driven parallel adjustment of clock circuitry and clock protein functioning likely represents a conserved strategy, enabling animals to adapt their daily behavior to seasonal changes.",

In 106 patients with 29 benign nodules, 45 papillary thyroid carcinomas, and 32 follicular neoplasms, three PAI-derived parameters—the photoacoustic spectral gradient, oxygen saturation, and skewness of the oxygen saturation distribution—were combined using a support vector machine. Following USI-based American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines, they were used to develop the ATA-Photoacoustic (ATAP) scoring system. The ATAP score achieved 97% sensitivity and 38% specificity in distinguishing nodules requiring FNAB. Our approach enabled better identification of benign nodules, reducing unnecessary FNAB in 11 of the 29 benign cases. This dual-modal strategy can assess thyroid nodules, effectively reducing unnecessary biopsies while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.",

To address this, we introduce mixture modeling for multiple-instance learning (MMIL), an expectation-maximization approach that trains cell-level binary classifiers using only patient-level labels. Applied to primary samples from patients with acute leukemia, MMIL accurately separates leukemia from nonleukemia baseline cells, including rare minimal residual disease (MRD) cells; generalizes across tissues and treatment time points; and identifies biologically relevant features with accuracy approaching that of a hematopathologist. MMIL can also incorporate cell labels when they are available, creating a robust framework for leveraging both labeled and unlabeled cells. MMIL provides a flexible modeling framework for cell classification, especially in scenarios with unknown gold-standard cell labels.",

Although neurons in the macaque anterior temporal lobe (ATL) show invariance to face viewpoint, whether they also encode abstract representations of caller identity is not known. Here, we demonstrate that neurons in the voice-selective ATL of two macaques support invariant voice identity representations through dynamic population-level coding. These representations minimize neural distances across different vocalizations from the same individual while preserving distinct trajectories for different callers. This structure emerged from the coordinated activity of the broader neuronal ensemble, although a small subset of highly identity-selective neurons carried high identity information. Our findings provide a neural basis for voice identity recognition in primates and highlight the ATL as a key hub for integrating perceptual voice features into higher-level identity representations.",

The fiberbot was demonstrated to perform precise navigation and steering in a constrained spherical model and an isolated pig knee joint.

In this study, we investigate the differences between these two phases through a comprehensive set of analytical methods, from macrolevel assessments (rheology) to microlevel characterizations (small and wide-angle x-ray scattering, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy) and chemical analyses. The lower phase is enriched in free fatty acids and lead carboxylates, especially saturated species—both as free acids and metal soaps—prone to self-organization. As a result, the lower phase displays a pronounced lamellar organization with partial crystallization and exhibits viscoelastic and shear-thinning properties. In contrast, the unstructured upper phase behaves as a Newtonian fluid. The observed phenomena share similarities with the formation of soap-related defects such as protrusions, linked to saturated lead soaps.",

To address this, we developed a deep learning–based method that not only recovers parameter distributions from exponential signals with improved accuracy but also provides an uncertainty estimation for each reconstruction result. This additional insight allows the user to assess the confidence across spectral regions, providing a clearer and more reliable framework for Laplace-related data interpretation, thus facilitating broader applications in fields such as chemistry and materials science.",

Much of our knowledge about SSA derives from coastal observations near shorelines, but whether and when these observations accurately represent open oceans remain unclear. Here, we show that strong nearshore SSA production during high-wave periods greatly enhances downwind cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and aerosol mass concentrations. Strong shoreline wave breaking is widespread globally, and swell waves, which are decoupled from local winds, play a dominant role in many coastal regions. Therefore, extrapolating results based on coastal measurements to open oceans may significantly overestimate SSA concentration and its contribution to CCN and, by extension, the impact of SSA on clouds and climate. Additionally, the strong enhancement of coastal aerosol population by shoreline wave breaking and its environmental impact on coastal communities cannot be captured by current regional models, which do not parameterize nearshore SSA generation using wave energy or completely neglect it.",

Here, we report poorer disease outcomes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) expressing high IgM versus those expressing IgG1. Using isogenic lymphoma cells expressing distinct BCRs, we found that IgM expressing cells strongly outcompete their IgG1 counterparts. Mechanistically, IgG1 BCR is associated with a dysfunctional mitochondrial state and reduced cell survival. We show that mitochondrial dysfunction is triggered by accentuated calcium responses downstream of IgG1 BCR. Genetic reversal of IgG1 to IgM, pharmacological dampening of calcium signaling, or treatment with interleukin-21 can correct mitochondrial defects and rescue IgG1 survival.

Here, we show that α-actinin-3 deficiency decreases AR in muscles of mice and humans (in males and females) and that AR positively correlates with α-actinin-3 expression in a dosage-dependent manner. α-Actinin-3 deficiency exacerbates gastrocnemius mass loss with androgen deprivation in male mice and stunts the muscle growth response to dihydrotestosterone in female mice at the onset of puberty. This is mediated by differential activation of pathways regulating amino acid metabolism, intracellular transport, autophagy, mitochondrial activity, MAPK, and calcineurin signaling, likely driven by seven key genes that are both androgen sensitive and α-actinin-3–dependent in expression. Our results highlight a role for ACTN3 as a regulator of muscle mass and a genetic modifier of androgen action in skeletal muscle.",

HSPCs express low levels of Id1 that is induced by growth factors and other mediators of inflammatory during stress to promote HSPC expansion. Since chronic inflammation is associated with the progression of hematopoietic malignancies, reducing Id1 expression may reduce CH. Genetic ablation of Id1 in Tet2 −/− HSPCs reduces HSPC expansion/CH, extramedullary hematopoiesis, myeloid skewing, and genetic instability and delays the onset of disease.

          "abstract": "Current gene circuits designed to time gene expression depend on the intricate interactions among various regulators and their targets, which confines them to a limited range of temporal tunability. Here, we report a programmable timer switch of gene expression termed BioFuse, which allows the reaction time ranging from hours to days. BioFuse comprises a series of fuse-like tandem DNA cassettes that can be sequentially edited by the adenine base editors (ABEs), resulting in either the activation or deactivation of a downstream gene once the editing is complete. Adjusting the number of DNA cassettes incorporated allows precise programming of BioFuse’s reaction time. Applying BioFuse to control carotenoid biosynthesis genes decouples lycopene production from growth in E. coli and increases lycopene yield without external inducers. Using BioFuse in a bacterial autolysis system enables timely and efficient protein release. BioFuse offers a versatile tool for precise, wide-range timing of gene expression and metabolic activities in bacteria, with potential applications in industry and biomedicine.",

Their spatiotemporal activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) is tightly controlled to ensure fidelity. Our structural and functional comparison of the tri-longin domain RabGEFs Mon1-Ccz1 and Fuzzy-Inturned reveals the molecular basis for their target specificity. Both complexes rely on a conserved sequence motif of their substrate GTPases for the catalytic mechanism, while secondary interactions allow discrimination between targets. We also find that dimeric Mon1-Ccz1 from fungi and the metazoan homologs with the additional third subunit RMC1/Bulli bind membranes through electrostatic interactions via distinct interfaces. Protein-lipid interaction studies and functional characterization in flies reveal an essential function of RMC1/Bulli as mediator of GEF complex membrane recruitment. In the case of Fuzzy-Inturned, reconstitution experiments demonstrate that the BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) domain protein CiBAR1 can support membrane recruitment of the GEF.

          "abstract": "The nervous system uses prior information to enhance movement accuracy, yet the underlying computational mechanisms remain relatively unclear. Prevailing motor control models emphasize Bayesian inference, where prior information is integrated to optimally estimate the current state. An alternative framework, efficient coding, proposes that the system dynamically reallocates encoding resources on the basis of environmental statistics—a mechanism highlighted in perception while underappreciated in motor control. We compared these frameworks in reaching movements, focusing on how the system leverages short-term priors in unpredictable environments. Unexpectedly, sequential effects aligned with the efficient coding model and contradicted Bayesian models. Specifically, current movements were biased in the opposite direction of previous movements, and movement variability decreased when successive reaches were similar. We further explored the temporal dynamics of these effects and showed that sequential bias is enhanced by intrinsic motor variability. These findings, accompanied by model comparisons, further support efficient coding in motor planning.",

Using a comprehensive survey of a fish community in a central Amazonian floodplain, conducted over the 2003, 2012, and 2022 hydrological cycles, we ask if the high levels of environmental heterogeneity (both temporal and spatial) that characterize this ecosystem constrain the capacity of species to dominate local assemblages. We find rapid replacement of dominant species, with local species richness inversely related to dominance. Marked turnover in fish community structure and composition is also present, with different functional groups favored under changing environmental conditions. By showing that turnover in dominant species fuels species coexistence, we identify an ecological mechanism that helps explain how environmental heterogeneity can foster tropical biodiversity.",

Phytoplankton frequently experience a limiting supply of multiple nutrients simultaneously (colimitation). Ocean warming is predicted to exacerbate marine nutrient limitation. Yet, how phytoplankton adapt their physiology and regulate responses to colimitation is poorly understood. Here, we show that when the crucial macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) colimit growth of globally abundant phytoplankton, the diatoms, cellular resources are diverted to prioritize N uptake over P sensing and acquisition. Regulatory mechanisms for responding to fluctuating P supply, including Phosphate Starvation Response 1 (PSR1) and P-resupply sensing via Ca 2+ signaling, are strictly nitrate dependent. Further, P-Ca 2+ signaling is impaired in psr1 mutants, suggesting that PSR1 is necessary for this response and coordinates adaptations to colimitation. Our study demonstrates a hierarchy of resource allocation during colimitation that points to N starvation mechanisms overriding those of P and could lead to N-P colimitation being masked in many marine ecosystems.",

This unique resource reveals wide spatial variation, where SUMO proteins and proteases have subfunctionalized in both their expression and subcellular localization. During stress, SUMO conjugation is mainly driven by tissue-specific regulation of the SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme. Stress-specific modulation of the SUMO pathway reveals unique combinations of proteases being targeted for regulation in distinct root tissues by salt, osmotic, and biotic signals.

The current climate shows several hundred supercells per convective season. Occurrence peaks are colocated with complex topography, e.g., the Alps. The absolute frequency maximum lies along the southern Alps and minima over the oceans and flat areas. Comparing a current-climate simulation with a pseudo–global warming +3°C global warming scenario, the future climate simulation shows an average increase of supercell occurrence by 11%.

However, reducing the thickness of the structure is almost the only strategy to enhance the elastic bendability of inorganic flexible electronics. This study proposes an overbend strategy, whose operation is beyond the designed elasticity of the fabricated structure. Mechanical theories, finite element analysis, and experiments verified that, with multilayer stacks and interconnects with various geometric designs as examples, the overbend strategy can enhance the designed elastic bendability to twice for the material of the ideal elastoplastic/kinematic hardening constitutive relationship and to more than twice for the mixed hardening/isotropic hardening constitutive relationship. The mechanism is extending the elastic strain range at the critical section to twice or more times the original value by the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relationship. Notably, the overbend strategy is virtually costless, combinative with other strategies and widely applicable for inorganic flexible electronics.",

Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the “ripplon” interface modes. Last, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain.

We find that while cell volume and mass exhibit complex behavior after osmotic shock, CMD follows a straightforward monotonic recovery over 48 hours. This recovery is cell cycle independent and depends on coordinated adjustment of protein synthesis and volume growth rates. Unexpectedly, the protein synthesis rate decreases when CMD increases. We observe that nucleoplasm-cytoplasm transport is CMD dependent, which contributes to negative regulatory feedback on CMD. The Na + /H + exchanger helps regulate CMD by affecting both protein synthesis and volume change.

Our findings reveal dynamic regulation of SLC35A4-MP expression during primary brown adipocyte differentiation in vitro and during cold exposure or high-fat diet (HFD)–induced obesity in mice. Using a knockout mouse model, we show that loss of SLC35A4-MP disrupts mitochondrial lipid composition, decreasing cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolamine in brown adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice. SLC35A4-MP deficiency also impairs mitochondrial activity, alters mitochondrial number and morphology, and promotes inflammation. Knockout mice accumulate acylcarnitines during cold exposure, indicating defective fatty acid oxidation. These findings reveal SLC35A4-MP as a previously unrecognized microprotein in regulating mitochondrial function and tissue lipid metabolism, adding to the growing list of functional endogenous microproteins.",

Supported by molecular dynamics simulations, we confirm that electrostatic effects promote the dehydration of Cl − , the counterions to the membrane charge, at the positively charged membrane surface. This dehydration leads to a great tendency of Cl − to absorb to the membrane surface and be retained, compromises Cl − partitioning, and impedes salt cotransport. For negatively charged membranes, Cs + with its lower hydration energy undergoes greater electrostatic-driven dehydration and partition hindrance than K + , resulting in selective KCl transport. Our findings provide both theoretical and experimental proofs of ionic dehydration and transport impediments driven by electrostatic interactions at charged membrane surfaces, presenting an in-depth perspective for designing ion-selective membranes to separate similar ions based on charge effects.",

We demonstrate that macrophage oxLDL-derived superoxide modulates mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, facilitating foam cell formation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial superoxide drives signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation, leading to reduced tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In parallel, mitochondrial superoxide enhances chromatin accessibility at STAT5 target genes, establishing a distinct STAT5 signaling signature in foam cells ex vivo and in human and mouse plaques in vivo. Inhibition of STAT5 during atherosclerosis progression prevents the differentiation of macrophages to mature Trem2 hi Gpnmb hi foam cells.

Here, we report that DKC1 drives an ATF4-mediated transcriptional program that supports amino acid metabolism and stress adaptation. We identify hnRNP A1, an IRES trans-acting factor, as a critical downstream mediator of DKC1 in sustaining ATF4 expression and IRES-dependent translation. Mechanistically, DKC1-mediated pseudouridylation at two specific 28 S ribosomal RNA sites is crucial for maintaining hnRNP A1 protein expression. In turn, hnRNP A1 binds and stabilizes ATF4 messenger RNA, preferentially promoting IRES-dependent translation of ATF4 variant 1. Furthermore, cellular stress induces hnRNP A1, which is necessary for stress-induced ATF4 protein expression.

The kagome ferrimagnet TbMn 6 Sn 6 has been reported to host a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Here, we demonstrate that doping the Mn sites with Cr drives the system toward magnetic compensation. For nearly compensated compositions at low temperatures, giant coercive fields exceeding 14 T are observed.
