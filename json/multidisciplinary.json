          "authors": "Jacob N. Shapiro",
          "abstract": "Large-scale, centrally funded measurement systems on the economy, education, the environment, and public health enable rapid scientific research and support robust policy feedback. They provide frameworks for assessing policy effectiveness, flagging emerging problems, and informing planning processes. The online information environment—a critical domain of human interaction—has not yet been similarly instrumented. This article first reviews key measurements in other domains and outlines why existing tools for studying online environments are insufficient. It then lays out the consequences of the measurement gap, identifies key data-collection tasks, discusses the scale of resources required to meet them, and addresses the implications of generative AI for the instrumentation task. I argue that modest but strategic investments in scaled measurement infrastructure could unlock transformative research capabilities and facilitate an evidence-driven approach to policymaking that could improve how we govern online spaces.",

          "authors": "Baron L. Pineda",
          "abstract": "Technological advancements in internet communications have led to changes in how young people’s behavior is monitored and shaped in their families and schools. The debate about the impacts of the rise of internet use and the creation of a new generation of digital natives is polarized: Some believe that internet restrictions on youth are undemocratic and counterproductive, and others connect internet use to social problems among youth—such as shortened attention spans, apathy, and increased vulnerability to predatory behavior. This article analyzes life history interviews of young people that focus on their use of technology and how it is regulated by their parents. I show how the social norms associated with the digital lives of youth can vary and evolve, often in unpredictable ways. This suggests that governance efforts likely need to be dynamic and capable of changing in ways that keep pace with new forms of sociality.",

          "title": "The Myths of Platform Governance: How Tech Works to Create Online Trust and Safety",
          "authors": "Sudhir Venkatesh",
          "abstract": "Platform governance is often conceptualized in terms of external rules or algorithmic systems. This article shifts the analytic focus inward, examining how governance teams within technology firms create social order through their everyday practices. Drawing on organizational sociology and cultural analysis, I argue that internal governance is shaped less by formal policy than by the underlying “myths” that structure how practitioners understand harm, responsibility, and effectiveness. These organizational myths—rooted in engineering culture and reinforced by institutional routines—shape not only how governance work is carried out, but also what counts as legitimate intervention. By analyzing the symbolic and practical dimensions of governance labor, I show how cultural logics embedded within platform teams produce specific orientations to risk, fairness, and authority. Understanding these logics is essential for researchers and practitioners seeking to explain—and ultimately influence—the ways in which social order is maintained online.",

          "authors": "Toby Shulruff",
          "abstract": "Policymakers struggle to craft effective strategies for governing online platforms. Their efforts are often referred to as attempts to regulate “black-boxed” tech in a sector that has long been described as the “Wild West.” But historical perspectives from practitioners in the trust and safety field offer a more nuanced understanding. Data from the History of Trust and Safety Project reveal that governance precedents and cross-sectoral initiatives date back at least two decades and address issues including fraud, spam, child sexual abuse material, and extremist content. This collaborative work occurred in and among government agencies, media, civil society organizations, academia, and the platforms themselves. The Wild West and black-box metaphors are not helpful points of departure for regulatory debates with decades-old precedents. Governance should be informed by what has been tried before and by a clearer understanding of the technical and social forces that have shaped the present state of play.",

          "abstract": "Platform governance that is driven by external policymakers and researchers is often disconnected from how and when technology companies actually make decisions about their products. This misalignment creates challenges for meaningful oversight and regulation, as external actors cannot see the internal processes that shape platform design and governance. This article explores the internal dynamics of product development, from prototyping through iteration, and how governance considerations are incorporated or excluded at various stages. Arguing for a reintegration of social science and academic expertise into product decision-making, I propose an updated framework that bridges external governance objectives with the realities of platform power and product design.",

          "abstract": "Social media data have become a mainstay of social science research since the first application programming interfaces (APIs) debuted in the mid-2000s. Over time, platforms have radically altered their data offerings, substantially determining the kinds of research that can be conducted. This article presents historical and normative analyses of the current state of platform data precarity, defined by Freelon (2018) as the post-API age . We recount a periodized history of social media data access spanning nearly 20 years, characterize the data access options currently offered by six prominent platforms, and make recommendations for improving platform data access. Our primary aim is to help social media researchers understand how access to social media data has evolved over the years and consider how platforms might help them conduct more rigorous research moving forward.",

          "abstract": "Prominent online platforms have recently engaged in highly visible pullbacks in their commitments to promoting purpose-driven organizational cultures and to developing diverse workforces. These changes have been framed as a move back to a profit-centered business model, but they have also been perceived as government regulation in decline. We argue that there is strong evidence that associates purpose-driven organizational cultures and diverse workforces with organizational vitality, profitability, and growth. The association holds for organizations generally but is particularly true for online platforms, whose success is linked to innovation and change. Thus, there is a strong bottom-line business argument for creating and sustaining purpose-driven organizational cultures and for developing diverse workforces, irrespective of whether they are mandated by external authorities.",

          "abstract": "Middleware is software that can give users increased control over their social media experience, allowing them to protect their privacy, customize their recommendations, and understand the spread and impact of content they create. We believe middleware could complement policy efforts and reforms made by social media platforms to improve user experiences on social media, while avoiding freedom of expression questions that plague the regulation of online platforms. We describe and examine middleware as it exists in the world, demonstrating that even while middleware is a viable solution to some contemporary problems attendant to social media, there are still open questions about who middleware helps and who it harms. We suggest Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulation of middleware and show that U.S. Code 47 section 230(b) anticipated categories of middleware that would be protective of users’ control over their online experiences.",

          "abstract": "Concerned about the power that social media now wield, a chorus of tech-minded reformers have called for a return to the internet’s foundational design principles of interoperability and end-user control. This group argues for “middleware”—online tools like browser extensions and consumer-facing protocols that would enable people to take control of their online experiences across the web. This article argues that the campaign for middleware is laudable but mostly speculative and inapposite. It proceeds on the disproven theory that consumers can control their online experiences in today’s networked information economy. As such, it distracts reformers from solutions that would redress the structural asymmetries that define today’s market for consumer-facing services, including social media. This article argues that it is time to give up the illusory promise of user control and attend above all to enacting enforceable restrictions on service designs and commercial surveillance practices.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the concept of user engagement has dominated debate over the governance of online platforms, and critics use the term to assign crass commercial interests to social media companies. We argue that social media engagement is a multifaceted ideal that serves both economic and ideological functions for platforms. We show how Facebook’s early leadership used the concept to reconcile the competing demands of expansion, revenue generation, and community-building. In doing so, they synthesized three distinct ideas: the Silicon Valley belief that network expansion correlated with network strength , the ad industry’s contention that media should promote emotional investment from viewers, and the academic claim that civic participation is the most important democratic virtue. Even as the contradictions that these claims yield have come to the foreground, the multiple logics of engagement have proven difficult to evade, and it continues to shape discussions of platform governance.",

          "abstract": "I examine the relationship between social media platforms and news organizations as it has evolved over the past two decades, showing that platform governance has affected individual users and news publishers in ways that often result in damage to democratic societies. I argue that the contraction of traditional journalism and rise of democratic backsliding around the globe call for a reconsideration of platform governance models that might help to reinvigorate news production. A better synthesis of traditional journalism’s public interest values and social media’s engagement model requires a restructuring of platform algorithms that focuses on long-term user value, enhanced press freedom protections, and renewed economic support for news production. Supporting news represents a global imperative as democratic stability becomes increasingly threatened, social media companies come under increasing strain and scrutiny as public actors, and generative AI further imperils news production.",

          "abstract": "Spared regions of the damaged central nervous system undergo dynamic remodelling and exhibit a remarkable potential for therapeutic exploitation1. Lesion-remote astrocytes (LRAs), which interact with viable neurons and glia, undergo reactive transformations whose molecular and functional properties are poorly understood2. Here, using multiple transcriptional profiling methods, we investigated LRAs from spared regions of mouse spinal cord following traumatic spinal cord injury. We show that LRAs acquire a spectrum of molecularly distinct, neuroanatomically restricted reactivity states that evolve after spinal cord injury. We identify transcriptionally unique reactive LRAs in degenerating white matter that direct the specification and function of local microglia that clear lipid-rich myelin debris to promote tissue repair. Fuelling this LRA functional adaptation is the secreted matricellular protein CCN1. Loss of astrocyte-derived CCN1 results in excessive, aberrant activation of local microglia, characterized by abnormal molecular specification, impaired debris processing reflected by the intracellular accumulation of myelin and axon debris, and dysregulated lipid metabolism with distinctive attenuation in lipid droplet accumulation. Mechanistically, we find that CCN1 binds microglial SDC4 to augment lipid storage, linking this signalling axis to a vital repair-associated lipid buffering response in debris-clearing microglia. Accordingly, microglial deficits resulting from astrocyte CCN1 depletion culminate in blunted clearance of white matter debris and impaired neurological recovery from spinal cord injury. Ccn1-expressing white matter astrocytes are induced by local myelin damage and are generated in diverse demyelinating disorders in mice and humans, pointing to their fundamental, evolutionarily conserved role in white matter repair. Our findings show that context-specific cues shape regionally distinct LRA reactivity states with functional adaptations that orchestrate multicellular processes underlying neural repair and influence disease outcome.",

Here we describe efforts by the 4D Nucleome Project 1 to map and analyse the 4D nucleome in widely used H1 human embryonic stem cells and immortalized fibroblasts (HFFc6). We produced and integrated diverse genomic datasets of the 4D nucleome, each contributing unique observations, which enabled us to assemble extensive catalogues of more than 140,000 looping interactions per cell type, to generate detailed classifications and annotations of chromosomal domain types and their subnuclear positions, and to obtain single-cell 3D models of the nuclear environment of all genes including their long-range interactions with distal elements. Through extensive benchmarking, we describe the unique strengths of different genomic assays for studying the 4D nucleome, providing guidelines for future studies. Three-dimensional models of population-based and individual cell-to-cell variation in genome structure showed connections between chromosome folding, nuclear organization, chromatin looping, gene transcription and DNA replication. Finally, we demonstrate the use of computational methods to predict genome folding from DNA sequence, which will facilitate the discovery of potential effects of genetic variants, including variants associated with disease, on genome structure and function.",

          "abstract": "Ising machines offer a compelling approach to addressing NP-hard problems1, but physical realizations that are simultaneously scalable, reconfigurable, fast and stable remain elusive. Quantum annealers, such as D-Wave’s cryogenic hardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of qubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs2. Here we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin representation. Inspired by Hopfield networks3, our architecture solves fully connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings) and >41,000 spins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system makes use of cascaded thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and a digital signal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating potential >200 giga operations per second (GOPS) for spin coupling and nonlinearity. This platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic Ising machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate best-in-class solution quality for max-cut problems of arbitrary graph topologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain ground-state solutions for number partitioning4 and lattice protein folding5—benchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system uses inherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate convergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP—traditionally used in optical communications—within optical computation enhances convergence and solution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for optimization, neuromorphic processing and analogue artificial intelligence.",

In this randomised phase 3 study, 731 participants with T2D were randomised 1:1:1 to receive mazdutide 4 mg, mazdutide 6 mg or dulaglutide 1.5 mg for 28 weeks. Both mazdutide doses demonstrated non-inferiority and superiority to dulaglutide 1.5 mg in mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 28, with the least squares (LS) mean treatment difference of −0.24% (p=0.0032) for mazdutide 4 mg and −0.30% (p=0.0003) for mazdutide 6 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Significantly greater weight reductions were achieved with mazdutide versus dulaglutide, with LS mean treatment difference of −3.78% for mazdutide 4 mg and −5.76% for mazdutide 6 mg vs dulaglutide (both p<0.0001). Moreover, significantly more participants with mazdutide achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c <7.0% with ≥5% weight reduction vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg at week 28 (both p<0.0001). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. Our findings showed that 28-week treatment with mazdutide (4 mg and 6 mg) provided superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg in Chinese participants with T2D. Mazdutide was generally safe, with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events than dulaglutide.",

          "abstract": "The development of complex multicellular human in vitro systems holds great promise for modelling disease and advancing drug discovery and tissue engineering 1 . In the liver, despite the identification of key signalling pathways involved in hepatic regeneration 2,3 , in vitro expansion of human hepatocytes directly from fresh patient tissue has not yet been achieved, limiting the possibility of modelling liver composite structures in vitro. Here we first developed human hepatocyte organoids (h-HepOrgs) from 28 different patients. Patient-derived hepatocyte organoids sustained long-term expansion of hepatocytes in vitro and maintained patient-specific gene expression and bile canaliculus features and function of the in vivo tissue. After transplantation, expanded h-HepOrgs rescued the phenotype of a mouse model of liver disease. By combining h-HepOrgs with portal mesenchyme and our previously published cholangiocyte organoids 4–6 , we generated patient-specific periportal liver assembloids that retain the histological arrangement, gene expression and cell interactions of periportal liver tissue, with cholangiocytes and mesenchyme embedded in the hepatocyte parenchyma. We leveraged this platform to model aspects of biliary fibrosis. Our human periportal liver assembloid system represents a novel in vitro platform to investigate human liver pathophysiology, accelerate drug development, enable early diagnosis and advance personalized medicine.",

          "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and facilitate the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by exchanging GDP for GTP1. This exchange function is not unidirectional2. Here we demonstrate that an agonist can show selective affinity for an active state that prefers the release of GTP. Specifically, for the mu opioid receptor, we show that several agonists have state-selective affinities for promoting GTP release versus GTP binding. We identify two agonists that show a marked preference for promoting release. In mice, marginally efficacious doses of the release-preferring agonist enhance and prolong the antinociceptive effects of morphine and fentanyl without enhancing the respiratory and cardiac effects of fentanyl. Although these observations are limited to simple measures of thermal nociception, they may point to a way to bifurcate physiological responses to such agonists. We propose that the active-state selectivity of an agonist may determine the preferred direction of the receptor GEF function, which may affect the kinetics and selectivity of the engagement of the receptor with downstream effectors; this may ultimately present a means to disentangle multifaceted drug-induced physiological responses.",

Precision experiments with heavy atoms and molecules can provide stringent constraints on CP violation via searches for effects due to permanent electric dipole moments and other CP-odd properties in leptons, hadrons and nuclei3. Radioactive molecules have been proposed as highly sensitive probes for such searches4, but experiments with most such molecules have so far been beyond technical reach. Here we report the production and spectroscopic study of a gas-phase actinium molecule, 227AcF. We observe the predicted strongest electronic transition from the ground state, which is necessary for efficient readout in searches of symmetry-violating interactions. Furthermore, we perform electronic- and nuclear-structure calculations for 227AcF to determine its sensitivity to various CP-violating parameters, and find that a realistic, near-term experiment with a precision of 1 mHz would improve current constraints on the CP-violating parameter hyperspace by 3 orders of magnitude. Our results thus highlight the potential of 227AcF for exceptionally sensitive searches of CP violation.",

Here we assess palaeometabolomes from fossilized mammalian hard tissues as a molecular ecological strategy to provide evidence of an ancient organism’s relationship with its environment. From eastern, central and southern African Plio-Pleistocene localities of palaeoanthropological significance, we study six fossils from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, one from the Chiwondo Beds, Malawi, and one from Makapansgat, South Africa. We perform endogeneity assessments by analysing palaeometabolomes of palaeosols and the effects of owl digestion on rodent bones to enable prudent ecological inferences. Diagenesis is indicated by metabolites of collagenase-producing bacteria2, whereas the preservation of peptides including those of collagen are identified by proteomics. Endogenous metabolites document biological functions and exogenous metabolites render environmental details including soil characteristics and woody cover, and enable annual minimum and maximum rainfall and temperature reconstructions at Olduvai Gorge, supporting the freshwater woodland and grasslands of Olduvai Gorge Bed I3,4,5, and the dry woodlands and marsh of Olduvai Gorge Upper Bed II6. All sites denote wetter and/or warmer conditions than today. We infer that metabolites preserved in hard tissues derive from an extravasated vasculature serum filtrate that becomes entombed within developing mineralized matrices, and most probably survive palaeontological timeframes in the nanoscopic ‘pool’ of structural-bound water that occurs in hard tissue niches7.",

          "abstract": "Ageing erodes human immunity, in part by reshaping the T cell repertoire, leading to increased vulnerability to infection, malignancy and vaccine failure 1–3 . Attempts to rejuvenate immune function have yielded only modest results and are limited by toxicity or lack of clinical feasibility 1,3–5 . Here we show that the liver can be transiently repurposed to restore age-diminished immune cues and improve T cell function in aged mice. These immune cues were found by performing multi-omic mapping across central and peripheral niches in young and aged animals, leading to the identification of Notch and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) pathways, together with interleukin-7 (IL-7) signalling, as declining with age. Delivery of mRNAs encoding Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1), FLT3L and IL-7 to hepatocytes expanded common lymphoid progenitors, boosted de novo thymopoiesis without affecting haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) composition, and replenished T cells while enhancing dendritic cell abundance and function. Treatment with these mRNAs improved peptide vaccine responses and restored antitumour immunity in aged mice by increasing tumour-specific CD8 + infiltration and clonal diversity and synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade. These effects were reversible after dosing ceased and did not breach self-tolerance, in contrast to the inflammatory and autoimmune liabilities of recombinant cytokine treatments 6,7 . These findings underscore the promise of mRNA-based strategies for systemic immune modulation and highlight the potential of interventions aimed at preserving immune resilience in ageing populations.",

          "abstract": "The human gut microbiome is composed of a highly diverse consortia of species that are continually evolving within and across hosts 1,2 . The ability to identify adaptations common to many human gut microbiomes would show not only shared selection pressures across hosts but also key drivers of functional differentiation of the microbiome that may affect community structure and host traits. However, the extent to which adaptations have spread across human gut microbiomes is relatively unknown. Here we develop a new selection scan statistic named the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS) that can detect sweeps of adaptive alleles spreading across host microbiomes by migration and horizontal gene transfer. Specifically, iLDS leverages signals of hitchhiking of deleterious variants with a beneficial variant. Application of the statistic to around 30 of the most prevalent commensal gut species from 24 human populations around the world showed more than 300 selective sweeps across species. We find an enrichment for selective sweeps at loci involved in carbohydrate metabolism, indicative of adaptation to host diet, and we find that the targets of selection differ significantly between industrialized populations and non-industrialized populations. One of these sweeps is at a locus known to be involved in the metabolism of maltodextrin—a synthetic starch that has recently become a widespread component of industrialized diets. In summary, our results indicate that recombination between strains fuels pervasive adaptive evolution among human gut commensal bacteria, and strongly implicate host diet and lifestyle as critical selection pressures.",

          "abstract": "Hydrogen (H2) will play a part in decarbonizing the global energy system1. However, hydrogen interacts with methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapour, leading to an indirect 100-year global warming potential of 11 ± 4 (refs. 2,3,4,5). This raises concerns about the climate consequences of increasing H2 use under future hydrogen economies3,5. A comprehensive accounting of H2 sources and sinks is essential for assessing changes and mitigating environmental risks. Here we analyse trends in global H2 sources and sinks from 1990 to 2020 and construct a comprehensive budget for the decade 2010–2020. H2 sources increased from 1990 to 2020, primarily because of the oxidation of methane and anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds, biogenic nitrogen fixation, and leakage from H2 production. Sinks also increased in response to rising atmospheric H2. Estimated global H2 sources and sinks averaged 69.9 ± 9.4 Tg yr−1 and 68.4 ± 18.1 Tg yr−1, respectively, for 2010–2020. Regionally, Africa and South America contained the largest sources and sinks of H2, whereas East Asia and North America contributed the most H2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. We estimate that rising atmospheric H2 between 2010 and 2020 contributed to an increase in global surface air temperature (GSAT) of 0.02 ± 0.006 °C. GSAT impacts of changing atmospheric H2 in future marker Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios are estimated to remain within 0.01–0.05 °C, depending on H2 usage, leakage rates and CH4 emissions that influence photochemical H2 production.",

          "abstract": "The growing demand for advanced materials, miniaturized devices and integrated microsystems calls for the reliable fabrication of complex, multiscale, three-dimensional (3D) architectures, a need increasingly addressed through light-based and laser-based processes. However, owing to the field-of-view (FOV) limitations of conventional imaging optics, existing 3D laser nanofabrication techniques face fundamental challenges in throughput, proximity error and stitching defects on the path to scaling. Here we present a scalable 3D nanofabrication platform that uses a metalens-generated focal spot array to parallelize two-photon lithography (TPL)1 beyond centimetre-scale write field areas. Metalenses are ideally suited for producing submicron-scale focal spots for high-throughput nanolithography, as they uniquely feature large numerical apertures (NAs), immersion media compatibility and large-scale manufacturability. We experimentally demonstrate a printing system that uses a 12-cm2 metalens array to produce more than 120,000 cooperative focal spots, corresponding to a throughput exceeding 108 voxels s−1. By programmatically patterning the focal spot array using a spatial light modulator (SLM), an adaptive parallel printing strategy is developed for precise greyscale linewidth modulation and choreographed printing of semiperiodic and fully aperiodic 3D geometries. We demonstrate parallel printing of replicated microstructures (>50 M microparticles per day), centimetre-scale 3D architectures with feature sizes down to 113 nm, and photonic and mechanical metamaterials. This work demonstrates the potential of 3D nanolithography towards wafer-scale production, showing how TPL could be used at scale for applications in microelectronics2, biomedicine3, quantum technology4 and high-energy laser targets5,6.",

Even for the long-studied edge modes of quantum Hall phases1,2, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional electron systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive. Despite advances made using local probes3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13, key experimental challenges persist: the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile for co-propagating modes and induce unexpected edge valley polarization, which differs from the bulk. Although some of our findings can be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture, highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes scanning tunnelling microscopy as a promising tool for exploring the edge physics of the rapidly expanding group of two-dimensional topological phases, including recently realized fractional Chern insulators.",

Here we assessed the efficacy and safety of the dual glucagon receptor (GCGR)/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist mazdutide monotherapy versus placebo in Chinese adults with T2D inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone. In this phase 3 trial, 320 participants (mean HbA1c of 8.24%, BMI of 28.2 kg/m2, and diabetes duration of 1.9 years) were randomised 1:1:1 to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of mazdutide 4 mg, 6 mg, or placebo for 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week extended mazdutide treatment. At week 24, mazdutide significantly reduced HbA1c versus placebo (primary endpoint): -1.57% with mazdutide 4 mg and -2.15% with mazdutide 6 mg, versus -0.14% with placebo, with treatment differences of -1.43% and -2.02% (both p <0.0001). Significant weight loss at week 24 occurred with -5.61% (4 mg) and -7.81% (6 mg) versus -1.26% (placebo) (both p<0.0001). Additionally, significantly more participants with mazdutide achieved clinically relevant HbA1c target (<7.0%), weight loss goal (≥5%), and composite endpoints (HbA1c <7.0% and weight loss ≥5%) versus placebo (all p <0.0001). The most common adverse events—diarrhoea, decreased appetite, and nausea—were consistent with GLP-1R agonists. These results establish mazdutide monotherapy as an effective intervention providing clinically meaningful glycaemic control and weight reduction alongside a favourable safety profile in this population.",

          "abstract": "Phosphorus atoms in silicon represent a promising platform for quantum computing, as their nuclear spins exhibit coherence times over seconds 1,2 with high-fidelity readout and single-qubit control 3 . By placing several phosphorus atoms within a radius of a few nanometres, they couple by means of the hyperfine interaction to a single, shared electron. Such a nuclear spin register enables high-fidelity multi-qubit control 4 and the execution of small-scale quantum algorithms 5 . An important requirement for scaling up is the ability to extend high-fidelity entanglement non-locally across several spin registers. Here we address this challenge with an 11-qubit atom processor composed of two multi-nuclear spin registers that are linked by means of electron exchange interaction. Through the advancement of calibration and control protocols, we achieve single-qubit and multi-qubit gates with all fidelities ranging from 99.10% to 99.99%. By entangling all combinations of local and non-local nuclear-spin pairs, we map out the performance of the processor and achieve state-of-the-art Bell-state fidelities of up to 99.5%. We then generate Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states with an increasing number of qubits and show entanglement of up to eight nuclear spins. By establishing high-fidelity operation across interconnected nuclear spin registers, we realize a key milestone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom processors.",

          "abstract": "The Cassini mission provided unprecedented insights into Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, from its atmosphere to the deep interior1. The moon’s large measured response to the tides exerted by Saturn was interpreted as evidence of the existence of a subsurface ocean2,3. This response, twice the value predicted in pre-Cassini studies, has escaped complete explanation. Here we show that the signature of tidal dissipation in Titan’s gravity field is not consistent with the presence of an ocean. Our results arise from the detection of this signature through a reanalysis of the radiometric data acquired by Cassini with improved techniques. We found that substantial energy is being dissipated in the interior (approximately 3–4 TW, corresponding to a tidal quality factor Q ≈ 5), consistent with recent studies of Titan’s rotational state4. Because the presence of a liquid layer reduces the tidal dissipation generated below it5, these new measurements preclude the existence of a subsurface ocean on Titan and are explained by a model in which dissipation is concentrated in a high-pressure ice layer close to its melting point. This model also reproduces Titan’s observed rotational state and static gravity field self-consistently, reconciling all available geophysical measurements. Efficient ice shell convection can prevent widespread melting and ocean formation, but a slushy high-pressure ice layer is consistent with expectations6, indicating that it probably hosts liquid water pockets. The forthcoming Dragonfly mission to Titan will provide a further test of whether a subsurface ocean exists.",

          "abstract": "Neural circuits in many brain regions are refined by experience. Sensory circuits support higher plasticity at younger ages during critical periods—times of circuit refinement and maturation—and limit plasticity in adulthood for circuit stability1,2. How astrocytes, a glial subtype, maintain these differing plasticity levels, and whether they stabilize the properties of sensory circuits in adulthood, remain largely unclear. Here we take a comprehensive approach to address these questions and establish astrocytes as key orchestrators of circuit stability. Combining a transcriptomic approach with ex vivo electrophysiology and in vivo imaging, we identify that astrocytes release CCN1 (refs. 3,4) to maintain synapse and circuit stability in the adult visual cortex. Overexpressing CCN1 in astrocytes during the critical period promotes the maturation of inhibitory neurons, limits ocular dominance plasticity and promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. Conversely, knocking out astrocyte CCN1 in adults destabilizes binocular circuits and reduces myelination. This establishes CCN1 as an astrocyte-secreted factor that stabilizes neuronal circuits by coordinating the maturation state of multiple cell types, and demonstrates that the composition and properties of sensory circuits require ongoing maintenance in adulthood, and that these maintenance cues are provided by astrocytes.",

Its development involves complex processes of sex specification, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, the disruption of which can cause lifelong issues, including infertility 1–5 . Here we present an extensive single-cell and spatial multi-omic atlas of the human reproductive tract during prenatal development to provide insights beyond those that are possible with smaller-scale, organ-focused studies. We describe potential regulators of sexual dimorphism in reproductive organs and pinpoint previously unknown genes involved in Müllerian duct emergence and regression and urethral canalization of the penis. By combining histological features with gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, we define transcription factors and signalling events potentially involved in the regionalization of the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts. We also refine how the HOX code is established in distinct reproductive organs and reveal that the expression of thoracic HOX genes is increased in the rostral mesenchyme of the fallopian tube and epididymis. Our findings further indicate that epithelial regionalization of the fallopian tube and epididymis, which probably contribute to sperm maturation and capacitation, is established during development. By contrast, later events are necessary for regionalization of the uterocervical canal epithelium. Finally, on the basis of single-cell data and fetal-derived organoids, we show that the fetal uterine epithelium is vulnerable to oestrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors. By mapping sex-specific reproductive tract regionalization and differentiation at the cellular level, our study provides valuable insights into causes and potential treatments of developmental reproductive disorders.",

          "title": "Annual flu vaccines are far from ideal — this is why",
          "authors": "Troy Sutton",
          "abstract": "Before routine vaccines were developed in the 1900s, many children did not survive to adulthood and many adults did not reach old age. People succumbed in large numbers to diseases such as whooping cough and measles. Through the implementation of routine vaccination, many more children now reach adulthood and can contribute to society. Although some childhood diseases are for the most part relegated to history, the viruses responsible still sporadically cause outbreaks in unvaccinated populations.\n\nThis year in Texas, for example, a measles outbreak resulted in 762 infections, 99 hospitalizations and 2 deaths between January and August. Of those infected individuals, 718 were unvaccinated — including the 2 people who died. Moreover, outbreaks of other diseases for which vaccines exist still occur every year. For example, there were 40 million cases of flu and 28,000 deaths in the United States during the 2023–2024 flu season.\n\nNature Spotlight: Influenza\n\nTo strengthen the health of people in the United States, vaccination is essential. In particular, investment in the development and implementation of innovative vaccine technologies is urgently needed.\n\nThis is perhaps best illustrated by flu vaccines, which are still produced using technology developed in the 1960s. These vaccines have significant limitations. Their efficacy, which is calculated as the reduction in the number of people seeking medical attention owing to flu infection, ranges from 20–60% year to year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One major reason for this unimpressive showing is that influenza viruses continually mutate to evade existing vaccine- or infection-induced immunity. To remain efficacious, therefore, vaccines need to be updated every one or two years. Predicting which strains will circulate during the next flu season is complicated, and sometimes strains are selected that are not a good match for the strains that people will be exposed to.\n\nThe second important limitation is that most influenza vaccines are formulated to be delivered as an injection in the arm. Administering a vaccine in that way induces an immune response that protects internal parts of the body, such as the lungs, but not one at mucosal surfaces such as the nose and throat. As a result, in-arm influenza vaccines reduce how sick people get and protect against death, but do not reliably prevent infection and have a limited ability to prevent transmission1.\n\nTo prevent infection and viral transmission, immunity must be induced in the nose and throat. To induce immunity here, a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (called FluMist) that is administered in the nose has been developed and licensed. Owing to the high degree of attenuation required to ensure safety, however, this vaccine has limited efficacy compared with in-arm vaccinations.\n\nNew vaccines that target the nose and throat are therefore needed. However, the immune system here is understudied; researchers do not fully understand how to induce protective immunity in this part of the body. The nose has two key attributes that render it difficult to use as a point of vaccine delivery. It’s designed to quickly remove foreign materials trapped in the mucus layer. And it is naturally tolerant of foreign material — the immune system marshals a response only when it recognizes signals, carried by foreign materials such as viruses, as dangerous.\n\nAction needed\n\nThese obstacles are surmountable. Developing a more efficacious influenza vaccine in the United States will require four action points.",

Using perovskites to build ‘tandem’ solar cells, in which different photoactive materials are layered on top of each other, is a particularly promising approach. However, unwanted heat generated by crystal defects in the perovskite bulk and at the interfaces through which electric charge is extracted limits the power-conversion efficiency of these devices. Writing in Nature, Lin et al.1 report tandem perovskite solar cells that use dipolar molecules called surfactants on one of the perovskite surfaces to reduce interfacial energy loss. The resulting solar cells convert more than 30% of incident solar energy into electrical energy, surpassing the theoretical limit for silicon solar cells.",

          "authors": "Sarah DeWeerdt",
          "abstract": "Dairy cattle throughout the United States have been infected with the H5N1 virus.Credit: MediaMedium/Alamy\n\nIn the southwestern United States in the early weeks of 2024, a large-animal veterinarian pulled up to a dairy farm on his usual rounds and was greeted by an odd absence. The barn cats who normally came trotting out to meet his truck were nowhere in sight.\n\nOver the next few weeks, at dairies across Texas and New Mexico, cows started to get sick. They were losing their appetites and producing less milk than usual — and what little they did produce was thick and gluey. Deaths of birds such as crows and pigeons were also being reported. And then there were the barn cats. They were disappearing or dying suddenly, after becoming blind or unable to walk (see ‘Is a lack of curiosity killing the cats?’).\n\nIs a lack of curiosity killing the cats?\n\nThe plight of domestic cats proved crucial to identifying the outbreak of H5N1 influenza in US dairy cattle in 2024. Companion animal species are an important part of the One Health approach, which recognizes the interdependency of human, animal and ecosystem health. But there has been little organized surveillance of H5N1 in companion animals anywhere in the world.\n\nWhen H5N1 is concerned, feline friends should be top priority. So far, about 100 domestic cats are known to have died from H5N1 in the United States. Most have been barn cats, those that live mainly outside on agricultural properties, or feral cats. They could have been exposed to the virus in multiple ways — through drinking infected milk, contact with wild birds or contaminated clothing, or potentially transmission from infected humans.\n\nGovernment agencies often lack the authority to track emerging infectious diseases in domestic animals. The US Department of Agriculture is responsible for the surveillance of livestock and poultry to ensure the safety of the food supply, whereas the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for food products, including milk and pet food. Some states have incorporated H5N1 testing into their rabies protocols for cats with neurological disease, but few cats are ever tested for rabies.\n\nVeterinarians should be made more aware of the possibility of H5N1 infection in pets in areas where the virus is circulating in birds, researchers say. They also suggest that contact tracing for the virus should include questions about companion animals, and the development of rapid tests for such species.\n\nThe bird and cat deaths were consistent with influenza — specifically, a type of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) known as H5N1 that had been circulating among wild birds and causing outbreaks on poultry farms across the country since early 2022. But H5N1 had never been known to infect cattle.\n\nNature Spotlight: Influenza\n\nAs the weeks went on, dairy veterinarians across the region compared notes, messaging back and forth and organizing conference calls. Affected cows were tested for dozens of likely diseases, but to no avail.\n\nIn late March 2024, milk samples from sick cows and tissue samples from barn cats that had died at a dairy in northern Texas were tested for avian influenza at the National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. The test was more to rule out the virus than anything else. “Nothing else was coming up positive,” says Meghan Davis, a veterinary epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. But both species were positive for H5N1.\n\nThe results unmasked an outbreak of H5N1 in US dairy cattle that, by September 2025, had affected more than 1,000 herds across 18 states. That birds and cats played a part in the outbreak’s detection highlights the common vulnerabilities and intertwined fates of livestock, companion animals and wildlife species. In fact, the US dairy outbreak is only one element of a global H5N1 outbreak that has caused mass deaths among dozens of wildlife species and killed tens of millions of domestic poultry in the past several years.\n\nHuman deaths from H5N1 have been much rarer — the virus killed 12 people, globally, between January and August 2025. But there are fears that further evolution of the virus could spark a human pandemic. Arresting that possibility requires a public-health approach that recognizes the interdependency of human, animal and ecosystem health, known as the One Health perspective. But surveillance often fails to cover a broad enough variety of species in sufficient detail to keep tabs on the virus, researchers say.\n\nFlu on the wing\n\nFor at least the past 20 years, scientists have known that influenza surveillance in birds is key to monitoring pandemic risk. Wild birds harbour just about every one of the almost 150 possible subtypes of influenza A, the form of the virus that causes human pandemics.\n\nLarge numbers of terns were found dead on beaches in South America.Credit: Marcela Uhart, University of California, Davis\n\nInfluenza has a segmented genome, making it easy for new strains to emerge when birds congregate in large numbers. “Everybody has their different viruses with all their pieces that can swap around like Lego bricks,” says Wendy Puryear, a virologist at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine in North Grafton, Massachusetts. This is especially true for breeding grounds at high latitudes, where birds’ migratory ‘flyways’ converge.\n\nInfluenza can spill over from wild birds to domestic flocks. The bigger the global poultry industry gets, the more often this happens — and the more likely it is that the virus will evolve into HPAI, which refers specifically to the impact on domestic poultry. (Whether HPAI viruses cause severe illness in other species, including humans, is unclear.) More than 50 HPAI strains have emerged since the first such virus was isolated in Scotland in 1959. Most have been stamped out quickly by mass culling of infected poultry flocks.\n\nThe H5N1 lineage that led to the current global outbreak is an exception. It emerged among domestic geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. The following year, six people died from the virus after visiting live poultry markets in Hong Kong — the first avian influenza fatalities reported in humans. For about a decade, the virus was mostly confined to eastern China, where it was passed back and forth between wild and domestic waterfowl that mingled in the same ponds. Then, in 2005, it killed around 1,500 wild birds near Qinghai Lake in western China. Over the next few months, migratory flyways brought it to Russia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India.\n\nThese events triggered a focus on influenza surveillance in wild birds globally, says Thijs Kuiken, a veterinary pathologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. “People realized that now, wild animals were carrying the virus to new places, so they need to be studied.” Initially, the goal was to protect the poultry industry and to prevent occasional human infections, Kuiken says. But in the early 2020s, the rapid global spread of a new form of the virus, known as clade 2.3.4.4b, laid bare the need for a much more comprehensive approach.\n\nThis virus caused mass deaths among European seabirds in 2020. It then jumped to North America in late 2021. By late 2022 it had reached South America; in early 2024, it landed in mainland Antarctica.\n\nH5N1 is “going into a much broader range of wild birds than other forms of influenza have in the past”, Puryear says. Previously, the virus mostly affected waterfowl and seabirds. But now it has been reported in more than 500 species of wild birds across a variety of taxonomic groups, from songbirds to raptors.\n\nIt has also infected at least 80 species of mammals, producing sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission in several instances, including among mink (Neovison vison) at a fur farm in Spain, southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) in South America, and dairy cattle in the United States. “There are multiple alarm bells going off,” says Martha Nelson, a computational biologist at the US National Center for Biotechnology Information in Bethesda, Maryland, who works with influenza genome sequences.\n\nCattle contagion\n\nAlarm bells also rang for Maggie Baldwin, the Colorado Department of Agriculture’s state veterinarian, one day in July 2024. The state’s poultry industry had been hit hard over the previous two years by H5N1, and the dairy outbreak had arrived in Colorado herds in late April. On that July day, she got word that the virus had spilled over from a dairy facility to a poultry operation in the state for the third time.\n\nBarn cats have been affected by the H5N1 outbreak.Credit: DS70/Getty\n\nH5N1 is disruptive to dairy operations, but most infected cattle recover after a few weeks. For poultry farmers, however, the virus is ruinous. It is so swiftly lethal to domestic flocks that all birds on site must be culled when the virus is detected. In Colorado, dairy-to-poultry spillovers resulted in the culling of 3.2 million birds in July 2024.\n\n“I said, ‘We need to make a change — we really need to have a better handle on where the virus is,’” Baldwin recalls. She implemented a strategy that several states had been discussing: weekly testing of samples from bulk milk tanks.\n\nThe approach builds on existing procedures to test milk for antibiotics and bacterial contamination. It enables detection of infected herds before cows start to show symptoms, giving farmers more time to implement quarantine and other measures to make sure that the virus does not spread from the farm.\n\nAbout a dozen infected herds were discovered in the weeks after bulk-tank testing began, but no new infections have emerged since mid-August 2024. As of late July 2025, Colorado’s dairy herds remain free from H5N1. Davis calls bulk-tank testing “one of the best success stories” of H5N1 surveillance. Indeed, the US Department of Agriculture began requiring it nationally in early December 2024 — and by August 2025, through this and other measures, the number of affected states had contracted to six.\n\nBut on-farm surveillance alone cannot eradicate the virus from agricultural operations. In early 2025, two fresh spillovers from wild birds into dairy cattle were identified in Nevada and Arizona. H5N1 also continues to periodically pass from wild birds into poultry in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nWild-bird surveillance has so far provided much of the information about H5N1 risk for agricultural operations. If officials know that a virus-carrying flock of migratory waterfowl is moving through an area, for example, “then you can put out an alert to producers that this is a high-risk period”, says David Swayne, a poultry veterinarian in Watkinsville, Georgia, and former head of HPAI research at the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nBut these efforts leave many questions unanswered about how H5N1 gets onto farms in the first place and to what extent vectors other than birds are responsible. Researchers have suggested that rodents, flies and even gusts of wind could also be spreading viral outbreaks.",

          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "In just the first weeks of Donald Trump’s second presidency, his administration embarked on making radical changes to US science.\n\nOfficials appointed by the new president started firing thousands of researchers and other government employees. At the same time, it cut billions of dollars of US support for global-health programmes, including dismantling the US Agency for International Development (USAID). It arrested some scholars from outside the United States as it stepped up efforts to restrict entry into the country and limit political speech. Over the next few months, the US government took steps to exert unprecedented control over universities by withholding federal research funding. The administration cancelled tens of billions of dollars in research grants to universities to force the adoption of policies on hiring and admissions, policing of campuses, curricula and other factors.\n\nDespite all the negatives, 2025 showcased the power, resilience and universality of science\n\nThe administration has justified its actions by saying that they were necessary to improve science and innovation. “The Trump administration is committed to cutting taxpayer funding of left-wing pet projects that are masquerading as ‘scientific research’ and restoring the American people’s confidence in our scientific and public-health bodies that was lost during the COVID era,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to Nature.\n\nBut critics of the administration see these actions as part of a broader plan to bend science for political purposes. “The attack on science must be seen as one component of a larger attack on information, on facts, on independent analysis,” says John Holdren, a physicist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who worked as the science adviser to former US president Barack Obama. “I think Trump sees science as the fortress of the opposition.”\n\nDuring Trump’s previous term in office, he encountered resistance from people in his own administration as well as from members of his own party in Congress, which rejected his calls to slash funding for science agencies. This time, that kind of opposition has been more limited, even as his administration ignored spending laws enacted by Congress, which holds the power to decide government funding.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nBut some people and institutions have fought the government over such changes. Harvard University sued the Trump administration after it cancelled billions of dollars in grants amid claims that Harvard had failed to combat campus antisemitism. Several lawsuits have been filed challenging both the administration’s firing of employees and its cancellation of grants. Climate scientists pushed back against the administration’s efforts to deny the threat of global warming. And six former surgeons general who served during both Republican and Democrat administrations published an article in The Washington Post criticizing Trump’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. They wrote that he was “endangering the health of the nation” by amplifying misinformation and undermining public confidence in medicine and the very public-health agency that he oversees — the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which includes the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest biomedical funder.\n\n“The consequences aren’t abstract,” the surgeons general wrote. “They are measured in lives lost, disease outbreaks and an erosion of public trust that will take years to rebuild.”\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science",

But until now, models have sometimes struggled to forecast extreme weather events that they’ve never seen before, but that are happening more frequently as the planet warms.\n\nIt’s like trying to “forecast the future with yesterday’s climate”, as Jacob Landsberg, a data scientist at Boston University in Massachusetts, puts it.\n\nOne new approach that’s showing success combines an AI model with a conventional climate model, plus mathematical tools that describe rare events, to forecast weather extremes more effectively. In early tests, this hybrid approach simulated the probabilities of extreme heatwaves as accurately as the older, non-AI method, which takes much longer to run1.\n\n“We think this is the way forward,” says Pedram Hassanzadeh, a climate physicist at the University of Chicago in Illinois who is involved in several of the early studies. Team members posted the results in a series of preprints on arXiv this year, and will discuss the work at upcoming conferences, including the American Geophysical Union meeting this month.\n\nLimited training data\n\nExtreme weather can be particularly dangerous when it goes beyond what people usually experience. Examples include the deep freeze in Texas in 2021 that killed hundreds of people, and the 2010 heatwave in Moscow that killed more than 10,000. But it’s hard to reproduce the statistics of such rare events and accurately predict how they might change in the future, Hassanzadeh says. AI models might be working with only 40 years of training data but need to forecast a weather extreme that happens just once every 1,000 years.\n\nConsider the unprecedented rains that hit Dubai in April 2024, when more than one year’s worth of rain fell in one day. Researchers led by Qiang Sun, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Chicago, and Hassanzadeh analysed the event with two AI models. They were surprised and impressed to find that one of them, the GraphCast model developed by Google DeepMind in London, would have accurately forecast the event eight days before it occurred2.\n\nBut things didn’t work as well when the scientists looked at tropical cyclones. A different AI weather model, FourCastNet, developed by NVIDIA in Santa Clara, California, struggled to forecast the strongest tropical cyclones when it had no extreme storms in its training set3.\n\nThat seemed like bad news, but the researchers did spot a glimmer of hope. The model seemed to be able to learn from storms that occurred in one ocean basin, such as the Atlantic, and apply that learning to other ocean basins, such as the Pacific. It could basically improve its regional forecasts by translating information to different parts of the globe. “The fact that they can do that gives them a lot of power,” Hassanzadeh says.\n\nHybrid approach\n\nIn their latest work, the researchers found a way forwards with yet another AI model, Pangu-Weather, developed by Chinese firm Huawei Cloud, in Shenzhen. The scientists combined it with a physics-based global climate model, plus a mathematical method for analysing the statistics of rare events, to see whether they could predict mid-latitude heatwaves.",

Police say they are investigating his death and treating it as a homicide. Loureiro’s death is the second US university-related tragedy in a week, after two people were killed and nine others were injured in a shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday.\n\nAt the time of his death, Loureiro had been the head of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, a position he held since May last year. The laboratory hosts more than 250 scientists. This year, Loureiro was given the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, which is bestowed on researchers who show exceptional potential for leadership.\n\nLoureiro was a “brilliant scientist”, who was sharp, kind and had a smart sense of humour, says Stanislav Boldyrev, a plasma physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who began working with Loureiro in 2017. “It’s a privilege to have a friend like him,” Boldyrev adds. “He was so interested in science, it was almost contagious.”\n\n“He shone a bright light as a mentor, friend, teacher, colleague and leader, and was universally admired for his articulate, compassionate manner,” said Dennis Whyte, former director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, in a statement.\n\nLoureiro was passionate about the potential for fusion as a clean power source and about teaching a new generation of scientists, say colleagues. He thought “that we are really progressing towards finally having electricity from fusion”, says Bruno Soares Gonçalves, a plasma physicist and president of the Institute of Plasmas and Nuclear Fusion in Lisbon, where Loureiro worked until he moved to MIT in 2016.\n\n“People in the community are so shocked and extremely saddened,” he says.\n\nNuno Loureiro was a theoretical physicist who was helping to develop clean-energy fusion devices.

          "title": "Stopping the next flu pandemic",
          "authors": "Cassandra Willyard",
          "abstract": "In spring, consumers in the United States found themselves having to hunt for something that had previously been exceedingly easy to find: eggs. Some supermarkets limited customers to a single carton per visit, but still ran out. Shoppers who did manage to find eggs in stock paid dearly — a dozen could sell for more than US$11. For many people, it was the first indication that the country was in the midst of a devastating bird-flu outbreak.\n\nThe H5N1 flu virus responsible for this outbreak hit poultry farms especially hard. The egg shortage and skyrocketing prices were the result of the loss of tens of millions of hens — the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) requires the destruction of poultry flocks that test positive for H5N1. Egg prices have now fallen. But US consumers could experience another shock if they buy a turkey for their Thanksgiving meal in late November. This year’s flock is the smallest in decades, partly due to bird flu. Some economists predict that turkey prices will be 40% higher this year than in 2024.\n\nNature Spotlight: Influenza\n\nSome poultry farms contracted H5N1 from waterfowl. But others got the virus from a new source of infection. In March 2024, the United States announced that several herds of dairy cattle had been infected. Since H5N1 jumped to cattle, the virus has infected at least 1,000 cows in 18 states, tens of millions of chickens and turkeys, and 70 people, one of whom died.\n\nH5N1’s move into dairy cattle, which come into close contact with humans, has infectious-disease specialists on alert. “This was not on our potential-pandemic bingo card,” says Thomas Friedrich, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The virus hasn’t developed the capacity to easily transmit between humans, but that doesn’t mean that it never will, he adds. And “we’re not doing enough to take the threat as seriously as I think we should”.\n\nIn April 2024, the federal government began requiring dairy farmers to test cattle for H5N1 before moving them between states. And late last year, it launched a milk-testing programme. But it’s not enough, says Carol Cardona, an avian-influenza researcher at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “We want to see a comprehensive national plan that addresses all susceptible species,” she says. Dairy cows are among the latest species to contract H5N1, but they won’t be the last.\n\nThe current clade of H5N1 circulating the globe has been detected in dozens of animal species, including cats, seals and mice. Specialists worry that the more the virus circulates in mammals, the greater the chance it will acquire the mutations it needs to transmit between humans, sparking a global pandemic. “If we don’t take and maintain steps to actively detect infection of cattle and then, when it’s detected, to stop the spread of virus from farm to farm, then the danger persists,” Friedrich says.\n\nFirst contact\n\nWhen Kay Russo, a veterinarian at RSM Consulting in Fort Collins, Colorado, heard about a mystery illness circulating in dairy cattle in Texas, she worried that it might be avian influenza.\n\nThe United States has introduced a milk-testing programme to monitor the H5N1 virus.Credit: Michael M. Santiago/Getty\n\nRusso started her career as a dairy veterinarian, but after returning to university to specialize in poultry medicine, she has been following the spread of the H5N1 strain from wild birds to a host of different species. Speaking to vets in Texas, she asked how the wild birds on the farms were behaving, and one vet replied that they were all dead. “This is going to sound nuts,” she remembers saying, “but it sounds like it could be flu.”\n\nEvidence suggests that the virus circulating in cows came from a wild bird in December 20231. On many commercial poultry farms, birds stay indoors where they are protected from wildlife. Cows and wild birds, however, mix freely — in the pasture, at the water trough and when they eat.\n\nMany researchers initially thought this ‘spillover’ event was a freak occurrence, says Friedrich. “There was something unique about this particular constellation of genes that we call B3.13 that enabled the virus to jump from birds to cattle.”\n\nSince then, however, a virus with a different genotype, called D1.1, has also jumped from wild birds to cattle on at least two occasions, in two different locations. Scientists still don’t know how or why this is happening, but it does suggest that the interface between dairy cattle and wild birds needs more attention.\n\nCows can’t be raised in enclosures like poultry can, but there are other ways to minimize contact with wild birds. The biggest problem, says Maurice Pitesky, an epidemiologist who studies poultry health at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, is the built environment. “In some cases, farms are located near prime waterfowl habitat,” he says. In others, wild birds have to rely on suboptimal habitats, such as poultry and livestock lagoons (see ‘Close contact’).\n\nSource: Maurice Pitesky\n\nReinventing the construction of dairy farms isn’t feasible, but keeping waterfowl away from them by making habitat less attractive is, Pitesky says. That might mean using nets over ponds to prevent birds from landing, or employing lasers and sound cannons to scare birds away. “You want to reduce the potential for spillover,” he says.\n\nCow conundrum\n\nOnce a spillover occurs, the focus shifts to curbing the spread of the virus — both from animal to animal and from farm to farm.\n\nAmong poultry, H5N1 is deadly. So poultry operations tend to have good biosecurity measures in place. If a bird tests positive for H5N1, all the poultry on that farm are culled.\n\nSnuffing out H5N1 in dairy herds is trickier, partly because the disease is milder. Cows infected with H5N1 might produce less milk or stop eating, but rarely do the animals die. The H5N1 control strategy for cattle has focused on identifying and isolating sick animals. “The hope initially was that this would burn out in cattle and we wouldn’t have to worry about it,” says Russo, who calls that “the stick-your-head-in-the-sand approach”.\n\nSome countries vaccinate chicks against the H5N1 virus. Credit: Fang Dehua/VCG via Getty\n\nThe USDA recommends that producers implement biosecurity measures on dairy farms to prevent the spread of H5N1. For example, it suggests that farms disinfect the tyres of vehicles when they arrive, treat infected milk before disposal and ensure that farm workers use personal protective equipment. But those measures cost time and money, and many dairy producers don’t have a strong incentive to implement them. “The only way that they are going to take up improved biosecurity is if cows start dying,” says Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\n\nResearchers still don’t understand how the virus moves from farm to farm. Theories include the virus being transferred by birds, insects or farm workers; brought in by vehicles; or even carried on the wind. Cows’ udders could be the point of entry, or it could be respiratory. “We’re not sure what the riskiest pathways actually are,” says Michelle Kromm, a turkey veterinarian and an expert in food-system risk management, who works as a consultant in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to formulate the best plan of action.\n\nIn a preprint in August2, researchers showed that the virus seems to be widespread on dairy farms in California. The team found infectious virus in milk, in wastewater manure lagoons, and even in the air — both in milking parlours and on cows’ breath.\n\nThat suggests there could be a couple of simple risk-mitigation strategies, says Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who co-led the research. In milking parlours, “we’ve got lots of aerosols, lots of infectious virus”, she says. Face masks could prevent infections in workers, and fans could help to reduce the amount of virus carried in the air. Lakdawala also points out the importance of disinfecting milking equipment and inactivating virus in the milk of infected cows before it is discarded, so that it doesn’t enter the waste stream. “There is no one mode of transmission for influenza viruses,” she says. “One intervention is not going to solve everything.”\n\nThe management of dairy herds also makes control difficult. Poultry producers operate what they call an ‘all in, all out’ strategy, meaning the entire population of animals on a given farm cycles in and out together. But on a dairy farm, Russo says, about one-third of the animals are replaced every year. That means there is a constant supply of cows with no immunity to the virus. And stopping the movement of new cows is nearly impossible. In many cases, dairy production is broken up geographically. One farm might raise the calves, another takes the animals once they’re ready for breeding, and a third deals with the lactating cattle. Dairy farmers can’t just turn the switch off and stop production, Poulsen says.\n\nAs a result of these obstacles, little has been done to curb the virus’ spread. “The way that a dairy clears virus is living through the infection as it moves through the herd,” said California’s state veterinarian Annette Jones when she testified before the US House Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry in July. “Some of our herds have been under quarantine for over 300 days. So that means they are potentially spreading virus in the environment that long.”\n\nInfected dairy farms can be devastating for poultry producers. A single infected cow sheds enough virus to “wipe out an entire poultry operation”, Russo says. “Twenty-eight million out of the 39 million egg-layers we lost last year were associated with dairy cattle spillover events.”\n\nThis kind of spillover is exactly what happened in May at Hickman’s Family Farms in Buckeye, Arizona. The virus spread from a nearby dairy to one of the egg producer’s cage-free farms. The company had to cull six million birds — 95% of its flock. “It’s just been a slow-motion train wreck,” president Glenn Hickman said on a podcast in July.",

          "authors": "Amanda B. Keener",
          "abstract": "Every summer, Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, spends about a month in Managua, Nicaragua, when the rainy season is in full swing. But Gordon is interested in a different kind of season. “June or July can be peak influenza time in Nicaragua,” Gordon says.\n\nSince 2011, she and her colleagues at the Managua site of the Sustainable Sciences Institute, headquartered in Oakland, California, have been tracking flu infections, vaccinations and immune responses in hundreds of children enrolled in the Nicaraguan Pediatric Influenza Cohort study. The work is part of the larger Dissection of Influenza Vaccination and Infection for Childhood Immunity (DIVINCI) study, which is following some 3,000 children in the United States, Nicaragua and New Zealand, most of them from birth. Through the study of antibodies, immune cells and viral genomes, the researchers hope to understand a mysterious feature of the human immune response to the rapidly evolving flu virus.\n\nNature Spotlight: Influenza\n\nInfluenza frequently alters the proteins on its surface, so that over a lifetime, a person encounters many slightly different varieties of the virus. But the immune system generally sticks to what worked before. “Our earliest childhood exposures with influenza viruses prime antibody responses that last a lifetime,” says Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as original antigenic sin (OAS) — antigenic derives from antigen, which refers to any part of a virus to which an antibody binds. The term OAS comes from researchers who, in the 1950s, recognized that most of the flu-binding antibodies circulating in people’s blood match whichever influenza strains were most prevalent during their childhood1.\n\nThe emergence of swine and avian influenzas has made it possible to observe OAS in action, owing to it providing protection to people who had been imprinted by similar flu varieties decades earlier. However, it is hard to predict when this bias for ‘retro’ antibodies will help or hamper immune responses to current strains and updated vaccines. Some evidence suggests that the body’s tendency to boost old immune responses to fight off infection might limit its ability to detect parts of the flu virus that have recently changed.\n\nNow, researchers are trying to define the biological basis of OAS and design vaccines that could take advantage of it — or override it to generate immunity against a wider variety of flu strains. Longitudinal studies such as DIVINCI are poised to provide the data to make this possible. “The challenge for vaccinology is understanding how to work better with the memory that’s available,” says Sarah Cobey, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Chicago in Illinois. Yet shifting policies at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the administration of President Donald Trump have created uncertainty about future funding of these studies.\n\nNot so sinful\n\nThe benefit of OAS was clearly demonstrated in a 2016 study2 that is often credited with reigniting widespread interest in the phenomenon. In that study, researchers used statistical modelling to correlate people’s birth years with the flu subtype they were most likely to have first been exposed to.\n\nA health-worker takes a swab as part of a long-running flu study in Nicaragua.Credit: Marc-Gregor Camprendon\n\nThe most common type of influenza — influenza A — comes in several subtypes named after their surface proteins: haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. These H and N proteins come in different varieties, and influenza subtypes are named after the combination of proteins present. The predominant subtypes over the past 100 years, for example, are H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2. Subtypes that infect people fall into two broad groups based on the haemagglutinin present: group 1 viruses have H1, H2 or H5, and group 2 viruses have H3 or H7.\n\nBecause most people are exposed to flu by the age of three, Hensley says, “birth year really does serve as a good proxy of what our initial influenza encounters were”. For example, people born between 1918 and 1957 are most likely to have had H1N1 (the cause of the 1918 influenza pandemic) as children (see ‘Childhood memories’).\n\nSource: K. M. Gostic\n\nThe researchers in the 2016 study combined this probability data with flu-surveillance data on two avian influenza subtypes that emerged in the 1990s and 2000s — H5N1 and H7N9. They found that people who were probably infected with a group 1 virus in early childhood had the greatest protection against the group 1 virus H5N1 later in life. Likewise, those whose earliest exposure to flu came from a group 2 virus were better protected against the group 2 virus H7N9. The researchers termed this protective effect immune imprinting. Although often used interchangeably with OAS, immune imprinting describes the effect of early-life flu exposure on the entire immune system rather than just on antibody levels.\n\nSeveral studies have since described the role that antibodies have in the protection that imprinting bestows. Antibodies circulating in the blood can help to block the flu virus from latching onto and infecting cells. In a study published this year3, Cobey, Hensley and their colleagues found that people who were born before 1968 — and therefore probably imprinted with a group 1 virus — carried the highest levels of antibodies that could bind to, block or neutralize a strain of H5N1.\n\nThe researchers also examined blood samples collected during clinical trials of an H5N1 vaccine. In older adults, levels of an H5-neutralizing antibody were already high, and the vaccine provided only a slight boost. In children, by contrast, the vaccine brought antibody levels up significantly from a low starting point. The result suggests that in the case of an H5N1 pandemic, public-health officials should prioritize vaccinating children over older adults, Hensley says.\n\nImprinting studies have tended to focus on the antibody response to influenza A’s haemagglutinin protein. But Hensley, Cobey and their colleagues have described an imprinted antibody response against influenza A’s other surface protein, neuraminidase4. Meanwhile, a team led by immunologist Marios Koutsakos at the University of Melbourne in Australia has shown evidence5 of imprinting affecting the levels of circulating antibodies that target a less common form of influenza: type B.\n\nThings remembered\n\nCirculating antibodies are just one line of defence against flu. Immune cells called B and T cells also remember past infections, and act quickly to protect the body from familiar pathogens. OAS and imprinting are important during this reactivation step.\n\nCell samples collected in Nicaragua are stored in liquid nitrogen. Credit: Marc-Gregor Camprendon\n\nIn 1956, the research team that originally described OAS reported that, after vaccination with one of a variety of influenza A strains, people got a boost of antibodies that stuck to whichever strain they had encountered in childhood6. People still made vaccine-strain-specific antibodies, but usually in lower amounts than their childhood-flu-specific antibodies.\n\nImmunologists now know that this effect results from a combination of normal immune memory and a rapidly mutating virus. Memory B cells remember 3D features of influenza proteins called epitopes. “That is probably the immunological basis of what is called immune imprinting now,” Hensley says.\n\nBut influenza’s shifting epitope landscape throws a spanner into this process. Memory B cells might churn out antibodies so efficiently that other, newly exposed B cells miss their chance to engage any new or altered epitopes and form memories. That could be a problem for annual flu shots, which are meant to encourage immunity to new epitopes that appear as a result of viral evolution.\n\nResearchers don’t know the extent to which this competition between naive and memory B cells plays out when people are infected or vaccinated. But animal studies are providing some insight.\n\nIn 2023, immunologist Gabriel Victora at the Rockefeller University in New York City and his team showed that memory B cells are more likely to predominate in an immune response when an animal is exposed to two identical or very similar strains in a row7. In mice that were first infected with a flu strain called PR8 and then injected with a PR8 haemagglutinin months later, 90% of the antibodies produced in response to the vaccine came from memory B cells. “Almost everything is dominated by the old memory cells,” Victora says.\n\nHowever, when the researchers injected previously infected mice with a haemagglutinin that was only 90% identical to that of PR8, the ratio of antibodies from memory B cells and naive B cells dropped to about 50:50. Victora’s team repeated the experiment with several more haemagglutinin proteins that were less similar to the initial infecting strain and found that as the similarity dropped, the proportion of naive B-cell antibodies increased.\n\nThe cost of imprinting\n\nVictora’s study suggests that when memory B cells react to a highly familiar flu protein, fewer naive B cells can respond to that protein. “One of the big discussions is whether this is a problem or not,” Victora says.\n\nWhich epitopes the imprinted antibodies bind to seems to be a factor. “If that antibody response is targeting something that’s conserved and neutralizing, then perhaps that’s a projective form of imprinting,” Koutsakos says. But if memory B cells and their antibodies target parts of the virus that are not important for infection, the imprint might leave a person less protected.\n\nIn 2020, Hensley and Cobey’s groups reported that imprinting with an H3N2 strain that circulated in the 1960s and 1970s might have left middle-aged adults more susceptible to an H3N2 strain that emerged in 20148. The study found that people of all age groups carried antibodies that could bind to the new H3N2, but that those made by middle-aged adults were generally poor at neutralizing the virus in lab experiments.\n\nEven when they don’t prevent infection, antibodies can still help to fight it. Reawakened memory B cells that initially produce poorly binding antibodies can improve with each flu exposure, by acquiring mutations and undergoing a selection process that results in highly specific, tightly binding antibodies, Hensley says.\n\nA memory B-cell arsenal that is too specifically focused on one small feature of a viral protein, however, can become a liability — especially if that feature suddenly mutates. This seems to have happened in the 2013–2014 flu season, when H1N1 dominated. “That season, there was a shift to more and earlier infections in middle-aged adults,” Cobey says. Some people born in the 1960s and 1970s who had an immune response that was imprinted against a focused area on H1N1 were more susceptible to infection by a new strain of H1N1 that had acquired a mutation in that region. There is evidence that the same birth-year cohort in the United States and Canada experienced a dip in vaccine effectiveness during the 2015–2016 flu season, possibly because their immune imprinting made it harder to generate immunity to that year’s vaccine strain.\n\nLongitudinal studies such as DIVINCI could shed light on how imprinting affects flu-vaccine effectiveness, and how annual shots shape flu immunity. The goal is to “describe how these immune responses form and then what their potentials are in downstream infection or vaccine settings,” says Paul Thomas, an immunologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington, and one of the study’s principal investigators.",

Efforts to protect the turtle’s eggs and measures to prevent their accidental capture in fishing nets have allowed populations to recover.\n\nThe ampurta (Dasycercus hillieri), a rat-sized Australian marsupial, moved from near-extinction to ‘least concern’ this year. Between 2015 and 2021, ampurta territory expanded by more than 48,000 square kilometres, despite dry conditions and food shortages.\n\nLastly, nations reached a historic milestone for marine conservation in September with the United Nations High Seas Treaty receiving approval from more than 60 countries. The treaty, which will come into effect in January, aims to legally protect biodiversity in international waters and conserve at least 30% of land and sea areas.\n\nOzone hole shrinks\n\nThe hole in the Antarctic ozone layer has shrunk to its smallest size since 2019, indicating the continued recovery of Earth’s protective upper atmosphere.\n\nThe ozone hole was first discovered in 1985 and is a result of human-emitted ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), such as coolants in refrigerators and aerosol sprays. The Montreal Protocol in 1987 phased out the production and use of CFCs, which has successfully curbed emissions1 . Since 1987, the average size of the ozone hole throughout the year has been gradually decreasing in size, with the smallest so far in 2019.\n\nThe ozone hole is on track to recover completely in the late 2060s, provided efforts to find climate-friendly alternatives to CFCs continues.\n\nThe hole in the Antarctic ozone layer has continued to shrink.Credit: CAMS\nGene-editing successes\n\nThis year “was a breakthrough year for gene editing,” says David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “In 2025, these technologies have achieved a number of medical milestones.”\n\n“I view this year as an outstanding one, marked by the launch of many clinical trials”, adds Annarita Miccio, who studies gene therapy at the Imagine Institute at the Necker Hospital for Sick Children in Paris.\n\nHuntington’s disease treated for the first time using gene therapy\n\nThe first gene therapy for Huntington’s disease proved striking, slowing the rate of cognitive decline in participants by 75%. Another gene-therapy trial for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia showed promise with the majority of 11 participating children and adults entering remission2. The new type of CAR-T-cell therapy uses base-editing technology to modify several genes in T cells, helping them to target the cancer cells.\n\nResearchers also trialled the first use of a CRISPR technology tailored to an individual this year. Other successes include the first clinical trial for a gene therapy to treat a rare immune disorder called chronic granulomatous disease3, and another that corrected a pathogenic mutation, which can cause lung damage and liver disease4.\n\nThese clinical trials paved the way for developing mutation-specific strategies for rare diseases and demonstrated that collaboration between academia and industry can lead to cures for people with such diseases, says Miccio.\n\nRenewable-energy boost\n\nRenewable energy surpassed coal as the largest energy source for the first time globally this year. The achievement was helped by China becoming the first country in the world to install 1 terawatt of solar power capacity in May. In the first six months of 2025 alone, China installed new solar systems with a capacity of 256 gigawatts — twice as much as the rest of the world combined. The country plans to add a further 200–300 gigawatts of capacity for solar and wind energy in its five year plan, beginning in 2026.\n\nWhat happened at COP30? 4 science take-homes from the climate summit\n\n“China and many developing countries are deploying solar and wind [and] electric vehicles at pretty breakneck pace,” says Peters.\n\nAround half of the European Union’s demand for electricity came from from renewables in the second and third quarters of this year. Renewable-energy capacity is projected to increase by almost 4,600 gigawatts between 2025 and 2030 — double the capacity deployed between 2019 and 2024.\n\nHowever, greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels reached a new high this year. It remains to be seen whether renewable energy can replace fossil fuels as the dominant global energy sources.\n\nEbola contained",

          "abstract": "Researchers looked for markers of Alzheimer's disease in more than 11,000 NorwegiansCredit: Tek Image/Science Photo Library\n\nNearly one in ten people over the age of 70 have Alzheimer’s disease dementia, shows a first-of-its-kind study that paired blood-based markers and clinical assessments to study the disease in Norway1.\n\nThat prevalence is in line with previous estimates for some other white populations2. But there were also unexpected differences, including higher disease rates than anticipated in individuals older than 85.\n\n“This is very important work from a beautiful Norwegian study,” says Nicolas Villain, a neurologist at Sorbonne University in Paris who was not involved in the research. The study, published today in Nature, shows that blood-based tools can improve epidemiological estimates of neurodegenerative disease.\n\nBlood tests are now approved for Alzheimer’s: how accurate are they?\n\nBut exactly how to use these tests remains controversial, warns Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician and co-director of the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Blood-based markers can be helpful for physicians treating people with dementia and for answering research questions, but they aren’t ready to be rolled out widely as health screening tools.\n\n“It is the kind of test that, in the wrong hands, could cause a lot of harm,” says Karlawish, who was not involved in the study.\n\nFrom blood to brain\n\nTo assess the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), an international team of researchers turned to the Trøndelag Health (HUNT) study, a prospective health research study that started in 1984 and that has collected health data and biological samples from 250,000 Norwegians.\n\nUsing blood samples from 11,486 individuals in the study aged 58 and above, the team looked at levels of a protein called tau that has been phosphorylated at a specific site. Known as pTau217, this blood marker serves as a proxy for the build-up of amyloid plaque in the brain, a hallmark of AD. HUNT study participants over the age of 70 have undergone cognitive testing, enabling the researchers to compare pTau217 levels with the presence of dementia.\n\nAround 10% of participants over the age of 70 had dementia and AD pathology, showing both cognitive impairment and high pTau217, they report. Another 10% had mild cognitive impairments and high pTau217. And 10% had high pTau217 but no signs of cognitive impairment, which the authors refer to as preclinical AD.\n\nThese findings are broadly in line with expectations, but there were surprises too.\n\nSome 25% of people aged 85–89 had dementia and AD pathology, up from previous estimates of around 7% for men and 13% for women in this age group in Western Europeans3. And the incidence of preclinical AD in younger individuals was 8% in those aged 70–74, down from a previous estimate of around 22%.\n\nAnders Gustavsson, a member of the team that compiled the earlier estimates, welcomes the latest data. “I'm not surprised that this study gets somewhat different numbers,” says Gustavsson, who is an adviser to the health economics consultancy Quantify Research in Stockholm.\n\nAlzheimer’s decline slows with just a few thousand steps a day\n\nThe discrepancies probably reflect selection bias, says study co-author Anita Lenora Sunde, a physician and dementia researcher at Stavanger University Hospital in Norway. Previous estimates were made by recruiting participants for brain scans, and people with dementia might not have wanted to or been able to participate.\n\nBut other factors could also be at play, says Villain. The latest study uses a high pTau217 threshold to define its preclinical AD population, and so excludes people with intermediate levels of the protein and emerging pathology.\n\n“If you lower the threshold, the prevalence suddenly increases,” says Villain.\n\nThe value of education\n\nThe study also found that people with lower education levels have higher pTau217 levels.",

          "abstract": "The National Science Foundation, one of the world’s largest funders of basic science, has reduced the minimum number of external reviews that grant proposals must undergo.Credit: Briscoe Savoy for Nature\n\nThe US National Science Foundation (NSF) is relaxing some of its requirements for the review of grant proposals in an effort to cope with a backlog of applications and reduced staff numbers. Staff members at the agency, one of the world’s leading funders of basic science, say that the new strategy could have benefits, but raises the risk of grant applications being inadequately reviewed.\n\nPreviously, proposals for research grants were generally required to undergo at least three external reviews by scientists from outside the agency. Now, two reviews are enough and, under some circumstances, one can be an internal review by a scientist at the NSF.\n\nIs academic research becoming too competitive? Nature examines the data\n\nThe change in policy was described in an update of the agency’s Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide that was published on 8 December. Nature also obtained the more detailed internal guidance supplied to NSF programme officers, who are in charge of the review process. To get a better understanding of the changes, Nature spoke to five NSF staff members. All requested anonymity because of concerns about retaliation.\n\nSubstituting an internal review for an external review could save time, programme officers say. “I’m glad to have a little more flexibility,” one says, especially when they are handling proposals that do not meet basic criteria for funding. “But I would hate to see two reviews becoming the norm for the proposals that are legitimate candidates for funding.” Programme officers say that they value a range of external expert perspectives.\n\nVariety of views\n\nLike other science agencies, the NSF relies heavily on external expertise to assess grant proposals. Proposals are sent to peer-review panels of between three and ten independent specialists, each of whom produces reviews of a handful of proposals. To supplement panellists’ evaluations, programme officers also solicit other external experts for ad hoc reviews.\n\nNSF slashes prestigious PhD fellowship awards by half\n\nDuring day-long discussion sessions, panels consider panellists’ reviews and any ad hoc reviews, then produce assessments of proposals. Programme officers use these assessments to make recommendations to division directors, who decide which proposals are funded.\n\nProgramme officers also write summaries of these assessments, which can provide feedback for researchers. Until now, those summaries were highly detailed and multiple paragraphs long. But new internal guidance limits summaries to three to five sentences. It is a shame to limit the summaries, which are “a more helpful synthesis” than other documents from the review process, says Laurel Yohe, a bioinformatics researcher at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse, Mohana Basu",
          "abstract": "Young people in Australia can no longer use popular social media platforms.Credit: David Gray/AFP via Getty\n\nThis week, Australia became the first country to ban children under the age of 16 from using most social-media platforms. Many teenagers in the country are furious, but for social scientists, the policy offers a natural experiment to study the effects of social-media restrictions on young people.\n\nTechnology companies have had a year to come up with ways to stop teenagers in the country using their platforms, including Facebook, X, Reddit, YouTube, Threads and Snapchat. From Wednesday, companies must take reasonable steps to prevent young people from creating or keeping accounts, or risk fines of up to Aus$49.5 million (US$33 million).\n\nDo smartphones and social media really harm teens’ mental health?\n\nOther countries, including France, Denmark and Spain, have introduced social-media restrictions for young people, or announced plans to, but no policy is as far-reaching as Australia’s. Its government says that social media is harming young people’s mental health, causing teenagers to lose sleep because of addictive design features and exposing them to harmful content. But some researchers say the evidence that social media causes harm is mixed. Communicating with peers online is a crucial support system for some young people, particularly those in minority groups and those living in remote areas.\n\nNature spoke to researchers who will study the effects of the ban.\n\nNew avenues of research\n\nFor Susan Sawyer, a physician-researcher specializing in adolescent health at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, the start of the social-media ban this week meant entering the next phase of her research. Over the past two months, Sawyer and her colleagues interviewed 177 teenagers aged 13–16 about their social-media use, screen time and mental health before the ban came into effect. She and her colleagues plan to survey the teenagers again in six months, to see whether the ban has affected their use of the platforms or their mental health. The researchers will also survey the participants’ parents about problematic Internet and social-media use by their children.\n\nAnother research collaboration between the Kids Research Institute Australia, the University of Western Australia and Edith Cowan University, all in Perth, will examine whether the ban is presenting new parenting challenges and what family conflicts have arisen as a result.\n\nAmanda Third, a researcher at Western Sydney University in Australia who studies how children use technology, says the ban is an opportunity to collect data about the effect of policies that restrict young people’s access to the Internet and social media. She is going to investigate how teenagers engage with technology and the Internet, and how their face-to-face interactions might change following the ban.\n\nBut, she says, it might be hard to tell whether any changes are a direct result of the ban or other policies designed to make the Internet safer: for example, later this month, new industry standards will come into effect for tech companies to prevent children being exposed to sexually explicit or violent content on the Internet. The social-media ban could undercut some well-thought-out efforts to keep children on social media and positively impact their experiences online, she says. “The ban is about booting them out.”\n\nZareh Ghazarian, a political scientist at Monash University in Melbourne who studies the role of social media in young people’s political development, says online platforms can be an important way for teenagers to engage with politics. Teachers can discuss contemporary issues, political debates and policy issues that come up on social media, he says. Now that the ban is in place, he plans to interview teachers to find out how it is affecting students’ political knowledge, and what alternative platforms they are turning to. “Part of education is to be able to engage with issues and ideas that may not be covered in the classroom — and that was the benefit social media was bringing,” he says.\n\nUnintended consequences",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "Image sleuths noticed irregularities in figures from scores of papers co-authored by Ali Khademhosseini.Credit: Natali Mis/Getty\n\nIn December 2024, Elisabeth Bik noticed irregularities in a few papers by a highly-cited bioengineer, Ali Khademhosseini. She started looking at more publications for which he was a co-author, and the issues soon piled up: some figures were stitched together strangely, and images of cells and tissues were duplicated, rotated, mirrored and sometimes reused and labelled differently.\n\nBik, a microbiologist and leading research-integrity specialist based in San Francisco, California, ended up flagging about 80 papers on PubPeer, a platform that allows researchers to review papers after publication. A handful of other volunteer science sleuths found more, bringing the total to 90.\n\nThe articles were published in 33 journals over 20 years and have been cited a combined total of 14,000 times. Although there are hundreds of co-authors on the papers, the sleuthing effort centred on Khademhosseini, who is a corresponding author for about 60% of them.\n\nWhy retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science\n\nHe and his co-authors sprang into action. Responding to the concerns, some of which were reported in the blog For Better Science, became like a full-time job, says Khademhosseini, who until August was director and chief executive of the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation in Los Angeles, California. “I alerted journals, I alerted collaborators. We tried to do our best to make the literature correct.” In many cases, he and his co-authors provided original source data to journal editors, and the papers were corrected.\n\nKhademhosseini told Nature that investigations into his work have been carried out and have found no evidence of misconduct by him. The Terasaki Institute says that an “internal review has not found that Dr. Khademhosseini engaged in research misconduct”.\n\nThe case raises questions about oversight in large laboratories and about when a paper needs to be retracted and when a correction is sufficient. In some cases, journals have issued corrections for papers containing issues that research-integrity sleuths describe as “clearly data manipulation”, and the corrections were issued without source data. Bik and others argue that this approach sets a bad precedent. “I don’t think that any part of a study that bears these signs of data manipulation should be trusted,” says Reese Richardson, who studies data integrity at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He argues that such papers should be retracted.\n\nKhademhosseini defends the corrections and says that the conclusions of the papers still hold. He says he has not seen any “conclusive evidence” of misconduct or “purposeful manipulation” in the papers, and nothing that would require a retraction.\n\nFinding flaws\n\nFor three decades, Khademhosseini has developed biomedical technologies such as organs on chips and hydrogel wound treatments. His work has been funded by the US National Institutes of Health, and by other public and private agencies. As a PhD student, he worked under Robert Langer, a renowned bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Khademhosseini has published more than 1,000 papers, which have been cited more than 100,000 times in total. He has also received numerous awards and honours — most recently, the 2024 Biomaterials Global Impact Award, from the journal Biomaterials.\n\nThis science sleuth revealed a retraction crisis at Indian universities\n\nIn August, Khademhosseini left the Terasaki Institute. He says that he did so to work on a start-up “to accelerate scientific discovery using AI”, and that his departure was not related to the PubPeer comments. The institute also says that his departure “was unrelated to any research integrity inquiries”.\n\nTo get a sense of the severity of the image-related issues, Nature’s news team analysed the 90 papers flagged on PubPeer in consultation with four image-integrity specialists, including Bik and Richardson, and three bioengineers. The team relied on guidance from the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM). This ranks image irregularities on the basis of the type of aberration, perceived intent and impact on research conclusions. Six papers had issues unrelated to images, such as authorship disputes or complaints about reported conflicts of interest. Of the remaining 84, 41 were classed as ‘level I’: containing minor issues, such as an accidentally duplicated image that could easily be corrected with raw data. Another 20 papers had more substantial problems, falling into level II. And 23 papers considered level III had more serious issues, including multiple manipulations that directly affect the interpretation of the data. STM guidelines recommend that level-II and level-III issues are investigated to rule out misconduct.\n\nKhademhosseini disputes the Nature news team’s analysis, saying it contains “substantial inaccuracies”. He says, for example, that many of the figures classified as having severe problems were in fact peripheral to the conclusions of the papers, and that some errors that the analysis deemed intentional could in fact have been accidents.\n\nThousands of highly cited scientists have at least one retraction\n\nKhademhosseini adds that the high number of flagged papers results from the fact that he’s published so many papers during his career, each of which has about 80 images. He objects to being singled out, and estimates that the rate of errors in his flagged papers is below the average error rate in biomedical literature, which is sometimes given as 4%. “If you go after anybody who has been around a long time, you can dig up stuff,” he says. What’s more, he argues that the artificial-intelligence-powered tools that sleuths sometimes use to help them detect image irregularities raise the average error rate in the published literature, making his numbers look even more reasonable.\n\nBik estimates that she looked at about 530 papers to find the errors she did. She says that she used AI to analyse some of Khademhosseini’s papers, but that she also verifies each irregularity by eye.\n\nCorrection conundrum\n\nKhademhosseini and his co-authors have provided source data for more than 25 corrections, which is an accepted practice for level-I errors and often resolves the issue.\n\nBut many of the papers are old — about half are from before 2016 — and the source data are not always available. To address the concerns in these cases, Khademhosseini and his colleagues have repeated some of the experiments to show that the findings are reproducible.\nElisabeth Bik noticed multiple duplicated elements in one figure (highlighted in colour, left) from a 2004 paper.

Credit: National Institutes of Health, NIAID/Science Photo Library\n\nA twice-weekly cocktail of three messenger RNAs can rejuvenate the weary immune systems of aged mice and boost responses to vaccination and cancer treatments, a study has found1.\n\nThe treatment provides a needed boost to immune cells called T cells, which coordinate immune responses and kill infected cells. As people age, their ability to produce T cells wanes, and the ones they have become less effective.\n\nT-cell ageing helps to explain why vaccines are sometimes less effective in older people than in young adults, and why cancer treatments that unleash the immune system against tumours don’t work as well in older adults, says María Mittelbrunn, an immunologist at the Spanish National Research Council in Madrid. Flagging T-cell immunity is also linked to the chronic inflammation associated with many age-related diseases, including some forms of cardiovascular disease.\n\nHow to make an old immune system young again\n“T cells, in particular, are one of the cell types that change the most during ageing,” says Mittelbrunn, who was not involved in the study. “To rejuvenate them could have immense consequences.”\n\nThe work was reported in Nature on 17 December and earlier this month at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in Orlando, Florida.\n\nTargeting T cells\n\nT cells are produced in the bone marrow and then travel to a tiny gland called the thymus to mature. In the thymus, they learn to recognize and respond to pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. They also learn not to attack the body’s own healthy cells.\n\nBut the thymus degrades with age: it begins to shrink and is gradually replaced by fatty tissue. Attempts to reverse this using hormone treatments or other drugs have not worked, says Mirco Friedrich, a haematologist and oncologist at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, and first author of the study.\n\nSo, Friedrich and his colleagues decided to take a different approach: rather than directly treating the thymus, they targeted T cells by delivering an experimental therapy to the liver. “Most T cells are in the blood,” Friedrich says. “And the liver receives the body’s whole blood volume.”\n\nHow quickly are you ageing?

The centre’s modelling and Earth observations underpin a wide range of US and global research, especially on climate.\n\n“This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” wrote Russell Vought, Trump’s budget director, announcing the planned closure in a post yesterday on the social-media platform X. In a statement, the White House called NCAR “the premier research stronghold for left-wing climate lunacy”. The plan was first reported by USA Today.\n\nThe White House said that the National Science Foundation (NSF), which provides funding for the centre, “will be breaking up NCAR to eliminate Green New Scam research activities. Any vital functions, such as weather modeling and supercomputing, will be moved under the purview of another entity or location.”\n\nOn Wednesday, the consortium that runs NCAR received a letter of intent from the NSF regarding the planned breakup of NCAR, consortium president Antonio Busalacchi told Nature. The letter requested information regarding divesting, transferring or restructuring the various components of NCAR. It mentioned NCAR's research aircraft fleet and its supercomputing center in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as components that might be relocated. “Morale is terrible,” Busalacchi says.\n\nUS environmental agency halts funding for its main science division\n\nAny such action will be challenged by members of Congress. “We will fight this reckless directive with every legal tool we have,” Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the US House of Representatives, said in a statement. Congress sets the federal budget and can direct the US government to fund NCAR.\n\nA non-profit consortium of more than 130 colleges and universities, known as the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), operates NCAR for the NSF. The most recent agreement between the NSF and UCAR, which was signed in 2023, provides US$938 million to run NCAR for five years. Cancelling that award would eliminate the majority of NCAR’s annual budget. The rest of the budget comes from an array of federal and non-federal sources.\n\nCentral resource\n\nNews of the intended closure rippled quickly through the earth science community, with many starting a #SaveNCAR discussion across social-media platforms. “Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet,” wrote Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, on social media, adding that the laboratory is the “global mothership” of atmospheric science.\n\nThe move “is just another unbelievably reckless blow to American science,” says Dawn Wright, an oceanographer and geographer at Esri, a geographic information system company in Redlands, California. “If the NSF does follow through with these plans to break up NCAR, that’s just going to decimate a huge chunk of the US climate research that we all depend on.”\n\nThe NSF established NCAR in 1960 to support US atmospheric science research that requires computing or other resources beyond the means of any single institution. “If you cancel this, you will devastate atmospheric science,” says a researcher who formerly worked at the NSF and requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. “That’s different from other sciences that are more distributed.”\n\nTrump gutted two landmark environmental reports — can researchers save them?\n\nWork at NCAR played a key part in the rise of modern weather and climate forecasting. For instance, the lab pioneered the modern dropwindsonde, a weather instrument that can be released from an aircraft to measure conditions as it plummets through a storm. The technology reshaped the scientific understanding of hurricanes, says James Franklin, an atmospheric scientist and former branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the US National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.",

          "abstract": "Emergency hospital wards were set up during the 1918 flu pandemic.Credit: NATIONAL MUSEUM OF HEALTH AND MEDICINE/SPL\n\nOf all the pathogens that have plagued humanity, few are as notorious and persistent as influenza. Its Houdini-like ability to regularly slip the shackles of vaccine- or infection-induced immunity, aided by a steady and sustained mutation rate, has created a seasonal viral scourge that wreaks medical and economic havoc all over the world. Here, Nature outlines the history of flu and how it evades attempts to control it.\n\nA short history of flu pandemics\n\nInfluenza is never far away. Its seasonality means it see-saws between Northern and Southern hemispheres on an annual basis, causing illness and death among not just humans but also poultry, cattle and birds and mammals in the wild.\n\nNature Spotlight: Influenza\n\nEvery few decades or so, a chance mutation leads to an extraordinary pandemic event that can sweep the planet, claiming millions of lives. The 1918–19 flu pandemic caused 50 million deaths; for the 1957–58 pandemic it was 1 million to 4 million; in 1968–69, the death toll was also 1 million to 4 million; and in 2009–10 it was 105,000–395,000.\n\nSeasonal flu causes 290,000–650,000 deaths, globally each year. In 2015, flu caused losses of US$8 billion in wages and productivity in the United States alone.\n\nThe multiple disguises of influenza\n\nInfluenza is a single-stranded RNA virus of the family Orthomyxovirus. Although the virus is most commonly referred to as flu, it has many names, subtypes and disguises. Alterations to two key proteins on the surface of the influenza A virus — the spike protein haemagglutinin that allows the virus to attach to host cells, and neuraminidase, which enables the virus to escape from host cells — mean that subtypes are identified according to variations in these proteins.\n\nOf the four types of influenza, only type A causes pandemics. Influenza A (Alphainfluenzavirus) has 198 potential serotypes, consisting of combinations of the 18 known haemagglutinin (H) subtypes and the 11 known neuraminidase (N) subtypes.\n\nInfluenza B (Betainfluenzavirus) causes less severe disease than type A and is divided into distinct lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria. Influenza C (Gammainfluenzavirus) causes generally mild respiratory illness in children, but can be more severe in infants. Influenza D (Deltainfluenzavirus) is only known to infect cattle and pigs.\n\nFlu’s known associates\n\nThe influenza virus has a broad range of hosts, including cows, deer, horses, dogs, frogs, salamanders, fish and even marine invertebrates. But the favourite host species of the virus is birds, especially water birds, which provide a huge and diverse reservoir of influenza virus subtypes.\n\nAlthough influenza’s association with people is the most concerning, humans are an uncommon host for the virus. Of the many potential subtypes of influenza A, few have resulted in serious outbreaks in humans. The most notable are: H1N1, responsible for the deadly 1918 pandemic, and H3N2, the culprit behind the 1968 pandemic.\n\nFlu’s distinguishing features\n\nUnder an electron microscope, influenza looks deceptively innocent, like a slightly misshapen fuzzy jelly bean. But what really distinguishes it from other viruses is what’s on the inside.\n\nThe influenza virus has a remarkably simple genetic structure. The genomes of influenza A and B — the types responsible for most illness in humans — consist of just eight segments of single-stranded RNA. Influenza C and D each have seven segments. The segments of RNA carry the code for the RNA polymerase enzyme that is needed for the virus to replicate, and for the proteins that form the outside of the virus particle.\n\nInfluenza is a negative-sense RNA virus. This means that to produce proteins the virus must first generate a positive copy of its genetic code in the form of messenger RNA. Using this disguise, the virus can then hijack the host cell’s replication machinery and use it to churn out copies of its own mRNA and perpetuate its existence.",

          "authors": "Anil Shanker",
          "abstract": "In September, the US government announced a one-off US$495-million funding boost for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). This is welcome news — but doesn’t redress their chronic underfunding.\n\nThe financial shackling of historically Black universities in the United States\n\nIn the United States, HBCUs educate 1.5% of all university students — yet receive only 0.9% of federal research and development (R&D) funding. Data reported in 2024 show combined HBCU endowment assets around $100,000 per student. By contrast, the ten wealthiest US universities received $2 million to $7 million per student in 2023.\n\nAs a scientist and administrator at Meharry Medical College — a 150-year-old private historically Black health-sciences institution in Nashville, Tennessee, with some 1,500 students — I’ve seen how hard it can be to manage on scant budgets. I urge the government to redress funding levels. In the meantime, HBCUs and TCUs can target their investments, as Meharry has done with some success.\n\nOver the past decade, Meharry has increased its funds for research, and its scholarly output, by using metrics to guide budgeting and investments. We tracked publications and citations, grants, awards, student engagement, graduation and career placement rates, facility use, data generation and sharing (how many samples were processed, what data sets were produced and how were shared), research collaborations and investigator diversity. We also expanded our number of sponsors and monitored how funds were used.\n\nBetween the periods of 2010–15 and 2020–25, the number of cross-disciplinary collaborations increased, both between groups at Meharry and with external investigators. The number of papers with Meharry authors indexed in the PubMed database of biomedical literature rose from 444 to 1,067.\n\nEnd racism in science\n\nThree measures underpin this growth. First, we established transdisciplinary pilot grants of $50,000–$75,000 per faculty member lasting for 12–18 months — funded by federal research endowments or private foundations — to seed ideas and support core staff and infrastructure. While maintaining budgets for ongoing cancer, HIV and oral-health studies, we prioritized new projects in genomics, inflammation, immunity and cardiometabolic health. We also launched two new schools: one in applied computational sciences, in 2021; and one in global health, in 2023.\n\nSecond, we invested in infrastructure to handle, store and analyse data securely. We established procedures — including some around human consent and data sovereignty — that meet both federal and Tribal Nations’ standards. Studies that involve human participants must be co-designed with community members to ensure that any concerns — for example, about privacy, potential stigma or data misuse — are addressed early on. Steps such as pre-consented sharing of electronic health records or clinical notes can help to accelerate the analysis of disease risk, treatment response and gaps in care, to inform services and policies that benefit local people. This transparent and respectful approach deepens public confidence in science, especially among populations long marginalized in research.",

          "title": "A universal flu vaccine has proved challenging — could it finally be possible?",
          "authors": "Neil Savage",
          "abstract": "In February 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) tried to predict which strains of influenza were going to pose the biggest threat in that year’s Northern Hemisphere flu season. It failed.\n\nOn the basis of surveillance data on which strains were circulating, the WHO selected four that would become the foundation of that year’s vaccine. One was an H3N2 virus strain that was the most prevalent of that particular subtype, at that moment. But by the time the vaccine was making its way into people’s arms that autumn, a different version of the virus had taken over — and the vaccine was only 6% effective at protecting against it1. That year’s Northern Hemisphere flu season was more severe than the five that had preceded it, and lasted weeks longer than any in the previous decade.\n\nNature Spotlight: Influenza\n\nThis problem of antigenic drift — when gene mutations cause components of the influenza virus to change, and it evolves away from the vaccines designed to keep it in check — could be reduced by the development of a universal flu vaccine. A shot that provides broad coverage against a wide array of strains could improve efficacy significantly from the 40–60% reduction in risk that flu vaccines typically achieve2. It would also eliminate the need for WHO’s twice-yearly meetings to predict which viral strains to guard against, the subsequent scramble to manufacture the vaccine and the need for people to be vaccinated year after year.\n\nSome strategies to improve the effectiveness of the flu vaccine and reduce the need for annual shots have made it into early clinical trials3. A major thrust of these efforts is to coax the immune system to respond to a part of the flu virus that it normally pays little attention to. Ordinarily, the immune system produces antibodies that focus on a particular part of haemagglutinin, a protein on the surface of the virus that allows it to enter cells. Antibodies clamp to haemagglutinin and block the virus from attaching. Haemagglutinin has 18 subtypes: H1 to H18. And, unfortunately, haemagglutinin can evolve rapidly, changing its shape so that antibodies can no longer bind to it. “What we’re trying to do is trick the immune system into attacking a part of the influenza virus that it typically doesn’t attack,” says Florian Krammer, a vaccinologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.\n\nHaemagglutinin is a stalk, rising from the virus surface, topped by a ball-shaped head. The immune system focuses most of its efforts here. “The head domain sticks out of the virus, so it’s very easy for B-cell receptors, which in the end become antibodies, to recognize that part,” Krammer says. “The stalk is a little bit more hidden.” Krammer treats this as a challenge, and is trying to amplify the immune response to the haemagglutinin stalk.\n\nA second protein called neuraminidase, which helps the virus spread to other cells, has 11 subtypes. Although viruses with any combination of these haemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes can infect people, the two currently circulating in humans are H1N1 and H3N2. Krammer and his colleagues create new versions of the virus by taking H1 stalks and replacing the heads with those from other subtypes, such as H14 or H8. Apart from newborn babies, most people have been either infected with or vaccinated against flu — or both — and so have a pre-existing immune response. When presented with a chimaera protein (say, an H1 stalk and an H8 head) the immune system recognizes the part it has seen before (the stalk)and reacts to that. “That weakens the response to the head and strengthens the response to this stalk,” Krammer says.\n\nAnd a stronger reaction to the stalk should, in turn, make it harder for the virus to evade the immune response. The stalk plays a crucial part in allowing the virus to fuse with the host cell, and undergoes a series of structural changes during fusion. Any mutation that interferes with those changes renders the virus ineffective, meaning the stalk can’t evolve in response to the immune system as readily as the head can. The stalk also doesn’t vary much between virus strains, so immunity against this part provides broader protection.\n\nIn 2020, Krammer and his colleagues tested a vaccine in a small phase I clinical trial3. They showed that it induced a large number of antibodies to target an H1 stalk. Although the COVID-19 pandemic put the work on hold, it has since resumed. The next step will be to try the same with an H3 stalk, and to combine the two to see whether the result generates a broad antiviral response. “It’s going slowly, but it’s going,” Krammer says.\n\nAt Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, microbiologist Nicholas Heaton is also trying to get the immune system to look beyond the haemagglutinin head. His aim is to get it to notice other sites on the virus at which antibodies can bind, known as epitopes. “Normally, the immune system would focus on that haemagglutinin head domain. It’s obsessed with it,” Heaton says. “If you remove it, then you say, out of everything that’s left, what do you like? And so you get these responses to other epitopes.”\n\nHeaton and his colleagues used gene editing to create more than 80,000 variations of haemagglutinin with different changes to a specific part of the head domain, but with the same stalk4. The variety of head-domain epitopes meant that the immune system focused its attention on the stalk, leading to a significant increase in stalk antibodies when tested in ferrets and mice. But Heaton didn’t want to create a new immune response at the expense of the old one. He, therefore, also used conventional methods to create a virus particle that elicited the typical haemagglutinin-head-focused response, and then mixed the two types to achieve broader immunity.\n\nThe variant epitopes also seem to induce some immunity, and many might help to inhibit the virus. The stalk-binding antibodies don’t actually neutralize the virus, Heaton says, but they can help the immune system to recognize it and clear it faster, theoretically lowering the viral burden and thus the severity of the infection. “People who would have stayed out of work for two days won’t even feel sick,” Heaton says. People who might have died could instead experience just a few days of illness. “Those are the types of shifts that we think would be accomplished by lower peak viral burden and faster clearance of the virus.”\n\nPredicting evolution\n\nNot all research focuses on inducing antibodies to the stalk. Ted Ross, a vaccinologist and global director of vaccine development at the Cleveland Clinic Florida Research and Innovation Center in Port St Lucie, uses computational modelling to find head epitopes to attack. “Human beings have, from natural infection, lots of stalk antibodies already, and we still get infected with influenza,” Ross says. “So I don’t know if the stalk approach is going to be the only mechanism for a universal approach.” The upshot, Ross, says, is that “if you combine head, stalk, other antigens and even T cells, you’re going to have a much broader vaccine than just focusing on one”.\n\nVaccinologist Florian Krammer is working on a flu vaccine that could protect against multiple strains of influenza.Credit: Mount Sinai Health System\n\nRoss and his team developed a technology to search for genetic sequences in flu viruses that are less likely to mutate over time, making them better targets for a broad vaccine. Since high-throughput sequencing machines became mainstream, around 2010, vast numbers of flu viruses collected by a global surveillance system have had their genomes sequenced, Ross says. That includes not only strains isolated from humans, but also other potential sources of flu infections, such as those from pigs and ducks.\n\nHe and his team developed the Computationally Optimized Broadly Reactive Antigen (COBRA) system5. COBRA searches those genomes for sequences that change very little across viruses. Machine-learning models simulate how those conserved sequences might change as a result of the evolutionary pressure of an immune response. Using historical data and those predictions, the scientists can then design a vaccine for the virus that they think might be coming, and test that. “We’re letting viral evolution tell us how to make our vaccine,” Ross says.\n\nTo test its method, the team used data only up to 2009 to design a vaccine. The researchers gave the vaccine to mice that had never been exposed to flu, and then exposed the mice to viral strains of both H1N1 and H3N2 from 2009 to 20196. In an encouraging result, the vaccine provided the mice with good levels of protection against these ‘future’ strains.\n\nIn a vastly different approach, Jonah Sacha, a molecular biologist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, is trying to enlist another part of the immune system — T cells. He is using a platform created at the university to develop vaccines for HIV (now in clinical trials) and tuberculosis.\n\nInstead of focusing on surface antigens, Sacha and his colleagues looked at internal structural proteins that build the shell of the virus. Those proteins are so critical to the structure of the virus that significant mutations would destroy it. “The internal proteins don’t change that much, because they can’t,” Sacha says.\n\nThey selected three: a matrix protein, M1; a nucleocapsid protein; and a viral polymerase, PB1. They then inserted those into a cytomegalovirus (CMV), which infects humans but does not cause illness. T cells in the body’s mucosal surfaces, such as the lining of the respiratory system, keep CMV in check. Sacha hoped that, if CMV carried flu proteins, it would train those T cells to attack the flu virus, too.\n\nHe and his team produced a vaccine based on the virus that caused the 1918 flu pandemic — recreated from samples found in frozen tissues from people who were infected — and injected it into macaques. He then exposed the macaques to the virulent H5N1 bird flu, a potential cause of the next pandemic. All six unvaccinated monkeys died within a week, but 6 of the 11 vaccinated animals survived7. In other words, a vaccine based on one of the oldest available flu viruses provided protection against a strain that had accumulated around a century’s worth of mutations.\n\nSacha’s hope is that these flu-resistant T cells will remain on guard for life, although even such a vaccine might not provide perfect protection. “I think that it will be a component of a successful universal influenza vaccine,” he says. “I really believe, when we have a universal influenza vaccine, it will engage both T cells and antibodies.”\n\nMany researchers think that the idea of a universal flu vaccine might be overselling the concept. “I hate that title,” Heaton says. “I think we’re making a promise that we can never fulfil, even before the research starts. If we made a vaccine that was ten times better than what we have, that would save millions of people a year. And this still wouldn’t be universal.”\n\nRoss says that a truly universal vaccine could be years away, if it’s even possible. “I would be happy with a vaccine that lasted three to five years before it had to be updated,” he says. “That would be a huge improvement. It would help vaccine manufacturers. It would reduce costs. It would lead to year-round production of the vaccine instead of seasonal production.”",

          "authors": "Ashish Jha",
          "abstract": "When most people think of influenza, they imagine a few days of fever, body aches and bed rest. Flu is often regarded as a threat to the very old, the very young or those with compromised immune systems. The rest of us are reassured we’ll recover quickly. After all, ‘it’s just the flu’.\n\nSeasonal influenza doesn’t appear in the top ten causes of death in the United States. During the 2023–24 flu season, there were an estimated 28,000 flu-related deaths. Why, then, should time and resources be spent combating a seasonal virus when chronic diseases — particularly cardiovascular disease, which claimed more than 919,000 lives in the United States in 2023 — are much more deadly?\n\nNature Spotlight: Influenza\n\nThe reason is that this seemingly vast difference in impact is misleading: infectious and chronic diseases are deeply interconnected. And the collective failure of the health community to understand that relationship has serious implications for patients, their families and the health systems that care for them.\n\nThe evidence is compelling. A study in 2018 found that the risk of a heart attack jumps sixfold in the week after a confirmed flu infection1. Another study, involving more than 80,000 adults hospitalized with influenza, found that nearly one in eight experienced an acute cardiovascular event2.\n\nThe connection between influenza and a host of cardiovascular conditions is not a surprise. Scientists have long known that the virus affects more than the respiratory tract. It triggers a powerful inflammatory response, sending the immune system into overdrive. This response can activate blood platelets, increasing the risk of blood-clot formation. Fever elevates heart rate and energy demands, and dehydration adds further strain. The result is a physiological storm that can tip vulnerable people — especially those with underlying cardiovascular disease — into crisis.\n\nCardiac connection\n\nI and many other clinicians care for a lot of people who have had heart attacks during the flu season. But we rarely ask what caused the heart attack during this acute event and, unless people show overt signs of infection, we typically don’t test for influenza. Similarly, when an older adult arrives at hospital with heart failure, or dies suddenly at home, few clinicians pause to consider whether a recent viral illness might have contributed to the event.\n\nWhen people have thought to look, the findings have been sobering. A 2023 study estimated that, worldwide, nearly 4% of heart-attack deaths among adults aged 50 and over can be attributed to influenza3. This means that strategies to prevent flu infections — including vaccination, hygiene practices and effective communication with the public — could prevent around 300,000 deaths globally.\n\nThat realization requires a fundamental shift in how we approach influenza — not as an annual nuisance, but as a real public-health priority.\n\nPublic-health messaging must evolve. Clinicians should explicitly highlight the cardiovascular consequences of influenza, particularly during winter, when both flu infections and heart attacks spike. For people with heart disease, the flu vaccine should be presented not merely as protection against a respiratory illness, but as a proven cardiovascular intervention to reduce heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThe vaccine solution",

          "abstract": "Illustration: David Parkins\nThe problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nIn December 2024, I finished my PhD in biomedical chemistry in Italy, and I now find myself in that all-too-familiar early-career crisis, struggling to work out what to do next.\n\nResearch is important to me as a way to contribute meaningfully to a better, healthier world. But I have other life goals, such as becoming financially stable and starting a family, that seem incompatible with the reality of academic life. The cost of living is rising everywhere, and early-career research jobs come with low pay and short contracts.\n\nTrying to transition out of academia brings its own frustrations. After years of dedication, I’m treated by those hiring in industry as if I have no real work experience. It feels like starting from zero again.\n\nIs this early-career crisis an inevitable part of life after a PhD? How do I navigate a career when my goals and values conflict? Does my passion for research have to be all-consuming? Do I have to choose between research and a reasonable work–life balance? — A melancholy chemist\n\nThe advice\n\nYou’re not alone. These are big questions, echoed by newly minted PhD graduates around the world. This is a notoriously challenging time in the career of any young scientist, and it doesn’t mean you’re failing if you’re struggling. Nature’s careers team sought advice from three researchers on how to resolve your problem.\n\nPeter Hanenberg, vice-rector for research and innovation at the Catholic University of Portugal in Lisbon, says: “The first step is to recognize that this crisis is something which comes with what it is to be a researcher. An academic career is, to a certain point, a matter of passion, which means it might not be just a job. But the balance should be healthy.”\n\nWhen she completed her neuroscience PhD at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain, last year, Maria del Mar Cajiao Manrique knew that she didn’t want to continue in academia, but she didn’t have a clear idea of the alternatives.\n\n“From the time we start university,” she says, “we are shown there’s only one path: bachelor, master, PhD, postdoc, and then more postdocs until you become a principal investigator. It becomes internalized. If someone doesn’t feel like they fit that one path, that’s when they start having this existential crisis: What is it that I’m good at? Have I wasted the past four years on this PhD?”\n\nCajiao Manrique took a three-month contract as a visiting researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine in New York City, then found a position as a medical writer in August this year. She says that going to talks at other research institutions and connecting with PhD holders who have been in similar situations has helped her to broaden her perspective and discover fresh possibilities.\n\nAn ‘agony aunt’ for working scientists\n\nLynn McAlpine, whose higher-education research at the University of Oxford, UK, focuses on PhD and post-PhD career trajectories, points out that research career paths are not as straightforward as they once were. “Now we see a shift to what we’re calling self-authored careers,” she says, “where people have to take more responsibility for figuring out what they want, what kinds of jobs there are, and find ways to integrate their life–career goals.”\n\nMcAlpine has investigated how researchers navigate their careers and personal lives after finishing their doctorates. She observed that personal life aims, such as the desire to live close to a partner, have children and achieve financial security, tend to have greater influence in shaping career paths in the long term than do professional aims — such as reaching for a prestigious job title or a dream research project.\n\n“There are myriad factors coming into play in the life journey of early-career researchers,” says McAlpine. Your priorities and your opportunities will be affected by variables such as location, age, international mobility and personal values.\n\nSometimes, she says, people seek academic careers, but realize that what they really love is the academic environment. “So maybe they find a job in academia — not as a professor, but working in a museum or university archives, or as a communications officer in a research centre.”\n\nOne PhD holder, interviewed as part of McAlpine’s research, wanted to relocate with her partner, who was also an academic, but she knew that it would be difficult for both of them to get posts in the same place. “When she got a postdoc in another country, they both moved there, and he took a professional position working in the university museums as a curator. There, he could apply his academic knowledge — until they moved again.”\n\nPerseverance\n\nMcAlpine points to perseverance as a crucial skill from a PhD programme that can be applied at the job-seeking stage. Getting a job is itself a job, she says. In her observations, whether they were looking for an industry job or an academic grant, “the people who were most successful just kept applying. They weren’t put off by not getting an answer or getting a no.” In other words, “it’s a race against your own frustration”, says Cajiao Manrique. After her PhD, she spent months applying for jobs. “I was sitting at my desk nine to five. I sent over 1,000 job applications.” She estimates that she received a response for only about one in every 50 that she sent.\n\nThen, Cajiao Manrique went on LinkedIn and started finding communities of PhD graduates who were dealing with the same issues. Through these connections, she learned that her CV was probably being discarded by AI tools.

You sure you’re up for it?” The bartender spoke in a low voice, locking eyes with two of Spooky’s. Such a typical human habit — this compulsive need to make eye contact. It would have been far more practical to focus on the tentacles he used to communicate rather than struggling to pick which eye to look at.\n\n“Alright, alright, no need for the whole colour show — you really don’t look good in black. A fifth shot it is!” The bartender backpedalled quickly as Spooky’s displeasure became obvious. Quadrinocularis were usually a quiet, docile species, more accustomed to basking in the sun for hours than arguing. Spooky, however, had cultivated a reputation for being irascible. When he got annoyed enough to change colour, most knew to keep their distance.\n\nSoon, a small glass of clear liquid was placed before him. The bartender struck a match, and blue flames licked the surface. Spooky flared his pores, greedily absorbing the rising fumes. His entire body shivered in pleasure. Immersed in the heady haze of Smokey Blast, he could almost believe he was back in his reef — rooted, at peace, at home.\n\nLife had been simple then. Days spent weaving colour-shows with his brethren, not for profit or spectacle but simply for the joy of creating something beautiful. Occasionally, a predator would stir things up, but the Quadrinocularis’ eyes were excellent at spotting danger. More importantly, life had been static. It was so hard to remember what the reef had been like, now that he had been gone for so long. Only after a few Smokey Blasts could he recall the feeling of the warm currents flowing around him, the hum of his brethren blending into a harmony that resonated deep in his bones. His reef had been small — 20, maybe 30, Quadrinocularis — but their synchronization had been unmatched. Even in the dead of night, there was always a soft pulse of colour, a quiet song of belonging. Then the humans came — driven by greed, curiosity, and their ceaseless need for movement and expansion — and everything fell apart. His homeworld, once serene, was now forever tainted by activity. His reef had lasted longer than most. It wasn’t one of the great northern reefs, where thousands of Quadrinocularis moved as one, their collective shimmer making the sea itself vibrate with colour. There, the ocean was alive with a never-ending symphony. But humans needed space for their buildings, their entertainment, their noise. Like many of his friends, Spooky had left to chase the Universe’s vaunted beauty — only to learn that beauty was a relative concept in the endless expanse of space.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“Sa’amm pretty, right?

And last week — last week, you know what they tol’ me? They said I needed a better skin care rou’ine! Smooth skin this, smooth skin that! Some of us like bein’ a liiittle slimy! Discrimination, man, it’s all discrimination!” Spooky ranted.\n\nThe bartender was fluent in Quadrinocularis tentacle language, but even he struggled to parse the avalanche of signs the wobbly appendages were throwing at him all at once.\n\n“Yes, mate, it’s all discrimination,” the bartender nodded sagely. “You’ll get another chance. I’m sure there’s a brand out there looking for a pretty little thing like you.”\n\n“All I jus’ wanted was to stay in one place ’n’ look all pretty, ya know? Ain’t that what life’s ’bout? I figured humans were all nuts, runnin’ ’round, never just sittin’ down to soak up the sun for a year or two, ya feel me? Then they come up with this fancy model gig, ’nd I’m like, ‘Hey, that’s perfect for a Quadrinocularis like me!’ Thought I could build my own lil’ reef that way, ya know?”\n\nHis agitation reached a peak, even his rear tentacles were shaking wildly, turning his signs into an incomprehensible blur. His head began to vibrate, producing a resonant buzz.\n\nThe bartender sighed, humming noncommittally as he focused on mixing drinks for another customer. When Spooky got like this — his words blurring into song — there was no point in responding anymore.",

The map, called GlobalBuildingAtlas, combines satellite imagery and machine learning to generate 3D models for 97% of buildings on Earth.\n\nThe data set, published in the open-access journal Earth System Science Data on 1 December1, covers 2.75 billion buildings, each mapped with footprints and heights at a spatial resolution of 3 metres by 3 metres.\n\nThe 3D map opens new possibilities for disaster risk assessment, climate modelling and urban planning, according to study co-author Xiaoxiang Zhu, an Earth observation data scientist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany. It could also help to improve how researchers monitor United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals for cities and communities, Zhu adds.\n\nBillions of buildings\n\nConventionally, creating detailed 3D maps at a global scale has been difficult, say Zhu, because it usually requires either laser scanning or high‑resolution stereo imagery. The team’s solution was to combine deep learning with laser-scanning techniques to predict building heights. The tool was trained on reference data obtained using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) from 168 cities, mostly in Europe, North America and Oceania.\n\nThe researchers created the 3D maps from approximately 800,000 satellite scenes captured in 2019, using the deep-learning tool to predict building heights, volumes and areas.\n\nThe study found that Asia accounts for nearly half of all mapped buildings in the world — approximately 1.22 billion structures. Asia also dominates the total building volume at 1.27 trillion cubic metres, reflecting rapid urbanization and dense metropolitan clusters in China, India and southeast Asia.\n\nAfrica has the second largest number of buildings, at 540 million, but their combined volume is only 117 billion cubic metres, underscoring the prevalence of small, low-rise structures.\n\nCity-scale analyses illustrate how building volume correlates with population density and economic development. In Europe, Finland has six times more building volume per capita than does Greece. The study also highlighted that Niger’s per-capita building volume is 27 times below the world average.\n\nThese patterns suggest that conventional 2D measures of urban growth, such as built-up areas, might obscure crucial differences between infrastructure and living conditions.\n\nAn aerial model of structures in the Chinese city of Changsha.Credit: Zhu et al./ESSD, (Basemap ©CARTO and ©OpenStreetMap contributors)\nDisaster risk assessment\n\nDorina Pojani, an urban planning researcher at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, says that the data set would be extremely valuable for her research, because she has previously relied on static, 2D data.",

          "abstract": "Why Brains Need Friends\n\nBen Rein\n\nBridge Street (2024)\n\nHave you ever chosen between answering a friend’s phone call and finishing some work? This relatable scenario opens Why Brains Need Friends by neuroscientist Ben Rein. Social connection feels good and there is clear evidence that it lowers risks of dementia, cognitive decline, heart failure, diabetes, depression and stroke. Yet, few people prioritize it in the way they do exercise, sleep and nutrition.\n\nRein notes that various factors, including political polarization, remote work and online habits, are dividing people. And an accumulation of small decisions, such as choosing self-checkouts over small but real social contact in shops, could lead to increased risks of social isolation in older people.\n\nIt’s true that socializing can feel awkward. Some brains want more interaction than others; some encounters are more pleasant than others. Rein recommends recognizing, and meeting, your own social needs — like a ‘social diet’.\n\nThe good news is that other people like us more than we think they do, studies have shown. We can underestimate how interested others will be in us and how much a brief chat can lift our mood.\n\nRein encourages readers to not worry about people’s approval. And to think about what each declined invitation might cost both parties over time. So, when a friend calls, maybe answer? — Kelly-Ann Allen\n\nSlowing the Sun\n\nNadine Hura\n\nBridget Williams (2025)\n\nIn Slowing the Sun, writer and poet Nadine Hura (of Ngāti Hine, Ngāpuhi and Pākehā descent) brings us a refreshing perspective on climate change. Western knowledge tends to struggle to reach communities outside academia; she offers Indigenous storytelling as a solution. Through her collection of essays, interspersed with powerful poetry, we meet climate activists, politicians and Indigenous leaders — and learn about her experiences of grief.\n\nRecounting her father’s role in flattening mountains in Auckland, New Zealand, Hura highlights the juxtaposition of Indigenous people’s involvement in extractive industries, and reminds us how the poorest people bear the brunt of climate change in a system that they have no control over.\n\nHura reveals the gulf between how Western scientists discuss climate change, focusing on risks and vulnerabilities, and the determination of Indigenous communities to act — despite their lack of resources and power.\n\nIt’s easy to be overwhelmed by the climate crisis and disengage from it. But Hura reminds readers that “anything you do to benefit the land benefits you, often immediately. The environment is the healer, not the other way around”. I have never read a book like this before — deeply personal, yet relevant to everyone. Even the most seasoned climate scientist will learn a lot. — Tara McAllister\n\nThinking Like an Economist\n\nElizabeth Popp Berman\n\nPrinceton Univ. Press (2022)\n\nIt can seem hard to disagree with the maxim of efficiency. But observing the actions of the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) earlier this year — including the cuts it made to research — raised an important question. Is efficiency everything? A government is not a private company; organizing it around efficiency can detract from what it should be. Worryingly so.\n\nSociologist Elizabeth Popp Berman’s book, Thinking Like an Economist, helped me to make sense of what can be lost in favour of efficiency. Berman shows how, since the 1960s, US governments have strived for efficiency, sometimes over considerations of equity and democracy. The US Clean Air Act, for instance, was framed initially around asserting the public value of clean air by stigmatizing polluters and pushing industry to innovate. But over time, pollution became something to be priced, shifting efforts away from negotiating acceptable levels of pollution and towards markets.\n\nThis book is essential reading for those who want to understand how a focus on efficiency can help to centralize power and authority. Policies affect societal concerns that cannot be monetized. They are shaped through political bargains, by treading the line between redistribution and growth, environmental protection and business interests — and require messy democratic negotiation not algorithms. Such bargaining might not always deliver ‘value for money’ — but it remains essential for preserving freedoms. — Yamini Aiyar\n\nThese Letters End in Tears\n\nMusih Tedji Xaviere\n\nCatapult (2024)\n\nIn These Letters End in Tears, novelist Musih Tedji Xaviere tells a story about two young women in love in Cameroon — a love that provides refuge, self-acceptance and joy in a country where being gay is punishable by law. But the society fights back violently and devastatingly, through both individuals and institutions. The two women are incarcerated, for example. When my teary eyes left the last line of the final chapter, I became laser-focused on how to dismantle systems with beliefs, norms and laws that criminalize some experiences and existences.\n\nAs a medical sociologist, a central aspect of my work is to help people and institutions to understand how our societies can cause harm to some of us while allowing others to thrive. I identify how to eliminate oppression and promote well-being for all. For me, as a Cameroonian lesbian living in the United States, this book blurs the lines, in positive ways, between reality and fiction and between my professional responsibilities and my life’s purpose.\n\nReaders will question the very core of education, media, religion, gender, family life, class, language, politics and law — in Cameroon and beyond. Tragedy is an explicit focus of this poignant book, but Xaviere’s award-winning fiction also suggests actions of resistance that everyone can take against the erasure that is perpetuated in many societies, to varying extent: defiance, community-building, storytelling and being present. — Sirry Alang\n\nThe Reason I Jump\n\nNaoki Higashida\n\nSceptre (2013)\n\nAs a neuroscientist studying sensory input and behaviour, I seek to understand how brains construct perception and action. The Reason I Jump remains the most illuminating and hopeful book I have read. First published in 2007, its relevance has only increased as diagnoses of and research on autism spectrum disorder have expanded. Yet, the rich forms of communication, social connection and empathy that Naoki Higashida describes remain overlooked.\n\nHigashida, who mainly communicates non-verbally, wrote this candid book using a Japanese hiragana alphabet grid when he was just 13 years old. Unlike most autobiographies written by adults, the book offers an unfiltered account of how his mind perceives, feels and attempts to act, before such experiences can be ‘sorted’ cognitively.\n\nAutism is often portrayed as a condition of deficits: impaired communication, reduced empathy and inflexible behaviour. Higashida’s reflections challenge this idea with clarity and force. He describes his intense sensory world, the effort required to initiate even simple actions and the confusion that his own body can cause him.\n\nFor me, this book is galvanizing. In an era when discussions about autism often focus on pathology and clinical prediction rather than lived experience, it reminds me that communication extends far beyond speech — and that it can take forms that we have yet to fully understand. — Misa Shimuta\n\nIntertwined\n\nRebecca Kormos\n\nNew Press (2024)\n\nAs part of her work documenting the relationship between people and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), wildlife biologist and conservationist Rebecca Kormos interviewed women — and wondered why she hadn’t previously sought their voices. The honesty and sincerity of this question, which kicks off her book about women involved in conservation and environmental activism, made me keep reading.\n\nIntertwined showcases a vast sisterhood from which we can draw wisdom, courage and hope. For example, fisheries and wildlife biologist Midori Nicolson from Gwayi, Kingcome Inlet, a small village in Canada, reflects on the origin story of her people, the Dzawada’enuxw First Nation, whose history and cultural practices were altered by patriarchy and colonization. Reflecting on my own Yucatec Maya heritage, this prompted me to question which of our ancestral Indigenous stories have also been neglected. The resilience and strength of Zimbabwe’s Akashinga Rangers, all of whom are women, was so inspirational that I hope it will help to guide the transformation of the ranger team of the Belize Maya Forest Trust, which I lead.\n\nIntertwined examines the role of everyone — not just women — in solving the planetary polycrisis. The scientific data and collective wisdom of the stories in the book show that good outcomes for gender equality and women’s rights will benefit all of humanity and nature. — Elma Kay\n\nThe Coming Wave\n\nMustafa Suleyman & Michael Bhaskar\n\nCrown (2023)\n\nTechnologies such as artificial intelligence and synthetic biology are developing at a pace that outstrips that of the institutions designed to govern them. In The Coming Wave, Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive of Microsoft AI, explores this “containment problem” with writer Michael Bhaskar: keeping control over systems that evolve faster than the associated political, social and ethical frameworks.\n\nRather than immersing readers in technical minutiae, the book captures the tension between technology’s extraordinary potential and the responsibility that comes with shaping its impacts. Suleyman’s analysis shows that the coming decades will be defined not just by the deployment of innovative technologies, but also by how they are used (governance and collective judgement).\n\nThe Coming Wave balances urgency and optimism well. Suleyman is clear about the risks of disruption by technologies that cannot be paused or reversed. Yet, he frames these challenges as an invitation to act.\n\nAs a researcher at the intersection of AI and spatial intelligence, I was struck by the book’s foresight. It offers younger generations the chance to become architects rather than victims of technological change and to shape systems that are resilient, equitable and aligned with human values. It is a call to ethical engagement with powerful technologies. — Mohamed Ibrahim\n\nNaturalistas\n\nLaura de Cabo et al.\n\nEl Ateneo (2024)\n\nInspiration can be close by — if you know where to look. Women in the research team of Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales “Bernardino Rivadavia” in Buenos Aires explored the work and lives of 16 of their predecessors: women who worked at the museum as illustrators and scientists, including botanists, arachnologists and marine biologists, over the past century. Despite contributing to their fields and the museum, these pioneers have long been overlooked.\n\nThis beautifully illustrated book, written in Spanish, conveys the thorough detective work its authors did. They combed through documents, newspapers and official records and contacted the researchers’ relatives. The stories were harder to piece together than they should have been.",

There are many reasons for the changes, but at least some researchers are curbing their travel to the United States because of policies put in place by the administration of US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe obstacles have galvanized some meeting organizers to hatch alternative plans to bring the international research community together.\n\nMeet the early-career scientists planning to leave the United States\n\nEarlier this month, for instance, the artificial-intelligence conference NeurIPS hosted not only its main meeting in San Diego, California, but also its first-ever alternative location, in Mexico City, with the goal of alleviating travel challenges. Meanwhile, a group of AI researchers in Europe organized an independent spin-off conference, dubbed EurIPS, in Copenhagen.\n\n“Our main focus was on giving a home to people who felt intellectually homeless this year,” says Søren Hauberg, a machine-learning and computer-vision researcher at the Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby who helped to organize EurIPS.\n\nSmaller crowds\n\nNature asked the organizers of large conferences that were scheduled to take place in US cities in the second half of 2025 or the first quarter of 2026 for details of their attendance trends. Of the six that responded, three had seen or were expecting a drop in attendance compared with the previous year.\n\nIn some cases, the observed decrease was slight, and the reasons were complex. For instance, attendance at the Society for Neuroscience’s annual meeting last month was down 6%, from 22,359 people in 2024 to 21,093 this year. The number of countries those attendees represented also fell, from 88 in 2024 to 73 in 2025. Organizers of the conference, one of the biggest in the United States, say that attendance has fluctuated since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, making it difficult to pinpoint the effect Trump’s policies have had.\n\nOrganizers of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference, another of the nation’s largest meetings, say that they also are seeing a drop in numbers at the 2025 meeting, which began on Monday, compared with 2024. More than 30,000 people attended last year’s AGU conference; more than 20,000 were registered for this year’s as of Monday, conference organizers say. The lighter attendance was notable in the poster and exhibit halls, which were slightly less jam-packed than usual.\n\nBarriers to entry\n\nScientists hoping to travel to the United States in 2025 faced a raft of new restrictions. As part of Trump’s focus on immigration and visa enforcement, border officials have tightened up scrutiny of incoming travellers, turning some away at airports and other entry points. In June, Trump’s administration banned or limited entry for citizens of 19 countries, including Iran and Venezuela, citing national-security concerns. And on 9 December, the administration proposed requiring visitors from dozens of countries to provide their social media posts for the past five years before entering the United States.\n\nOther policies have also had an impact on scientists’ willingness or ability to attend US meetings. This week’s Pacifichem meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, which around 11,000 people have registered to attend, has seen significantly fewer attendees than usual from Canada, says meeting chair Laurel Schafer, a chemist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. That aligns, she says, with overall drops in tourism from Canada to the United States after Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian goods and said he would make it “the 51st state”.\n\nWhere is the best place to hold a scientific conference right now?\n\nFor Tanja Junkers, a chemist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, the deciding factor on attending Pacifichem was Trump’s attacks on trans and non-binary people; on his first day in office he issued an executive order declaring that there are “two sexes, male and female” and that the government will “enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality”. “Being of a gender-diverse background, I do not feel I am able to safely travel to the US, even to a more liberal state such as Hawaii,” Junkers says. She helped to arrange a symposium at the meeting from a distance, but did not participate in it, even remotely.",

          "abstract": "Survey results suggest that peer reviewers are increasingly turning to AI.Credit: Panther Media Global/Alamy\n\nMore than 50% of researchers have used artificial intelligence while peer reviewing manuscripts, according to a survey of some 1,600 academics across 111 countries by the publishing company Frontiers.\n\nNearly one-quarter of respondents said that they had increased their use of AI for peer review over the past year. The findings, posted on 11 December by the publisher, which is based in Lausanne, Switzerland, confirm what many researchers have long suspected, given the ubiquity of tools powered by large-language models such as ChatGPT.\n\n“It’s good to confront the reality that people are using AI in peer-review tasks,” says Elena Vicario, Frontiers’ director of research integrity. But the poll suggests that researchers are using AI in peer review “in contrast with a lot of external recommendations of not uploading manuscripts to third-party tools”, she adds.\n\nSource: Unlocking AI’s untapped potential, Frontiers\n\nSome publishers, including Frontiers, allow limited use of AI in peer review, but require reviewers to disclose it. Like most other publishers, Frontiers forbids reviewers from uploading unpublished manuscripts to chatbot websites because of concerns about confidentiality, sensitive data and compromising authors’ intellectual property.\n\nThe survey report calls on publishers to respond to the growing use of AI across scientific publishing and implement policies that are better suited to the ‘new reality’. Frontiers itself has launched an in-house AI platform for peer reviewers across all of its journals. “AI should be used in peer review responsibly, with very clear guides, with human accountability and with the right training,” says Vicario.\n\n“We agree that publishers can and should proactively and robustly communicate best practices, particularly disclosure requirements that reinforce transparency to support responsible AI use,” says a spokesperson for the publisher Wiley, which is based in Hoboken, New Jersey. In a similar survey published earlier this year, Wiley found that “researchers have relatively low interest and confidence in AI use cases for peer review,” they add. “We are not seeing anything in our portfolio that contradicts this.”\n\nChecking, searching and summarizing\n\nThe Frontiers’ survey found that, among the respondents who use AI in peer review, 59% use it to help write their peer-review reports. Twenty-nine per cent said they use it to summarize the manuscript, identify gaps or check references. And 28% use AI to flag potential signs of misconduct, such as plagiarism and image duplication (see ‘AI assistance’).\n\nMohammad Hosseini, who studies research ethics and integrity at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois, says the survey is “a good attempt to gauge the acceptability of the use of AI in peer review and the prevalence of its use in different contexts”.\n\nAI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried\n\nSome researchers are running their own tests to determine how well AI models support peer review. Last month, engineering scientist Mim Rahimi at the University of Houston in Texas designed an experiment to test whether the large language model (LLM) GPT-5 could review a Nature Communications paper1 he co-authored.\n\nHe used four different set-ups, from entering basic prompts asking the LLM to review the paper without additional context to providing it with research articles from the literature to help it to evaluate his paper’s novelty and rigour. Rahimi then compared the AI-generated output with the actual peer-review reports that he had received from the journal, and discussed his findings in a YouTube video.\n\nHis experiment showed that GPT-5 could mimic the structure of a peer-review report and use polished language, but that it failed to produce constructive feedback and made factual errors. Even advanced prompts did not improve the AI’s performance — in fact, the most complex set-up generated the weakest peer review. Another study found that AI-generated reviews of 20 manuscripts tended to match human ones but fell short on providing detailed critique.",

          "abstract": "China produces the largest share of high-quality research for 66 technologies.Credit: Liu Guoxing/VCG via Getty\n\nChina is leading research in nearly 90% of the crucial technologies that “significantly enhance, or pose risks to, a country’s national interests”, according to a technology tracker run by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) — an independent think tank.\n\nThe ASPI’s Critical Technology Tracker evaluated high-quality research on 74 current and emerging technologies this year, up from the 64 technologies it analysed last year. China is ranked number one for research on 66 of the technologies, including nuclear energy, synthetic biology and small satellites, and the United States topped the remaining 8, including quantum computing and geoengineering.\n\nThe results reflect a drastic reversal. At the beginning of this century, the United States led more than 90% of the assessed technologies, whereas China led less than 5% of them, according to the 2024 edition of the tracker.\n\n“China has made incredible progress on science and technology that is reflected in research and development, as well as in publications,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, who researches China’s industrial policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a non-profit research organization based in Washington DC.\n\nMazzocco says the general trend identified by the ASPI is not a surprise, but it is “remarkable” to see that China is so dominant and advanced in so many fields compared with the United States.\n\nThis might have something to do with the types of technology that are tracked, says Wang Yanbo, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong. The country is more likely to be a research leader in new technologies, where it has focused its efforts, than in established fields, such as semiconductor chips, where other countries lead, he notes.\n\nTracking high-impact research\n\nThe ASPI team based its analysis on a database that contains more than nine million publications from all around the world. It ranked nations in each technology by identifying the top 10% of the most-cited papers produced by researchers in a country over a five-year period, between 2020 and 2024, and calculated that country’s global share.\n\nOne noteworthy finding is that China is outpacing the United States in cloud and edge computing, according to David Lin, a national security and technology strategist at the Special Competitive Studies Project, a non-profit organization based in Arlington, Virginia. Cloud computing enables artificial intelligence companies to train models and process data without the need for physical infrastructure, whereas edge computing processes data locally. China’s research intensity in these fields “probably reflects the urgency with which Beijing is moving AI from the lab into deployment”, Lin says.\n\nThe analysis should not be interpreted as “a collapse of American power”, says Steven Hai, a political economist focusing on technology innovation at Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University in Suzhou, China. In general, the United States is still an important player globally in these technologies, Hai says.\n\nJenny Wong-Leung, a data scientist at ASPI who participated in the study, warns that the findings show democratic nations risk losing “hard-won, long-term advantages in cutting-edge science and research” in a range of essential sectors, which is crucial for the development and advancement of the world’s most important technologies.",

          "title": "AI is transforming the economy — understanding its impact requires both data and imagination",
          "authors": "Daniel Björkegren",
          "abstract": "How will artificial intelligence reshape the global economy? Some economists predict only a small boost — around a 0.9% increase in gross domestic product over the next ten years1. Others foresee a revolution that might add between US$17 trillion and $26 trillion to annual global economic output and automate up to half of today’s jobs by 20452. But even before the full impacts materialize, beliefs about our AI future affect the economy today — steering young people’s career choices, guiding government policy and driving vast investment flows into semiconductors and other components of data centres.\n\nWhy evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now\n\nGiven the high stakes, many researchers and policymakers are increasingly attempting to precisely quantify the causal impact of AI through natural experiments and randomized controlled trials. In such studies, one group gains access to an AI tool while another continues under normal conditions; other factors are held fixed. Researchers can then analyse outcomes such as productivity, satisfaction and learning.\n\nYet, when applied to AI, this type of evidence faces two challenges. First, by the time they are published, causal estimates of AI’s effects can be outdated. For instance, one study found that call-centre workers handled queries 15% faster when using 2020 AI tools3. Another showed that software developers with access to coding assistants in 2022–23 completed 26% more tasks than did those without such tools4. But AI capabilities are advancing at an astounding pace. For example, since ChatGPT’s release in 2022, AI tools can now correctly handle three times as many simulated customer-support chats on their own as they could before5. The better, cheaper AI of tomorrow will produce different economic effects.\n\nSecond, carefully controlled studies do not capture the wider ripple effects that accompany AI adoption. For example, the studies involving call-centre workers3 and software developers4 found that when organizational structure remained fixed, the less-experienced workers benefited most from AI assistance. But in the real world, managers might respond by reorganizing work or even replacing some of the less-experienced workers with AI systems. If they do, the effect on those individuals could be the opposite of that estimated in controlled studies. Indeed, payroll data suggest that employment of younger workers has declined since 2022, particularly in occupations that include tasks that AI excels at, such as customer service and software development6. However, researchers are still trying to understand how much of the pattern is attributable to AI technology.\n\nCarefully controlled studies are like flashing a bright, narrow spotlight: they are only part of the illumination needed to understand how society is adapting to AI. With so much still unknown about its broader economic and social effects, popular debate often slips into speculative, science-fiction narratives of a world dominated by machine intelligence.\n\nSocial science could help to navigate these uncertainties, but it would require both imagination and grounding. Here, I describe three complementary approaches that can guide researchers working in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nSocial science fiction\n\nOne approach is to create what economist Jean Tirole calls social science fiction7 — speculation about the future that remains rooted in fundamental economic principles and behavioural theories. Rather than relying on imagination alone, this kind of analysis uses models to explore how technologies might interact with market forces.\n\nFor example, in 2019, researchers modelled how self-driving cars might reshape cities and found that the vehicles could make traffic worse8. Because passengers in self-driving cars can relax, read or watch videos, the personal cost of time spent in traffic falls. But as more people choose to travel by car, they impose greater congestion on others. Whether that leads to inefficiency will depend on whether governments implement policies such as congestion pricing to correct the ‘externality’.\n\nCan AI help beat poverty? Researchers test ways to aid the poorest people\n\nAnother illustration of imaginative, yet grounded, social science comes from research on how market forces might limit AI’s disruptive potential. Studies9,10 suggest that, as automation boosts productivity in some tasks, other activities that cannot easily be automated — such as creative direction or vetting final outputs — will grow in relative value. That might raise demand for labour, and therefore wages, in such jobs. These opportunities could cushion some of the disruptive effects of automation. But it might also deepen inequalities between people who thrive in these roles and those who do not.\n\nMore thought experiments like these can help policymakers to imagine how the economy might shift in a more disciplined manner. Such experiments can identify which indicators to monitor and provide a head start on planning the policies that might be needed. Other open problems include understanding the incentives to create knowledge for AI systems, and how innovation and economic growth might be affected if AI labs remain competitive with each other, or if one pulls ahead as a clear market leader.\n\nForward-looking data\n\nAs well as theory, policymakers will also need evidence to understand how the economy will change. Different types of information need to combine to form a more complete picture.\n\nOne common approach to assessing AI capabilities is benchmarking — testing the systems on standardized tasks, much as exams do. Benchmarks can assess an AI system’s ability to solve mathematics problems, respond to customer-support requests or diagnose medical conditions. However, benchmark scores often diverge from performance in real-world settings, where tasks are noisier, more complex and context-dependent. For example, a medical AI system might perform well on textbook-style clinical questions, but could misinterpret communications from patients if they omit key details. More research is needed to design benchmarks that better capture real-world performance.\n\nIf AI is anywhere near as transformative as many expect, its effects will show up in numerous indicators that can be monitored in real time, such as tracking which tasks people use AI for. These usage data show, for instance, that AI chatbots are often used for software development, suggesting that this sector might feel the earliest effects of AI adoption11,12. Other indicators include employment, job openings and whether firms that integrate AI earn higher profits and expand. However, there will be questions that such descriptive indicators alone cannot answer. For that reason, researchers might still attempt to measure the causal impact of AI: that is, whether AI causes improvements, rather than merely being adopted by high performers who also happen to be more willing to try new technologies.\n\nAI can supercharge inequality — unless the public learns to control it\n\nEstimating AI’s causal effects is difficult because the technology is evolving and organizations are adapting. But this challenge is not unique to AI. Similar issues arise when evaluating how any pilot programme — whether in business, education or public health — will perform once it is expanded. When scaled up, programmes often encounter fresh constraints or trigger wider economic fallouts. Economists have developed methods to anticipate these scaling effects when designing experiments, such as replicating the conditions of the eventual implementer — for example, a government agency — rather than those of the more agile, well-resourced organizations that typically run pilots13–15. Researchers studying AI can similarly attempt to anticipate future changes when designing experiments.\n\nOne important parameter is the cost of running AI models, which has been falling. Researchers can model how cost declines might affect the viability of different applications. For example, one study16 examined AI usage by teachers in Sierra Leone who pay for Internet access by the megabyte. In early 2022, querying an AI chatbot was 12 times more expensive than loading a standard web page; by 2025, thanks to falling compute costs and the bandwidth efficiency of AI, using the technology had become 98% cheaper than accessing a web page. This cost advantage suggests that AI might expand access to information in low-resource settings where the Internet is expensive.\n\nThe capabilities of AI are another crucial determinant of its impact. It is hard to predict how these will evolve, but researchers can try to anticipate how humans might respond to more-powerful systems. Even as technology advances, human behaviour tends to follow stable patterns — in terms of how people develop trust, how they respond to incentives and how they adapt to automation.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Part of the IBM Quantum System Two computer.Credit: Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty\n\nClaims of leaps in quantum computing are made almost daily, but progress is hard to judge when each research group uses its own mixture of hardware, algorithms and evaluation metrics, making it near impossible to compare systems. Now, researchers are trying to make it easier to chart the performance of quantum machines.\n\nAs part of an ongoing effort, a consortium of UK researchers has created a suite of metrics that they say is a holistic way to measure the performance of quantum computers. They have published the work alongside a library of open-source software called QCMet1. Separately, a group including tech giant IBM and Helsinki-based quantum-software company Algorithmiq launched the Quantum Advantage Tracker last month as a way to compare experiments that purport to show ‘quantum advantage’ — that is, an efficiency or accuracy better than that of a classical machine.\n\n“People ask, ‘When is quantum computing going to be useful?’ I think it’s a little bit of a farcical question to answer without some data. And I think having data-driven answers is exactly what initiatives like this are pushing for,” says James Whitfield, a quantum physicist at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.\n\nMany possible metrics\n\nClassical computers encode information in bits that can be either 1 or 0. Quantum computers are instead based on quantum bits, or ‘qubits’, using any system — such as light or tiny superconducting loops — that can be put into a state of being both 1 and 0 at once. Physicists make qubits interact in ways that they hope will allow them to perform certain kinds of calculation much faster than would otherwise be possible. Some groups have created quantum computers that contain more than 1,000 qubits. But maintaining ever-larger systems while operating the computer is challenging.\n\nQuantum computers: what are they good for?\n\nWhen publicizing their results, quantum-computing companies often highlight the number of qubits in their machine as an indication of how advanced it is. But this doesn’t tell the full story: other metrics are often more relevant, such as error rates and how many qubits can be connected or harnessed in each calculation. And it is not always clear how firms calculate the figures they report. The QCMet project — led by researchers at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Teddington, UK — has built a list of metrics and algorithms to capture the performance and capabilities of all kinds of quantum computer, as well as publishing software to help standardize how each measurement is performed.\n\n“You shouldn’t just use one [metric] to tell you which is ‘better’ — you need to have the larger picture,” says Abhishek Agarwal, a quantum physicist at the NPL, who is part of the project. One often-ignored factor is stability, he says. In some systems, “if you run something now, versus even two minutes later, you can get quite different results”.\n\nUsing a range of metrics could help to harmonize what types of result researchers report, improving comparisons between quantum computers, as well as interoperability, says Whitfield. Each type of qubit has its own strengths, and sometimes companies report only the metrics that suit them. “It’s almost like they don’t want you to compare across devices,” Whitfield says.\n\nScrutinizing quantum advantage\n\nThe Quantum Advantage Tracker aims to help compare quantum machines by gauging how well quantum computers perform at particular applications, compared with classical computers. Claims of quantum advantage — often for little-known and very specific applications — are usually quickly overturned once external researchers improve the performance of classical methods. The tracker could help to monitor these ever-moving goalposts, says Whitfield.",

One way to enhance the effectiveness of endocrine therapy and delay the emergence of resistance is through periodic fasting, when, under clinical supervision, people restrict their eating and consume few or no calories for time spans of hours to days on a regular cycle.

          "authors": "Charles Schmidt",
          "abstract": "Fertilized chicken eggs are used to manufacture flu vaccines. Credit: Jason Alden/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nDuring the summer of 2023, fur farms in Finland that raise mink, foxes and raccoon dogs were hit by an outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza. Nearly half a million animals were culled during the outbreak, and Finnish health officials were on high alert. “We worried that under circumstances where many animals are confined in small places, the pathogen might rearrange genetically into a new pandemic virus,” says Hanna Nohynek, a vaccinologist and chief physician at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki.\n\nFinnish authorities responded by offering to vaccinate groups at high risk of H5N1 exposure, including fur-farm workers, laboratory technicians and veterinarians — the first and only country to do so.\n\nNature Spotlight: Influenza\n\nThis was a precautionary measure: although H5N1 is spreading among birds and other animals all over the world, human cases are still rare. But this state of affairs could change. An H5N1 pandemic “might be the big one that many of us have worried about”, says Ashish Jha, a physician and dean of public health at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nThe bird-flu shot used in Finland was developed by CSL Seqirus in Holly Springs, North Carolina — one of a handful of companies developing vaccines against H5N1. Amassing a global arsenal of vaccines for the virus is a tricky proposition. Like most other influenza vaccines, the shots are manufactured in chicken eggs or cell lines. New batches take up to six months to produce, which is a long wait if a pandemic starts to rage.\n\nAnd there is no guarantee that H5N1 will ever be a deadly threat. By the time Finland implemented its vaccine programme, having waited until the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Amsterdam licensed the Seqirus shot in July 2024, the outbreak in its fur industry had ended without a single human infection. “You don’t want to stockpile millions of vaccine doses that you may never need,” says Marco Cavaleri, head of the EMA’s Office of Biological Health Threats and Vaccine Strategy.\n\nBird flu in brief\n\nThere are four basic types of influenza virus: A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B both cause seasonal flu in people, but only the A type has a history of causing human pandemics. The virus is further broken out into subtypes based on two surface proteins. One of the proteins, haemagglutinin, binds to receptors on host cells and has 18 subtypes (H1–18). The other protein, neuraminidase, has roles in the spread of the virus and has 11 N subtypes.\n\nInfluenza A viruses circulate in various animal species. And when the virus jumps from birds to humans, the consequences can be deadly. H7N9 bird flu, which emerged in China in 2013 and has so far infected nearly 1,600 people, has a fatality rate in humans of around 40%. Nearly 1,000 people have been infected with H5N1 since 2003, mostly through direct contact with infected animals. Roughly half of the people affected died. Human-to-human bird flu transmission has been documented only in rare instances involving prolonged exposure to a seriously ill person.\n\nThe current dominant form of H5N1 — the 2.3.4.4b clade — became widespread after 2018. It has infected a greater variety of birds and mammals than any other known avian flu virus, “which is why it’s so alarming”, says Scott Hensley, a microbiologist who specializes in influenza at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. But the virus doesn’t easily infect people. Only 70 cases of H5N1 influenza, all of them in cattle and poultry workers, have been reported in the United States, as of July 2025.\n\nMost of the infections with this clade have produced mild illness akin to the common cold. The one person who died was over 65 and had underlying health problems. Why the 2.3.4.4b clade isn’t as lethal as its predecessors isn’t clear. “Cross-reactive immunity from prior H1N1 [seasonal flu] infections might play a role, and the route of transmission may also have had an effect,” says Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. Still, even mortality of one person in 70 “does not bode well for how H5N1 could affect the whole population”, Gronvall adds.\n\nCurrently, H5N1 doesn’t bind well with cell receptors in the upper airway of people. But that could change. In 2024, scientists reported1 that a single mutation in the viral genome could enable H5N1 to readily attach to human lung cells. If the virus were able to replicate efficiently in the lung, it would transmit through the air, potentially spawning a large outbreak.\n\nPaul Offit, a paediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, describes H5N1 as an unrealized threat that needs monitoring. The good news, he says, is that even after almost 30 years, the bird virus still doesn’t readily infect human lungs “and maybe never will”. But with repeat ‘spillovers’ into different species, H5N1 might be edging closer to a random mutation that facilitates airborne transmission of a pathogen that seasonal-flu vaccines would not protect against.\n\nH5N1 shares sequence similarities with the seasonal-flu virus H1N1. But for vaccination, the genetic overlaps occur in the wrong place. The seasonal shot prompts immune reactions against the ‘head’ of haemagglutinin — the part that binds directly with human cell receptors. H5N1 and H1N1 overlap on the ‘stalk’ part of haemagglutinin. As a result, Hensley says, “you need H5-specific vaccines”.\n\nAmassing an arsenal\n\nVaccine makers are providing those shots. As well as Seqirus, companies, including GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi Pasteur and AstraZeneca, have developed H5-targeted vaccines for human use in the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia. All the shots are produced in fertilized chicken eggs or mammalian cell lines, with the same processes that are used to make vaccines for seasonal influenza.\n\nAccording to a March 2025 document published by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, the United States planned to stockpile 10 million doses of H5N1 vaccine by early 2025. It takes two doses given weeks apart to fully vaccinate someone against a new strain of influenza, according to Jha, so that would be enough to inoculate about 1.5% of the US population.\n\nIt’s unclear, however, whether that target was reached, or even whether it remained a goal. When asked, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) — the agency that coordinates US responses to and recovery from public-health emergencies — did not confirm the size of the stockpile.\n\nH5N1 remains widespread on US dairy farms and some scientists say that it poses an existential threat to certain wildlife species. But an ASPR spokesperson says that with reports of animal infections declining and no new human cases since February 2025, the emergency bird-flu response put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had been deactivated, adding that “millions of doses are already filled and could be made available” if that became necessary.\n\nProminent public-health scientists criticize this move. Given these cuts, Offit says, “I’m concerned that we won’t have enough vaccine doses should a pandemic occur”. Peter Hotez, who directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, says that this latest decision reflects a “broader absence of situational awareness and pandemic preparedness” by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nElsewhere, preparations for an H5N1 outbreak are taking place. Fifteen European Union countries have collectively stockpiled 665,000 doses of the same Seqirus vaccine that was made available in Finland. The shots were authorized through an EMA programme that makes vaccines available to protect high-risk individuals “in case H5 strains start getting worse”, Cavaleri says. Seqirus has further contracts to provide millions of doses to the United Kingdom, the United States and the Asia Pacific region, according to Ray Longstaff, the company’s director for pandemic preparedness and response in Maidenhead, UK.\n\nThe zoonotic shot targets the 2.3.4.4b clade of the variant H5N8, which is closely related to H5N1 but has not spread as far. H5N8 isn’t typically encountered in people, but it has been detected in several animal species and is widely distributed in birds. Blood samples from volunteers who were vaccinated with the shot produce immune antibodies against H5N1 in lab assays. According to an EMA report of experimental results, between 64% and 90% of people produce antibodies that prevent infection in sufficient amounts to protect against a variety of H5N1 clades — including some that were common decades ago.\n\nNohynek and her colleagues in Finland tested the Seqirus zoonotic vaccine specifically against the 2.3.4.4b clade of H5N1 and found that 83–97% of vaccinated volunteers developed enough neutralizing antibodies to ward off infection2.\n\nMeanwhile, European Union countries have signed up to purchase 112 million doses of pandemic-preparedness vaccines manufactured by Seqirus and GlaxoSmithKline. These shots cannot be distributed, however, until a pandemic is declared. Companies want to avoid mass production until they know which virus to target, and this EU agreement ensures that if a pandemic does strike, vaccine manufacturers “can get a rapid approval without additional clinical data”, Cavaleri says.",

          "abstract": "Yasmin Proctor-Kent displayed waistcoats made by her dad behind her while competing on The Great British Sewing Bee.Credit: Love Productions Ltd 2025\nScientist sewing bees\n\nIn September, Yasmin Proctor-Kent, a research and development scientist at the cancer diagnostics company Leica Biosystems who is currently based in Melbourne, Australia, reached the finals of the 2025 BBC series of The Great British Sewing Bee. The television competition, which has now completed 11 seasons and boasts more than a dozen international versions, tests amateur sewers’ skills in pattern making, altering garments and creating made-to-measure pieces under time pressure. Previous scientist ‘bees’ include cell biologist Charlotte Newland, who won series four in 2016. Afterwards, Newland left a career in scientific publishing to become a sewing teacher, and she now works as a birth and postnatal doula. “The sewing bee made me a lot more flexible and less terrified of not having a predictable work progression,” she says.\n\nI love how the skills you develop as a scientist can be applied to sewing and other crafts. Like science, sewing requires creativity, as well as an initial idea or concept to get going. Both are about research and experimenting, and are iterative processes, in which you apply knowledge gained from work that you and others have done previously.\n\nDespite these parallels, craftwork such as sewing and knitting is often undervalued or dismissed because it’s seen as ‘women’s work’. But our brains work in the same way during crafting and research. For me, training in science and having a passion for sewing have been mutually beneficial — with each discipline supporting the other and driving my success.\n\nGrowing up, sewing was always part of my background. The Great British Sewing Bee was also always a regular fixture on our family television and was a source of connection to my family after I moved out to attend university (first at the University of Sheffield, UK, where I did a master’s degree in biochemistry and genetics, then at Newcastle University, UK, where I undertook doctoral research in mitochondrial biology).\n\nMy dad was my favourite person in the world, and a keen sewer. He had an innate creativity and curiosity that shaped my own — it almost feels genetic. He trained as an armourer in the UK Royal Air Force before moving into information technology, and if something needed doing while we were growing up — electrics, plumbing, repairing a hole in an item of clothing — he just did it.\n\nAlthough I get my love of sewing from him, his way of sewing was very different from mine. Before starting, he ensured that he had all the right equipment and did tonnes of research. He wouldn’t use a sewing machine to make a garment if, for example, it wasn’t historically accurate to do so, choosing instead to stitch by hand.\n\nIt was his sudden and unexpected death from cancer two years ago, aged 62, that made me decide to apply to be a contestant on the sewing bee. Sewing — and by extension the sewing bee — was our shared connection, and applying felt like a way to carry that forward.\n\nBecoming a ‘bee’\n\nThe programme’s application process began with sending in pictures of things you’d made. This was hard for me, because I hadn’t really documented anything I’d sewn, and just had the occasional selfie I’d sent to friends or family. The next step was a series of interviews, followed by an in-person sewing audition. Initially, I wasn’t cast — and I felt a strange sense of relief, because I wasn’t sure I was really a ‘TV person’. I’m loud in volume, but not necessarily in presence. I didn’t think I fitted the mould. But two weeks later, someone dropped out, and I was invited to take their place. I couldn’t believe I’d made it through.\n\nThe filming commitment was huge. Each episode is filmed over two long days, often starting at 6.30 a.m. and not ending until 8 p.m., with two episodes filmed back-to-back and just a day off in between.\n\nYasmin (centre) says she got her love of sewing from her dad (left, Yasmin’s mum appears on the right). Credit: Yasmin Proctor-Kent\n\nSiôn Phillips, a technical team leader and my manager at Leica Biosystems in Newcastle, UK, where I was then working as a lead research and development scientist in cancer diagnostics, generously gave me the time off and encouraged me to ask the company leadership if I could be filmed at work. He felt that there were not enough scientists on the programme, and that there’s a difference between saying you’re a scientist and viewers seeing you in a laboratory. It has more power.\n\nMy scientific skills and background helped to shape my approach to the programme’s challenges, and meant I was comfortable doing the research required. In the Korea-themed episode, for example, I found myself looking for papers on historical Korean clothing, translating them and applying that knowledge to make a cheollik — a traditional garment that includes a pleated skirt and is often worn by rulers and military personnel. It was no surprise to me that Kit, another contestant, also did well on the show. Kit is a mathematician, and was accustomed to engineering and transforming a 2D object to fit perfectly around a 3D form.\n\nCareer and craft\n\nI have wanted to be a scientist for as long as I can remember. When I entered the lab at university I fell in love with research, but I knew early on in my PhD that academia wasn’t for me. I didn’t feel it was a place where I could balance work with my hobbies, which include sewing, cooking and rugby (although a torn ligament means I can no longer play).\n\nFrom bench to bread: how science can enhance your hobbies\nI find industry much more compatible with a strong work–life balance. Leica Biosystems’ Newcastle office, where I am normally based, even has a crafting social group. Most of the members knit or crochet, and we meet regularly in a local cafe to practice our hobbies together. It’s a reminder that science and craft often sit side by side.\n\nMuch of my earlier career experience helped me to handle the pressure of being on the sewing bee. I have a specific interest in coaching that I have been developing throughout my career. During my doctorate, I tutored for a charity called the Brilliant Club, which places PhD students in local schools for extracurricular teaching. After I concluded my PhD lab work, but before I graduated in 2021, I worked as a personal development coach with 16–18-year-olds at a local sixth-form college. At the start of the pandemic, I worked in a COVID-19 testing lab, where I joined the UK National Health Service’s professional coaching programme, and I now support an international coaching programme for women at Leica Biosystems, training future coaches.",

          "abstract": "Traditional social network models focus on pairwise interactions, overlooking the complexity of group-level dynamics that shape collective human behaviour. Here we outline how the framework of higher-order social networks—using mathematical representations beyond simple graphs—can more accurately represent interactions involving multiple individuals. Drawing from empirical data including scientific collaborations and contact networks, we demonstrate how higher-order structures reveal mechanisms of group formation, social contagion, cooperation and moral behaviour that are invisible in dyadic models. By moving beyond dyads, this approach offers a transformative lens for understanding the relational architecture of human societies, opening new directions for behavioural experiments, cultural dynamics, team science and group behaviour as well as new cross-disciplinary research.",

This study examines how MLLMs evaluate hate speech through a series of conjoint experiments. Models are provided with a hate speech policy and shown simulated social media posts that systematically vary in slur usage, user demographics and other attributes. The decisions from MLLMs are benchmarked against judgements by human participants (n = 1,854). The results demonstrate that larger, more advanced models can make context-sensitive evaluations that are closely aligned with human judgement. However, pervasive demographic and lexical biases remain, particularly among smaller models. Further analyses show that context sensitivity can be amplified via prompting but not eliminated, and that some models are especially responsive to visual identity cues. These findings highlight the benefits and risks of using MLLMs for content moderation and demonstrate the utility of conjoint experiments for auditing artificial intelligence in complex, context-dependent applications.",

          "authors": "Shin Ling Wu",
          "abstract": "The Australian government frames this social media ban as a response to the ‘darker side’ of online platforms, including algorithmic manipulation, compulsive design features and harmful content, and growing concern that the design of social media platforms exploits developmental vulnerabilities. Platforms are built to maximize attention through features such as infinite scroll, streaks and push notifications1. Among adolescents, heavier or more problematic use (that is, excessive or uncontrollable engagement with social media) has been consistently linked with higher levels of depression, anxiety and psychological distress, although most evidence remains cross-sectional2. Furthermore, adolescence is a period of heightened sensitivity to peer approval and social comparison. Social media intensify these dynamics by increasing the visibility and quantification of social interactions, which amplifies the pressures of belonging and popularity3. By prohibiting accounts for individuals under 16 years old, the Australian government aims to limit these risks and compel companies to prioritize safety over engagement.\n\nAlthough advocates regard the ban as a precautionary response to mounting concerns over youth wellbeing, its success might be limited because it focuses on accounts rather than content. Streaming platforms typically allow users to scroll endlessly without logging in, and recommendation systems remain active for anonymous viewers. These feeds can shift rapidly following minimal interaction, and move from generic clips to streams that feature conspiracy theories, far-right material and violent imagery. Thus, restricting accounts does not necessarily protect adolescents from harmful content. In fact, this ‘logged-out’ state might be less safe than a registered account, which at least offers restricted modes and parental controls. Moreover, algorithms do not merely reflect user interests but actively shape them. A recent study shows that the content recommended by certain platform algorithms gradually narrows over time, and particular viewpoints become increasingly amplified. This ‘narrative drift’ can entrench bias and reduce diversity in what viewers encounter4. This paradox, in which efforts to protect adolescents from harmful content might instead increase exposure, underscores the difficulty of protecting adolescents in ecosystems that are shaped by recommendation systems.",

          "abstract": "Comparing information structures in between deep neural networks (DNNs) and the human brain has become a key method for exploring their similarities and differences. Recent research has shown better alignment of vision–language DNN models, such as contrastive language–image pretraining (CLIP), with the activity of the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) than earlier vision models, supporting the idea that language modulates human visual perception. However, interpreting the results from such comparisons is inherently limited owing to the ‘black box’ nature of DNNs. Here we combine model–brain fitness analyses with human brain lesion data to examine how disrupting the communication pathway between the visual and language systems causally affects the ability of vision–language DNNs to explain the activity of the VOTC to address this. Across four diverse datasets, CLIP consistently captured unique variance in VOTC neural representations, relative to both label-supervised (ResNet) and unsupervised (MoCo) models. This advantage tended to be left-lateralized at the group level, aligning with the human language network. Analyses of 33 patients who experienced a stroke revealed that reduced white matter integrity between the VOTC and the language region in the left angular gyrus was correlated with decreased CLIP–brain correspondence and increased MoCo–brain correspondence, indicating a dynamic influence of language processing on the activity of the VOTC. These findings support the integration of language modulation in neurocognitive models of human vision, reinforcing concepts from vision–language DNN models. The sensitivity of model–brain similarity to specific brain lesions demonstrates that leveraging the manipulation of the human brain is a promising framework for evaluating and developing brain-like computer models.",

          "abstract": "A collaborative group can often outperform a single individual in complex problem solving, even when information is limited. This phenomenon, called collective intelligence, can be achieved by engineering a central planner who assigns subtasks distributed across the group. But such algorithms cannot explain how natural populations, which often lack sophisticated central control, can nonetheless evolve collective intelligence. In fact, the process of social learning by imitating successful peers will typically reduce diversity and inhibit collective intelligence. Here, we consider a prediction task where the true outcome each round is a continuous quantity that depends linearly on a large number of random causal factors. Each individual can observe only one factor, and the collective prediction is generated by aggregating personal predictions across individuals. We propose two classes of reward structures that guarantee the emergence of collective intelligence through social learning. One scheme provides greater rewards to those individuals (called experts) whose personal predictions are more accurate. The other scheme provides greater rewards to those individuals (called reformers) whose predictions have greater potential to reduce the collective error, even though their personal predictions may be far from the truth. Although both of these payoff structures can provably maintain diversity and establish collective intelligence, we show that rewards based on collective error are more robust to diverse problem settings than rewards based on personal accuracy. Our results show that identifying reformers is more effective than identifying experts in promoting the emergence of collective intelligence.",

          "abstract": "This perspective addresses two of humanity’s greatest challenges: feeding a growing population and conserving biodiversity. We begin by examining the legacy of Nikolai Vavilov, who pioneered the improvement of crops such as wheat and beans by hybridizing them with their wild relatives. This strategy used wild species biodiversity to introduce new genetic variation into crops, making them more resilient and productive. Its adoption around the world greatly increased food security and brought lasting benefits to humanity. However, since the 1990 s, well-intentioned laws shifted the governance of biodiversity from a shared global resource to the sovereign control of nation states, with serious unintended consequences. These changes have disrupted the collection, preservation, exchange, and use of biodiversity, all of which are central to Vavilov’s strategy for crop improvement and to biodiversity science more broadly. Efforts at reform have been frustrated as the issues became moralized, inhibiting the open dialogue needed for change. Using foundational concepts shared by science and good governance, we propose seven empirically grounded principles for reform, to help realign biodiversity governance with its intended aims. We then illustrate one possible framework—underpinned by global financing to protect biodiversity hotspots—that would align incentives and work in synergy with the principles to foster practical reform. The principles, together with frameworks that align incentives, would create the conditions for stronger biodiversity conservation and research, agricultural development, global food security, and all the associated benefits to humanity.",

However, it remains unclear whether this effect generalizes across varied assessments and the extent of this effect across sociodemographic groups has been debated. Though seasonal variation in cognitive performance is often attributed to “forgetting” of learned material, no large-scale studies have systematically investigated seasonal variation in general cognitive skills (e.g., executive functioning) on standardized laboratory-based assessments in school-age youth compared to adults. Across four datasets with geographic, demographic, mental health, and measurement variation (total n = 23,251), we quantify cyclical, seasonal variation in children’s cognitive performance using generalized additive models with cyclic cubic splines. In school-age children but not young adults, we found consistent cognitive performance minima following school vacation (July–September in the United States; November–January in Singapore) across nearly all cognitive domains investigated. These results demonstrate a generalizable small-magnitude effect of lower cognitive performance aligning with school vacation even after adjusting for socioeconomic status or ADHD diagnosis. We contextualize summer cognitive minima relative to environmental and developmental effects, noting that the largest effect size is still seven times smaller than effects of the socioeconomic environment on cognition, and provide recommendations for future data collection and analysis of behavior across the calendar year.",

The results show that climate change is already reducing annual U.S. income by 0.32% [95% CI: −0.17 to 0.82%] by altering counties’ current, local temperatures, with losses concentrated in the Great Plains and Midwest. Accounting for effects on past temperatures and on temperatures in other counties increases income losses to 12% [2.0 to 22%] and makes them more widely distributed, with suggestive evidence that trade networks propagate effects around the United States. Central estimates can change with different indices of nonlocal weather or models of cross-county heterogeneity.

          "abstract": "Complex adaptive networks exhibit remarkable resilience, driven by the dynamic interplay of structure (interactions) and function (state). While static-network analyses offer valuable insights, understanding how structure and function coevolve under external interventions is critical for explaining system-level adaptation. Using a unique dataset of clandestine criminal networks, we combine empirical observations with computational modeling to test the impact of various interventions on network adaptation. Our analysis examines how networks with specialized roles adapt and form emergent structures to optimize cost–benefit trade-offs. We find that emergent sparsely connected networks exhibit greater resilience, revealing a security–efficiency trade-off. Notably, interventions can trigger a “criminal opacity amplification” effect, where criminal activity increases despite reduced network visibility. While node isolation fragments networks, it strengthens remaining active ties. In contrast, increasing a node’s connectivity (analogous to social reintegration) can unintentionally boost criminal coordination, increasing activity or connectivity. Failed interventions often lead to temporary functional surges before reverting to baseline. Surprisingly, stimulating connectivity destabilizes networks. Effective interventions require precise calibration to node roles, connection types, and external conditions. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about connectivity and intervention efficacy in complex adaptive systems across diverse domains.",

          "abstract": "Genotype–phenotype associations can be context-dependent and dynamic in nature leading to heterogeneity of genetic effects across different parts of the phenotype distribution. Quantile regression, an alternative to linear regression for continuous phenotypes, is particularly well suited for detecting and characterizing heterogeneous genotype–phenotype associations. Here, we propose a computationally efficient whole-genome quantile regression technique, Regenie.QRS, for biobank-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data with genetic structure. Our approach first estimates the polygenic effect, and then incorporates this effect as an offset in the nonmixed quantile regression model. Our simulations demonstrate robust control of type I error and higher power to detect heterogeneous associations relative to linear regression in GWAS and improved power over the marginal quantile regression tests. We present applications using data from the UK Biobank and the ProgeNIA/SardiNIA project, where we show the advantages of Regenie.QRS in identifying and characterizing heterogeneous genetic effects. To cite just one interesting example, using quantile regression, we are able to show that even though variants at the G6PC2 locus increase glucose levels, their effects are much stronger at lower quantiles of glucose level distribution than at higher quantiles, suggesting that G6PC2 may serve as a guardian against low glucose levels without driving dangerous hyperglycemia, which may explain the previously reported lack of association with diabetes risk. Beyond human genetics, our approach can be applied to plant and animal genetic studies to improve selective breeding and conservation efforts.",

          "abstract": "Cytosine methylation is a key epigenetic modification that regulates transcription factor (TF) binding and gene expression. While most current understanding of methylation-sensitive TF binding derives from studies focused exclusively on fully methylated CpG sites, alternative forms—such as non-CpG and hemimethylation—are increasingly recognized as widespread and functionally important, particularly in embryonic stem cells and neurons. However, the direct impact of these alternative methylation contexts on TF–DNA interactions remains poorly defined, largely because current binding assays introduce methylation enzymatically, which precludes strand-specific and position-resolved measurements. Here, we systematically profile the methylation sensitivity of 18 human TFs spanning 11 structural families using chemically synthesized DNA libraries containing position-specific 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in CpG, non-CpG, and hemimethylated contexts, measured via high-throughput protein-binding microarrays. Our results reveal extensive TF sensitivity to methylation state, position, and strand orientation, including strong binding of several TFs to non-CpG and hemimethylated sites. The presence of 5mC can dramatically alter TF–DNA interactions: transforming low-affinity sites into high-affinity ones by enabling new contacts or silencing otherwise favorable motifs through steric hindrance. Genomic analyses further show that the methylation-sensitive sequences identified in vitro are represented within enhancers and regulatory elements, exhibiting distinct methylation patterns across cell types. Together, our findings uncover a previously hidden layer of methylation-dependent TF–DNA recognition, broadening the understanding of epigenetics in transcriptional regulation.",

Among prompting strategies, self-refinement, where the LLM improves its own initial solution, was the most effective, a result validated using additional LLMs. While LLMs are capable of handling more complex data science tasks beyond tabular data prediction, their performance is substantially worse. These findings demonstrate that LLMs have the potential to design competitive machine learning solutions, even when used by nonexperts.",

          "abstract": "Cis -regulatory sequences, such as enhancers, play a crucial role in morphological evolution, but how their diversification leads to evolution of novel expression patterns that underpin diversity is still poorly understood. Recent work suggests that the function of enhancers is influenced by their genomic sequence context more than previously thought, further complicating our understanding of their contribution to diversity. To address these issues, we investigated the regulation of the RCO homeobox gene, which contributed to the evolution of complex leaves following its tandem duplication from LMI1 . By characterizing seventeen regulatory alleles at the LMI1 / RCO locus that we generated by genome editing, we found that the evolved RCO enhancer is subject to pronounced negative regulation that helps delimit the RCO expression domain. While the LMI1 enhancer was strictly required for LMI1 gene expression, the same was not true for the RCO enhancer, which caused only partial loss of function when deleted. We mapped both positively and negatively acting sequences within the RCO enhancer, validated them in reporter gene assays and showed that a repressive sequence arose in association with a nested duplication within the evolved RCO enhancer. This repressive sequence played a key role in shaping the specific RCO expression domain that underlies its role in leaf complexity, and we provide evidence that it helped to prevent potential pleiotropic effects arising from evolutionary diversification or RCO expression. Our findings highlight the regulatory features of a diversity-linked enhancer and show that the evolution of repressive sequences is a powerful force in regulatory evolution.",

The traditional elastic equations are correct to linear elastic order. However, there is a disregistry of the displacement field at ± infinity that significantly influences the elastic displacements and is missed in the linear elastic description. The earlier revision included volumetric nonlinear elasticity through the use of embedded coordinates and included the disregistry as well as removing the divergence. However, the revised model had a larger self-energy than the traditional model, which we now find to arise from similar divergent terms for the line force. The present model modifies the line force field to remove the divergent terms. The resultant total energy in the modified model has a lower energy than the traditional model.",

NCAM2 belongs to the Immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules with roles in intercellular adhesion and signaling.

          "abstract": "Entry of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) into host cells is mediated by the viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc. Structural details and assembly mechanism of Gn and Gc on the surface of RVFV remain unclear. Here, we stabilized the GnGc with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody RVFV-140 and determined a near-atomic resolution structure of the GnGc hexamer in complex with the fragment antigen binding (Fab) domain of RVFV-140 (Fab140). Our structure showed that RVFV-140 recognizes a ternary epitope and crosslinks two adjacent Gn heads within the hexamer, thus preventing the prefusion to postfusion transition of the glycoproteins. The intraglycoprotein and interglycoprotein interactions within the GnGc hexamer involve van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds, which are mainly located between Gn heads, and Gn domain C and Gc domain III. Assembly of the GnGc hexamer requires dramatic conformational changes in the loops L231-L244, D280-Q286, Q380-D386, and A427-Y429 of Gn and the hinge region between domains I and II of Gc. The construction of viral capsomeres with the hexameric structure of recombinant GnGc shows that the capsomeres interact primarily through residues 693 to 713 in domain I of Gc. These interactions vary depending on the local environment of each capsomere.",

Here, we obtain fluctuation theorems within an autonomous framework in which S exchanges energy with a reversible work source, R . The two subsystems, R and S , interact with one another as they evolve under Hamiltonian or stochastic dynamics, without external intervention. In this setting, we must account for the backaction of S on R , which is absent in the nonautonomous setting.

Using magnetoencephalography, we find that the brain constructs nested hierarchies through rapid neural sequences that perform two recurring generative operations. The first operation identifies the hierarchy depth of a symbol and is associated with increased ripple-band power; while the second arranges the symbol into its correct order at that level, a process that scales with the number of depths, also positively correlated with planning time. These results reveal a fundamental neural computation for transforming sensory information into structured representations, which is essential for higher-order cognition.",

          "abstract": "Interannually highly variable and synchronized production of large seed crops by perennial plants, called masting, drives resource pulses and famines with cascading effects on food webs. While the spatial scale of masting synchrony is well documented, it remains unclear how synchrony differs between years of seed abundance and failure, and how such dynamics extend across species and space. These gaps are important to resolve, as they determine the magnitude and spatial extent of masting effects on food webs. Using a 36-y dataset from 431 sites spanning seven dominant tree species in temperate Europe, we provide evidence that seed failures are more spatially synchronized than mast peaks, indicating that regional coherence in seed production is structured primarily by reproductive failure. Among-species synchrony was localized. This suggests that in temperate forests, mobile seed consumers are unlikely to experience coordinated starvation–satiation cycles, in contrast to highly synchronous tropical dipterocarp systems. From an applied perspective, failure years affect seed availability over broad regions, limiting sourcing options for afforestation and restoration, and underscoring the value of spatially explicit masting forecasting. Because mast peaks and failures differ fundamentally in their food web consequences, our findings highlight the need to better understand and anticipate the ecological impacts of synchronized seed scarcity.",

This study employed targeted and untargeted metabolomics, coupled with isotope labeling, to shed light on the metabolism of salicinoids—potent antiherbivore phenolic defenses present in the Salicaceae family—in the poplar-specialized leaf beetle, Chrysomela tremulae . C. tremulae was found to produce a range of metabolites from salicortin and utilize the essential amino acid tryptophan and its breakdown products, namely kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and 4-hydroxyquinoline, to form novel conjugates with the salicinoid metabolite saligenin, which are then excreted in the feces of the beetles. Saligenin and its conjugates are not toxic to C. tremulae and similar metabolic pathways were found in other poplar herbivores. Experimental analyses of the gut microbiota revealed that there is no microbial contribution to the formation of tryptophan metabolite–saligenin conjugates. The production of such substances by insect herbivores may be a critical adaptation that enables specialists to survive on a diet high in salicinoid defense compounds. Therefore, identifying the underlying detoxification mechanisms creates opportunities to develop targeted anti-insect agents for protecting salicaceous trees.",

This study introduces an approach by examining the temporal dynamics of brain functional networks postimplantation to identify predictors of outcomes and explore brain plasticity. Twenty-nine CI candidates and 23 normal-hearing individuals participated. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy measured brain activity during audio-only and visual-only speech tasks at 1 mo and 1 y postimplantation, with speech understanding assessed after 1 y. Brain community dynamics were analyzed using multilayer modularity and network switching rates to capture temporal reorganization. Lower network switching rates shortly after implantation were associated with better long-term speech performance. Evidence of cross-modal plasticity—reflecting preimplant neural reorganization—was observed in early recordings, indicated by increased module allegiance between the posterior temporal (PT) region and visual cortices, which diminished after 1 y. Additionally, interhemispheric connectivity in the PT showed significant improvement between sessions, reducing disparities between CI users and normal-hearing individuals. These findings highlight dynamic functional connectivity as a meaningful neural correlate of outcome variability, with potential relevance for guiding personalized rehabilitation strategies and optimizing auditory and speech outcomes.",

Prisoners’ dilemma, and in particular, the important special case of donation games, represents social dilemmas where cooperation is mutually beneficial, yet defection is preferred by selfish agents. In evolutionary games on networks, the agents interact over a population structure. The existence of population structures that promote cooperative behavior is a fascinating and active research topic. Previous research establishes structures promoting cooperation in the limit of weak selection where the benefit-to-cost ratio β exceeds 1.5. The existence of such structures for medium and strong selection for 1 &lt; β &lt; 2 and for weak selection for 1 &lt; β &lt; 1.5 has been a long-standing open question. First, we answer the open questions in the affirmative: For every selection strength and every β &gt; 1 , we construct networks promoting cooperation. Second, we present a robustness result with respect to β and selection strength: Our structures promote cooperation for a range of these parameter values rather than specific parameter values. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with simulation results on small population structures that show the effectiveness of our construction over well-studied population structures.",

After the emergence of AI-based methods, convection nowcasting has experienced rapid advancements, with its performance surpassing that of physics-based numerical weather prediction and other conventional approaches. However, the lead time and coverage of it still leave much to be desired and hardly meet the needs of disaster emergency response. Here, we propose a deep diffusion model for satellite data (DDMS) to establish an AI-based convection nowcasting system. Specifically, DDMS employs diffusion processes to effectively simulate complicated spatiotemporal evolution patterns of convective clouds, achieving more accurate forecasts of convective growth and dissipation over longer lead times. Additionally, it combines geostationary satellite brightness temperature data and domain knowledge from meteorological experts, thereby achieving planetary-scale forecast coverage. During long-term tests and objective validation based on the FengYun-4A satellite, our system achieves effective convection nowcasting up to 4 h, with broad coverage (about 20,000,000 km 2 ), remarkable accuracy, and high resolution (15 min; 4 km). Its performance reaches a new height in convection nowcasting compared to the existing models. In terms of application, our system is highly transferable with the potential to collaborate with multiple satellites for global convection nowcasting. Furthermore, our results highlight the remarkable capabilities of diffusion models in convective clouds forecasting, as well as the significant value of geostationary satellite data when empowered by AI technologies.",

          "abstract": "Many regions of the world have seen an increase in highly destructive wildfires, driven by well-documented increases in burned area and growth of housing in the wildland–urban interface (WUI), which exposes more homes to fire. However, it is unclear whether wildfires are also becoming more destructive due to changes in wildfire behavior or in the development patterns of exposed communities. Here, we assessed trends in wildfire building exposure and destruction rates in the conterminous United States from 2002 to 2022. We mapped destroyed and surviving buildings within 100 m of all wildfires that destroyed 10 or more buildings (n = 362) and assessed trends relative to major ecoregions and vegetation types. We used logistic regression to assess relationships between destruction rates and landscape factors. We found that 10% of exposed buildings were destroyed in 2002–2012, but this percentage increased to 32% in 2013–2022. This increase was largely due to greater building exposure in evergreen forests in the northwestern United States, where exposed buildings were more than 3.4 times as likely to be destroyed as those in grass and shrublands. However, annual destruction rates also significantly increased in all other vegetation types and were correlated with development type, weather, and burn severity. These results indicate that increasing wildfire destruction in the United States has resulted not only from increased exposure but from rising rates of building destruction, potentially indicating more extreme wildfire behavior. This finding underscores the need to better understand how fuel management, community planning, and hardening buildings can reduce vulnerability.",

While growing evidence highlights the central role of CD103 + T cells in shaping the immune landscape of regional tissues, mechanisms driving the cell differentiation in LN remain largely unexplored. In this study, we identified an increased frequency of CD4 + CD103 + T cells within the kidneys of SLE patients. Importantly, glomerular endothelial cells (ECs) from human LN tissues were found to promote the differentiation of CD4 + CD103 + T cells by upregulating B lymphocyte–induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1). Genetic knockdown of Blimp-1 in CD4 + T cells resulted in a reduced frequency of renal CD4 + CD103 + T cells and alleviated LN in humanized SLE chimeras. Mechanistically, LN-associated ECs, triggered by circulating DNA from SLE patients, exhibited elevated CD38 expression via the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. This facilitated the transfer of CD38 into CD4 + T cells through an exosome-dependent mechanism, leading to the depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) levels in CD4 + T cells. The resulting NAD + depletion impaired the PARP1-mediated ADP-ribosylation of early growth response protein 1 (EGR1), which, in turn, enhanced Blimp-1 transcription and promoted CD103 + T cell differentiation. Targeting the cGAS/STING-CD38-EGR1 axis effectively reduced renal CD103 + T cell accumulation and inhibited LN progression in humanized SLE chimeras. Thus, ECs facilitate NAD + depletion to drive CD103 + T cell differentiation, presenting a cellular mechanism underlying LN pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for the clinical management of human LN.",

Here, we suggest that these DSB ends form in an asymmetric manner, with one being blunt or near blunt and the other bearing a 3′ ssDNA overhang of up to the size of an Okazaki fragment. We find that Mre11 preferentially binds blunt ends and is required to evict Ku from these DSB ends and to promote end resection. In contrast, the ends predicted to have 3′ overhangs have minimal Ku binding, and resection at these break ends can proceed in a mostly Mre11-independent manner through either the Exo1 or Dna2-Sgs1 long-range resection mechanisms. These findings indicate that resection proceeds differently at replication-dependent DSBs than at canonical DSBs and reveal that Ku selectively binds blunt ends, potentially explaining why replication-dependent DSBs are poorly repaired by nonhomologous end joining.",

          "abstract": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) cells have emerged as a crucial component of the inhibitory network, facilitating interregional communication, particularly in the context of associative memory. To expand our current understanding of the role of this population, we combine anatomical and functional approaches to question the influence of VIP cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), a region key for navigation and spatial memory. From our anatomical tracing study, our findings reveal that neurons located in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADN) specifically project onto MEC interneurons, with a strong preference for MEC VIP cells. Additionally, MEC VIP cells receive input from the hippocampus, the subicular complex, and the retrosplenial cortex, suggesting a specialized role for MEC VIP cells in spatial memory. Indeed, we find that MEC VIP cells exhibit increased c-Fos expression in a spatial memory task and show that chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons impairs task performance. Together, these data reveal a specific projection of head-direction (HD) information onto MEC interneurons and confirm that MEC VIP-expressing cells play a critical role in spatial memory.",

Previous studies have linked the function of a single Krüppel-associated box zinc finger protein (KZFP), ZFP189, in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the regulation of transposable elements (TEs), immune genes, and social behaviors. Here, we expand the scope of inquiry to explore the relationship between collective PFC KZFP function and social behaviors by altering the function of the cognate KZFP interacting protein TRIM28 within the PFC of male and female mice. We reprogrammed natural TRIM28 WT by replacing the endogenous, transcriptionally repressive domain with a synthetic, enhanced transcriptional activation domain VP64-p65-Rta (TRIM28 VPR ) or by excising the transcriptional regulatory domain (TRIM28 NFD ). Upon intra-PFC viral-mediated delivery of TRIM28 variants, we observed that inversion of TRIM28 transcriptional control via HSV-TRIM28 VPR selectively produced deficits in social behaviors, without affecting nonsocial behaviors. RNA sequencing of manipulated PFC revealed that HSV-TRIM28 VPR drove transcriptional escape of all classes of TEs, particularly those located within intronic and enhancer regions proximal to downregulated immune genes. HSV-TRIM28 VPR -mediated social deficits were reversible by intra-PFC repletion of interferon cytokines. These data point to PFC KZFP–TRIM28 interactions as necessary to stabilize genomic TEs to enable cis -regulation of key immune gene expression, which enhances organismal capacity for complex, prosocial behaviors.",

          "abstract": "The activation of the vesicular trafficking system, including endosomal recycling and extracellular vesicle (EV) release, represents an adaptive mechanism in cancer cells to counteract cellular stress or necroptotic death signals, which hampers cancer therapy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Indeed, our study demonstrate that inhibition of valosin-containing protein (VCPi) induces EV release and necroptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC), but does not achieve a synergistic effect with immunotherapy. Mechanistically, VCPi delays the degradation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), a critical regulator of necroptosis and endosomal trafficking. Knockdown of MLKL reduces VCPi-mediated necroptosis, EV release, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) recycling. VCPi leads to MLKL accumulation, which recruits the retromer complex and GTPase-activating protein TBC1D5 to inactivate Rab7A. This redirects PD-L1-loaded vesicles to the cell surface via the retromer complex, thereby resulting in immunosuppression. Notably, targeting the retromer complex enhances the therapeutic efficacy of combined VCP inhibitors and anti-PD-L1 therapy in CRC, offering a promising immunotherapeutic strategy. Our study elucidates the role of the retromer complex in mediating PD-L1 recycling during VCPi-induced necroptosis and reveals that dual inhibition of VCP and the retromer complex potentiates immunotherapy efficacy in CRC.",

However, it remains unclear whether other transcriptional programs operate beyond the central androgen/AR signaling in promoting WD development. We found that mesenchyme-specific deletion of the transcription factor Gata2 resulted in defective epididymal coiling in the corpus and caudal regions. The defective coiling did not result from androgen signaling deficiency, as there were no abnormalities in testicular androgen production, AR/ Ar expression, or androgen-responsive genes, and dihydrotestosterone supplementation did not restore epididymal coiling in cultured WDs. Instead, Gata2 deletion led to the loss of epididymal identity, as evidenced by the reduced expression of epididymal mesenchymal markers. The epididymal defect persisted into adulthood, with the uncoiled corpus and caudal epididymis exhibiting abnormal epithelial morphology and lumen environments, resulting in an unfavorable environment for sperm storage. Our results demonstrate the androgen-independent role of mesenchymal GATA2 in promoting epididymal development and highlight the importance of proper fetal development in male reproduction.",

          "abstract": "Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant research attention in algorithm design and perception applications. However, their potential in the decision-making domain, particularly in model-based reinforcement learning, remains underexplored. In reinforcement learning, a world model refers to a predictive model that learns the environment’s dynamics and enables agents to simulate future trajectories in a latent space, thereby improving sample efficiency and long-horizon planning. The difficulty lies in the need for spiking neurons with long-term temporal memory capabilities, as well as network optimization that can integrate and learn information for accurate predictions. The dynamic dendritic information integration mechanism of biological neurons brings us valuable insights for addressing these challenges. In this study, we propose a multicompartment neuron model capable of nonlinearly integrating information from multiple dendritic sources to dynamically process long sequential inputs. Based on this model, we construct a spiking world model (Spiking-WM), which integrates a spiking state-space model, a spiking convolutional encoder, and a fully connected spiking network for policy learning, to enable model-based deep reinforcement learning with SNNs. We evaluated our model using the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating that Spiking-WM outperforms existing SNN-based models and achieves performance comparable to artificial neural network-based world models employing Gated Recurrent Units. Furthermore, we assess the long-term memory capabilities of the proposed model in speech datasets, including Spiking Heidelberg Digits dataset, Texas Instruments/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus, and LibriSpeech 100h, showing that our multicompartment neuron model surpasses other SNN-based architectures in processing long sequences.",

          "abstract": "The magnitude and shape of phenotypic variation depends on properties of the genotype-to-phenotype (GP) map, which itself can evolve over time. The evolution of GP maps is particularly interesting in variable environments, as GP maps can evolve to bias variation in the direction of past selection, increasing the evolvability of the population over time. However, the degree and manner in which environmental variation shapes GP maps and influences evolutionary dynamics may depend on properties of the fitness landscape. To explore how evolutionary dynamics are affected by variable environments across a wide range of different pairs of fitness landscapes, we evolved GP maps to produce spatial-temporal gene expression patterns that matched two-dimensional patterns generated by different elementary cellular automata rules. We found remarkable variation in how populations evolved in variable environments. In some cases, changing the environment helped populations find higher fitness peaks; in others, it hindered them. The evolution of evolvability also depended on the fitness landscape pair. In some experiments, the ability to generate adaptive phenotypic variation upon environment change increased over time, while in some others, populations found shared areas between fitness landscapes. On the other hand, environmental variability consistently resulted in higher fitness landscape exploration, average fitness, and mutational robustness compared to evolution in static environments, which we hypothesize are tightly connected. In conclusion, work presented here sheds light on important general consequences of environmental variability, while also demonstrating dependency on properties of fitness landscapes, which future research on the evolution of evolvability should consider.",

In this paper, we test whether local circuits alone can generate predictive signals by training a recurrent spiking network using local plasticity rules. Our network model replicates experimentally observed features of prediction errors, such as biphasic neural activity patterns and context dependency. Our findings shed light on how synaptic plasticity can shape prediction errors and enable the acquisition and updating of an internal model of sensory input within a recurrent neural network.",

          "abstract": "Motile cilia are eukaryotic organelles with essential chemo- and mechanosensing functions across evolution, from single cell organisms to humans. Motile cilia of the mammalian nervous, respiratory, and reproductive systems are characterized by unique motility proteins to generate fluid flow essential for transporting metabolites and removing mucus. The molecular mechanism underlying motile cilia assembly remains unknown. Here, we use high-resolution imaging, proteomics, in situ cryotomography, and single-molecule motility assays to identify mammalian KIF27, a motor protein of the Kinesin-4 family and homologue of the Hedgehog pathway regulator COS2/KIF7, as a key regulator of motile cilia assembly in vivo. We show that KIF27 promotes the integrity of the transition zone (TZ), a diffusion barrier situated at the cilium base. Loss of KIF27 results in specific and profound defects in axonemal structure and disrupts cilia beating, which collectively lead to organismal phenotypes that recapitulate primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We show that the motile properties of KIF27 are dispensable for its function in motile cilia assembly. Instead, KIF27 acts as a microtubule scaffold to regulate the TZ architecture and enable correct ciliary incorporation of motility-generating proteins. Given that KIF27 orthologues exist in different evolutionarily lineages, we propose that the ancestral activity of KIF27/KIF7 kinesins was to form a microtubule-associated scaffold for protein–protein interactions pertinent to cilia formation and signaling. The transition-zone-associated KIF27 activities may represent a general building principle for the motile cilia assembly in diverse species and cell types.",

We implement a bottom–up model of different cement end-use applications (buildings, pavements, bridges, pipelines, and other infrastructure) in the United States and Mexico to estimate the in-use and end-of-life carbon uptake in cement. We show that carbon uptake in 2024 could sequester approximately 13% of process emissions associated with cement consumption, which is around 6.7 Mt CO 2 . We observe a four-fold variation in the uptake per square area across all the states due to regional differences in the distribution of building types, concrete mix designs, and climates. The building sector uptake is almost twice as large as infrastructure systems. In Mexico, the current stock of cement-based products sequesters around one-quarter of the industry’s annual process emissions, implying the importance of local differences in end-use context, which can dramatically alter the extent of carbon uptake. Where prudent, enhancing carbon uptake in cement-based products is a valuable strategy to move toward carbon neutrality in the construction sector. The findings in this paper provide a fundamental shift in understanding how anthropogenic materials interact with the carbon cycle, which changes how national greenhouse gas inventories are calculated.",

However, the extent to which EV ncRNAs resemble overall cellular RNAs and the benefits to host cells of packaging them into EVs remain unknown. Here, we purified EVs from the culture media of mouse and human cells and characterized their RNA components using high-throughput sequencing and Northern blotting. We report that EVs are enriched for numerous aberrant ncRNAs, including ncRNA fragments, ncRNAs that have failed to mature, and short structured introns. Many RNAs contain oligouridine tails, a modification that can promote degradation by DIS3L2, an exoribonuclease that degrades defective structured ncRNAs. Both the numbers of EVs released and the fractions of tailed RNAs in EVs increase on DIS3L2 depletion, indicating that EV packaging of aberrant ncRNAs occurs in competition with DIS3L2 decay. Multiple type I interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are upregulated on DIS3L2 depletion, and cells treated with a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor that reduces exosome biogenesis show moderate ISG upregulation, an effect that is enhanced in DIS3L2-depleted cells and accompanied by accumulation of aberrant ncRNAs in cellular RNA. Thus, DIS3L2 degradation and packaging of aberrant RNAs into vesicles may prevent these RNAs from activating innate immune sensors and triggering an interferon response.",

          "abstract": "In sign languages, linguistic information is transmitted through the simultaneous movement of several bodily articulators. This study investigates cortical tracking of sign language and whether experience and knowledge of sign language can modulate the tracking. We used a camera with a depth sensor to record videos of semispontaneous sign language narratives while tracking articulators’ movement in 3D space. These videos served to characterize the temporal periodicity of the sign language visual signal and as stimuli for the experiment. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded the neurophysiological activity of two groups of hearing participants—proficient signers and sign-naive individuals—while they watched videos in a known and unknown sign language. Coherence between the preprocessed MEG data and the visual linguistic signal extracted from different articulators was used as measure of brain-language tracking. The results show that neural activity tracks sign language input in delta frequency band (0.5 to 2.5 Hz), reflecting the slower periodicity associated with articulator movements. Both groups of participants show similar tracking in occipital areas, reflecting low-level visual processing of the videos. Proficient signers show stronger synchronization compared to sign-naive controls for linguistically relevant articulators in the right temporal cortex. Proficient signers also show greater tracking for the known compared to the unknown sign language. These findings confirm that cortical tracking of language is a feature of language processing beyond the auditory domain, and is modulated by language experience.",

          "abstract": "The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years has necessitated the development of effective charging infrastructures. However, charging infrastructure expansion is a multifaceted problem that requires careful consideration of the existing infrastructure, spatiotemporal distribution of charging demands, power-grid capacity, and budget constraints. To approach this complex problem, we present charge-map , a data-driven simulation-optimization framework, focused on ensuring meaningful charging experience for individual EV owners. charge-map integrates three modules: an agent-based simulation module that estimates spatiotemporal distribution of charging demands by modeling EV adopter mobility and charging behavior; an optimization module that determines optimal new charging station/charger locations and capacities, while minimizing expected detour distances and wait-times with a limited number of new stations; and a power module that determines how to connect the stations to the power grid while maintaining its stability. Using the state of Virginia (consisting of 95 counties and 38 independent cities) as a case study, our results show that charge-map can meet the demand of ∼ 198,600 predicted EVs with 1,305 new public charging stations and 2,164 new chargers. It reduces average detour distances for charging by 66% and wait-times at stations by 72% compared to the existing infrastructure. Furthermore, transformer capacity requirement analysis reveals that only 1.8% of residential transformers require upgrades, while over 80% of commercial charging locations can be supported with modest transformer infrastructure (25 to 50 kVA). This indicates that targeted investments can facilitate cost-effective EV integration. Consequently, charge-map provides policymakers and urban planners with crucial data-driven insights for effective EV charging infrastructure expansion.",

          "abstract": "Cells require highly polymorphic receptors to perform accurate self/non-self recognition. In the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum , polymorphic TgrB1 and TgrC1 proteins are used to bind sister cells and exclude cheaters, but it remains unknown how cells continually generate their extreme genetic diversity. Here, we created a collection of chromosome-length, whole genome sequences from 10 D. discoideum isolates and sister species to understand the evolution of the large tgr gene family. Our dataset includes AX2-214, a widely used D. discoideum lab strain, as well as complete genomes for two Chlamydia -like endosymbionts harbored within amoebae. We find that tgrB1 and C1 lie in a hypermutational hotspot, with haplotypes that undergo repeated intralocus recombination, duplications, transpositions, and inversions. These structural dynamics are highly localized adjacent to tgrB and C , resulting in the gain and loss of dozens of genes. The tgrBC genes themselves frequently duplicate and recombine, leading to the rapid generation of unique tgrBC repertoires. In the broader tgr gene family, some genes (e.g., tgrN ) are single copy and syntenic across all the genomes, whereas others (e.g., tgrA ) prolifically duplicate at similar rates to Dictyostelium transposons. Thus, the tgr genes are among the most rapidly evolving families genome-wide. We propose that the intense diversification within the tgrBC locus can help explain how these genes acquire such extreme levels of polymorphism, with parallels to the MHC immune genes in mammals and other allorecognition systems. This collection of amoeba genomes is also a useful resource for future comparative genomics and molecular evolution studies in Amoebozoa.",

          "abstract": "Models for prebiotic syntheses often have many steps, each separately validated by laboratory experiments. The challenge then asks whether these steps work together in natural geological environments, absent human intervention. Here, we analyze a six-step Discontinuous Synthesis Model (DSM) for the prebiotic formation of RNA, proposed to be the first informational molecule to support Darwinian evolution, and life, on Earth and/or Mars. DSM requires that borate in multiple steps guide the formation of pentoses from simple carbohydrates and control phosphorylation, in all cases by binding adjacent HO-groups on key intermediates. However, adjacent HO-groups must react in two other steps, which borate might inhibit. Experiments here show that borate does not inhibit these two other steps, but rather facilitates them. This makes the six-step DSM a “no human intervention” route from simple precursors (1 to 3 carbons, 0 to 2 nitrogens) to oligomeric RNA with predominately 3’,5’-linkages at least 6 nucleotides long, but possibly much longer. The process i) exploits privileged chemistry in ii) intermittently irrigated aquifers constrained by basalt that iii) have borate iv) above a redox-neutral mantle v) having access to an atmosphere transiently reduced by a Vesta-sized impactor. In a possible coincidence, such an impact occurred most likely ca. 4.3 billion years ago (Ga), ~100 Mya before some molecular clocks date the divergence of the three kingdoms of life on Earth (4.2 Ga), and ca. 200 Mya before isotopically “light” carbon is reported in zircons dated at 4.1 Ga. This carbon may be the oldest trace of life ever proposed.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies of the tight junction protein occludin (OCLN) suggest that multiple phosphorylation sites on the carboxy-terminal domain contribute a regulatory role in vascular barrier properties. However, gene deletion studies failed to identify a clear functional role for OCLN, despite multiple phenotypic alterations. Importantly, previous studies targeting exon 3 allowed expression of a splice variant starting at exon 4 (isoform 4), that expresses the full carboxy-terminal tail. Here we show that the OCLN carboxy terminus forms a complex with the light intermediate chain (LIC) of dynein to link tight junction cargo to the minus end directed motor protein. Mutational analysis revealed S471 phosphorylation promotes binding to the LIC while S490 phosphorylation is required for trafficking. Expressing OCLN S490A mutant prevented endothelial cell proliferation and collateral angiogenesis. Ocln gene deletion targeting exon 5, preventing full-length and isoform 4 expression, resulted in embryonic lethality. In summary, OCLN links tight junction cargo to the dynein motor, regulating trafficking in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and contributing to both vascular endothelial growth factor-induced vascular permeability and collateral angiogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Strong coupling photonics, in which coupling strengths significantly exceed decay factors, holds great promise for applications in energy conversion and information processing. However, the effective and scalable design of strongly coupled polaritonic structures requires precise determination of the transition boundaries between strong and weak coupling regions. Traditional trial-and-error methods and classical machine learning (ML) algorithms struggle to achieve this due to the inherent difficulty in measuring decay factors during coupling. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid ML framework that integrates physics-informed modeling with uncertainty quantification. This approach enables accurate determination of strong–weak coupling transition boundaries—even with inaccessible decay factors. By leveraging this capability, our method facilitates efficient and large-scale design of strongly coupled polaritonic structures with sparse data, achieving a computational speedup of ~10 4 times compared to conventional simulations. Guided by this framework, we experimentally constructed a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) polariton coupling structure and observed strong coupling via near-field spectroscopy. This work establishes a generalizable optimization methodology for strongly coupled photonic devices, opening a broad avenue for polariton-enhanced energy conversion and optical information modulation.",

We present MultistageOT ( https://github.com/dahlinlab/MultistageOT ), a generalized optimal transport-based framework that models cell differentiation in a single snapshot as a series of intermediate cell transitions. MultistageOT employs multiple transport stages to establish temporal progression within the snapshot—overcoming limitations with the classic bimarginal formulation of optimal transport. Moreover, our multistage framework uses global information across all cells and differentiation stages to infer coherent trajectories from initial to terminal states. This allows MultistageOT to infer individual outlier cells that are unrelated to the analyzed differentiation process—an essential mechanism for preventing the inference of spurious or biologically implausible trajectories. We benchmark MultistageOT on snapshot data of cell differentiation, showing significantly improved fate prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art bimarginal optimal transport and demonstrating MultistageOT’s unique ability to detect outlier cells.",

In this study, APV assembly and release is achieved in nonimmune cells by transfecting a single-chain heterotrimer (SCT) peptide major histocompatibility complex I (pMHCI) construct containing an ESCRT- and ALIX-binding region (EABR) sequence appended to the cytoplasmic tail; this EABR sequence recruits ESCRT proteins to induce the budding of APVs displaying SCT pMHCI. A comparison of multiple pMHCI constructs shows that inducing the release of APVs by the addition of an EABR sequence generalizes across SCT pMHCI constructs. Purified pMHCI/EABR APVs selectively stimulate IFN-γ release from T cells presenting their cognate T cell receptor, demonstrating the potential use of these vesicles as a form of cell-free immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Multicellular organisms utilize epithelial folding to achieve remarkable three-dimensional forms. During embryonic development, stereotypical epithelial folds emerge from underlying active cellular and molecular processes including cell shape change and differential cell growth. However, the origin of epithelial folding in early animals and how folding may be harnessed in synthetic systems remain open questions. Here, we identify a modality of behavior-induced epithelial folding and unfolding arising from cilia–substrate adhesion and ciliary walking in the basal animal Trichoplax adhaerens (phylum Placozoa). We show that T. adhaerens is capable of exhibiting dynamic nonstereotyped folding states, providing a 3D perspective to an organism previously only characterized in its 2D state. We correlate these folding states to local substrate geometry, revealing that the animal conforms to available substrate surface area, promoting the maintenance of a folded state. Using 4D fluorescence light sheet microscopy, we characterize fold geometry, curvature evolution during unfolding, and the nonstereotypy of unfolding behavior. Through repeated unfolding trials, we reveal the robustness and timescales associated with unfolding behavior and employ scaling analysis and toy model simulations to establish how collective ciliary activity can robustly drive unfolding. In this way, despite lacking any folding–unfolding “pathway,” transitions between folding and unfolding states emerge as a function of the animal’s environment and motility. Our work reveals a remarkable behavior exhibited by a brainless, nerveless animal, and demonstrates the capacity for 3D–2D transitions in folding epithelial sheets using ciliary activity.",

          "abstract": "Fluoride has long been known to possess antimicrobial properties. For many bacteria, the toxic effects of fluoride are reversible. However, fluoride has also been shown to trigger lysis and cell death in many other diverse bacterial species, including dental pathogens. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for fluoride-induced cell lysis have not been established. Using Streptococcus mutans as a model, we show that fluoride elicits an uncontrolled stress response characterized by upregulation of competence pathways and extensive cell wall degradation. While controlled and limited autolysis under stress is an adaptive response, we show that expression of the competence-associated alternative sigma factor ComX is prolonged under fluoride stress, relative to other stressors. Using in vitro and in vivo analyses, we show that fluoride disrupts the typical tight temporal control of ComX by specifically inhibiting assembly and activity of Clp ATPases responsible for its proteolytic degradation. Unchecked, ComX upregulates bacteriocins and autolysins, while simultaneously suppressing immunity peptide expression via a 6S RNA-mediated mechanism. Thus, fluoride subverts cellular mechanisms to turn off competence pathways that are induced under cellular stress, causing irreversible damage to the cell wall and ultimately cell death. Phenylalanine partially restores Clp protease assembly and activity, providing a rationale for the frequent presence of a gene encoding chorismate mutase in fluoride-responsive operons. Together, our findings reveal the molecular mechanism of fluoride-dependent lysis in bacteria, fifty years after this phenomenon was first reported. These pathways could be exploited to potentiate the antimicrobial effects of oral fluoride.",

Here, we revisit the August 2003 heat wave in France, a canonical event in a region with rich climate and mortality data, to understand these influences. We find that standard heat–mortality exposure–response functions underpredict excess deaths in August 2003 by 55% but that accounting for the temporally compounding effects of hot days better matches observed mortality. After accounting for compounding effects and applying a machine learning approach to single-event climate attribution, we attribute 6,079 deaths in August 2003 to climate change. Finally, we show that recent adaptation to heat in France has reduced the projected death tolls of future 2003-like events by more than 75%.",

          "abstract": "Many coral reefs have fish stocks that are depleted below the level at which sustainable production is maximized. Lower production means that millions of people are losing out on potential food, income, and livelihoods. Rebuilding these stocks to maximize sustainable production can contribute toward ending hunger and malnutrition but requires active and effective fisheries management. Yet, for fish stock recovery plans to be implemented, recovery benefits, targets, and timeframes need to be quantified. Here, using 1,211 individual reef sites and 23 jurisdictions identified globally as being below maximum sustainable production levels, we show that reefs have the potential to increase sustainable yields by nearly 50% if allowed to recover toward their maximum production levels. For individual jurisdictions, this recovery represents from 20,000 up to 162 million additional sustainable servings of reef fish per year in comparison to current sustainable production, meeting recommended seafood intake for up to 1.4 million additional people a year. However, such growth and food provisioning will require fish stocks to double their standing biomass (increase by a median of 32 t/km 2 ). Recovery timeframes range from 6.4 y under the most stringent scenario (a moratorium) to 49.7 y under the maximum harvest scenario that results in recovery. We find that locations with the greatest potential for sustainable gains in yield are among those with the greatest food and micronutrient deficiencies, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in recovering fish assemblages to achieve their maximum sustainable potential.",

Using metabolic genome-wide association studies (mGWAS), we identified the cytochrome P450 gene ( Glyma.11g108300 ), GmIF6H1 , as a key determinant of glycitein biosynthesis in soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Biochemical assays together with in planta stable-isotope tracing demonstrated that GmIF6H1 catalyzes the 6-hydroxylation of daidzein, establishing a previously unrecognized and predominant biosynthetic route for glycitein. A single amino acid substitution in GmIF6H1 accounts for the domestication-associated reduction of glycitein-type isoflavonoids. Upon Phytophthora sojae infection, (malonyl)glycitins undergo sustained deglycosylation to release glycitein aglycone, underscoring its defensive role. Strikingly, both loss- and gain-of-function alleles increase susceptibility to P. sojae , indicating that precise tuning of GmIF6H1 expression is essential for effective resistance. Metabolite profiling further reveals complementary daidzein-centered defense strategies: Glycitein-type isoflavonoids (via daidzein 6-hydroxylation) function as phytoanticipins, whereas glyceollins (via daidzein 2’-hydroxylation) act as inducible phytoalexins. Together, these findings clarify the biosynthetic origin of the glycitein and underscore the synergistic action of glycitein and glyceollins in pathogen resistance, offering opportunities for engineering disease-resilient soybean cultivars.",

          "abstract": "Clinical responses to CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy in B cell malignancies are strongly associated with robust CAR T cell expansion in the peripheral blood. In contrast, CAR T cells targeting solid tumors do not encounter cognate antigen in the periphery, resulting in limited expansion and subtherapeutic peak concentrations. To overcome this, we engineered dual-targeted and dual-costimulated CAR T cells (CD19/28ζ-M5BBζ) that recognize CD19+ B cells, thereby promoting peripheral expansion and increasing the pool of solid tumor-directed CAR T cells available for tumor infiltration without the need for lymphodepletion. In immunocompetent C57BL/6 mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and melanoma, these dual-targeted CAR T cells demonstrated enhanced peripheral expansion, improved anti-tumor efficacy, and increased survival without added dysfunction or toxicity compared to single antigen-targeted CAR T cells. We translated our findings to human CAR T cells by developing a pancreatic/xenograft model with CD19 + B cells in the periphery and again demonstrated that treatment with dual CAR T cells showed significantly enhanced tumor clearance and survival compared to single antigen-targeted CAR T cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that dual-targeted CAR T cells boost peripheral expansion, and anti-tumor efficacy, providing a strategy for enhancing outcomes for patients treated with clinical CAR T products targeting solid tumors.",

Here, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 screens and identified sphingolipid transporter 1 (SPNS1) as an essential factor for EV-A71. SPNS1 deficiency inhibits infection of EV-A71 and 9 of 11 examined enteroviruses. Mechanistically, the endo/lysosomal localization of SPNS1 and the acidification of the endo/lysosomes are essential for SPNS1 to support EV-A71 infection. SPNS1 deficiency inhibits EV-A71 genomic RNA replication, but barely affects replication of EV-A71 RNA directly transfected into the cytoplasm. SPNS1 interacts with the EV-A71 capsid protein VP1 and entry receptor SCARB2 in the endo/lysosomes, where it acts as a transporter to release the viral pocket factor into the cytosol, leading to uncoating. Animal experiments show that SPNS1 deficiency results in reduced viral loads, pathological effects, and lethality following EV-A71 infection. Our findings collectively identified SPNS1 as a transporter of the EV-A71 viral pocket factor.",

However, there have been no guaranteed routes of microfluidics that can achieve widespread adoption in mainstream chemistry and biomedical research. Inspired by the cooperative multiple cilia of biological organisms and tissues to generate flow, we propose an open microfluidic platform, lab on an end (LoE), to pump spatially and temporally continuous flow for multifunctional micromanipulation with the acoustohydrodynamic pillar array as an end effector. LoE brings together the micromanipulation of individual entities, liquid operations, and cell processing onto an acoustic end effector. These operations are mainly driven by acoustic radiation and two unique frequency-dependent microstreaming profiles: out-of-plane vortex near a single pillar and in-plane transmission flow surrounding the entire pillar array. Applications in embryo engineering, local morphological phenotyping of Caenorhabditis elegans for neuron research, efficient chemical reactions, and multifunctional cell processing indicate that the LoE could potentially lead to breakthroughs in understanding and using microfluidics. Its capability of integrating multiple sequential processes, inherent high accessibility, easy use, and low cost provide an end-to-end solution to mainstream chemistry and biomedical research.",

Evidence of acute health effects of wildfire particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) is growing, but less is known about long-term effects related to repeated exposures. Using a cohort of 1,250,083 Kaiser Permanente Southern California members aged ≥60, we estimated the association between all-cause mortality and 3-y exposure to five different census tract–level wildfire smoke metrics (mean daily wildfire-specific PM 2.5 , mean daily wildfire-specific PM 2.5 during the peak wildfire week, number of days with daily wildfire-specific PM 2.5 &gt; 0 μg/m 3 , number of weeks with average wildfire-specific PM 2.5 &gt; 5 μg/m 3 , and number of smoke waves). We applied a discrete-time approach with pooled logistic regressions, adjusting for sex, age, race and ethnicity, marital status, smoking status, requiring an interpreter, calendar year, and census tract–level poverty and population density. When comparing those highly exposed (95th percentile) to those minimally exposed (5th percentile), we found an increased odds of mortality across all five wildfire smoke metrics. Mean daily wildfire PM 2.5 was the metric most strongly associated with mortality (odds ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.09). We observed greater vulnerability to the long-term effects of smoke for individuals under age 75, or with Black or Other racial/ethnic identity, or living in a census tract with higher poverty. Identifying the most harmful long-term wildfire smoke metric and most-at-risk populations can help focus attention for developing effective adaptation strategies in a changing climate.",

In a randomized, double-blind crossover study of 110 young women, we examined how exogenous estradiol (E2) modulates threat neurocircuitry, timed precisely to ovarian phase. E2 increased engagement of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and, in the early luteal phase, reduced central and corticomedial amygdala reactivity to threat in women with little trauma history, but not those with PTSD.

A popular mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), could serve to develop such a therapy, provided we can better understand the nature and importance of the autoantibodies involved. Here, we report the finding of autoantibody-secreting extrafollicular plasmablasts in EAE induced with specific myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that these cells produce nonaffinity-matured IgG antibodies. These include pathogenic antibodies competing for shared binding space on MOG’s extracellular domain. Interestingly, the synthetic anti-MOG antibody 8-18C5 can prevent the binding of pathogenic antibodies from either EAE mice or people with MOG antibody disease. Moreover, an 8-18C5 variant carrying the NNAS mutation, which inactivates its effector functions, can reduce EAE severity and promote functional recovery. In brief, this study provides not only a comprehensive characterization of the humoral response in EAE models but also a proof of concept for a therapy to antagonize pathogenic anti-MOG antibodies.",

          "abstract": "The interplay between magnetism and flat-band (FB) instability is a central theme in quantum materials research. A striking example is the emergence of magnetic order in a nominally nonmagnetic compound when a flat band is tuned near the Fermi energy ( E F ). In this study, we investigate this phenomenon in the Pauli paramagnet SrCo 2 As 2 , where an FB associated with Co e g orbitals lies close to E F . Remarkably, a minute substitution of the nonmagnetic element Pd onto the Co site ( ∼ 2%) induces antiferromagnetic order with a transition temperature as high as T N = 25 K. Temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent magnetic and transport measurements, complemented by zero-field neutron diffraction, reveal a helical magnetic order for x ≤ 0.10 in Sr(Co 1− x Pd x ) 2 As 2 , transitioning to a complex ferromagnetic state at higher Pd concentrations. Spectroscopic evidence and theoretical band structure calculations demonstrate that electron doping shifts the flat band closer to E F , significantly enhancing the Stoner parameter. This enhancement drives a strong ferromagnetic instability, leading to helical magnetic ordering dominated by in-plane ferromagnetic interactions. The emergence of robust magnetic ordering through substitution with nonmagnetic elements is a unique phenomenon that underscores the pivotal role of flat-band instability in tuning magnetism in itinerant systems.",

For example, modern machine-learning techniques such as deep learning or reservoir computing typically require a large quantity of data. Leveraging synthetic data from paradigmatic nonlinear but non-ecological dynamical systems, we develop a meta-learning framework with time-delayed feedforward neural networks to predict the long-term behaviors of ecological systems as characterized by their attractors. We show that the framework is capable of accurately reconstructing the “dynamical climate” of the ecological system with limited data. Three benchmark population models in ecology, namely the Hastings-Powell model, its variant, and the Lotka-Volterra system, are used to demonstrate the performance of the meta-learning based prediction framework. In all cases, enhanced accuracy and robustness have been achieved using five to seven times less training data as compared with the corresponding machine-learning method trained solely from the ecosystem data. In addition, two real-world ecological benchmark datasets: the microbial time-series dataset and global population dynamics database, are tested to demonstrate the applicability of the meta-learning framework to the real world. A number of issues affecting the prediction performance are addressed.",

          "abstract": "The basal ganglia (BG) are a collection of subcortical nuclei involved in motor control, sensorimotor integration, and procedural learning. They play a key role in the acquisition and adaptation of movements, a process driven by dopamine-dependent plasticity at cortico-striatal projections, which serve as BG input. However, BG output is not necessary for executing many well-learned movements. This raises a fundamental question: How can plasticity at BG input contribute to the acquisition and adaptation of movements which execution does not require BG output? Existing models of BG function often neglect the feedback dynamics within cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical circuitry and do not capture the interaction between the cortex and BG in movement generation and adaptation. In this work, we address the above question in a theoretical model of the BG-thalamo-cortical multiregional network, incorporating anatomical, physiological, and behavioral evidence. We examine how its dynamics influence the execution and reward-based adaptation of reaching movements. We demonstrate how the BG-thalamo-cortical network can shape cortical motor output through the combination of three mechanisms: i) the diverse dynamics emerging from its closed-loop architecture, ii) attractor dynamics driven by recurrent cortical connections, and iii) reinforcement learning via dopamine-dependent cortico-striatal plasticity. Our study highlights the role of the cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical feedback in efficient visuomotor adaptation. It also suggests a mechanism for early-stage acquisition of reaching movements through motor babbling. More generally, our model explains how the BG-cortical network refines motor output through its intricate closed-loop dynamics and dopamine-dependent plasticity at cortico-striatal synapses.",

          "abstract": "Oxytocin, a hormone linked to reproduction and health, may mediate life-history trade-offs across the human life course. Yet, how oxytocin naturally varies with age remains poorly understood. Here, working with the Tsimane, forager-horticulturalists of lowland Bolivia, we collected the largest sample of oxytocin measurements to date (n = 1,242 samples, n = 405 individuals, age = 2 to 84 y, 51% female), and i) examined how oxytocin varies throughout the life course in females and males, and ii) investigated potential drivers of age- and sex-specific variation. Our sample provides rare insight into the relationship between oxytocin and age in a context where energy is limited and trade-offs between reproduction and somatic maintenance are more salient. We found that oxytocin follows a nonlinear sex-specific trajectory throughout the life course. In females, oxytocin levels were high during the reproductive years and declined in the early to midforties, a pattern largely explained by breastfeeding and, to a lesser extent, childcare and good self-rated health. In males, oxytocin was low in early adulthood but high in old age, and although higher oxytocin was linked to good self-rated health, this did not explain the rise in oxytocin in later life. These findings suggest that oxytocin is instrumental for reproduction and caregiving in females and may also be associated with health in both males and females. Together, our work highlights oxytocin’s broader biological significance across the human life course, suggesting that it may play a pivotal role in coordinating age- and sex-specific trade-offs involving reproduction and health.",

Despite 80% of individuals with DM1 experiencing GI dysfunction that affects their daily life, the mechanisms of GI dysmotility in DM1 remain an understudied aspect of the disease. DM1 is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene that, when expressed as an expanded CUG repeat RNA, sequesters and reduces the activity of the muscleblind-like (MBNL) RNA-binding protein family. We developed a mouse line with conditional, smooth muscle-specific knockout of Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 to model and investigate myogenic mechanisms contributing to GI dysmotility in DM1. Mice with Mbnl knockout exhibited delayed GI transit of small and large bowel in vivo and increased smooth muscle contractile tone of jejunum and colon segments ex vivo. Smooth muscle from the jejunum and colon showed no histopathology suggesting an intrinsic defect and contained increased phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light chain (Mlc20), consistent with increased contraction. RNA sequencing of mouse and human DM1 GI samples enriched for smooth muscle revealed conserved misregulated alternative splicing of transcripts associated with the regulation of Mlc20 phosphorylation and smooth muscle contraction. These findings demonstrate that Mbnl knockout disrupts the regulation of contraction dynamics and causes GI smooth muscle hyperactivity, suggesting that therapeutics that reduce GI contractile activity may improve DM1 GI symptoms.",

Although anatomical, molecular, and genetic approaches have revealed diverse SCN cell types, how network-level wiring enables their synchronization remains unclear. To overcome the challenges of inferring functional connectivity from fixed tissue, we developed Mutual Information &amp; Transfer Entropy (MITE), an information-theoretic framework to infer directed cell–cell connections with high fidelity from long-term live-cell imaging. Recording and analyzing 3,290 h of clock gene expression from 8,261 SCN neurons across 17 mice, we uncovered a highly conserved, sparse SCN network organized into two asymmetrically coupled modules: dorsal and ventral. Connectivity analyses revealed five functional SCN cell types independent of neurochemical identity. Notably, only ~30% of vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons exhibited Hub-like connectivity, classifying them as Generators and Broadcasters of synchrony signals. Other spatially stereotyped cell types consistently identified as Bridges, Receivers, or Sinks. Simulations based on MITE-inferred connectomes recapitulated emergent SCN dynamics, including recovery from desynchrony and the daily dorsal-to-ventral phase wave of gene expression. Together, these results demonstrate that MITE enables precise mapping of cellular network topology, revealing the circuit logic and key cell types that mediate circadian synchrony across space and time in the mammalian SCN.",

          "abstract": "Physical exercise affects multiple physiological processes, including those regulated by hormones, such as energy balance, stress responses, and pain perception. The prohormone precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gives rise to β-endorphin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, β-lipotropin, and the melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), which act through melanocortin (MC1-5) and opioid receptors to influence these key physiological responses. Here, we identified a mechanism by which full-length POMC interacts with small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in the circulation. In healthy adults, the fraction of plasma POMC associated with sEVs increased fourfold following intense exercise, despite unchanged POMC and sEV concentrations. POMC-positive sEVs contained leukocyte or megakaryocyte/platelet markers, suggesting hematopoietic origin. A substantial subset of circulating sEVs expressed MC1–MC5 and μ-opioid receptors, and coimmunoisolation assays demonstrated binding of unprocessed POMC to MC1 and MC3 receptors. Molecular modeling indicated that POMC undergoes pH-dependent conformational changes that favor MC binding, a finding corroborated by in vitro binding assays under acidic conditions. Functionally, addition of POMC-positive sEVs to B16-F10 melanoma cells induced melanogenesis, consistent with POMC-derived MSH activity. The sEV-associated POMC had higher rates of transport than unbound POMC in assays mimicking the blood–brain barrier. These findings establish that exercise-induced, pH-dependent binding of POMC to circulating sEVs may facilitate hormone precursor transport and potentially influence transfer across the blood–brain barrier. This mechanism represents a separate paradigm for endocrine regulation, providing insight into how exercise modulates sEV interactions with systemic hormone distribution and signaling.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal function depends on mitochondria, but little is known about their organization across neurons. Using an electron microscopy Drosophila connectome, we uncovered quantitative rules governing the morphology and positioning of hundreds of thousands of mitochondria across thousands of neurons. We discover that mitochondrial morphological features are specific to cell and neurotransmitter type, providing fingerprints to identify neurons. Mitochondria are positioned with 2–3 μm precision relative to synaptic and structural features, with systematic differences across neuron types and compartments. Mitochondrial localization correlates with regional activity and postsynaptic targets. Analysis of a mouse visual cortex connectome confirms cell-type specific morphology and identifies partially divergent positioning rules. These results establish mitochondria as circuit-embedded organelles whose distribution links subcellular architecture to brain connectivity.",

          "abstract": "AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are multimodal transducers of glutamatergic signals throughout the brain. Their diversity is exemplified in the cerebellum; at afferent synapses, AMPARs mediate high-frequency excitation, whereas in Bergmann glia (BG) they support calcium transients that modulate synaptic transmission. This spectrum arises from different combinations of core subunits (GluA1-4), auxiliary proteins, and post-transcriptional modifications. Here, using mass-spectrometry, cryo-EM, and electrophysiology, we characterize major cerebellar AMPARs in pig: calcium-impermeable GluA2/A4 heteromers with four TARP subunits, mainly neuronal in origin, and BG-specific calcium-permeable GluA1/A4 heteromers containing two Type-2 TARPs. We also showed that GluA4 receptors consistently exhibit compact N-terminal domains that promote their synaptic delivery. Our study defines the organizational principles of mammalian cerebellar AMPAR complexes and reveals how different receptor subtypes support cell-type specific functions.",

Here, we report the observation of Shapiro steps in periodically driven Josephson junctions between strongly interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. The height and the width of the observed quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such a mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations. Our work may open prospects for studying emergent nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.",

A solution-based kinetic fabrication process templates growing networks of cylindrical surfactant micelles with thin tubes of polysiloxane-forming gel networks and, upon replacing surfactants and solvents with air, yields lightweight materials with greater than 99% visible-range optical transparency and approximately 10 milliwatts per kelvin per meter thermal conductivity. Such predesigned metamaterials enable transparent thermal barriers for wall-grade insulated glass units, square-meter window retrofits, and unconcentrated solar thermal energy harnessing.",

          "abstract": "Earth’s water was likely acquired early, when our planet was extensively molten because of large to giant impacts. How such early water was retained and distributed within a crystallizing mantle remains unclear. In this study, we investigated partitioning of water between bridgmanite, the first and primary mantle mineral to crystallize, and coexisting melt through systematic high-pressure experiments. Our results demonstrate that partitioning of water into bridgmanite is strongly enhanced by increasing temperature. Thus, appreciable amounts of water may have been retained in the lower mantle after its crystallization. Circulation of such early stored water in Earth’s interior could have modulated mantle dynamics and influenced the transition of early Earth to a habitable planet.",

We found that the transcription factor hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) could direct the tissue residency program and function of CD4 + T RM cells. HLF simultaneously up-regulated tissue retention receptors, down-regulated tissue egress receptors, and promoted proinflammatory CD4 + T RM cells by inducing Bhlhe40 , and all of these processes were associated with changes in chromatin accessibility. Genetic deletion of Hlf inhibited CD4 + T RM cell generation and ameliorated airway tissue inflammation in vivo. HLF + CD4 + T RM cells isolated from inflamed airway tissue in humans had a tissue residency signature and expressed inflammatory cytokines. We conclude that HLF may act as a central regulator of proinflammatory CD4 + T RM cell development and function.",

Cancer cells frequently contain micronuclei—small, nucleus-like structures formed by chromosome missegregation—that are susceptible to rupture, exposing chromatin to cytoplasmic nucleases. Through an unbiased, imaging-based small interfering RNA screen that targeted all 204 known and putative human nucleases, we identified a previously uncharacterized cytoplasmic endonuclease, NEDD4-binding protein 2 (N4BP2), that enters ruptured micronuclei and initiates DNA damage, leading to chromosome fragmentation. N4BP2 promoted genome rearrangements (including chromothripsis), formation of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in drug-induced gene amplification, tumorigenesis, and tumor cell proliferation in an induced model of human high-grade glioma. Analysis of more than 10,000 human cancer genomes revealed elevated N4BP2 expression to be predictive of chromothripsis and copy number amplifications, including ecDNA.",

We find rapid evolution of genome architecture, including ~100-megabase decreases in genome size driven by shifts in complex satellite landscapes. SVs exhibit slightly deleterious dynamics modulated by variant length and population size, with consistent evidence of adaptive fixation only in the largest population. Gene copy number variants exhibit an inverse relationship with population size, indicating strongly deleterious dynamics, with consequences for gene expression.

Mitochondrial adaptations heat plant reproductive structures in a circadian pattern, radiating infrared that is sufficient to attract beetle pollinators. Beetle antennae contain infrared-activated neurons with thermosensitive ion channels that are structurally tuned to match host plant thermogenesis. Comparative analyses revealed that infrared is among the earliest pollination signals, and indicate a deep-time transition from infrared-based to color-dominated signaling in flowering plants.

We report the rock properties encountered by Perseverance during a ten-kilometer traverse extending over 400 meters in elevation, from beneath Jezero's western sedimentary fan to the upper crater rim. These rocks consist of coarse-grained olivine, magnesium- and iron-carbonates, silica, and phyllosilicates, including some of the oldest materials exposed within Jezero. We infer these rocks formed by olivine accumulation in an igneous system of layered intrusions, followed by exposure to water and carbon dioxide that caused extensive carbonation of the silicate minerals.

Knockout of CsARF3 resulted in an androecious phenotype with only male flowers, whereas overexpression of CsARF3 led to increased number of female flowers. CsARF3 promotes femaleness by directly stimulating the expression of meristem maintenance gene CsSTM , and repressing the activity of gynoecious gene CsWIP1 . Auxin and ethylene exhibit a reciprocal relationship during sex determination, in which ethylene promotes carpel formation through auxin at the early stage of flower development.

Age-related transcriptional changes were greater in oocytes than in granulosa cells across species, although mature oocytes change more in humans.

Purine salvage represses DNPB to prevent excessive purine nucleotide synthesis through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. We identified Nudix hydrolase 5 (NUDT5) as a DNPB regulator. During purine salvage, NUDT5 suppresses DNPB independently of its catalytic function but rather through interaction with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the DNPB pathway. The NUDT5-PPAT interaction promoted PPAT oligomerization, suppressed PPAT’s enzymatic activity, and facilitated disassembly of the purinosome, a metabolon that functions in DNPB. Disrupting the NUDT5-PPAT interaction overcame DNPB suppression during purine salvage, permitting excessive DNPB and inducing thiopurine resistance.

          "abstract": "α-Tropolones comprise an unsaturated seven-membered ring bearing a hydroxyl substituent adjacent to a polarized carbon-oxygen π bond. This polarization imparts a permanent molecular dipole and aromatic stabilization to the ring, resulting in distinct physical properties, including affinity for divalent metals and ambiphilic reactivity. Among secondary metabolites that contain α-tropolones, the pseudodimeric isolate (–)-gukulenin A ( 7 ) stands out for its complexity and has shown promise in treating mouse models of ovarian cancer. In this study, we describe an enantioselective synthesis of (–)-gukulenin A ( 7 ). Key steps include a directed C–H arylation, a tandem Grob fragmentation–alkylation, an innovative synthesis of methyl tropolone ethers, a multicomponent cross-coupling, and a thermal carbonyl-ene reaction. Structure-function studies establish the dimeric tropolone and aldehyde substructures as drivers of cytotoxicity.",

          "abstract": "Folate metabolism is intricately linked to purine de novo synthesis through the incorporation of folate-derived one-carbon units into the purine scaffold. By investigating chemical and genetic dependencies caused by mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, cyclohydrolase, and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase 1 (MTHFD1), we discovered a key role for Nudix hydrolase 5 (NUDT5) in regulating purine de novo synthesis. Genetic depletion and selective chemical degradation showed that a scaffolding role, rather than NUDT5 enzymatic activity, was causing this phenotype. NUDT5 interacted with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme of purine de novo synthesis, to repress the pathway in response to increased purine abundance. Through this mechanism, loss of NUDT5 mediates resistance to purine analogs in cancer treatment and prevents adenosine toxicity in MTHFD1 deficiency.",

          "abstract": "Flexibility and stability of neuronal ensembles are crucial features of brain function. Little is known about how these properties of local circuits are influenced by long-range inputs. We show, in mice, that lateral entorhinal cortex glutamatergic (LEC GLU ) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)–ergic (LEC GABA ) projections to CA3 recruit specific microcircuits that conjunctively provide stability to neuronal ensembles, thereby supporting learning. LEC GLU drives excitation in CA3 but also substantial feedforward inhibition that prevents somatic and dendritic spikes. Conversely, LEC GABA suppresses this local inhibition to disinhibit CA3 activity with compartment and pathway specificity by selectively boosting somatic output to integrated LEC GLU and CA3 recurrent inputs. This synergy allows the stabilization of spatial representations relevant to learning, as both LEC GLU and LEC GABA control the formation and maintenance of CA3 place cells across contexts and over time.",

Structural studies on chlorophyll f–containing photosystem I could identify some chlorophyll f sites, but none among the photochemically active pigments, and thus concluded that chlorophyll f plays no photochemical role. Here, we report two cryo–electron microscopy structures of far-red photosystem I from Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203, allowing the assignment of eight chlorophyll f molecules, including the redox active A −1B . Simulations of absorption difference spectra induced by charge separation indicated that the experimental spectra can be reproduced only by considering the presence of a chlorophyll f at the A −1B site. The chlorophyll f locations, wavelength assignments, and conserved far-red–specific residues provide functional insights for efficient use of long-wavelength photons.",

          "abstract": "Online political discussions are often dominated by a small group of active users, while most remain silent. This visibility gap can distort perceptions of public opinion and fuel polarization. Using a collective field experiment on Reddit, we examined factors predicting self-selection into silent “lurker” and active “power-user” roles and tested whether participation differentials can be reduced with norm- or incentive-based interventions. We recruited 520 United States participants, randomly assigned them to conditions in six private communities, and asked them to discuss 20 political issues over 4 weeks while completing weekly surveys. Lurking (posting nothing) was most common among users who perceived discussions as toxic, disrespectful, or unconstructive; these same perceptions also predicted power usership (more posting, conditional on not lurking). Experimentally, financial incentives for commenting reduced participation differentials, whereas we did not find effects from a civility norm treatment. These findings support preference- and incentive-based accounts of participation but suggest that light-touch interventions are unlikely to bridge participation gaps, let alone polarization.",

A key mechanism in this process is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped by adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules. Here, we investigate the relationship between CID and adsorbate-induced changes in dc electrical resistivity for four molecular adsorbates on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID regimes. On one hand, CID takes place via direct resonant electronic transitions to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. This mechanism is dependent on plasmon energy. In the second regime, plasmon damping takes place through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface. This regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy. This mechanism also leads to adsorbate-induced changes in dc resistivity. These findings provide previously unidentified insights into the microscopic origins of plasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate energy transfer.",

Necroptosis, a regulated necrotic cell death pathway controlled by receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), has emerged as a potential driver of inflammation and fibrosis in chronic liver disorders. We investigated the role of necroptosis in PSC and whether RIPK1 inhibition could modify disease course and progression. Spatial profiling of human PSC biopsies revealed that necroptosis primarily affects cholangiocytes, while apoptosis was more frequent in hepatocytes and nonbiliary cells. In vitro, necroptosis inhibition protected cholangiocytes, and RIPK1 deletion conferred resistance to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. In a murine model of PSC, pharmacological RIPK1 inhibition reduced cholestatic injury, hepatic inflammation, and biliary fibrosis. Multiomic analyses comprehensively demonstrated reprogramming toward wild-type–like profiles following treatment. These findings identify necroptosis as a critical effector in PSC and highlight RIPK1 inhibition as a promising disease-modifying approach, opening the door to targeted necroptosis-based therapies for this otherwise untreatable disease.",

          "abstract": "Phytohormone signaling pathways are crucial for defense against pathogens mediated by pattern recognition receptors and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors. The induction of auxin signaling by immune receptors for antiviral immunity is poorly understood despite its notable role in plant defense against viral pathogens. Here, we report that plant NLR Sw-5b initiates and amplifies auxin signaling through auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAAs)–ARF19 and YUC8–transport inhibitor response1/auxin-signaling F-box (TIR1/AFB) modules to promote callose-mediated antiviral defense. Upon recognizing viral effector, Sw-5b associates with and relieves repressors Aux/IAAs on transcription factor ARF19. ARF19 then activates callose synthase gene GSL5/8 to deposit callose at plasmodesmata, inhibiting viral cell-to-cell spread. Meanwhile, ARF19 activates auxin biosynthesis gene YUC8 to boost auxin production; this further amplifies callose deposition signaling via TIR1/AFB receptors and Aux/IAAs-ARF19–glucan synthase-like (GSL) module, thereby restricting the virus in localized cell death. Our findings provide valuable insights into the mechanism by which plant immune receptors induce phytohormone signaling pathways to combat pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Artificial neural networks, widely recognized for their role in machine learning, are also transforming the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), bridging data-driven modeling with classical dynamical systems as well as enabling the development of infinitely deep neural models. However, their practical applicability remains, in this context, constrained by the opacity of the learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of neurally driven dynamical systems are now scarce and restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce event transition tensors as a new tool containing high-order differential information that provides a rigorous mathematical description of NeuralODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterizing uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analyzing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method allows for the interpretability of NeuralODEs and their analytical verification by expressing their behavior through previously unknown explicit mathematical structures. The neural dynamics are thereby fully encapsulated within a set of compact, computationally efficient tensors, which retain all the necessary information for rigorous system analysis and certification. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.",

Here, we use in vitro–generated ECM bioscaffolds that recapitulate cell-ECM interactions and induce broad metabolic alterations in PDAC cells. High-throughput integration of multiomics datasets coupled with metabolic tracing showed that the ECM enhances the generation of guanylates in PDAC cells, the accumulation of which alleviates oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage, and boosts PDAC cell proliferation. These events are guided by the guanosine monophosphate (GMP)–producing enzymes inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and guanosine monophosphate synthase (GMPS), the expression of which correlated with that of matrisomal and DNA repair genes in samples from patients with PDAC. We propose that targeting ECM-driven metabolic processes, such as the enhanced IMPDH activity, may be an effective therapeutic approach for patients with PDAC to bypass the negative side effects of direct targeting of the ECM itself.",

The structure shows highly localized density of RNA underneath surface fivefold axes on one-half of the viral particle. This polarity in RNA distribution is associated with a unique interchain isopeptide bond (glutamic acid–lysine), which flanks conserved high-affinity RNA binding sites.

We show that surface-sensitive interparticle interactions mediated by the LC can drive mixtures of colloidal MPs into assembly patterns that are accurately recognized using computer vision approaches. In particular, we show that we can identify MP composition (polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate) in complex samples that contain natural organic matter and have been weathered using ultraviolet light.

To better understand the etiology of melanoma associated with tanning bed use, we described the patterns of melanoma in patients with quantifiable tanning bed usage and performed exome sequencing of melanocytes from normal skin of a subset of these patients. Tanning bed users were more likely to have melanoma on body sites with low cumulative levels of sun damage and to have multiple melanomas. The melanocytes in skin from tanning bed users had higher mutation burdens and higher proportions of cells with pathogenic mutations—these differences were most prominent over body sites that experience comparatively less exposure to natural sunlight. We conclude that tanning bed radiation induces melanoma by increasing the mutation burden of melanocytes and by mutagenizing a broader field of melanocytes than are typically exposed to natural sunlight.",

A proposed facilitator of apoptotic cell clearance is the fragmentation of these cells into apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) through cell-autonomous processes involving caspases and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Although this fragmentation process is considered a hallmark of apoptosis, its progression in tissue environments remains underexplored. Here, we examine the in vivo apoptotic dynamics of mouse thymocytes and pluripotent cells from zebrafish embryos. We show that the in vivo biogenesis of ApoBDs is independent of known cell-intrinsic regulators. Instead, fragmentation depends on actin-rich protrusions from neighboring resident phagocytes, which mechanically compress apoptotic cells to break them into smaller particles. Four-dimensional in vivo tracking of apoptotic cells reveals that both phagocyte-mediated fragmentation and phagocytosis are size sensitive, indicating that apoptotic size reduction mediated by phagocytes enhances their own clearance abilities. This non–cell-autonomous fragmentation ensures rapid apoptotic cell clearance, crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis in physiological settings.",

The aim of this study was to develop iPSC-derived “minimal injectable unit” chondrogenic micropellets (MIUChons) for delivery via intra-articular injections for OA therapy. To create transplantable allogeneic cartilage tissue, we optimized good manufacturing practice or clinical-grade production of iPSC-derived injectable chondrogenic spheroids and tested them in OA animal models.

The proposed, yet unproven, mechanism underlying digoxin’s positive inotropic effect is as follows: By inhibiting the Na + -K + ATPase (NKA), digoxin partially dissipates the transmembrane Na + gradient, which is used by the Na + -Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX1) to extrude Ca 2+ from myocytes, thus causing accumulation of cytosolic Ca 2+ and therefore increased cardiac contractility. Here, we demonstrate that digoxin critically relies on a specific allosteric regulation of NCX1, known as Na + -dependent inactivation, to exert its positive inotropic effect, establishing the precise mechanism of action of this historic drug. These findings identify a distinct molecular target for the development of positive inotropes that avoid the undesirable effects associated with the blockade of NKA. As the structural information for the region involved with NCX1 Na + -dependent inhibition is well resolved, we provide the mechanistic foundation for drug development.",

In this work, we develop an analytical model connecting diurnal cloud biases to emergent mean state radiative biases. With the use of satellite observations, we demonstrate that there are errors in the time of day that clouds are occurring in ESMs that would cause bias in shortwave cloud radiative effect (SWCRE) that is greater than 45% of the total SWCRE bias, but such errors in the cloud diurnal cycle are masked by other compensating errors, indicating that these ESMs are getting the right answer for the wrong reasons.",

We observed that neurons, astrocytes, and CD8 + T cells had high rates of parasite interactions in Casp8 −/− Ripk3 −/− mice compared to wild-type mice. While Casp8 deficiency in neurons and astrocytes did not affect control of infection, deletion of Casp8 in CD8 + T cells led to impaired survival, increased parasite burden, and direct infection of CD8 + T cells in the brain.

TOR activity is rapidly suppressed by heat stress, independently of SG formation. In contrast, TOR reactivation following heat stress relief is dependent on the rate of SG disassembly, implicating SG recovery dynamics as a key regulator of TOR reactivation. These findings reveal a layer of TOR regulation and highlight the potential of modulating SG dynamics to orchestrate plant growth and stress adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Histone variants play crucial roles in DNA replication and repair. The plant TONSOKU (TSK) requires histone H3.1 unmethylated at lysine 27 for DNA repair at replication forks, but how TSK is recruited to double-strand break (DSB) sites remains unclear. In this study, we show that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of TSK recognizes the N-terminal tails of histone variants H2A.X and H2A.W—key for DNA repair in euchromatin and heterochromatin, respectively—but not the H2A.Z variant. A unique motif containing multiple basic and acidic residues (BAR motif) in H2A.Z prevents TSK binding. Moreover, disrupting TSK-H2A.X/W binding impairs TSK-mediated DNA repair. Genetic analyses reveal functional complementation between H2A.X and H2A.W in DNA repair, with the H2A.X N terminus being essential. This study reveals a previously unrecognized, H2A.X/W-dependent mechanism for recruiting the DNA repair protein TSK, highlighting the critical role of their N-terminal tails in plant DNA repair.",

In a THz pump-probe scheme, we observe long-lived oscillatory signals that we assign to out-of-plane breathing and in-plane shear modes, which are both dipole forbidden in the bulk. The relative excitation strength of these modes varies near defects, indicating that tip-induced local band bending modulates the coupling to the THz field.

In the past decade, metagenomics revealed that lineages outside of the Euryarchaeota superphylum encode genes for methanogenesis. This was recently confirmed through the cultivation of two classes of methanogenic Thermoproteota. Thus far, all methanogens within the Thermoproteota are predicted or were shown to be methylotrophic. The only exception to this are the Nezhaarchaea, for which metagenomic predictions suggest they are CO 2 -reducing methanogens. Here, we demonstrate methanogenic activity in a third class of Thermoproteota, the Methanonezhaarchaeia. Contrary to genomic predictions for this class, we cultivated a methylotrophic species, Candidatus Methanonezhaarchaeum fastidiosum YNP3N, highlighting the importance of testing metagenomic hypotheses through experimentation. We investigate the metabolic diversity of Methanonezhaarchaeia, including metabolic modifications accompanying frequent loss of methanogenesis in this class.

Here, we developed resource datasets in zebrafish that include a single-cell projectomic dataset, two independent scRNA-seq datasets, and a whole-brain 5-HT neuron functional imaging database at cellular resolution. The integrated analysis uncovered seven 5-HT subpopulations, each with unique axon projection patterns, specific soma locations, and distinctive genetic profiles. Within each subsystem, 5-HT neurons were functionally homogeneous, whereas across different subsystems, they were functionally heterogeneous. We further demonstrate that each 5-HT subsystem functions as a distinct module playing a role in multiple tasks, rather than being exclusive to one function. Moreover, the involvement of multiple parallel 5-HT subsystems, rather than a single subsystem, is fundamental to the accomplishment of a specific task.

We prioritized eight conservative transcription factors in glial cells in multiple brain regions, including RFX4 in astrocytes and IKZF1 in microglia, which are implicated in regulating sEOAD-associated genes.

Through single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis of lamprey, fish, bird, and mammalian retinas, we demonstrate cross-species conservation of cis-regulatory codes in all retinal cell classes despite extensive turnover of cis-regulatory regions. Conservation manifests as clustering of high-affinity transcription factor binding sites in cell class–specific open chromatin regions.

Here, we propose a non-Laplacian electrocoalescence strategy using space-charge emitter electrodes with an air gap, enabling corona-based charge injection to achieve electric fields up to 8 kilovolts per centimeter and an eightfold enhancement over conventional methods. The enhanced electrostatic field enables a 64-fold increase in dipole-dipole attraction forces, leading to accelerated droplet coalescence and separation across water fractions ranging from 2 to 20%, without chemical demulsifiers.

However, current fabrication methods often suffer from limited gradient precision, restricted material compatibility, and poor reproducibility. Here, we introduced gradient regulation via acoustofluidic dynamic engineering (GRADE), a programmable system to generate high-fidelity gradient biomaterials across different material systems. By incorporating focused interdigital transducers with the pulsed surface acoustic wave actuation, GRADE can achieve tunable and directional acoustic streaming (0 to 22 millimeters per second), which allows accurate regulation of the gradient magnitude and length. Its open microchannel design enables nondestructive extraction of centimeter-scale gradients and supports device reuse, enhancing practicality and scalability. In contrast to magnetic or electrospinning techniques that are limited to specific material types, the GRADE approach supports composition-independent fluid manipulation of a diverse group of biomaterials and cross-linking methods, thus providing greater versatility and translational potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate stiffness-dependent mechanosensation in stem cells cultured on customized gradient substrates, which validates the platform’s usability. The experimental results show that GRADE has the ability to uncover mechanobiological responses in physiologically relevant contexts. All these results establish GRADE as a powerful and versatile platform for gradient biomaterial fabrication.

Here, we reveal that the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptional regulator basic helix-loop-helix 35 (bHLH35) is required for plant acclimation to a specific set of MFSC conditions that includes a combination of salinity, excess light, and heat, occurring simultaneously (but not to each of these stresses applied individually or in any other combination). Under the three-stress combination, bHLH35 interacts with no apical meristem/transcription activator factor/cup-shaped cotyledon 69 (NAC069), binds the promoter of lateral organ boundaries domain 31 (LBD31) , and regulates the expression of transcripts involved in flavonoid metabolism and ethylene signaling.

          "abstract": "Rivers regulate land-ocean total phosphorus (TP) fluxes critical to ecosystem health and food security, yet global dynamics remain poorly understood due to limited observations. Here, we develop a machine learning framework integrating multimodal data and 280,000 TP measurements to reconstruct TP flux patterns over 1980–2019 across 420 major rivers. Results reveal a deceptive global equilibrium. While TP flux declines in the Northern Hemisphere, driven by dam trapping, particularly in Western Europe (−16.2%) and Eastern Asia (−8.7%), it rises in the Southern Hemisphere due to increased fertilizer use and deforestation, especially in Southern Africa (+15%) and the Malay Archipelago (+20.3%). Notably, the number of small rivers with rising TP flux is nearly double that of large rivers. This growing TP export from small rivers and Southern Hemisphere basins may intensify eutrophication, expand hypoxic zones, and threaten fishery yields. Our findings highlight a shifting global phosphorus landscape and underscore the need for more targeted, sustainable phosphorus management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Natural selection has produced diverse vision systems, from simple patches of photoreceptors to complex camera eyes, representing just one set of evolutionary outcomes. Computational evolution offers a way to systematically test hypotheses, isolate individual factors, and ask the “why” questions behind vision. We recreate vision evolution by coevolving eyes and behaviors in embodied agents and use this to illuminate principles shaping vision across different levels of the Marr’s hierarchy. This leads to three key findings: First, we provide computational evidence that task-specific selection drives bifurcation in eye evolution. Second, we reveal how optical innovations naturally emerge to resolve fundamental trade-offs between light collection and spatial precision. Third, we uncover scaling laws between visual acuity and neural processing that provide insights into long-standing hypothesis behind eye and brain size. Our work introduces a paradigm that uses embodied artificial intelligence (AI) as hypothesis-testing machines that can help accelerate discoveries in vision science.",

Their remarkably stable topology has recently been observed in electromagnetic waves. For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we report, both in theory and experiment, the concept of moiré plasmonic skyrmion clusters, where multiskyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster. By leveraging twistronics engineering of plasmonic nanostructures, we demonstrate both periodic and quasi-periodic optical skyrmions, revealing a large degree of topological control. In a misaligned composite nanostructure, the rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved, which is explained by a lattice model. This topological change of moiré plasmonic skyrmion clusters can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between composite nanostructures.",

Here, we performed noncoding RNA profiling of human breast cancer–induced secondary lymphedema. We identified the long intergenic non–protein coding RNA, P53-induced transcript ( LINC-PINT ), as essential for the lymphedema development. LINC-PINT is the most expressed lncRNA in human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) under stress condition. Knocking down LINC-PINT in LECs promotes the expression of inflammation-related genes. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq revealed that LINC-PINT induces the transcription of genes involved in lymphangiogenesis and immune cell adhesion by increasing chromatin accessibility. Notably, LINC-PINT deficiency impairs LEC proliferation, migration, and sprouting. Conditional deletion of Lnc-Pint in mouse lymphatic endothelium (Lnc-Pint lecko ) leads to a reduction in dermal lymphatic network density. Lnc-Pint lecko mice exhibit decreased lymphedema, reduced dermal backflow, fibrosis, and inflammation. Our findings unveil a crucial molecular role of LINC-PINT in lymphatic function and hold substantial clinical implications for lncRNA as biomarker of lymphedema.",

Here, we present a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the T4 bacteriophage topoisomerase II with a transport-segment DNA bound directly to its central domain. The structure reveals conformational rearrangements in the central domain that accommodate the transport-segment DNA, suggesting an alternative sequence of events in which the enzyme sliding along the loosely bound religated gate segment may precede transport-segment passage through the coiled-coil gate.

We propose a rapid and efficient electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor for the synchronous detection of multiple bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and methicillin-resistant S. aureus . This homogeneous sensor is based on a self-assembled DNA nanosphere loaded with tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP). The sensor operates in an “off-on” mode, in which bacterium-aptamer binding triggers a conformational change in the DNA nanosphere, releasing TCPP and generating an enhanced ECL signal. The inclusion of cerium nanoparticles boosts signal intensity through electrocatalytic reactions, improving sensitivity with a detection limit of ≤100 colony-forming units per milliliter. Integrated with a microfluidic chip, the system enables multibacterial detection in just 45 minutes. Bacterial quantification in clinical samples strongly correlates with digital polymerase chain reaction results. This approach provides a rapid, specific, and efficient diagnostic tool for bacterial infections with great potential for point-of-care applications in clinical settings.",

Ferroptosis, a newly recognized form of regulated cell death, contributes critically to SCI pathology, and targeting this process may enhance neuronal survival. Extracellular vesicles, key mediators of intercellular communication, are emerging as promising therapeutic agents for central nervous system injury. Here, we examined the role of athlete-derived plasma extracellular vesicles (AEVs) in neuronal ferroptosis and motor function recovery after SCI. In a murine model, AEVs markedly inhibited ferroptosis and improved motor outcomes. Mechanistically, AEVs delivered RNF216, which promoted ubiquitination and degradation of NOX1, thereby reducing ferroptotic damage and facilitating recovery. Moreover, RNF216-enriched vesicles enhanced synaptic plasticity, supporting neuronal regeneration and network reestablishment. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized RNF216-NOX1 axis in SCI and highlight AEVs as a previously unidentified therapeutic strategy.",

Estimated genomic changes in effective population size mirrored known whaling history and shifts in technology. In the Southern Ocean, a comparison of genomes from historical and contemporary populations indicated that the contemporary genomes have less diversity and an elevated realized mutation load for moderately deleterious mutations, likely due to the effects of whaling. Our results demonstrate that the relatively recent, brief, and marked depletion of humpback whale populations by whaling likely had subtle but discernible, negative, and lasting effects on the whales’ genomes. Thus, even as some humpback whale populations are now recovering to pre-exploitation numbers, they likely do so with a diminished adaptive capacity in the face of future conditions and threats.",

Increasingly, alterations to metabolic regulation offers insight into chronically inflamed macrophage function, which remains unexplored in peri-implant inflammation. Here, ex vivo profiling of metabolic dependence and capacity in peri-implant tissues revealed persistent glycolytic reliance by macrophages up to 6 weeks postimplantation. Expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) increased temporally and with proximity to the implant interface in glycolytically dependent cells, paired with increased capacity for biosynthetic pathways. Glycolytic dependence was notable in multinucleated macrophages, hallmark to the phagocytic behavior of implant pathology. Transcriptomic assessment correlated the up-regulation of pathological wound healing to cells where the capacity for glucose import was highest, highlighting glycolysis as the definitive metabolic system in persistent peri-implant inflammation.",

For all these applications, the TFTs must have a large on/off current ratio and a high transit frequency. A major challenge is to simultaneously maximize the on/off ratio and the transit frequency, because a high transit frequency requires a small channel length, which often leads to short-channel effects, including a large off-state drain current. Here, we lift this fundamental compromise and demonstrate organic TFTs that exhibit a complete absence of detrimental short-channel effects for channel lengths down to 300 nm, making it possible to simultaneously achieve the largest on/off current ratio (10 10 ) and the highest transit frequency (40 MHz) reported to date for flexible organic TFTs, despite the fact that these TFTs operate at very low voltages (≤3 V). These organic TFTs therefore meet the fundamental static and dynamic performance requirements for flexible, high-frequency, low-voltage, low-power electronic systems.",

Plasmonic structures can provide strong light confinement but suffer from ohmic losses. Recent advances in dielectric nanostructures enable strong light localization without metallic losses. However, previous studies primarily focused on minimizing the optical mode volume without adequately addressing light-matter interactions. Here, we demonstrate a nanolaser that colocalizes photons and excited carriers within a dielectric nanobridge. This extreme dielectric confinement of both light and matter yields a subdiffraction-limited mode volume and a subwavelength carrier volume without lateral quantum confinement. We observe a strong correlation between the mode field and carrier distribution, where enhanced mode localization produces stronger carrier confinement. By suppressing carrier surface recombination, this platform not only enables continuous-wave lasing at room temperature but also achieves a substantially reduced lasing threshold. We quantify the intensified interaction with an interaction volume, generalizing mode volume to a broad class of active media.",

Here, we demonstrate that quantum reservoir computing embodies a powerful alternative for witnessing quantum entanglement and, more generally, estimating quantum features from experimental data. We leverage the orbital angular momentum of photon pairs as an ancillary degree of freedom to enable informationally complete single-setting measurements of their polarization. Our approach does not require fine-tuning or refined knowledge of the setup, at the same time outperforming conventional approaches.

After conditional deletion of Dot1L in vitro, CD8 T cells retained in vivo proliferative capacity and antitumor reactivity. Moreover, Dot1L knockout CD8 T cells showed increased antigen-specific cytotoxicity toward tumor cells in vitro. Mechanistically, loss of DOT1L resulted in an altered cell state with loss of T cell and gain of innate-like features.

Here, we present a regiospecific topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition for synthesizing crystalline covalent helical polymers via a single–crystal–to–single–crystal transformation. Building on our prior glycine-proline–based systems, we investigated the effect of subtle modification: introducing a hydroxyl group to the proline unit. This minor change induced a helicity reversal (left- to right-handed) and a substantial reduction in pitch (8.9 to 4.9 Å). Single-crystal x-ray diffraction revealed that this profound reordering is driven by intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (C─H⋯O and O─H⋯N), acting as supramolecular bridges between helices, enabling denser packing. Consequently, the glycine-hydroxyproline–based polymer exhibited markedly enhanced mechanics, with a Young’s modulus of 18.57 ± 2.01 GPa and hardness of 1.09 ± 0.13 GPa, surpassing natural collagen. This study provides insights into controlling polymer topology and mechanics through subtle modifications, establishing a powerful paradigm for the design of next-generation helical materials with tailored functionalities.",

A dynamic, continuously tunable electro-mechano-acoustical model explains the mechanism and predicts frequency with R 2 = 0.990 . In emission, a 25.34-decibel sound pressure level gain was observed at resonance, enabling controllable, frequency-selective voice amplification for personalized output. In sensing, the LIG piezoresistive readout delivers sensitive transduction, while resonance matching amplifies weak, high-frequency cardiac sounds. Wearable tests on healthy volunteers and patients recorded clear S1/S2 and pathological murmurs. Integrated with AuscNet-H, a deep learning algorithm designed for heart sound classification, the system achieved 99.375% accuracy across four clinical classes. Under inflation, no false negatives occurred, and misclassifications among similar diseases were fewer than with a commercial electronic stethoscope. These results demonstrate a practical path toward intelligent, wearable auscultation.",

          "abstract": "High-throughput biomarker analysis traditionally relies on spatial distribution features, either naturally occurring or artificially engineered. Achieving multiplex detection in a homogeneous system without spatial distribution remains a challenge. Fluorescence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) exemplifies a spatially independent technology for targeted multiplex detection, but it is limited by spectral overlap. Here, we proposed spectral fingerprint PCR (sf-PCR), which leverages three-dimensional fluorescence spectral fingerprints to profile biomarker expression patterns. These fingerprints capture both the position and intensity of fluorescence peaks, increasing information density and offering a breakthrough in spectral overlap. In addition, sf-PCR exhibits linear superimposability and decodability, providing a solid foundation for data interpretability. Using a 10-plex sf-PCR model, we demonstrated sf-PCR’s capacity to fundamentally overcome spectral overlap limitations. Furthermore, sf-PCR has demonstrated clinical potential in cancer diagnosis and respiratory pathogen detection. This work underscores the potential of spectral fingerprints to enhance information density and fundamentally resolve challenges in homogeneous system analysis.",

However, their high-pressure application is severely hampered by the mechanical fragility stemming from weak interactions at grain boundaries.

These graphene oxide nanosheets act as a rigid wall, bridging soft MOF grains and dispersing accumulated stresses at grain boundaries under external loadings, thereby preventing structural cracking and enhancing the mechanical robustness of crystal membranes. By fine-tuning the morphology and content of nanosheets, the optimized NB–ZIF-8 membranes are endowed with unprecedented 50-bar pressure resistance and superior C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8 separation performance, with a separation factor &gt;240 maintained above 300 hours at industry-relevant pressure.

The role of aquatic factors (e.g., air bubbles) in the generation of MNPs is poorly understood. Here we show microbubbles that spontaneously form on seven typical plastics across a wide temperature range (25° to 95°C) and in various water types (deionized, tap, river, and marine water) can erode plastic surfaces and drive MNP release. Nucleation, expansion, and movement of microbubbles generate shear stresses capable of dislodging polymer protrusions at surface defect sites. This sweeping action, combined with the unbalanced surface tension forces at the three-phase contact line, generates O-shaped ring structures composed of accumulated polymers, which ultimately fragment leading to the release of MNPs into the aquatic environment. Our findings demonstrate that microbubble-induced erosion represents a low-energy pathway for micropollutant release.",

Using observations and model simulations, we reveal that atmospheric teleconnection from the western North Pacific accounts for ~26 to 40% of the interannual to decadal variability of the BKS sea ice during February-March-April. A poleward-propagating Rossby wave train, forced by divergent winds associated with the Western Pacific (WP) pattern, links WP to BKS sea ice variability by inducing lower-atmospheric circulation anomalies over the North Atlantic that enhance poleward heat and moisture transport. Furthermore, decadal shifts in the WP pattern, potentially originating from the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, have modulated the sea ice trend over the BKS, driving accelerated retreat in the 2000s and a slowdown after 2015. A projected transition of WP to its negative phase may accelerate BKS sea ice loss in the coming decade.",

The achievement is enabled by integrating the QDs with exceptional gain metrics with a seed-amplifier laser structure. Transient spectroscopy and theoretical simulation reveal that the narrow emission linewidth and large biexciton binding energy of the QDs act synergistically to enable an enhanced gain performance with submonoexcitonic threshold and record high–saturated gain cross section. A Littman-Metcalf cavity is designed to deliver the continuously tunable laser emission, and the synchronous amplification reaches the megawatt output.

          "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), widely distributed in the human genome, are usually epigenetically silenced but can be reactivated in cancer. Activated ERVs may act as regulatory elements or produce noncoding RNAs that modulate gene expression and affect tumor biology. Their role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), particularly in ferroptosis regulation, remains unclear. Here, we identify human endogenous retrovirus-H (HERVH) derived enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) aberrantly overexpressed in PDAC by integrating gene expression and histone modification data. Silencing HERVH markedly suppresses PDAC proliferation and tumor growth. Mechanistically, HERVH transcription is driven by the super-enhancer–associated transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), and HERVH eRNAs cooperate with KLF5 to transactivate a distal super-enhancer upstream of aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member 3 (ALDH1A3), increasing its expression. ALDH1A3 inhibits the reactive oxygen species/specificity protein 1/spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (ROS/Sp1/SAT1) cascade, reducing lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Disrupting this axis induces ferroptotic death and impairs PDAC development. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism in which HERVH-derived eRNAs regulate ferroptosis via super-enhancer–mediated transcriptional reprogramming and highlights the KLF5/HERVH/ALDH1A3 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in PDAC.",

Our observations reveal that the concentration of terephthalaldehyde (BDA) linkers not only influences the morphology of the primary COF-300 crystal seeds but also governs the facet evolution, leading to the generation of differently shaped COF-300 microcrystals. Mechanistic studies reveal that the observed shape evolution of COF-300 single crystals arises from distinct kinetically or thermodynamically controlled growth pathways, depending on the BDA concentration. Moreover, we uncover the shape-dependent deformation capacity after solvent uptake, demonstrating the impact of COF-300 crystal morphology on its performance. These discoveries elucidate the COF facet transition mechanism and offer guidance for the future design of single-crystal COFs.",

Knockdown of cki resulted in hyperproliferation that, combined with p53-1 knockdown, yielded tumor-like growths, indicating that cki and p53-1 are tumor suppressors in Schistosoma mansoni . cki homologs are ubiquitous in parasitic flatworms but are absent from their free-living ancestors, suggesting that cki may have come from horizontal gene transfer.

We identified two related but distinct neural manifolds: the sensory and perceptual manifolds. The sensory manifold was embedded in a three-dimensional subspace defined by three stimulus features, where contour orientations remained linearly inseparable. However, through a sequence of geometric transformations equivalent to twist operations, this three-dimensional sensory manifold expanded into a seven-dimensional perceptual manifold, enabling the linear separability of contour orientations. Computational modeling further demonstrated that this dimension expansion was facilitated by neurons exhibiting nonlinear mixed selectivity with heterogeneous response profiles. These findings provide insights into how biological neural networks enhance the dimensionality of representational spaces, illuminating the geometric mechanism underlying the transformation from sensation to perception.",

We introduce dynamic connectome-based predictive modeling (dCPM) to identify high temporal resolution, whole-brain functional connectivity networks, and show that distinct networks can successfully predict trial-level arousal (involving salience network) and subsequent memory (involving visual, frontoparietal, and default mode networks). We find that, under cortisol, brain networks associated with both processing arousal and forming memories have more structural and functional overlap. Neural networks that predict arousal are more consistent and strongly engaged under cortisol, whereas networks that predict memory are more specialized to emotional memoranda. Together, these results reveal a dynamic process by which cortisol shifts whole-brain mechanisms to amplify emotional memories: Cortisol amplifies arousal-predictive networks while tuning memory-predictive networks to prioritize emotionally salient information.",

However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the “immersion” mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance (~1 parsec), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 parsec, supporting the feasibility of this scenario.

Although previous studies implicate formin 1 (FRM1) in governing this process in Toxoplasma , the mechanisms that position it at the cell apex and regulate its activity during the transition from intracellular replication to active motility remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that FRM1 is complexed with a protein methyl transferase that stabilizes it from degradation and positions it at the cell apex. Moreover, we identify a conserved intramolecular interaction within FRM1 that serves as a critical regulatory switch that is functionally conserved in Plasmodium and other apicomplexan parasites. Using structural modeling combined with biochemical assays, we define two regulatory elements located upstream of the FH2 domain that mediate autoinhibition. Repositioning these elements by activation of an intramolecular switch relieves autoinhibition and activates actin polymerization by the FH2 domain. Collectively, these findings elucidate how precise regulation of FRM1 coordinates actin polymerization, parasite motility and host cell invasion.",

          "abstract": "The efficacy of oral delivery of biologic drugs for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment is substantially compromised by the swift enzymatic degradation and insufficient retention of biologics in the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we report a simple method for fabricating fluidic microgel assemblies (FMGAs) by introducing the hydrogen bonds between the microgel surfaces. These FMGAs with water content of 77% are flowable yet immiscible with water. Upon oral administration, these FMGAs form a large-area physical adhesive coating on the intestinal surface, extending intestinal retention time to at least 48 hours. The intermicrogel spaces within the assemblies can efficiently harbor therapeutic biologics (such as exosomes and TNFα antibody), protect them from the harsh intestinal microenvironment, and enable efficient delivery to intestinal lesion sites to restore intestinal barrier function and microbiota diversity in mouse and beagle models of IBD. We believe that the fluidic microgel assembly strategy holds great promise for oral delivery of labile biologics for the treatment of diverse gastrointestinal diseases.",

          "abstract": "Metal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are transformative optoelectronic platforms due to their tunable emission, high color purity, and broad color gamut. Nevertheless, the realization of high-luminance blue LEDs, particularly in the deep-blue spectral region, remains challenging compared to their green and red counterparts. This disparity is primarily attributed to the impaired charge transport kinetics and severe nonradiative recombination, both induced by the structural defects in wide-bandgap perovskites. Here, we address this issue through in situ growth of deep-blue–emitting perovskite single-crystal thin films (SCTFs). The resulting SCTFs exhibit exceptional crystallographic orientation, long-range structural ordering, and atomic-level smooth surfaces with a root mean square roughness of 109 picometers. In addition, the SCTFs show a low trap density of 6.9 × 10 14  per cubic centimeter. These structural advantages translate to a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 48% and suppressed nonradiative recombination, enabling deep-blue LEDs with a maximum electroluminescence luminance of 179 candelas per square meter at 419 nanometers.",

Here, we present in situ aircraft measurements of 5-day-old pyroCb smoke, addressing a critical observational gap in aerosol evolution from freshly emitted to weeks-to-months-aged states. The sampled smoke primarily contained unusually large aerosol particles (500 to 600 nanometers in diameter), formed through cloud processing and efficient coagulation in the UT/LS. Compared to smaller particles in typical non-pyroCb smoke, these large particles increase outgoing radiation by 30 to 36%, substantially enhancing atmospheric radiative cooling. Climate models may greatly underestimate this cooling effect by assuming smaller aerosol sizes for pyroCb smoke. As pyroCb events become more frequent, accurately representing their aerosol properties is essential for improving climate projections.",

By combining cellular and transcriptomic approaches, we show that common CD8 + T cell clusters with a similar transcriptional profile infiltrate NL and peri-lesional (PL) skin of patients with vitiligo. Pathways related to immune activation were more active in T cells from PL skin, while those related to immune regulation were enriched in NL skin T cells, also evidenced by the stronger infiltration of regulatory T cells and the higher expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) by CD8 + T cells in NL skin. Treatment of patients with baricitinib led to an increase in regulatory T cells and CD8 + T cells expressing PD-1 in repigmented skin.

We identify chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) as a key mediator linking immune activation to fibrotic remodeling in MASH. Across hepatocyte-macrophage coculture and recombinant interleukin-17A (IL-17A) stimulation assays, we delineate a hepatocyte-associated IL-17A signal that augments macrophage CHI3L1 expression via c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling. CHI3L1 then binds to IL-13Rα2 on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), triggering a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) cascade that induces lipocalin-2 (LCN2), promoting HSC activation and fibrosis. Using cell-specific knockout models, we show that deleting Chi3l1 in macrophages or Il13ra2 in HSCs markedly reduces liver inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, CHI3L1-neutralizing antibodies disrupt this circuit and significantly improve disease outcomes in mice. These findings uncover a complete IL-17A–CHI3L1–IL-13Rα2–LCN2 signaling network, positioning CHI3L1 as both a mechanistic effector and a promising therapeutic target in MASH-fibrosis.",

Using activity-dependent genetic labeling, we tagged NST neurons activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and showed that their chemogenetic activation strongly promotes NREM sleep. These NST neurons project extensively to the parabrachial nucleus (PB), where LPS-activated neurons also promote NREM sleep. Fiber photometry recording of several wake-promoting neuromodulators using their biosensors showed that evoked norepinephrine release from locus coeruleus neurons is markedly reduced by either LPS injection or direct activation of NST or PB sickness neurons.

One of the great challenges in broader applications of insect wing–inspired surfaces is to mass-produce insect-wing nanoarchitectures (IWNs) on ultrathin and durable substrates that can be integrated onto any planar/nonplanar surfaces. This study presents a simple method for producing IWNs on ultrathin polyimide (PI) films. An ultraviolet laser irradiates the PI-glass interface, generating gas that induces the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of nanobubbles, leading to the formation of nanopillars at the interface. Mechanical peeling then delaminates the PI film from glass along the middle of these nanopillars, creating IWNs on both PI film and glass. The artificial wing membrane (thickness &lt; 500 nanometers) closely mimics natural dragonfly wings and can be seamlessly integrated onto contact lenses, demonstrating enhanced optical and bactericidal capabilities.

One interpretation holds that a low-relief, low-lying West Antarctic landscape supported a &gt;1500-kilometer transcontinental river system. Alternatively, higher-relief topography in central West Antarctica formed a drainage divide between the Ross and Amundsen seas. Here, zircon U-Pb data from Amundsen Sea Embayment sediments are examined alongside known regional bedrock provenance signatures. These analyses suggest that all observed provenance indicators in the Eocene sandstone derive from West Antarctic rocks.

Here, we identify the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)/GRP receptor (GRPR) system in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (MO)–nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway as critical for regulating chronic pain and its affective dimensions. Using multimodal approaches (fiber photometry, chemogenetics, optogenetics, and Raman spectroscopy), we show that chronic pain reduces NAc Grpr neuron excitability and MO-to-NAc GRP release. Chemogenetic inhibition or GRPR knockdown in NAc Grpr neurons induces pain phenotypes in naive mice; optogenetic activation of NAc Grpr neurons or NAc GRP supplementation alleviates these in chronic pain mice. MO Grp -to-NAc activation mirrors therapeutic effects. Raman mapping shows fivefold lower NAc GRP after nerve injury, correlating with reduced neuronal activity. These findings establish the MO Grp -NAc Grpr circuit as a central integrator and GRP/GRPR as a dual therapeutic target for chronic pain, uncovering a neuropeptide-mediated cortical-limbic pain mechanism.",

          "abstract": "We develop a unified and exact quantum geometric framework to understand and model molecular reactive quantum dynamics. The critical roles of quantum geometry of adiabatic electronic states in both adiabatic and nonadiabatic quantum dynamics are unveiled. A numerically exact geometric quantum molecular dynamics method is developed via discrete local trivialization of the projected electronic Hilbert space bundle over nuclear configuration space, eliminating all singularities from nonanalytic adiabatic electronic states. In it, the singular electronic quantum geometric tensor—Abelian for adiabatic dynamics and non-Abelian for nonadiabatic dynamics—is fully encoded in the global electronic overlap matrix. Numerical illustrations demonstrate that atomic motion, whether adiabatic or nonadiabatic, is governed not only by variations in electronic energies (potential energy surfaces) but also by variations in electronic states (electronic quantum geometry). Beyond quantum molecular dynamics, the strategy of discrete local trivialization can be extended to describe quantum dynamics, possibly non-Hermitian, on arbitrary, especially nondifferential fiber bundles.",
