          "authors": "Amanda Hollis-Brusky",
          "abstract": "Donald Trump and Trumpism have transformed the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, two institutions at the heart of the conservative legal movement. In this article, I use the conservative philosophy of fusionism as a lens for understanding the causes and consequences of the transformation. The original fusionism of William F. Buckley and Frank S. Meyer brought disparate factions of conservatives together under the mantle of libertarian means to conservative ends. Here, I show that Trump and Trumpism have transmogrified that original concept into a “new fusionism” of authoritarian means to Christian nationalist ends . I investigate the extent to which this “new fusionism” has been embraced or endorsed by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society and what the consequences might be for the respectability and efficacy of the conservative legal movement after Trump.",

          "abstract": "I examine the tension between Donald Trump’s perception of the judiciary—marked by a form of legal realism—and the Supreme Court’s stated commitment to judicial bipartisanship and independence. I analyze Trump’s public criticisms of judicial rulings that counter his personal interests and his criticism of his own appointees and other Republican-appointed justices who do not always rule in his favor to highlight how the court’s claim of independence is complicated by political science data showing that judges often align with the ideological leanings of the party whose president appointed them. This analysis ultimately reveals a growing disconnect between the judiciary’s stated ideals and the political pressures present in an increasingly polarized environment.",

          "abstract": "The Roberts court has long been characterized as a “probusiness” court, given the ostensible orientation of the court’s Republican-appointed majority and assumptions that President Trump’s appointments have magnified that orientation. But there are reasons to question this characterization. Quantitative analyses often fail to account for the relative importance of individual decisions, the broader legal context in which the court’s decisions are made, or the ways in which decisions can alter or depart from preexisting legal baselines. I show that President Trump’s appointments to the court have fairly consistently voted to restrain the power of administrative agencies, but they have not consistently supported outcomes that are beneficial to business. In cases involving state laws that may fragment or burden national markets, the Roberts court may actually be less sympathetic to business interests than it was prior to Trump’s appointments.",

          "abstract": "The articles in this volume, written by leading law professors, political scientists, and journalists, center on the impact of President Donald Trump on the U.S. Supreme Court and the impact of the court on the second Trump administration and on all Americans. President Trump has already appointed a third of the current court and may appoint more than half. Considering that the second Trump administration has sought to “flood the zone” with executive actions during its first 100 days, the court’s rulings have become massively significant for American governance and for the lives of people in our nation and around the world. The four sections of the volume consider the rise of the “Trump court,” the court’s recent rulings on judicial and executive power and on a range of basic rights, its standing in the public’s eyes, and how it stacks up against high courts in other democracies.",

          "abstract": "The politics of appointments have transformed the U.S. Supreme Court in recent years. We examine why and how the current conservative supermajority on the court came to be, with a particular focus on how this court stands apart from earlier ones. We trace the factors that allowed President Donald Trump to reshape the court with his three appointments in his first term and evaluate the importance of the conservative supermajority by connecting it to theories of the court’s collective decision-making. We show that the current court is the culmination of a “partisan sort” in appointments—a strict correlation between party and ideology—that began a few decades ago but did not fully crystallize until the 2010s. Finally, we summarize simulations that show why conservatives are likely to control the court for several decades.",

Harvard realizes conceptions about race and the post–Civil War amendments present in the Roberts court’s jurisprudence for several years including, notably, deep skepticism about the continuing need for civil rights remedies and a reading of colorblindness as the core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. Conservative litigation groups and the Trump administration are now using the SFFA decision to challenge race-conscious affirmative action programs and fundamental racial justice and civil rights laws and policies. While the Supreme Court has so far declined to adopt the farthest-reaching colorblindness arguments and has even expanded the reach of civil rights statutes in certain contexts, the next few years will likely be consequential for racial justice and antidiscrimination law. The court will almost certainly take up cases challenging the constitutionality of long-standing civil rights laws and recent racially reparative efforts.",

          "abstract": "The current Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on issues of executive power differs markedly depending on the precise type of executive power in question. Although generally taking an expansive view of presidential power, it often seeks to narrow the authority of executive branch administrative agencies, especially those engaged in regulation. This contrast creates an appearance of inconsistency: At the same time that the court is expanding presidential power, it is pulling back on administrative action and thereby denying the presidency one of its most important sources of authority. But the court’s approach is more coherent if it is understood as aimed at implementation of a conservative legal and political agenda. Moreover, by both expanding presidential powers and limiting administrative authority, the court’s decisions aggrandize judicial power at the expense of the political branches.",

Jackson Women’s Health Organization was highly predictable, the decision nonetheless came as a shock to the political and legal systems—and, based on the justices’ first encounters with the post- Dobbs world during the 2023–2024 term, it was perhaps even a shock to the court itself. Women played little more than a walk-on role both in the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion (a decision essentially about doctors) and in the repudiation of that right (a decision essentially about fetuses). But now, in the half of the country where even medically necessary abortion is unavailable after Dobbs , concerns for pregnant women and their fate dominate, and the justices appear no longer so certain that they are finished with abortion. Their work, in fact, may be just beginning.",

I compare the apex courts of 38 Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, finding that the power and role of the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) makes it unique among them. SCOTUS’s appointment process, lifelong judicial terms, agenda-setting powers, consensus norms, and constitutional framework make it an exceptionally powerful and exceptionally partisan court. Further, several factors that encourage a tendency toward the protection of rights in other apex courts are less relevant to SCOTUS. This comparison highlights that SCOTUS is the most partisan of the OECD apex courts, among the most powerful, and relatively less likely than other courts to uphold core democratic principles.",

          "abstract": "Chief Justice John Roberts is often called an “institutionalist,” indicating that he places the good of the Supreme Court as a governing institution over his own political preferences. This description is true only to a limited extent. The historical institutionalist analysis presented here shows that Roberts’s priority is to advance his version of the modern conservative legal movement’s vision of the Constitution, and that he protects the judiciary as an institution in the service of that cause. But because many Americans do not share that vision of constitutionalism, and because its endorsement of executive power may undermine judicial authority, the decisions of the Roberts court may only compound the difficulties facing both the court and the country today. I also discuss implications of the Chief Justice’s disposition, both for the court and for the nation’s evolving conception of constitutionalism.",

          "abstract": "Over the past half century, Republican leaders have had considerable success enlisting courts in their campaign to boost the party’s electoral prospects through the suppression of voting and the manipulation of election rules. Donald Trump has embraced this mission and escalated the assault on America’s electoral processes in new and dangerous ways. Has the Supreme Court supported or opposed this contemptible project? Its recent election law decisions offer a mixed verdict, though its performance mostly leans in an antidemocratic direction. The court’s decisions safeguarding democracy are fewer than those that undermine voting rights and elections, are typically handed down over the objections of Trump’s appointees, and often include doctrinal provisions that enable it to restrict democratic participation in the future. Whether the Supreme Court will abet or discourage the erosion of American democracy in the future is an open question.",

          "abstract": "The U.S. Supreme Court’s embrace of originalism, and particularly the “history and tradition” method of interpreting constitutional text, is often justified by its defenders as constraining judges from making up the law to match their preferences. This is a testable hypothesis. With the Bruen case in 2022, the Supreme Court moved away from a contemporary means-ends method of interpreting the Second Amendment to an originalist, “history and tradition” one. In this article, we analyze data on gun rights decisions handed down by lower federal courts from 2000 to 2023, finding that the Supreme Court’s switch to an originalist jurisprudence did not, in fact, constrain judges—rather, it corresponds with an increase in judicial discretion. Personal factors like partisan identity, gender, race, and careerist considerations shape judicial behavior in the post- Bruen era in ways they did not under the prior regime.",

The data analyzed here reinforce evidence from earlier studies that the Dobbs ruling produced a substantial hit to the court’s institutional legitimacy. Why and how did this occur? A dominant model of attitude change posits that short-term evaluations of the court’s performance are informed by individual rulings and readily evolve but that institutional loyalty originates from different sources and is resistant to change. Loyalty is not entirely impervious to change, however: This research suggests that controversial decisions can cause a realignment of both types of court attitudes and that this seems to have happened with Dobbs . But, as I show via an experiment, evaluations typically change first, and under some (but perhaps extraordinary) circumstances, changed evaluations can undermine institutional loyalty.",

It argues that these justices have failed to articulate a persuasive rationale as to why exactly the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings and that they have failed to adequately show that history supports their “no-coercion” construction of what constitutes a prohibited establishment. Concerning the Free Exercise Clause, the court’s conservatives have dismissed history by disregarding historical practices that do not conform to their approach to the text. The court’s use, misuse, and nonuse of history cannot help but give the impression that policy preferences—more than history or the actual original understanding of the First Amendment—have determined recent church-state decisions.",

          "abstract": "The Roberts court’s immigration jurisprudence has reinforced the discretionary powers of the government and sharply limited constitutional constraints on the exercise of those powers. As a result, the protection of immigrants’ rights increasingly has become a matter of executive grace. Discretion plays a crucial role in the execution of immigration law, and through its use, the executive can promote humanitarian objectives. But even when protective discretionary acts receive the imprimatur of courts, they do not provide lasting security because they are only as good as the policy preferences of the president in power. Indeed, discretion can also perpetuate overly aggressive enforcement in pursuit of those preferences. The checks the Roberts court has imposed on the operation of the enforcement system tend to reflect a skepticism of government, rather than a meaningful regard for the rights and interests of immigrants, leaving Congress as the only meaningful source of stability for the system and for immigrants themselves.",

In infancy and early childhood, boys and girls exhibit similar core knowledge of number and space3,4,5,6,7,8. Gender disparities in maths are, therefore, thought to primarily reflect an internalization of the sociocultural stereotype that ‘girls are bad at maths’. However, where, when and how widely this stereotype becomes entrenched remains uncertain. Here, we report the results of a 4-year longitudinal assessment of language and mathematical performance of all French first and second graders (2,653,082 children). Boys and girls exhibited very similar maths scores upon school entry, but a gender gap in favour of boys became highly significant after 4 months of schooling and reached an effect size of about 0.20 after 1 year. These findings were repeated each year and varied only slightly across family, class or school type and socio-economic level. Although schooling correlated with age, exploiting the near-orthogonal variations indicated that the gender gap increased with schooling rather than with age. These findings point to the first year of school as the time and place where a maths gender gap emerges in favour of boys, thus helping focus the search for solutions and interventions.",

          "abstract": "Understanding thermal transport mechanisms across material interfaces is crucial for advancing semiconductor technologies, particularly in miniaturized devices operating under extreme power densities1,2. Although the interface phonon-mediated processes are theoretically established3,4,5,6 as the dominant mechanism for interfacial thermal transport in semiconductors7, their nanoscale dynamics remain experimentally elusive owing to challenges in measuring the temperature and non-equilibrium phonon distributions across the buried interface8,9,10,11. Here we overcome these limitations by using in situ vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an electron microscope to nanoscale profile temperature gradients across the AlN–SiC interface during thermal transport and map its non-equilibrium phonon occupations at sub-nanometre resolution. We observe a sharp temperature drop within about 2 nm across the interface, enabling direct extraction of relative interfacial thermal resistance (ITR). During thermal transport, the mismatch of phonon modes’ thermal conductivity at the interface causes substantial non-equilibrium phonons nearby, making the populations of interface modes different under forward and reverse heat flow and also leading to marked changes in the modal temperature of AlN optical phonons within about 3 nm of the interface. These results reveal the phonon transport dynamics at the (sub-)nanoscale and establish the inelastic phonon scattering mechanism involved by interface modes, offering valuable insights into the engineering of thermal interfaces.",

          "abstract": "Trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) are important to marine life and are essential tools for studying ocean processes 1 . Two different frameworks have arisen regarding marine TEI cycling: reversible scavenging favours water-column control on TEI distributions 2–5 , and seafloor boundary exchange emphasizes sedimentary imprints on water-column biogeochemistry 6,7 . These two views lead to disparate interpretations of TEI behaviours 8–10 . Here we use rare earth elements and neodymium isotopes as exemplar tracers of particle scavenging 11 and boundary exchange 6,7,12 . We integrate these data with models of particle cycling and sediment diagenesis to propose a general framework for marine TEI cycling. We show that, for elements with greater affinity for manganese oxide than biogenic particles, scavenging is a net sink throughout the water column, contrary to a common assumption for reversible scavenging 3,13 . In this case, a benthic flux supports increasing elemental concentrations with water depth. This sedimentary source consists of two components: one recycled from elements scavenged by water-column particles, and another newly introduced to the water column through marine silicate weathering inside sediment 8,14,15 . Abyssal oxic diagenesis drives this benthic source, and exerts a strong influence on water-column biogeochemistry through seafloor geometry and bottom-intensified turbulent mixing 16,17 . Our findings affirm the role of authigenic minerals, often overshadowed by biogenic particles, in water-column cycling 18 , and suggest that the abyssal seafloor, often regarded as inactive, is a focus of biogeochemical transformation 19,20 .",

          "abstract": "Chest radiography frequently serves as baseline imaging for most lung diseases1. Deep learning has great potential for automating the interpretation of chest radiography2. However, existing chest radiographic deep learning models are limited in diagnostic scope, generalizability, adaptability, robustness and extensibility. To overcome these limitations, we have developed Ark+, a foundation model applied to chest radiography and pretrained by cyclically accruing and reusing the knowledge from heterogeneous expert labels in numerous datasets. Ark+ excels in diagnosing thoracic diseases. It expands the diagnostic scope and addresses potential misdiagnosis. It can adapt to evolving diagnostic needs and respond to novel diseases. It can learn rare conditions from a few samples and transfer to new diagnostic settings without training. It tolerates data biases and long-tailed distributions, and it supports federated learning to preserve privacy. All codes and pretrained models have been released, so that Ark+ is open for fine-tuning, local adaptation and improvement. It is extensible to several modalities. Thus, it is a foundation model for medical imaging. The exceptional capabilities of Ark+ stem from our insight: aggregating various datasets diversifies the patient populations and accrues knowledge from many experts to yield unprecedented performance while reducing annotation costs3. The development of Ark+ reveals that open models trained by accruing and reusing knowledge from heterogeneous expert annotations with a multitude of public (big or small) datasets can surpass the performance of proprietary models trained on large data. We hope that our findings will inspire more researchers to share code and datasets or federate privacy-preserving data to create open foundation models with diverse, global expertise and patient populations, thus accelerating open science and democratizing AI for medicine.",

          "authors": "Hannah L. Payne, Dmitriy Aronov",
          "abstract": "Vision enables many animals to perform spatial reasoning from remote locations1. By viewing distant landmarks, animals recall spatial memories and plan future trajectories. Although these spatial functions depend on hippocampal place cells2,3, the relationship between place cells and active visual behaviour is unknown. Here we studied a highly visual animal, the chickadee, in a behaviour that required alternating between remote visual search and spatial navigation. We leveraged the head-directed nature of avian vision to track gaze in freely moving animals. We discovered a profound link between place coding and gaze. Place cells activated not only when the chickadee was in a specific location, but also when it simply gazed at that location from a distance. Gaze coding was precisely timed by fast ballistic head movements called ‘head saccades’4,5. On each saccadic cycle, the hippocampus switched between encoding a prediction of what the bird was about to see and a reaction to what it actually saw. The temporal structure of these responses was coordinated by subclasses of interneurons that fired at different phases of the saccade. We suggest that place and gaze coding are components of a unified process by which the hippocampus represents the location that is relevant to the animal in each moment. This process allows the hippocampus to implement both local and remote spatial functions.",

          "abstract": "Eutyrannosaurians were large predatory dinosaurs that dominated Asian and North American terrestrial faunas in latest Cretaceous times. These apex predators arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids during the ‘middle’ Cretaceous that are poorly known owing to the paucity of fossil material1,2,3. Here we report on a new tyrannosauroid, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis gen. et sp. nov., from lower Upper Cretaceous deposits of Mongolia that provides a new perspective on eutyrannosaurian origins and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses recover Khankhuuluu immediately outside Eutyrannosauria and recover the massive, deep-snouted Tyrannosaurini and the smaller, gracile, shallow-snouted Alioramini as highly derived eutyrannosaurian sister clades. Khankhuuluu and the late-diverging Alioramini independently share features related to a shallow skull and gracile build with juvenile eutyrannosaurians, reinforcing the key role heterochrony had in eutyrannosaurian evolution. Although eutyrannosaurians were mainly influenced by peramorphosis or accelerated growth4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Alioramini is revealed as a derived lineage that retained immature features through paedomorphosis and is not a more basal lineage as widely accepted11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Our results reveal that Asian tyrannosauroids (similar to Khankhuuluu) dispersed to North America, giving rise to Eutyrannosauria in the mid-Late Cretaceous. Eutyrannosauria diversified and remained exclusively in North America until a single dispersal to Asia in the latest Cretaceous that established Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini. Stark morphological differences between Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini probably evolved due to divergent heterochronic trends—paedomorphosis versus peramorphosis, respectively—allowing them to coexist in Asia and occupy different ecological niches.",

Recent advancements in digital image reconstruction have helped to envision treatment results, although without any direct means of achieving them5,6,7,8. Here I describe the physically applied digital restoration of a painting, a highly damaged oil-on-panel attributed to the Master of the Prado Adoration from the late fifteenth century. In parallel, 5,612 losses spanning 66,205 mm2 and 57,314 colours were infilled with a reversible laminate mask comprising a colour-accurate bilayer of printed pigments on polymeric films. To ensure the effectiveness of the restoration, ethical principles in painting conservation were implemented quantitatively for digital mask construction, a critically important foundation lacking in the current digital restoration literature. The infill process took 3.5 h, an estimated 66 times faster than conventional inpainting, and the result closely matched the simulation. This approach grants greatly increased foresight and flexibility to conservators, enabling the restoration of countless damaged paintings deemed unworthy of high conservation budgets.",

However, existing random number generators have limitations—the generation processes cannot be fully traced, audited and certified to be unpredictable. The algorithmic steps used in pseudorandom number generators5 are auditable, but they cannot guarantee that their outputs were a priori unpredictable given knowledge of the initial seed. Device-independent quantum random number generators6,7,8,9 can ensure that the source of randomness was unknown beforehand, but the steps used to extract the randomness are vulnerable to tampering. Here we demonstrate a fully traceable random number generation protocol based on device-independent techniques. Our protocol extracts randomness from unpredictable non-local quantum correlations, and uses distributed intertwined hash chains to cryptographically trace and verify the extraction process. This protocol forms the basis for a public traceable and certifiable quantum randomness beacon that we have launched10. Over the first 40 days of operation, we completed the protocol 7,434 out of 7,454 attempts—a success rate of 99.7%. Each time the protocol succeeded, the beacon emitted a pulse of 512 bits of traceable randomness. The bits are certified to be uniform with error multiplied by actual success probability bounded by 2−64. The generation of certifiable and traceable randomness represents a public service that operates with an entanglement-derived advantage over comparable classical approaches.",

We overcame the challenge of lacking ground-truth speech for training the neural decoder and were able to accurately synthesize his voice. Along with phonemic content, we were also able to decode paralinguistic features from intracortical activity, enabling the participant to modulate his BCI-synthesized voice in real time to change intonation and sing short melodies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of enabling people with paralysis to speak intelligibly and expressively through a BCI.",

          "abstract": "Plasma membrane integrity is vital for nearly all aspects of cell functioning1. Mechanical forces can cause plasma membrane damage2, but it is not known whether there are large molecules that regulate plasma membrane integrity under mechanical strain. Here we constructed a 384-well cellular stretch system that delivers precise, reproducible strain to cultured cells. Using the system, we screened 10,843 siRNAs targeting 2,726 multi-pass transmembrane proteins for strain-induced membrane permeability changes. The screen identified NINJ1, a protein recently proposed to regulate pyroptosis and other lytic cell death3,4, as the top hit. We demonstrate that NINJ1 is a critical regulator for mechanical strain-induced plasma membrane rupture (PMR), without the need of stimulating any cell death programs. NINJ1 level on the plasma membrane is inversely correlated to the amount of force required to rupture the membrane. In the pyroptosis context, NINJ1 on its own is not sufficient to fully rupture the membrane, and additional mechanical force is required for full PMR. Our work establishes that NINJ1 functions as a bona fide determinant of membrane biomechanical properties. Our study also suggests that PMR across tissues of distinct mechanical microenvironments is subjected to fine tuning by differences in NINJ1 expression and external forces.",

          "abstract": "Plants make complex and potent therapeutic molecules 1,2 , but sourcing these molecules from natural producers or through chemical synthesis is difficult, which limits their use in the clinic. A prominent example is the anti-cancer therapeutic paclitaxel (sold under the brand name Taxol), which is derived from yew trees ( Taxus species) 3 . Identifying the full paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway would enable heterologous production of the drug, but this has yet to be achieved despite half a century of research 4 . Within Taxus ’ large, enzyme-rich genome 5 , we suspected that the paclitaxel pathway would be difficult to resolve using conventional RNA-sequencing and co-expression analyses. Here, to improve the resolution of transcriptional analysis for pathway identification, we developed a strategy we term multiplexed perturbation × single nuclei (mpXsn) to transcriptionally profile cell states spanning tissues, cell types, developmental stages and elicitation conditions. Our data show that paclitaxel biosynthetic genes segregate into distinct expression modules that suggest consecutive subpathways. These modules resolved seven new genes, allowing a de novo 17-gene biosynthesis and isolation of baccatin III, the industrial precursor to Taxol, in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, at levels comparable with the natural abundance in Taxus needles. Notably, we found that a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like protein, FoTO1, is crucial for promoting the formation of the desired product during the first oxidation, resolving a long-standing bottleneck in paclitaxel pathway reconstitution. Together with a new β-phenylalanine-CoA ligase, the eight genes discovered here enable the de novo biosynthesis of 3’- N -debenzoyl-2’-deoxypaclitaxel. More broadly, we establish a generalizable approach to efficiently scale the power of co-expression analysis to match the complexity of large, uncharacterized genomes, facilitating the discovery of high-value gene sets.",

X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have extended many optical techniques to X-rays for their advantages of ångström-scale spatial resolution and elemental specificity9. An example is XFEL-driven inner-shell Kα1 (2p3/2 → 1s1/2) X-ray lasing in elements ranging from neon to copper, which has been used for nonlinear spectroscopy and development of new X-ray laser sources10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Here we show that strong lasing effects similar to those in the optical regime can occur at 1.5–2.1 Å wavelengths during high-intensity (>1019 W cm−2) XFEL-driven Kα1 lasing of copper and manganese. Depending on the temporal XFEL pump pulse substructure, the resulting X-ray pulses (about 106−108 photons) can exhibit strong spatial inhomogeneities and spectral splitting, inhomogeneities and broadening. Three-dimensional Maxwell–Bloch calculations17 show that the observed spatial inhomogeneities result from X-ray filamentation and that the broad spectral features are driven by sub-femtosecond Rabi cycling. Our simulations indicate that these X-ray pulses can have pulse lengths of less than 100 attoseconds and coherence properties that provide opportunities for quantum X-ray optics applications.",

To meet metabolic demands, many cancers take up extracellular lipids2,3,4,5; however, how these lipids contribute to cancer growth and progression remains poorly understood. Here, using functional genetic screens, we identify uptake of lipoproteins—the primary mechanism for lipid transport in circulation—as a key determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer. Lipoprotein supplementation robustly inhibits ferroptosis across diverse cancer types, primarily through the delivery of α-tocopherol (α-toc), the most abundant form of vitamin E in human lipoproteins. Mechanistically, cancer cells take up lipoproteins through a pathway dependent on sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to cell-surface proteoglycans. Disrupting GAG biosynthesis or acutely degrading surface GAGs reduces lipoprotein uptake, sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis and impairs tumour growth in mice. Notably, human clear cell renal cell carcinomas—a lipid-rich malignancy—exhibit elevated levels of chondroitin sulfate and increased lipoprotein-derived α-toc compared with normal kidney tissue. Together, our study establishes lipoprotein uptake as a critical anti-ferroptotic mechanism in cancer and implicates GAG biosynthesis as a therapeutic target.",

          "abstract": "Although cell-fate specification is generally attributed to transcriptional regulation, emerging data also indicate a role for molecules linked with intermediary metabolism. For example, α-ketoglutarate (αKG), which fuels energy production and biosynthetic pathways in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is also a co-factor for chromatin-modifying enzymes 1–3 . Nevertheless, whether TCA-cycle metabolites regulate cell fate during tissue homeostasis and regeneration remains unclear. Here we show that TCA-cycle enzymes are expressed in the intestine in a heterogeneous manner, with components of the αKG dehydrogenase complex 4–6 upregulated in the absorptive lineage and downregulated in the secretory lineage. Using genetically modified mouse models and organoids, we reveal that 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), the enzymatic subunit of the αKG dehydrogenase complex, has a dual, lineage-specific role. In the absorptive lineage, OGDH is upregulated by HNF4 transcription factors to maintain the bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs of enterocytes. In the secretory lineage, OGDH is downregulated through a process that, when modelled, increases the levels of αKG and stimulates the differentiation of secretory cells. Consistent with this, in mouse models of colitis with impaired differentiation and maturation of secretory cells, inhibition of OGDH or supplementation with αKG reversed these impairments and promoted tissue healing. Hence, OGDH dependency is lineage-specific, and its regulation helps to direct cell fate, offering insights for targeted therapies in regenerative medicine.",

Sacrificial additives, namely, hypophosphorous acid and ammonium chloride, were used to induce nucleation and crystallization of caesium lead bromide, resulting in monocrystal grains with minimized trap density and a high photoluminescence quantum yield. Benefiting from the high carrier mobility and suppressed Auger recombination, we obtained efficient PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency reaching 22.0%, which remained above 20% at a high current density near 1,000 mA cm−2 and a brightness of over 1,167,000 cd m−2. Furthermore, benefiting from the suppressed ion migration and better thermal stability, the extrapolated half-lifetime of the weakly space-confined PeLEDs increased to 185,600 h under an initial luminance of 100 cd m−2 at room temperature.

Some models predict that stars form in predominantly atomic gas at low metallicity4,5, in contrast to molecular gas at higher metallicities6. Despite repeated searches7, cold molecular gas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% solar metallicity8. Here we report the detection of rotational emission from molecular hydrogen near the only O-type star in the 3% solar metallicity galaxy Leo P (refs. 9,10) with JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument/Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MIRI-MRS) observing mode. These observations place a lower limit on Leo P’s molecular gas content, and modelling of the photodissociation region illuminated by the O star suggests a compact (≤2.6 pc radius), approximately 104 M⊙ cloud. We also report a stringent upper limit on carbon monoxide (CO) emission from a deep search with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Our results highlight the power of MIRI-MRS to characterize even small ultraviolet-illuminated molecular clouds in the low-metallicity regime, in which the traditional observational tracer CO is uninformative. This discovery pushes the limiting metallicity at which molecular gas is present in detectable quantities more than a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance for models of the interstellar medium in early galaxies.",

          "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells use inhibitory and activating immune receptors to differentiate between human cells and pathogens. Signalling by these receptors determines whether an NK cell becomes activated and destroys a target cell. In some cases, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, immune receptors are found in pairs, with inhibitory and activating receptors containing nearly identical extracellular ligand-binding domains coupled to different intracellular signalling domains 1 . Previous studies showed that repetitive interspersed family (RIFIN) proteins, displayed on the surfaces of Plasmodium falciparum -infected erythrocytes, can bind to inhibitory immune receptors and dampen NK cell activation 2,3 , reducing parasite killing. However, no pathogen-derived ligand has been identified for any human activating receptor. Here we identified a clade of RIFINs that bind to inhibitory immune receptor KIR2DL1 more strongly than KIR2DL1 binds to the human ligand (MHC class I). This interaction mediates inhibitory signalling and suppresses the activation of KIR2DL1-expressing NK cells. We show that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs are abundant in field-isolated strains from both Africa and Asia and reveal how the two RIFINs bind to KIR2DL1. The RIFIN binding surface of KIR2DL1 is conserved in the cognate activating immune receptor KIR2DS1. We find that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs can also bind to KIR2DS1, resulting in the activation of KIR2DS1-expressing NK cells. This study demonstrates that activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors can recruit NK cells to target a pathogen and reveals a potential role for activating immune receptors in controlling malaria infection.",

Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic thickness and high carrier mobility, offer a promising alternative2,3,4,5. Although significant progress has been made in wafer-scale growth6,7,8, high-performance field-effect transistors9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 and circuits based on 2D materials21,22,23, achieving complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integration remains a challenge. Here, we present a 2D one instruction set computer based on CMOS technology, leveraging the heterogeneous integration of large-area n-type MoS2 and p-type WSe2 field-effect transistors. By scaling the channel length, incorporating a high-κ gate dielectric and optimizing material growth and device postprocessing, we tailored the threshold voltages for both n- and p-type 2D field-effect transistors, achieving high drive currents and reduced subthreshold leakage. This enabled circuit operation below 3 V with an operating frequency of up to 25 kHz, which was constrained by parasitic capacitances, along with ultra-low power consumption in the picowatt range and a switching energy as low as approximately 100 pJ. Finally, we projected the performance of the one instruction set computer and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art silicon technology using an industry-standard SPICE-compatible BSIM-BULK model. This model was calibrated with experimental data that incorporate device-to-device variations. Although further advances are needed, this work marks a significant milestone in the application of 2D materials to microelectronics.",

          "abstract": "The generation of self-tolerant repertoires of T cells depends on the expression of peripheral self antigens in the thymic epithelium 1 and the presence of small populations of cells that mimic the diverse phenotypes of peripheral tissues 2–7 . Whereas the molecular underpinnings of self-antigen expression have been extensively studied 8 , the developmental origins and differentiation pathways of thymic mimetic cells remain to be identified. Moreover, the histological identification of myoid and other peripheral cell types as components of the thymic microenvironment of many vertebrate species 9 raises questions regarding the evolutionary origin of this unique tolerance mechanism. Here we show that during mouse development, mimetic cells appear in the microenvironment in two successive waves. Cells that exhibit transcriptional signatures characteristic of muscle, ionocyte, goblet and ciliated cells emerge before birth, whereas others, such as those that mimic enterohepatic cells and skin keratinocytes, appear postnatally. These two groups also respond differently to modulations of thymic epithelial cell progenitor pools caused by deletions of Foxn1 and Ascl1 , expression of a hypomorphic variant of the transcription factor FOXN1, and overexpression of the signalling molecules BMP4 and FGF7. Differences in mimetic cell populations were also observed in thymic microenvironments reconstructed by replacement of mouse Foxn1 with evolutionarily ancient Foxn1/4 gene family members, including the Foxn4 gene of the cephalochordate amphioxus and the Foxn4 and Foxn1 genes of a cartilaginous fish. Whereas some cell types, such as ciliated cells, develop in the thymus in the absence of FOXN1, mimetic cells that appear postnatally, such as enterohepatic cells, require the activity of the vertebrate-specific transcription factor FOXN1. The thymus of cartilaginous fishes and the thymoid of lampreys, a representative of jawless vertebrates, which exhibit an alternative adaptive immune system 10 , also harbour cells that express genes encoding peripheral tissue components such as the liver-specific protein transthyretin. Our findings suggest an evolutionary model of successive changes of thymic epithelial genetic networks enabling the coordinated contribution of peripheral antigen expression and mimetic cell formation to achieve central tolerance for vertebrate-specific innovations of tissues such as the liver 11,12 .",

Consideration of ethnicity, age and sex is essential for the management of cancer patients because they underlie important differences in both incidence and response to treatment2,3. Age-related hormone production, which is a consistent divergence between the sexes, is underestimated in cancers that are not recognized as being hormone dependent4,5,6. Here, we show that premenopausal women have increased vulnerability to cancers, and we identify the cell–cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin as a crucial component in the oestrogen response in various cancers, including melanoma. In a mouse model of melanoma, we discovered an oestrogen-sensitizing pathway connecting E-cadherin, β-catenin, oestrogen receptor-α and GRPR that promotes melanoma aggressiveness in women. Inhibiting this pathway by targeting GRPR or oestrogen receptor-α reduces metastasis in mice, indicating its therapeutic potential. Our study introduces a concept linking hormone sensitivity and tumour phenotype in which hormones affect cell phenotype and aggressiveness. We have identified an integrated pro-tumour pathway in women and propose that targeting a G-protein-coupled receptor with drugs not commonly used for cancer treatment could be more effective in treating E-cadherin-dependent cancers in women. This study emphasizes the importance of sex-specific factors in cancer management and offers hope of improving outcomes in various cancers.",

The conserved transcriptional repressor SP140 inhibits interferon-β ( Ifnb1 ) expression through an unknown mechanism 3,4 . Here we report that SP140 does not directly repress Ifnb1 transcription. Instead, SP140 negatively regulates Ifnb1 mRNA stability by directly repressing the expression of a previously uncharacterized regulator that we call RESIST (regulated stimulator of interferon via stabilization of transcript; previously annotated as annexin 2 receptor). RESIST promotes Ifnb1 mRNA stability by counteracting Ifnb1 mRNA destabilization mediated by the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA-binding proteins and the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex. SP140 localizes within punctate structures called nuclear bodies that have important roles in silencing DNA-virus gene expression in the nucleus 3 . Consistent with this observation, we find that SP140 inhibits replication of the gammaherpesvirus MHV68. The antiviral activity of SP140 is independent of its ability to regulate Ifnb1 .

          "abstract": "Despite the success of fructose as a low-cost food additive, epidemiological evidence suggests that high fructose consumption during pregnancy or adolescence is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment1,2,3. An essential step in appropriate mammalian neurodevelopment is the phagocytic elimination of newly formed neurons by microglia, the resident professional phagocyte of the central nervous system4. Whether high fructose consumption in early life affects microglial phagocytosis and whether this directly affects neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here we show that offspring born to female mice fed a high-fructose diet and neonates exposed to high fructose exhibit decreased phagocytic activity in vivo. Notably, deletion of the high-affinity fructose transporter GLUT5 (also known as SLC2A5) in neonatal microglia completely reversed microglia phagocytic dysfunction, suggesting that high fructose directly affects neonatal development by suppressing microglial phagocytosis. Mechanistically, we found that high-fructose treatment of mouse and human microglia suppresses phagocytosis capacity, which is rescued in GLUT5-deficient microglia. Additionally, we found that high fructose drives significant GLUT5-dependent fructose uptake and catabolism to fructose 6-phosphate, rewiring microglial metabolism towards a hypo-phagocytic state in part by enforcing mitochondrial localization of the enzyme hexokinase 2. Mice exposed to high fructose as neonates develop anxiety-like behaviour as adolescents—an effect that is rescued in GLUT5-deficient mice. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological observation that high-fructose exposure during early life is associated with increased prevalence of adolescent anxiety disorders.",

Here we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature6,11,12,13, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low-entropy product state into strongly correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters14,15, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically10. At half-filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturation, leading to a temperature of \\(T/t=0.0{5}_{-0.05}^{+0.06}\\) based on comparisons with numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations9. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping.

          "title": "Do our observations make reality happen?",
          "authors": "Alyssa Ney",
          "abstract": "This week, physicists are gathering on the German island of Helgoland to commemorate 100 years since the discovery of quantum mechanics. In the century following Werner Heisenberg’s theoretical masterstroke — made while convalescing from hay fever on that island — this theory has become ever more precise in its descriptions and successful in its applications. With technologies such as quantum computers, we stand at the cusp of a revolution that promises to bring the quantum world into many aspects of our lives.\n\nYet there is still no consensus about what it all means — about the deep lessons that quantum mechanics reveals about the fundamental nature of reality. Addressing this issue takes us from the domain of physics into the realm of philosophy. Although physicists are best placed to develop and extend the mathematical framework of quantum theory and design experiments to test it, philosophers of physics are needed to come to conceptual grips with the result: they have the tools to contextualize that framework and set it in a coherent account of reality.\n\nLong-running disputes\n\nYet physicists and philosophers cannot agree about even the basics. A common refrain among philosophers of physics, and indeed some physicists, is that the textbook formulation of quantum mechanics has a ‘measurement problem’ — an unmanageable emphasis on the role of observers and their observations that makes it impossible to even begin to answer questions about the theory’s connection to the structure of reality. Many physicists beg to differ: some even argue that the emphasis on observers is the key to unlocking the deeper meaning of quantum mechanics.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nThese two camps remain at loggerheads. But there might be a way to bring them together — by revisiting connections between ideas that have been around for more than half a century.\n\nDisagreements about the meaning of quantum mechanics start with its description of physical systems through ‘wave functions’ that assign probabilities for the many possible values of a system’s measurable properties, such as its position. Repeated measurements of the same quantum system deliver a range of results in accordance with the probabilities encoded in the wave function. The standard explanation makes use of the Copenhagen interpretation, an approach championed by Heisenberg and the Danish physicist Niels Bohr in quantum theory’s early years. It says that physical objects fail to have definite values for their properties until they come into contact with an external observer or measuring device. This interaction between observers and quantum systems is essential to creating a definite reality. It is typically described as ‘wave function collapse’, although Bohr and Heisenberg were sceptical of interpreting this collapse as a genuine physical process.\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation was controversial from the start. Bohr and Albert Einstein, two titans of physics, notoriously maintained a decades-long debate about its validity, lasting until Einstein’s death in 1955. Much later, physicist John Bell laid out1 a series of objections to interpretations of quantum mechanics in which measurement played a fundamental part. According to this take, observers and measurements are imprecise and subjective concepts that don’t correspond to fundamental physical entities; they arise, rather, from the complex behaviour of more-basic entities, and so shouldn’t be referenced in fundamental physical laws.\n\nOver the decades, alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics have been proposed that remove reference to measurements or observers from the fundamental description of the quantum world. There are, for example, spontaneous-collapse theories, in which wave functions collapse into determinate realities independently of any observer or measurement process2,3. And the many-worlds interpretation, initially proposed4 by the physicist Hugh Everett in his PhD dissertation at Princeton University in New Jersey in the mid-1950s, suggests that observers do not collapse the wave function at the point of measurement. Instead, they pass into one of several parallel universes corresponding to the possible outcomes encoded in the wave function. By making a measurement, observers are not playing any fundamental part in creating reality, but merely choosing their route through it.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nThis idea has many detractors, not least because a potentially infinite number of parallel universes seems a profligate solution to the measurement problem. But the dominant narrative among philosophers has become that only by starting from ‘objective’, observer-free mathematical frameworks, and escaping the clutches of the (in their view) confused and confusing Copenhagen interpretation, can we begin to draw concrete conclusions about what quantum mechanics tells us about the fundamental nature of the Universe (or, if the many-worlds theory is right, multiverse)5,6.\n\nBut many physicists working in quantum foundations espouse a counter-narrative: although there isn’t absolute truth in the Copenhagen interpretation, quantum mechanics does force a reinterpretation of the observer’s part in fundamental scientific theories. In this view, textbook formulations of quantum mechanics do not face a measurement ‘problem’. They make central use of observers and measurements — but so they must. The interesting question is not how to get rid of observers, but rather how exactly to understand their role, and what that implies for the relationship of quantum theory to the world beyond the observer.\n\nMaking the Universe\n\nSeveral contemporary interpretations of quantum mechanics build on this idea. These include quantum Bayesianism, or QBism, which interprets quantum states in terms of the subjective probabilities that agents assign to events7, and the approaches of Anton Zeilinger8 and Časlav Brukner9, both quantum physicists at the University of Vienna, which stress the centrality of information. But this work is proceeding mostly without the support of philosophers of physics, who remain reluctant to embrace what they see as the central fallacy of Copenhagen and its offspring: a fundamental role for observers.\n\nOne common reason expressed for this reluctance6,10 is that such a move would equate to embracing instrumentalism: the idea that a theory doesn’t provide a true description of reality, but is a tool that allows observers to make better predictions about it. If the goal is to understand the fundamental nature of reality using quantum physics, any instrumentalist interpretation is thus a dead end.\n\nInstrumentalism was promoted in the early days of the Copenhagen interpretation — it is explicit in Heisenberg’s work, for example. But physicists today are more likely to espouse realism, viewing quantum mechanics as an attempt to gain knowledge of the fundamental structure of reality. In the words of the Christopher Fuchs, a physicist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston and one of the creators of QBism, “what is at stake with quantum theory is the very nature of reality. Should reality be understood as something completely impervious to our interventions, or should it be viewed as something responsive to the very existence of human beings?”11. In this view, the privileged status of observers in creating reality is the distinctive claim that quantum mechanics makes.\n\nParticle, wave, both or neither? The experiment that challenges all we know about reality\n\nThis position has little to do with instrumentalism. But it does go down the road of idealism — the philosophical position that reality is fundamentally composed of mental entities such as ideas. Contemporary philosophers of science are strongly disposed against this concept, and that position is not purely dogmatic. Idealism was the dominant position for most of the 2,500-year history of philosophy in the West, defining the work of influential thinkers from Plato in ancient Greece to George Berkeley, Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It was rejected only in the twentieth century, after a long march of breakthroughs in physics, chemistry, molecular biology and neuroscience that established the molecular nature of biological processes, demystified much of the operation of the brain and dispelled notions of the ‘vital forces’ that supposedly gave life to inert matter12.\n\nQuantum physics has played a huge part in establishing this reductive, supposedly objective world view — the one also referenced in Bell’s critique1 — which makes plain that human observers are far from fundamental entities. So it might seem odd that increasing numbers of physicists working on the foundations of quantum theory are inclined to treat observers as such entities.\n\nOne towering figure of twentieth-century physics, John Archibald Wheeler, argued forcefully in defence of this approach. Wheeler’s work includes pioneering early studies with Bohr on nuclear fission and extensive contributions to the study of the general theory of relativity and black holes (a term that he popularized), but his contributions to quantum foundations have, in my view, not been adequately recognized. I further feel that the key to resolving the current impasse in the understanding of quantum mechanics could come from revisiting his idea of a ‘participatory universe’ — a concept in which reality is not static, but shaped by the perception of conscious observers — and his motivations for proposing it.\n\nIn 1978, Wheeler devised13 a seminal thought experiment on the nature of quantum reality, known as the delayed-choice experiment. In one version, he considers an iteration of the double-slit experiment, in which a stream of single electrons, photons, atoms or molecules — any object obeying the rules of quantum mechanics — is sent through a screen with two narrow apertures. If a detector is placed at the slits, each object seems to pass through one or the other, behaving like a particle. But if the objects pass through the slits and are instead measured on a second screen behind the first, over time, an interference pattern will emerge — as if each object went through both slits at once, diffracting and interfering with itself as a wave would.\n\n‘Shut up and calculate’: how Einstein lost the battle to explain quantum reality",

          "abstract": "As the ferry pulled into the dock at the North Sea island of Heligoland, I wondered: did German wunderkind Werner Heisenberg — who famously formulated the mathematics behind quantum physics here in 1925 — also arrive wanting to throw up?\n\nThe choppy four-hour journey from Hamburg was unpleasant, but perhaps a small price to pay for an invite to the physics event of the year. I am one of some 300 people, including at least four Nobel laureates, who have descended on the remote island (population 1,253) for a conference dubbed by one of its organisers as the birthday party of quantum mechanics.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nLegend has it that 100 years ago this week, 23-year-old Heisenberg came to the island to escape his debilitating hay fever (some sources say the island hosted just one tree – I can report that I have seen at least four). Unable to sleep, he is said to have sketched out his ideas late into the night before reaching an epiphany. He then roamed the island, shaken, before watching the sunrise from the top of a rock.\n\nHeisenberg’s insight was that electrons around an atom — whose orbits had puzzled physicists with conflicting predictions and measurements — should be defined by only observables; their leaps and transitions, instead of trajectories. This required developing a specific kind of mathematics called matrix mechanics that helped to shepherd in a new, quantum, era in physics.\n\nRetracing Heisenberg’s steps\n\nThe young physicist’s revelation on this remote island is a beautiful and somewhat mythical image. As highlighted by science writer Philip Ball at the conference dinner, Heisenberg himself was unsure of the magnitude of what he had done, writing to his father on his return that “my own work is not going at the moment especially well”. It was only once built upon by his collaborators Max Born and Pascual Jordan, that Heisenberg’s work became a complete formulation of mechanics.\n\nBut people who want a birthday party need to pick a date. And now that I am here I can see that Heligoland’s stark red cliffs and stiff breeze makes it a perfect place to roam, contemplate and hope that some of Heisenberg’s genius rubs off.\n\nA memorial stone on the island honours Heisenberg and his achievements.Credit: Elizabeth Gibney for Nature\n\nDown every street and in every café sit physicists, their conference lanyards swinging, huddled in conversation. My server asks me what we’re all doing here. “Quantum physics!” I say with glee. A local man who studies wildlife at the Biological Institute Heligoland told me he could spot fellow scientists among the islanders.\n\nTo encourage conversation and revelation, the conference schedule is bizarre. After the morning session talks adjourn until til 7pm, to give ample time to explore the tiny island. Heligoland’s fame goes well beyond quantum mechanics. Over the centuries the island has swapped between British, Danish and German rule, and it is a haven for seals and rare seabirds. In 1947 it was half obliterated by the largest non-nuclear explosion in history, when the British Royal Navy blew it up to prevent it being used as a German military base.",

          "authors": "Mariana Lenharo",
          "abstract": "Many US hospitals rely on medical AI tools that assist with diagnoses and other tasks.Credit: Hilary Swift for The Washington Post via Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) already helps clinicians to make diagnoses, triage critical cases and transcribe clinical notes in hospitals across the United States. But regulation of medical AI products has not kept up with the rapid pace of their adoption, argue researchers in a report published on 5 June in PLOS Digital Health1.\n\nThe authors point to limitations in how the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves these devices, and propose broader strategies that extend beyond the agency to help ensure that medical AI tools are safe and effective.\n\nMore than 1,000 medical AI products have been cleared by the FDA, and hospitals are rapidly adopting them. Unlike most other FDA-regulated products, AI tools continue to evolve after approval as they are updated or retrained on new data. This raises the need for continuous oversight, which current regulations have limited capacity to ensure.\n\nGoogle AI better than human doctors at diagnosing rashes from pictures\n\nThe discussion is especially timely amid signs that the federal government might scale back AI regulation. In January, President Donald Trump revoked an executive order focused on AI safety, citing a need to remove barriers to innovation. The following month, lay-offs affected staff in the FDA division responsible for AI and digital health.\n\nWithout proper oversight, there is a risk that medical algorithms could give misleading recommendations and compromise patient care. “There have to be safeguards,” says Leo Anthony Celi, a clinical researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a co-author of the report. “And I think relying on the FDA to come up with all those safeguards is not realistic and maybe even impossible.”\n\nLow bar for approval\n\nThe criteria used by the FDA to review and authorize AI medical tools are often less rigorous than those for drugs. And because other countries rely on the FDA to inform their own decisions, its approach could have global implications. According to the FDA, only those tools that might pose a higher risk to patients are required to go through a clinical trial, for example. Another concern is that medical algorithms often perform poorly when applied to populations that differ from the ones they were trained on. Because of these limitations, regulatory approval does not ensure that a medical AI product is beneficial for the people it is intended to help, Celi says.\n\nGoogle AI has better bedside manner than human doctors — and makes better diagnoses\n\nIdeally, hospitals should assess how well the algorithms perform in their own patient populations, and train clinicians to interpret the outputs and respond appropriately before adopting these technologies. “One of the biggest challenges is that the vast majority of hospitals and clinics do not have the resources to hire AI teams” to perform such tests, Celi says, adding that a study published this year2 found that many hospitals are buying AI tools ‘off the shelf’ and using them without local validation. “That is a recipe for disaster,” he says.",

          "authors": "Rory Lambe",
          "abstract": "Rory Lambe recommends finding a community and establishing clear work–life boundaries to make PhD life more fun.Credit: Vincent Hoban/UCD\n\nSarah looked horrified. She was nearing the end of her PhD, and I had asked her how it was going. I had assumed she would be excited to finish. Instead, she explained that ahead of her lay the end of funding, no job offers and the ache of leaving friends behind to move home. We were used to comparing pain: in the same month that Sarah was facing her future, I was juggling four studies, two ethics applications, three assignments and an important upcoming exam. I, too, felt I was at breaking point.\n\nI’m in the second half of my PhD at University College Dublin, developing a machine-learning model that uses data from wearable sensors to assess heart health. I’m passionate about the technology’s potential to transform cardiovascular care — but passion had turned to pressure. The harder I worked, the more impossible progress seemed. The wall I was trying to climb felt taller by the day.\n\nIn my conversation with Sarah, a strong realization struck me. The finishing line that we race towards offers only an illusion of relief. Really, it’s a shift in perspective that we need — a pause and a breath that lets us rediscover joy in the journey. Here are five ways I’ve managed to achieve just that.\n\nKnit your own community\n\nMy friend Giulio studies the general theory of relativity — specifically, a variation involving something called asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-time. He is also an avid knitter. The beauty of knitting, according to Giulio, is that it has absolutely nothing to do with general relativity. But what he enjoys most is the friendship it fosters. His knitting club includes some of his closest friends, all of whom he met after he moved to Ireland from his native Italy.\n\nThe importance of having a genuine community cannot be overstated. The warmth of like-minded friends kindles my heart at the best of times and gave me a shoulder to lean on when Reviewer 2 dismissed six months of my work. These connections are hard to build on online platforms such as LinkedIn or Zoom, so I make an extra effort to get to the office in the morning rather than working alone from home. When it’s sunny, I suggest a short walk to those sitting around me, and I say ‘yes’ when a colleague whom I might not know that well invites me for coffee.\n\nI’ve learnt that taking an interest in others is key when it comes to building community. When I first joined my research centre, I made a concerted effort to remember just a few important details about people’s lives — such as a specific task they were working on, or their plans for the coming weekend. I am always greeted with a smile when I ask how it went.\n\nEstablish clear work boundaries\n\nWorking late, or even at the weekend, might be unavoidable when demands are at their highest, but it should not become the norm. I learnt this the hard way. In the early stages of writing my systematic review, I completed more tasks when I worked for longer — but it was a path to burnout.\n\nWithout a true weekend rest, by Wednesday or Thursday, I would feel as if I had been thrown around in a washing machine. Now, I choose quality of work over quantity.\n\nAnd as for those e-mail notifications that ping late at night? I saved myself so much heartache when I muted my phone’s notifications in the evenings. It can save you, too.\n\nRoutine and resilience can lower stress levels\n\nSimilarly, flexible working hours can quickly turn from friend to enemy if not treated with respect. Flexible schedules are beneficial, but those benefits are best when used sparingly. I found that disregarding my nine-to-five simply led to late nights and weekend work. My body and mind thrive with routine. This routine is grounded in a consistent sleep schedule, and helps me to be resilient to stressful situations.\n\nResponding positively to scenarios that can cause stress is a crucial skill and, to my surprise, I have found that I have much more control over this than I realized. I spent time working in a hospital, and I used to become frustrated when I was frequently contradicted by a senior staff member. However, stepping back from situations such as these and giving my thoughts some extra space facilitated a calmer and more assured response. Each morning, I would do ten minutes of mindfulness. This greatly calmed the traffic in my mind and allowed me to detach whenever I was caught up in it.\n\nAcknowledge your own progress",

          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi",
          "abstract": "A forest in the Permian period (artist’s impression), which saw atmospheric oxygen levels peak at more than 35%.Credit: Richard Jones/Science Photo Library\n\nThe strength of Earth’s magnetic field seems to rise and fall hand-in-hand with the abundance of oxygen in its atmosphere, a study of geological records spanning the last half billion years has found.\n\nExplaining the link could help to reveal fundamental trends in the evolution of life on Earth — and could show astronomers the most promising places to look for signs of complex life on other planets. But it is so far unclear whether Earth’s magnetism plays direct a role in keeping oxygen levels high — and sustaining animal life — or whether both are influenced by a third, unidentified mechanism.\n\nSource: Ref. 1Source: Ref. 1\n\n“We don’t really have a good explanation for it,” says Benjamin Mills, a biogeochemist at the University of Leeds, UK, and co-author of the study, published in Science Advances on 13 June1. But the study suggests “some potential causes that are exciting and potentially testable”, says Aubrey Zerkle, a biogeochemist at the University of St Andrews, UK.\n\nKnowing how Earth's deep interior could influence the evolution of the atmosphere is “critical to understanding what makes our planet habitable”, says Richard Bono, a geophysicist at Florida State University in Tallahassee who has helped to compile long-term records of geomagnetism.\n\nGeological clues\n\nOxygen is the main component of Earth’s crust and mantle. But molecular oxygen only began to slowly accumulate in the atmosphere after organisms that produce oxygen through photosynthesis began to evolve, around 2.5 billion years ago. And only in the current aeon, covering the last 540 million years or so, has it reached concentrations that are breathable by most animals.\n\nIs Earth’s core leaking? Volcanic rocks provide strongest evidence yet\n\nThere is no direct way to measure the composition of the atmosphere in the deep past, but geochemists can use indirect clues2 to reconstruct oxygen levels starting in the Cambrian period, which began around 540 million years ago. For example, oxygen concentration “has a strong relationship with how easy it is to start and maintain wildfires,” says Mills, and the frequency of large wildfires can be worked out by looking at ancient charcoal deposits, among other factors.\n\nGeophysicists can also reconstruct how the strength and direction of the geomagnetic field has varied across even longer stretches of Earth’s history, by studying rocks produced by ancient volcanic eruptions3. That’s because magnetic crystals that form in the solidifying lava align themselves with the field, acting like tiny compasses frozen in time.\n\nTo put these two long records side-by-side and compare them, Mills teamed up with geophysicists Weijia Kuang and Ravi Kopparapu, both at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, and with exobiologist Joshua Krissansen-Totton at the University of Washington in Seattle. The authors found a strong correlation — both oxygen levels and geomagnetic intensity have increased over the past million years, and some of the major spikes or drops in both measures occur in the same geological eras (see ‘Long-term trends’).\n\nPossible explanations\n\nThe paper discusses some possible reasons for the correlation. Earth’s magnetic field is known to have a protective effect on the upper atmosphere because it deflects solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the Sun that would otherwise cause oxygen and other gases to slowly escape into space. But the team calculated that the loss of oxygen caused by a drastic weakening of the field would still be small compared to the amounts generated by photosynthesis — or to those consumed by other organisms and by geological cycles in which elements are exchanged between the atmosphere, crust and the mantle.",

Credit: tadamichi/Getty\n\nA group of research-integrity experts has launched a toolkit for researchers that outlines how to spot suspicious scientific papers.\n\nThe guide’s creators hope that it will be a useful resource for sleuths who review published work for signs of sloppy, fake or fraudulent science, and will perhaps inspire others to get started. “The sleuthing community is growing. And this will be the essential handbook,” says Jana Christopher, an image-integrity analyst at FEBS Press in Heidelberg, Germany, who contributed to the project.\n\nWhat makes an undercover science sleuth tick? Fake-paper detective speaks out\n\nThe Collection of Open Science Integrity Guides (COSIG) brings together 27 freely available resources that explain how to spot image duplication, citation manipulation, plagiarism, tortured phrases and other hallmarks of paper mills — businesses that produce fake papers to order. The guides also provide tips for reviewing papers in specific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, statistics and computer science.\n\n“COSIG is really a compendium of all the tips and tricks that various sleuths have acquired over the years,” says Reese Richardson, a metascientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who led the project and authored a preprint on COSIG posted to the repository Zenodo on 4 June1. “We want to arm scientists with the tools to uphold the integrity of the literature.”\n\n“It will really help publishers, as well,” says Christopher, adding that research-integrity officers could use the guide as the basis for checklists to evaluate manuscripts.\n\n‘Anybody can do it’\n\nRichardson came up with the idea for COSIG last year, while at a meeting of science-integrity specialists in Paris. Concerned about the surge in formulaic research and flawed publications that continue to circulate largely unnoticed, he and other delegates wanted to broaden participation in correcting the literature and to help more people learn how to scrutinize papers.\n\n“A lot of people assume that you need some special talent, you need eagle eyes to see things, or you need to be at your computer ten hours a day looking through the scientific literature. But really, anybody can do it,” says Richardson. “That’s one of our mantras.”\n\nAI beats human sleuth at finding problematic images in research papers\n\nThe guides describe how to spot issues that are common across all disciplines, such as text that has been generated using artificial intelligence (AI), and publications from hijacked journals — scam websites that impersonate legitimate journals. They include instructions for how to use online tools such as the Feet of Clay Detector, which flags papers citing retracted or problematic research, and Imagetwin and Proofig, which use AI to detect integrity issues in scientific figures.\n\nSome of the guides home in on areas of research that have seen a recent surge in formulaic publications, and those that are frequently targeted by paper mills.\n\nFor example, one guide shows how to detect experiments that use non-existent cell lines, or contaminated ones that are no longer suitable for studying certain cancers. Another outlines how to check that tumour sizes in rodent studies fall within limits approved by institutional ethics committees (a reported size that is too large to have been approved can be a sign of manipulated or fabricated experiments).",

What’s more, they found that these patterns can be correlated with body-mass index (BMI) and signs of depression and anxiety.\n\n“In a way, we’re reading the mind through the nose,” says co-author Noam Sobel, a neurobiologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. “This could be a very powerful diagnostic tool.” The team published its study today in Current Biology1.\n\nTaking a breath\n\nBreathing is deeply connected to the brain. Every inhalation and exhalation is coordinated to supply the oxygen needed for the brain to manage the body’s systems. Sobel and his team wondered: if every brain functions differently, shouldn’t every person’s breathing be unique, too?\n\nTo test this, the researchers developed a custom, wearable device that records airflow through each of a person’s nostrils. Mounted on the back of the neck, the device, which has tubes fitted under the nose, tracks people’s breathing during their everyday routines, both while they are awake and while they are asleep.\n\nResearchers measured study participants’ breathing patterns over 24 hours, using a custom device that sits on the back of the neck.Credit: Soroka et al., Current Biology\n\nTo characterize a person’s breath pattern, the team extracted 24 parameters from the airflow data, including duration of inhalation and exhalation and airflow asymmetry between nostrils. They separated the periods when participants were awake and asleep, and trained a machine-learning algorithm with the data.\n\nWhen 42 of the participants came back to the laboratory weeks, months and even two years later, to take part in another 24-hour measurement, the trained algorithm could identify them from their breath patterns. Data from periods when the participants were awake gave more accurate results than did those from sleeping periods, but when the researchers used a 100-parameter characterization of a full data set instead of one using 24 parameters, they could pick individuals out with 96.8% accuracy.\n\nGiven this success, Sobel and his colleagues began wondering whether they could learn more from the breath patterns.\n\nHealthy breathing\n\nThe researchers collected data on the participants’ BMIs, and from questionnaires that assess levels of depression and anxiety. An analysis found correlations between this information and the breathing patterns, even though most participants had low-level scores on the questionnaires.\n\nFor instance, the breathing profiles during sleep of people with higher BMIs were different from those of people with lower BMIs. And those who scored higher on the questionnaires for anxiety or depression had distinct patterns in how they inhaled and exhaled.",

And Hunan province will provide a sum of up to 1 million yuan to doctoral students who move there from abroad.\n\nAcross China, cities and provinces are seeking researchers, students and innovators — both home-grown and from abroad. In return, they’re offering large sums of money, as well as housing, health care, work for their spouses and other benefits. That’s on top of the generous salaries being offered by universities, and research funding from the central government.\n\n“The competition for talent is intense both across China and within different districts of the same city,” says Yanbo Wang, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nThese efforts could soon benefit from the recent tightening of US immigration rules, particularly those targeting Chinese nationals, say researchers. On 28 May, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, announced that the country would start revoking visas of Chinese students and enhance scrutiny of all visa applications from China.\n\nSome US researchers with ties to China might have been debating whether to return there. “The Trump administration has made that decision much, much easier than ever before,” says Wang.\n\nLocal and global\n\nRecruiting researchers and highly skilled workers is central to China’s push for economic and social development and self-reliance. At an event last week to celebrate science and technology workers, China’s President Xi Jinping said: “A country’s technological innovation capacity depends on talent.”\n\nIn the past, China had a few central-government policies designed to recruit talent from abroad. One was the Thousand Talents Plan, which aimed to attract elite international scientists to make the country a global leader in science and technology. But the United States and other governments began to worry that the programme could be a vessel for China to steal intellectual property or trade secrets. Although this was proved only in rare cases, Chinese talent programmes are still viewed with suspicion by US government agencies.\n\nThere are now hundreds of talent-recruitment policies at the central, provincial and city levels, says Wang. The initiatives are tiered, from highly competitive programmes seeking to attract elite researchers and innovators to those encouraging skilled workers to move to specific cities or regions.\n\nSome programmes mainly target international researchers, including a continuation of the Thousand Talents Plan and the Overseas Young Elite Recruitment Program, which have essentially been reorganized under the High-End Foreign Talents Plan.\n\nBut most initiatives are open to talent based anywhere, including in China, reflecting the changing dynamics in the country, says Wang.\n\nTwo decades ago, overseas talent would have been considered the cream of the crop, says Wang. “However, these days, the talent pool inside China is pretty deep.” He notes the success of technology start-up DeepSeek, which has released large-language models that impressed the world, built by a team made up largely of graduates and PhD students at top Chinese universities.\n\nThis “broader policy shift underscores a growing emphasis on indigenous innovation and technological self-sufficiency,” says Marina Zhang, who studies innovation with a focus on China at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia.",

          "abstract": "Jayanta Bhattacharya, head of the US National Institutes of Health, testified about proposed budget cuts to his agency at a Senate hearing on 10 June.Credit: Win McNamee/Getty\n\nCapitol Hill, Washington DC\n\nUS senators grilled National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Jayanta Bhattacharya at a hearing on 10 June about how his professed support for science squares with unprecedented funding delays and research-grant terminations at the agency this year, as well as enormous cuts that have been proposed for its 2026 budget.\n\nCan NIH-funded research on racism and health survive Trump’s cuts?\n\nWhat would normally be a routine hearing about government spending was anything but: hundreds of scientists and advocates for Alzheimer’s disease research packed into a cramped room on Capitol Hill to denounce US President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget request, which calls for cutting the NIH’s budget by about 40% and collapsing its 27 institutes and centres into 8.\n\nSuch a cut “would stop critical Alzheimer’s research in its tracks”, Tonya Maurer, an advocate for the Alzheimer’s Association, a non-profit group based in Chicago, Illinois, told Nature at the hearing. “We’ve worked too damn hard to see this happen.”\n\nBhattacharya defended his leadership at the agency — the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world — noting that there is a “need for reform at the NIH” and that, to restore its reputation, the NIH “cannot return to business as usual”. (The NIH has been accused by Trump and his Republican allies of funding ‘woke’ science and research on coronaviruses that they say could have sparked the COVID-19 pandemic.) To help fix the agency, Bhattacharya told the senators, he wants to focus on improving reproducibility in biomedical research, upholding academic freedom and studying the cause of autism, which US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr has pledged to find an answer to by September.\n\nLetters of dissent\n\nThe hearing comes the day after more than 300 NIH staff members sent Bhattacharya a fiery letter decrying the mass termination of jobs at the agency and its cancellation of thousands of research projects on a growing list of topics that the Trump team has said are ‘politicized’, including those investigating the biology of COVID-19, the health of sexual and gender minorities (LGBT+) and reasons that people might be hesitant to receive a vaccine.\n\nExclusive: NIH to cut grants for COVID research, documents reveal\n\n“We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,” the staff members wrote.\n\nThey named their letter the Bethesda Declaration, after the Maryland community and Washington DC suburb where most of the NIH is located. The title also alludes to the ‘Great Barrington Declaration’, an open letter that Bhattacharya co-signed in October 2020 that argued against COVID-19 lockdowns, except for the most vulnerable citizens, instead allowing children and others to be infected so that ‘herd immunity’ could be reached ― a proposal that numerous scientists and NIH officials called dangerous at the time.\n\nAt the hearing, Patty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington, implored Bhattacharya to “heed their warning”, and said that she expects that “none of them face retaliation for raising those concerns”.\n\nBhattacharya didn’t respond to this comment at the hearing but said, in a statement on 9 June, that the Bethesda Declaration “has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months”, but that “respectful dissent in science is productive”.\n\nGavin Yamey, a global-health researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, who signed the latest declaration, said: “He can talk about freedom, but his own staff are decrying his censorship. How he’s actually acting and what he says are not one in the same.”",

          "title": "How to speak to a vaccine sceptic: research reveals what works",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "In her professional life, Sophia Newcomer analyses vaccination trends and safety in the United States. The epidemiologist, at the University of Montana, Missoula, has investigated the factors that stop some people from completing their children’s recommended immunizations.\n\nSo it’s no surprise that in her personal life, Newcomer is asked questions about vaccines, too. “I’m a mom — I’ve had plenty of playground conversations,” she says. “When people find out I study vaccines, they love to ask questions. What I try to do is listen and, as best as I can, share what I know.”\n\nQuestions and doubts about vaccines are on the rise worldwide. A major global study found that perceptions of vaccines’ importance for children dropped in 52 of 55 countries studied during the COVID-19 pandemic1 (see ‘Lost confidence’). In the United States, about 20% of parents are hesitant about vaccines — one reason for an outbreak of measles this year that has killed three unvaccinated people.\n\nPublic-health specialists worry that these trends could worsen, in part because of the influence of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has repeatedly questioned the safety of vaccines and inaccurately connected them to autism. Kennedy was tapped this year by US President Donald Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which approves vaccines and makes recommendations about their use.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThe shift in public attitudes towards immunizations can leave scientists, physicians and many others feeling disheartened because vaccines are among the most cost-effective ways to prevent disease and have saved more than 150 million lives over the past 50 years. So what should you say to someone who has doubts? What kind of information or argument might help when talking to family or friends? Fortunately, a surge of research on vaccine hesitancy over the past decade is starting to offer some answers. “There is a lot that we can draw from,” says Heidi Larson, who studies confidence in vaccines at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\n\nResearchers say that anyone can help to address vaccine hesitancy by listening to concerns and offering positive opinions. “If you think vaccination is a good idea, if you trust that, if you think it’s a good way to protect your children, I think you can share that view,” says Daphne Bussink-Voorend, who studies vaccine decisions at Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.\n\nListen, do not judge\n\nThe first thing to do if someone expresses uncertainty about vaccines to you, say researchers, is not to judge or dismiss them. It’s wrong to assume that people are ignorant, irrational or have naively swallowed online misinformation. A lot of people have genuine and legitimate questions and “you’re going to lose them if you immediately jump back and say ‘that’s silly’ or ‘that’s not the fact’”, Larson says. (Researchers distinguish between vaccine hesitancy — being unsure about vaccination — and ‘anti-vaccine’ activists who campaign against it.)\n\n154 million lives and counting: 5 charts reveal the power of vaccines\n\nInstead, researchers agree, it’s best to actively listen, ask questions and be curious about what’s behind the concerns. “I think that is sometimes difficult, but we should really be open to people’s views and ideas,” says Bussink-Voorend. “Once we know what the issues are, what specific barriers are, then we can address them, one by one,” says Mohammad Sharif Razai, a public-health researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nResearchers have identified a wide range of reasons that people hesitate about getting themselves or their children vaccinated. In 2014, an expert working group on vaccine hesitancy convened by the World Health Organization supported grouping these reasons into three buckets: confidence (I don’t trust the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, or the health system delivering them); complacency (I don’t need it because the risks are low); and convenience (I can’t access it easily)2. Context is also important, because people’s culture and religious or ethnic background can influence their attitudes.\n\nOne major European study pointed to the root of many concerns. The study, called VAX-TRUST, examined why parents hesitated to vaccinate their children in seven European countries between 2021 and 2024, a period that spanned the COVID-19 pandemic3. Typically, hesitancy “starts with personal concerns about, ‘what will this do to my child? How will it affect my health?’”, says Pia Vuolanto, a social scientist at Tampere University in Finland, who led the study.\n\nParticularly influential in seeding those doubts, Vuolanto says, were anecdotal stories from friends and in the media that involved possible vaccine side effects. “Previous cases were very important in shaping their views,” she says — even though serious side effects are rare and data show that, for most people, the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks.\n\nA child is vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella in Papua New Guinea.Credit: Kate Holt/eyevine\n\nA review published in 2023 measured the lasting damage one scare story can cause. The authors assessed 115 studies examining why parents in the United States hesitate over the childhood measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine4. The most common reason was fear of triggering autism, which stems partly from a prominent 1998 paper in the Lancet that claimed to show a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The paper was found to be fraudulent and was retracted, and subsequent studies have convincingly shown that no link exists, although Kennedy and others continue to draw connections. A spokesperson at the HHS says that the US National Institutes of Health is actively investigating the root causes of autism, and is confronting the issue of rising autism rates “employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science”.\n\nThe HHS spokesperson added that “blaming Secretary Kennedy for vaccine hesitancy ignores a broader and more complex reality: trust in public-health institutions declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven in large part by inconsistent messaging, shifting mandates and the failure to provide transparent, long-term safety and efficacy data”.\n\nExpress your view\n\nIt might sound obvious, but researchers say that it’s important in a conversation to provide information or opinions. “You need to elicit the concerns and then share accurate, reliable information,” Razai says.\n\nPhysicians and other health-care workers are best placed to provide that advice. A 2023 systematic review of studies, including 15 randomized trials, found that consistent, clear recommendations from trusted health-care professionals that addressed misconceptions and noted benefits were strongly associated with increased vaccination during pregnancy, particularly when the recommendations were delivered face-to-face5. It’s “one of the most important evidence-based strategies”, says Razai, who led the review. But the goal, he stresses, should be enabling someone to make their own informed decision, not telling them what to do. “I think that’s a really effective way of gaining people’s trust.”\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is slashing NIH-backed research — in charts\n\nOne method of doing this in a non-judgemental way is called ‘motivational interviewing’. This involves an empathetic, respectful conversation between a health-care worker and a prospective vaccine recipient that aims to strengthen their motivation. It typically starts with a recommendation to vaccinate, but if someone expresses ambivalence or reluctance, a health worker might ask ‘Why are you unsure?’, then acknowledge the concerns and offer information tailored to address them6.\n\nIf a parent expresses worry about the MMR vaccine and autism, for example, the health worker might say: ‘More than 500 studies around the world have demonstrated that there is no link between the vaccine and autism. The frequency of autism is the same in vaccinated children as it is in non-vaccinated children. What do you think?’ (This compares with a more didactic approach of: ‘The vaccine is safe, I assure you’ or ‘You should update your child’s vaccinations’.)\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that motivational interviewing can change behaviour. In one trial in Quebec, Canada, parents of around 1,100 babies received a session using motivational interviewing on the maternity ward after their children were born7. Seven months later, 76% of children in the experimental group had received all the recommended vaccines, compared with 69% in a control group that did not receive the intervention. This and other results convinced the government in Quebec to roll out the programme to all parents of newborns, starting in 2017. The programme led to a nearly 7% increase in vaccination coverage after 24 months.\n\nPeople who are not health professionals can share such messages, too, researchers say — they don’t have to know detailed facts and figures from studies. It also helps to get personal. “For those who are just a little bit unsure, often sharing your personal experience of why you vaccinated, why you trust vaccines, is enough,” says Vuolanto.\n\nBe honest\n\nTransparency and acknowledging uncertainties is key, researchers say. A systematic review8 of methods for combating vaccine misinformation in 2023 found that communicating with certainty, rather than recognizing that there are unknowns about risks or effectiveness, could backfire. Communicating the weight of evidence and scientific consensus about vaccines seemed more promising.",

A 2023 Nature survey of postdoctoral scholars, for example, found that 24% of respondents worked more than 10 extra hours over their contractual hours each week.\n\nI am from Italy, which grants students one of the most generous holiday allowances across all educational levels, from the beginning of primary school to secondary school: a three-month summer break plus days off for religious celebrations and bank holidays.\n\nThe lengthy summer break can be a joy for children and a nightmare for parents. Thanks to my family’s efforts to make the most of those three months while I was growing up, I’ve learnt to enjoy, value and plan holidays.\n\nAs a child, my holidays were filled with lengthy football matches with friends, cultural day trips with mum, gardening with my grandfather, many ice creams and sporadic swims at the nearby Mediterranean seaside with my cousins. There weren’t many moments when I didn’t know what to do, but books and television filled the days when needed.\n\nDuring this time, I learnt how to take holidays seriously. Now that I work as a neuroscientist at Imperial College London, researching how students can learn more effectively, I’ve seen colleagues fail to prepare for their time off. I’ve outlined four steps to nudge students and scientists to embrace stress-free holidays and treat them with the seriousness they deserve.\n\nAvoid the sense of guilt\n\nI sometimes felt guilty about taking time off during the early stages of my academic journey. For my PhD programme, I relocated overseas. I was the youngest member of the laboratory, keen to master new techniques. These factors led me to think, wrongly, that I had to outwork many senior colleagues. But learning takes time, and becomes even more powerful when combined with periods of reflection and relaxation. Plus, most of us are legally entitled, and sometimes even required, to take annual leave: we should feel guilty about not taking those days.\n\nTaking time off also boosts my productivity and creativity — which benefits the workplace much more than the days spent dragging out tasks and stubbornly refusing to leave my desk. Contrary to the popular belief that you must complete every task on your to-do list before taking leave, I can list at least nine papers and seven grant applications I have edited and resubmitted after returning from a holiday — and they were all successful!\n\nPlan ahead of time\n\nGoing on holiday does not have to be expensive or stressful: focus on what you can foresee, but do not worry too much about things you can’t control.\n\nThe real game-changer with preparing beforehand is not the ‘book ahead to secure the best deal’ aspect, but taking time to make a plan for work in your absence. For the sake of your co-workers, avoid taking time off during periods when you know you’ll be busy or your presence is absolutely required.\n\nBut at other times, embrace the risk. Tell your colleagues you will be away (one clear e-mail should do), take the necessary steps to minimize disruption — only you know what those are for your job — and trust your team. Regarding the destination, do not ignore staycations, or stay-at-home holiday options. Exploring your local area and its surroundings ‘as a tourist’ provides a chance to see them from a new perspective. There is probably a museum, a park or a lake near your home. Frequent visits to the Pinacoteca di Brera gallery in Milan, Italy, during my undergraduate studies and swims in the river in Zurich, Switzerland, before beginning my PhD training are memories I still cherish.\n\nA young Stefano Sandrone stands near sailboats on a beach.Credit: Image courtesy of Stefano’s mother, Elisabetta\nPut up an out-of-office message and stick to it",

          "abstract": "Controlled fires in laboratory safety simulations help lab workers to learn how to respond effectively to lab emergencies.Credit: JohnAlexandr/iStock/Getty\n\nIn August 2016, Margaret Braasch-Turi began her graduate studies in the department of chemistry at Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins. During orientation week, when she was getting familiarized with the laboratory-safety protocols, she couldn’t tell right away that something was wrong as she entered one of the labs, even though a very strong smell of almonds lingered in the air. Then she saw the pool of bodies lying on the floor at the end of the room. A few seconds later, she too was dead.\n\nAt least, that’s how it would have seemed to a casual observer. Braasch-Turi and the rest of the group had been participating in a simulated lab-accident drill. They were a little shocked when the instructors overseeing the exercise tapped them on the shoulder and told them their fate. “What do you mean, we’re dead?” she recalls thinking. “What did we miss?” It turned out to be a simulated leak of cyanide, which smells similar to almonds.\n\nFrom crevasse falls to polar bears, train fieldwork leaders for emergencies\n\nIt’s a dangerous situation that anyone working in a research lab might face, yet few researchers are trained to catch the warning signs and respond appropriately. With this in mind, Ben Reynolds, a lab coordinator at CSU’s chemistry department and one of the instructors, decided about ten years ago to take the standard laboratory safety training — based on online presentations or reading a safety manual — to a new level. He did so by recreating potential accidents, getting his students to respond to the situation and then assessing what they learnt. “I mean, how many more training modules can a grad student or an undergrad take where they’re just clicking through a PowerPoint presentation?” he asks.\n\nSimulations of real emergencies can trigger strong emotions and unexpected issues. To prepare students, institutions worldwide are using lab-accident drills, also known as fantasy lab accidents, and other activities to make training exercises more fun, while also teaching students to manage stress and understand emergency procedures. These drills help participants to identify hazards. They also enable staff to carry out assessments of safety culture, and spark open discussions. (CSU paused its lab-accident drills during the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize mental--health training, and has not resumed them.)\n\nOver the course of one afternoon, Braasch-Turi and the other participants encountered electrocutions, explosions, chemical spills and other emergencies, all acted out by other students and university staff who brought out their theatrical skills to make the scenarios as realistic as possible. They shattered glass, started controlled fires, screamed with despair, writhed on the floor and leaked out pools of fake blood in front of flustered students who had to work out how to respond to the situations without getting ‘injured’ themselves.\n\nHalloween make-up makes injuries look and feel real in fantasy lab-accident drills.Credit: Anthony Appleton\n\nThe scenarios ran from 15 to 20 minutes and students played various parts, such as taking notes, leading the response or making a 911 emergency call to Reynolds’ answering machine. Each exercise ended with a debriefing to run through what had gone right or wrong. Then they moved on to the next scenario. By the end of the afternoon, everyone had experienced each role.\n\n“Wow, this is really stressful. I don’t like this,” Braasch-Turi recalls thinking. As a new PhD student, she felt unprepared to be the person in charge of an accident scene as a lab member or teaching assistant. However, her perspective shifted after the training. Not only had it been more fun than a typical training session, but she also felt more confident and prepared to face an emergency in a range of lab settings. “It helped us be aware of what sort of hazards could exist,” in any lab, she says.\n\nReady for anything\n\nNumerous factors can lead to a lab accident. A study published in Nature Chemistry (A. D. Ménard and J. F. Trant Nature Chem. 12, 17–25; 2020) highlighted reasons including a lack of proper safety training and protective gear, researchers working alone and incorrect storage of equipment. Yet few accurate accounts of these incidents exist globally. In the United States, for example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) establishes and enforces safety standards and healthy working conditions at workplaces, but it doesn’t track the annual incidence of lab accidents.\n\nTo address these gaps, the Laboratory Safety Institute, a non-profit organization that provides lab-safety education from its headquarters in Natik, Massachusetts, has been mapping lab incidents around the world on the basis of newspaper reports or public-database contents. Its founder, James Kaufman, was inspired to start the institute in 1978, after witnessing the aftermath of a lab explosion at his PhD alma mater, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. So far, for the 2020s, the institute has recorded about 240 accidents, ranging from chemical and biological exposures to fires and explosions, the latter being the most common (See ‘Global laboratory safety incidents’). However, its executive director, Stephen Taylor, says that the numbers recorded are likely to be lower than the actual figures, owing to under--reporting. “There’s so much to uncover in the behaviours of scientists, and things that we might be doing that cause problems.”\n\nSource: Laboratory Safety Institute\n\nFurthermore, OSHA regulations vary from laboratory to laboratory depending on which state they are located in, says Anthony Appleton, former safety-culture coordinator at CSU, who is now retired but consults on research safety.\n\nAppleton says that although lab safety culture has improved since he was a student in the mid-2000s, fear of making mistakes or reporting accidents can still run deep. As a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta in 2008, Appleton accidentally stabbed himself with a glass pipette. It was through sheer luck that he reported the injury to a trusted department administrator who knew the proper procedures. That moment motivated Appleton to dedicate his career to improving lab safety. As a safety coordinator across several institutions, he often found that principal investigators were reluctant to engage with environmental health and safety (EHS) offices.\n\nAppleton says that one of the best things about the fantasy lab-accident programme is that it brings together researchers, lab managers, human--resource officers, principal investigators, administrators and EHS staff to have a conversation that says: “Look, we’re all here to help support research, and we can only do our job well if we are all well informed.”\n\nBehind the scenes in the biosafety office\n\nThese drills can also help students to anticipate problems. For example, on several occasions, Reynolds’ students were unable to call 911 because the lab was underground and they had no mobile-phone signal. This prompted conversations about what to do instead, such as how to get to the nearest land line.\n\nInstitutions must also consider people with disabilities when planning lab-safety measures. Yael Medley, a chemistry PhD student at Florida State University in Tampa, has a visual impairment, which means that safety is constantly on her mind. She used to work on a lab on the seventh floor, and although she had enough vision to find her way out of the building in an emergency, she realized that other people with less vision, or with other physical disabilities, wouldn’t be that lucky. “They can’t go down the stairs or take the elevator during a fire situation, so they basically have to wait for somebody to come get them,” she says.\n\nMedley, who once broke her leg falling down a carpeted stairwell that wasn’t clearly marked, thinks it’s important that office staff responsible for planning safety protocols include in their conversations people with disabilities, so as to properly address their needs.\n\nThe issue of disability sometimes surfaced during the fantasy lab drills at CSU, and is another reason why Reynolds thinks administrators should take part in the drills. “It makes their eyes much more wide open when you hear somebody else tell their story from their perspective,” he says.",

          "authors": "Christine Ro, Jack Leeming",
          "abstract": "In March, Omar, a biomedical researcher, posted a request in a private Facebook group for researchers. He was seeking to have his name added to a paper in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and medicine, in exchange for a payment.\n\nOmar is an assistant professor at a Saudi Arabian university. He published 20 papers in 2024 alone, a big jump from 2 the previous year. But it wasn’t enough, says Omar, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. To be promoted, he needed to publish at least ten more papers, in journals in the top half of those ranked by the Web of Science, a citation index. And to meet this demanding requirement, he’d turned to paper mills: fraudulent businesses that deceive publishers so as to arrange authorship, submission and other services related to publications.\n\nOmar wasn’t choosy. The paper could be on any branch of medicine with an AI theme, and he didn’t need to see it before submission. Nor did he mind what position he had in the author list, but he did not want to deal with reviews.\n\nScience’s fake-paper problem: high-profile effort will tackle paper mills\n\nOmar’s circumstances are not unusual: many countries operate a research culture that expects researchers to publish frequently to secure their career in science. Some, like Omar, are unable or unwilling to collect data, conduct analysis and write a paper that might be accepted in a journal. So they turn to organizations online that offer authorship status — for a price. The paper mills that make this their business have various techniques to take advantage of desperate or lazy researchers and to trick publishers: some operate as a marketplace in which extra authorship slots on already--accepted papers are up for grabs. Others take published papers and use AI to tweak text and graphics to escape plagiarism detectors. Still more generate entirely new data sets and text, without the inconveniences of any real laboratory work.\n\nOver WhatsApp, Omar told a reporter for Nature’s careers team, “I am dealing with many writers” as a co-author. Omar wrote that he had already paid for many papers, namechecking co-authors based in India and -Pakistan. He could afford to pay no more than US$400 per paper, he said. Communications he shared indicated that he had paid as little as 76 Saudi riyals (US$20) for one paper. He had marked one Western Union transfer, of 810 Saudi riyals, as an “Education/School fee” on his statement. The reporter contacted Omar after seeing his request on Facebook, and, to explore in more depth why he was offering payment to be included on a paper, posed as the representative of a paper mill.\n\nOmar isn’t the only researcher finding paper mills on Facebook. A separate post offered co-authorship of a paper on medicinal plants and trace elements in return for payment. According to the post, the paper had already been accepted for publication by a respected journal. The reviewers had asked for only minor revisions. Now, the author was seeking other researchers to attach their names to the paper — even though they had not been involved in the research, and would not be needed for substantial revisions.\n\nA US-based plant biologist who was asked by Nature why he had expressed interest in this co-authorship said: “Early-career researchers such as ourselves are under significant pressure to publish, which can sometimes be a challenging aspect of our work.” His Facebook account was then almost immediately deleted.\n\nIvan Oransky, the co-founder of research--integrity blog Retraction Watch, has repeatedly warned of the industrial-level scale of research misconduct, stressing that paper mills are just a symptom of an academic reward system focused on metrics such as university rankings and quantity of publications. In the absence of any other metric, retraction rates are often used to indicate rates of research misconduct, because retractions often occur only when a publisher decides that a paper is too flawed to be fixed with a correction or an erratum.\n\nAnna Abalkina says that pressure on researchers to publish is causing paper mills to multiply.Credit: Stefanie Loos for Nature\n\nAnd these pressures are only intensifying, according to Anna Abalkina, who researches academic fraud, including the use of paper mills, at the Free University of Berlin. She points to two reasons: the increasing number of researchers, and the introduction in many countries of requirements to publish in international journals. Paper mills have stepped in to meet this challenge, she adds.\n\nThe pressures are particularly intense in some countries. Gengyan Tang, a researcher in education at the University of Calgary, Canada, spent almost a year doing research at a teaching hospital affiliated with a medical university in southwest China. “I found that there was a significant demand for paper mills among nurses,” he reports. “Some paper mills even actively promoted their services within hospital departments by handing out business cards and making direct contact with staff.”\n\n“Early-career doctors and nurses in China are now facing even greater pressure to publish,” says Tang. As evaluation standards grow increasingly stringent, they are expected to produce more papers and publish in higher-impact journals than their predecessors, all while managing heavy clinical workloads, he says. “This struggle to balance research, clinical duties and personal life is one of the key factors driving some of them towards the services provided by paper mills.”\n\nTang’s concerns around pressures to publish faced by clinical staff are borne out in the data. A Nature analysis of paper retractions from 2014 to 2024, published in February, found that seven of the ten institutions with the highest proportion of retracted research articles were hospitals in China (see Nature 638, 596–599; 2025).\n\nPaper mills explained\n\nAbalkina defines paper mills as “commercial companies that organize on-demand writing of fraudulent academic manuscripts and offer co-authorship of these papers for sale”. For example, International Publisher LLC, a paper mill based in Russia, generated $6.5 million from co-authorship slots offered between 2019 and 2021, according to an analysis by Abalkina1. She estimates conservatively that the paper-mill industry as a whole is worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year (see ‘A case study of paper-mill purchases in Kazakhstan’).\n\nA case study of paper-mill purchases in Kazakhstan\n\nThe Soviet era left scientists ill-prepared to meet the demands of international journals.\n\nAnna Abalkina, who studies academic fraud at the Free University of Berlin, and her colleague Dorothy Bishop, a research-integrity sleuth and a retired psychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, carried out work that led to the retraction of a number of papers with authors in Kazakhstan. Many were at the country’s Ministry of Education and Science and its Institute for Strategic Studies, a research body based in the capital, Astana.\n\nA large market for paper mills exists in former Soviet countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, says Abalkina. It is driven by their history. During the Soviet era, social scientists at regional universities were accustomed to domestic publication, usually in Russian, and with the expectation that their work would adhere to Soviet ideology.\n\nA push to publish in international journals, she says, meant that many researchers had to grapple with new scientific disciplines and unfamiliar publishing norms. From around 2016, she adds, many scientists published in predatory journals, which tend to have weak editorial and publication practices, and might aggressively solicit submissions. And from around 2019, after Scopus and Web of Science removed a number of predatory journals, the market expanded to paper mills.\n\nIn her role as a research-integrity adviser at Springer Nature, Svetlana Kleiner corresponds with authors of disputed papers, including some who are based in the countries list above. (Springer Nature publishes Nature, but Nature journalists are editorially independent of the publisher.)\n\nShe thinks that some of them had genuinely contributed to the papers in some capacity, and had turned to a third-party service to handle translation or the daunting process of submission. They did not necessarily realize that this would include suggesting and responding to peer reviewers, or that doing so was a violation of journal policies. “It creates a problem when authors think they’re signing up to one service, but they get something more,” Kleiner says. “In some cases they didn’t know that what they were doing was wrong.”\n\nBut she stresses, too, that ignorance is not a reason for absolution. Abalkina says that authors have to remain responsible for their work throughout the publishing process. Otherwise paper mills can, and often do, manipulate reviews, revisions, authorships and citations.\n\nSvetlana Shakirova, head of science at Kurmangazy Kazakh National Conservatory in Almaty, confirms that among Kazakh researchers it was common several years ago to use intermediaries for publication.\n\nIn 2022, the Elsevier journal Thinking Skills and Creativity retracted 47 papers, citing manipulation of peer review. It did so after Abalkina pointed out links to the paper mill Scientific Publications, based in Kyiv. She dubbed the company Tanu.pro after the peculiar e-mail addresses it often used. Shakirova noticed that two of the authors of the retracted papers were based at her own university at the time. She sent a confidential survey to the Kazakh corresponding authors of 11 of the retracted Thinking Skills and Creativity papers. Six of these authors responded. They admitted to using intermediaries with the goal of achieving publication in a journal indexed by Scopus or Web of Science. One author mentioned taking out a loan to pay the intermediary’s fee of US$1,500.\n\nBecause papers are often mass--produced, typical signs include familiar text, duplicated images, suspicious e-mail addresses, implausible collaborations1 and irrelevant citations. Another red flag is “tortured phrases” resulting from attempts to hide plagiarism2 (examples include “profound neural organization” instead of “deep neural network”, and “subterranean insect settlement” instead of “ant colony”). Paper mills have also submitted, and occasionally been successful in publishing, plagiarized or duplicated papers.\n\nOne tactic is for companies to impersonate well-established researchers when offering papers for sale. In August 2024, a post appeared in a Facebook group selling co-authorship slots, for $200 to $700, on a paper about tracking COVID-19. Supposedly, this paper had already been accepted by the Lancet medical journal. The name on the Facebook account was Paul Robin Krugman, and photos of the Nobel prize-winning economist also appeared in profiles on Facebook and on the social-media app Telegram with the same name. The real Krugman confirmed to Nature’s careers team that this was not him. But not all attempts to use the names of genuine academics are this blatant or easy to detect.\n\nMore than 10,000 research papers were retracted in 2023 — a new record\n\nPaper mills offer a bevy of services. A researcher in a bind can find one through word of mouth or by searching online. They might need a paper written from scratch in a particular field, for a particular type of journal. They might already have a draft, but feel that they will have a better chance of acceptance if a third party handles the translation, submission, revision or communication with the journal. They might already have published a paper and want to boost its citations; paper mills often create citation networks to inflate the impact of their papers.\n\nAnd journal editors willing to accept bribes can accept a paper with little or no scrutiny. Similarly, peer reviewers can give a positive review in exchange for payment. One of Omar’s reviews is just 12 words long.\n\nAn unpublished analysis estimates that roughly 2% of all papers submitted to journals in 2022 bore the hallmarks of paper mills, and that the proportion was higher in biology and medicine (see Nature 623, 466–467; 2023). Mass-produced papers in these fields are especially worrying for academic--integrity researchers, because of the damaging effect that this junk science might have on patients.\n\nEasy pickings\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, sociologist Xinqu Zhang and criminologist Wang Peng, both at the University of Hong Kong, conducted anonymous interviews with natural-science academics at three elite Chinese universities, as well as obtaining internal documents3.\n\nOne faculty member told a research-ethics subcommittee that they had “indeed engaged in academic misconduct”. But they added that if university and faculty leaders “had not implemented such inhumane policies and forced us so harshly” to publish as many articles as possible, they “wouldn’t have resorted to unethical means”.\n\nMy ‘woke DEI’ grant has been flagged for scrutiny. Where do I go from here?\n\nThis researcher was found out by his colleagues in the faculty, but punishment was lenient: deductions of salary and research funding for that year, without the case being formally reported to others at the university. A committee member handling the case admitted that faculty members admired their colleague’s research, and wanted to avoid negative attention from the rest of the university and the public. A different researcher feared losing his job while dealing with health problems. He told Zhang and Peng that he “had no choice” but to commit research misconduct. He bought access to an official archive and altered the data to support his hypotheses. He then found someone who could help him to write up articles and have them published. “Money is the answer to everything,” he said. “I met all the required criteria in just a few months, and eventually secured a permanent position in the faculty.” These kinds of admission are rare. Authors whose papers have been retracted on suspicion of paper-mill activity tend to remain silent or to deny any participation in research misconduct.\n\nFor example, in 2019, Alexandr Litoy, a Moscow--based journalist, purchased an authorship slot for a paper sold by International Publisher. When Litoy, who made the purchase as part of an investigation into paper mills, confronted his two co-authors, who specialize in engineering and chemistry, about why they had contributed to a paper on entrepreneurship, both said that it was their first time using the services of the company. But neither admitted any wrongdoing.\n\nPaper mills continue to make it easy for authors to take shortcuts. Science Publisher, a company registered in Riga, offers co-authorship slots on already written (and sometimes already accepted) papers, in a variety of fields. Prices start from around $550, depending on the field, journal and position in the list of authors. Services are advertised on the company’s website, LinkedIn page and Facebook page.\n\nThe company Science Publisher is registered to a residential address in Riga.Credit: Jack Leeming\n\nThe company reassures potential buyers that the advertised title and abstract will be rewritten, to ensure that no one finds out that the paper has been purchased. On its website, photos of at least two purported staff members were copied and pasted from a stock-photo site and an entirely unrelated magazine.\n\nA reporter for Nature’s careers team corresponded with Science Publisher about an advertised position as a research-paper author. An employee asked whether she had any ready-made manuscripts, and whether she could provide extra services such as responding to reviewers’ comments.\n\nIn the Latvian business registry, Igor Vasilev — whose passport was issued in Volzhsky, in the Russian region of Volgograd — is named as the company’s owner. The Russian business registry indicates that a person of the same name and from the same region was previously chief executive of the company ANO Publishing House “Scientific Review”, which offers services similar to those provided by Science Publisher. Abalkina thinks that the Latvian company is a front for the Russian one.\n\nScience Publisher denies any connection to Vasilev, or even that the company is based in Latvia. A staff member responded to an inquiry from Nature’s careers team with hostility and suspicion, accusing the editor of “commercial espionage” and calling him a “fraudulent impostor”.\n\nIn one of its final e-mail communications with the team, a staff member for Science Publisher who described themselves as John Palomarez, director of Academic & Publisher Relations, wrote: “Show your press credentials of Nature on camera? Will you send the proof video of you or any personally [sic] how seeking our Company on behalf of Nature? We’re waiting.”\n\nAfterwards, the address listed on the website was changed from Riga to London, although it retained the Latvian phone number. Reporters representing Nature visited both the Riga and the London address. There were no traces of the company at either location.\n\nCurbs and clampdowns",

Pig embryos with human heart cells have survived for 21 days.Credit: Daniel Sambraus/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers have reported growing hearts containing human cells in pig embryos for the first time. The embryos survived for 21 days, and in that time their tiny hearts started beating. The findings were presented this week at the annual meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research in Hong Kong.\n\nScientists developing human–animal chimaeras grow human cells in animal embryos, with the aim of one day generating animals with human organs that can be transplanted into people. This could provide a way to address the global shortage of organs for transplantation.\n\nOne approach to developing chimaeras involves creating animal embryos that lack some of the genes needed to produce a specific organ, such as the heart. Human stem cells are then injected into the embryos, with the hope that the human cells — rather than those of the animal – will form that organ. Several groups have used this method to grow human muscle and blood-vessel cells in pig embryos.\n\nPigs are a suitable donor species because the size and anatomy of their organs are comparable with those of humans, says Lai Liangxue, a developmental biologist at the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who led the latest work. Lai’s team has previously grown early-stage human kidneys in pig embryos that survived for up to a month in pregnant sows. He wanted to see whether similar results were possible for the heart.\n\nBeating heart\n\nIn their study, which has not been peer-reviewed, Lai and his team reprogrammed human stem cells to bolster their ability to survive in a pig, by introducing genes that prevent cell death and enhance cell growth. They then generated pig embryos in which two specific genes that have key roles in heart development were knocked out. A handful of human stem cells were introduced into the pig embryos at the morula stage, soon after fertilization — a point at which the embryo consists of a ball of about a dozen cells that are rapidly dividing. The embryos were then transferred to surrogate pigs.\n\nThe team found that the embryos grew for up to 21 days, after which they did not survive. Lai says it’s possible the human cells disrupted the function of the pig hearts.\n\nWhen the researchers took a closer look at the embryonic hearts, they found that they had grown to the equivalent size of a human heart at that stage of development — the size of a fingertip — and were beating, says Lai. The human cells could be identified because they had been tagged with a luminescent biomarker and were glowing, he adds.",

          "title": "Some US researchers want to leave the country. Can Europe take them?",
          "authors": "Jack Leeming",
          "abstract": "In early May, European politicians and university leaders gathered in Paris at Sorbonne University to deliver a message to US researchers affected by cuts made by the administration of US President Donald Trump: move here instead.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and French President Emmanuel Macron announced a 2-year funding package worth €500 million (US$571 million) to support researchers who want to move to the continent, as part of a scheme named Choose Europe.\n\nAlthough von der Leyen didn’t name the United States or its president explicitly at the 5 May gathering, she said that parts of the world were questioning “free and open research”, describing that attitude as a “gigantic miscalculation”.\n\nIn April, the French government announced that money from the country’s €54-billion France 2030 strategic investment initiative had been set aside to fund international researchers who would like to work in France. Macron confirmed at the Sorbonne meeting that the separate €100-million cash boost would fund half of the costs of scientific projects involving international researchers moving to France.\n\nUS brain drain: the scientists seeking jobs abroad amid Trump’s assault on research\n\nThese announcements are the results of intense lobbying both in the French parliament and at the European level. A French-led conference, held in Brussels on 15 April and attended by French academic leaders and European policymakers, discussed issues around researcher mobility, partnerships and research programmes to help European scientific diplomacy get to grips with the changing global landscape.\n\nEconomist Jean-François Huchet, who is vice-president of France Universités, an association of higher-education organizations based in Paris and Brussels, hopes that coordinating the response at the European rather than country level will help to convince US researchers of Europe’s seriousness, and enable the region to accommodate more of those who want to move. On 19 March, a letter signed by research ministers from 13 European Union member states was sent to Ekaterina Zaharieva, the EU’s commissioner for startups, research and innovation. It asked for dedicated funding (subsequently granted by the €500 million for Choose Europe) and a dedicated immigration framework to “seize this historical moment”.\n\n“All those researchers want to find a new country, a new possibility to continue their work. It’s really important for them to continue working. That’s the reason why I pushed with Commissioner Zaharieva to add [these funds] to Choose Europe. We want to help researchers coming from all parts of the world, especially the United States,” says Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament (MEP) who sits on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Grudler initiated a separate lobbying letter that was sent on 24 March and addressed to both Zaharieva and von der Leyen.\n\n“We can offer a lot of things: world-class universities, academic freedom, research ecosystems focused on excellence, and freedom and support to scientists,” he says.\n\nJānis Paiders, the deputy state secretary for the Ministry of Education and Science of Latvia, adds that his country was among those to endorse the 19 March letter “because academic freedom is under threat across the world”. He also notes there is “an ever-increasing need for Europe’s competitiveness as a whole”. Paiders calls for an “activity boom” to “welcome brilliant talents from abroad”, saying the policy aligns with both European and Latvian priorities.\n\nGrudler’s 24 March letter, signed by 50 MEPs, stated: “In response to this crisis, the European Union must act swiftly to establish itself as a safe haven for these scientific talents. We have the tools and levers to do so, but we must accelerate and expand our response.” The letter also called for an accelerated visa strategy.\n\nPush–pull effects\n\nThere is growing evidence that many US researchers are considering moving abroad. An analysis of Nature Careers jobs-board data showed that US applications for European vacancies increased by 32% in March, compared with the same month in 2024. And a self-selected poll of Nature readers in March found that 75% of respondents were keen to leave the country.\n\nBut some question whether these trends will manifest as a large-scale exodus of talent. For one thing, whereas early-career researchers might be mobile, senior academics, who are likely to be more attractive strategically for European policymakers, could find it harder to leave. “I would expect US politics to have the strongest effects on PhD applicants, finishing PhD students and postdocs. These people are not as deeply attached to the US academic system yet,” says Robert Basedow, who researches international political economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\nUS epidemiologist Scott Delaney is one academic who would struggle to leave. “I have two kids in grade school, ageing parents and a partner who loves her job here in the States.” Delaney runs a laboratory at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant has been cancelled. “Relocating abroad would be a major disruption for all of them.”\n\nOn top of that, there is a big difference in the salary a scientist might expect in Europe compared with that in the United States. In France, for instance, a mid-career researcher might earn around €3,600 a month before taxes. A postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in California, by contrast, would stand to earn the equivalent of around €6,000 a month, according to an analysis by The New York Times.\n\nTrump gutted two landmark environmental reports — can researchers save them?\n\n“It has to be a competitive situation to be able to attract researchers to come out” of the United States, says Thomas Kimbis, chief executive of the US National Postdoctoral Association in Bethesda, Maryland. However, he says, “it depends what happens over the coming months. I think the more time postdocs are sitting without a position, the more attractive just having a position, any position, becomes.”\n\nThere are differences, too, in expenses: Europe is generally cheaper to live in. “You have a huge difference in salary, but of course once you integrate the fees for US education, social security and health care, it’s not as big as the headline figure,” says Huchet.\n\nAnd some think that any single fund won’t achieve large structural changes. “Although ultimately, top US universities have enormous funds, making it quite difficult for many European and other institutions to offer comparable salaries and research conditions, I do not think that a new EU fund can structurally change this situation,” adds Basedow. “Ironically, only Trump can do this, by taxing and eroding the funding and endowments of top US schools and thus undermining the material situation for academics in these places,” he concludes.\n\nChoose Europe’s €500-million funding pledge is also dwarfed by the scale of the cuts the Trump administration is seeking — and has already made — to US science. In May, for example, it proposed cuts of around $5 billion to the country’s National Science Foundation (NSF) budget for 2026, and a $93-million cut to the NSF’s internal expenses. The NIH, the country’s main biomedical and public-health research funder, reportedly faces cuts of almost $18 billion next year. And the value of cancelled NIH grants already totals $8 billion (see ‘Matters of scale’). The EU’s research fund, Horizon Europe, is the largest pot of scientific funding in the world, with a budget of €93.5 billion to be spent until 2027.\n\nSources: Cancelled grants: Grant-watch.us (go.nature.com/4keqthj); NIH/NSF: Nature https://doi.org/prfr (2025)\n\n“Half-a-billion euros and governments that don’t openly sneer at scientists sounds really attractive right now,” says Delaney. But, he adds, “While the €500-million investment is huge, it’s still only a fraction of what the US government spends on health research every year.”\n\nPan-European plans\n\nIndividual universities and organizations in the EU have also announced separate support packages to lure US researchers. In March, Aix-Marseille University in France announced a €15-million programme to attract researchers.\n\nIts announcement was followed by one from the Free University of Brussels (VUB), which funded 12 postdoctoral positions. The Netherlands has also said it plans to open a fund to attract international researchers.\n\nSpain has moved its international-competitiveness budget forward to spend more in this funding window, and is offering an additional €200,000 for each project for US researchers joining institutions in the country.\n\nIn April, the research council of Norway, the country’s main government research funder, pledged 100 million kroner (US$9.9 million) to attract researchers from abroad.\n\n“This is a strategic opportunity that Europe wants to exploit and hopefully will be able to exploit,” says Marianne Riddervold, who researches transatlantic relations at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs in Oslo.",

          "authors": "Paola Barbarino",
          "abstract": "In 2019, I met the health minister of a populous nation. After spending 30 minutes discussing the country’s dementia statistics, the minister politely stopped me mid-sentence — and asked whether I could define dementia. They had never heard the term before.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. As the chief executive of Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI), I’ve had more than one government minister tell me that their country is completely dementia-free. ADI’s 2024 World Alzheimer Report found that 65% of health-care professionals surveyed globally thought that dementia was a normal part of ageing — not a condition caused by a disease (see go.nature.com/3sxtjwj).\n\nEurope sidelines Alzheimer’s drug: lessons must be learnt\n\nThere are many factors behind this global lack of awareness. Dementia’s biological causes are complex and poorly understood, making them hard to explain to people without a scientific background. There’s a stigma associated with the condition that can make people unwilling to engage. And, perhaps because of this stigma, the first organizations to support and advocate for people with dementia weren’t set up until the 1980s — decades after comparable ones for people with cancer.\n\nHowever, in my view, the condition’s invisibility is also partly attributable to a failure of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations to class dementia as one of the world’s deadliest non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Inclusion of dementia in these organizations’ discussions about NCDs could drastically change attitudes worldwide — and could improve access to care and support for people living with the condition and their carers.\n\nIn September, there will be a chance to gain this recognition. During the UN’s fourth high-level meeting on the prevention and control of NCDs and the promotion of mental health and well-being, member states aim to develop a political declaration to chart how the world will address NCDs over the next five years.\n\nReading the signs of dementia\n\nHere’s why dementia must be part of that declaration.\n\nThe UN’s first high-level meeting on NCDs, in 2011, centred on a group of conditions known as the WHO’s ‘big four’ — cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. Being on this list has mattered ever since. The WHO uses it when proposing cost-effective interventions to prevent and control NCDs. Cash-strapped governments use these recommendations to allocate funds.\n\nBut the list is outdated. It is based on the numbers of people killed by NCDs before the age of 70. That might have made sense when the big four were first established — but today, people globally are living longer. In the United Kingdom, for instance, 2017 data showed that men aged 70 and women aged 72 had a remaining life expectancy of 15 years. Those ages are expected to rise.",

Neuroscientists have identified two brain regions that keep imagined images separate from reality, described in a study1 published in Neuron on 5 June.\n\n“Being able to keep apart your inner world and actual reality is quite useful for normal functioning in daily life,” says co-author Nadine Dijkstra, a cognitive neuroscientist at University College London. “This is something that does go wrong in psychosis and schizophrenia,” she adds.\n\nDijkstra and her colleagues developed a method to probe the limit of people’s ability to distinguish real and imagined images. This involved showing volunteers black and white stripes of varying transparency over a background resembling television static. In some trials, the researchers asked the participants to imagine the stripes as they looked at the image, and to report whether they really saw the stripes and, if so, how vivid they were.\n\nWhen participants thought the stripes were more vivid, they were more likely to report them as real, regardless of whether the stripes were actually there.\n\nThe researchers are trying to measure and then model an important yet abstract concept — the interaction between imagination and vision — that until now has been a philosophical question, says Thomas Naselaris, a neuroscientist at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.\n\nBrain imaging\n\nTo correlate the participants’ observations with brain activity, the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) readings of the participants while they viewed the images with and without stripes. The fMRI readings, which rely on tracking changes in blood flow as a proxy for brain activity, showed that activity in a region called the fusiform gyrus correlated highly with the reported vividness of the stripes. Neuroscientists already knew that the fusiform gyrus processes high-level visual information, but its role in distinguishing imagined images from reality was unknown.\n\nThis suggests that the fusiform gyrus sums up the total imagined and real stimulus, says Dijkstra. “The fusiform gyrus is tracking this ‘reality signal’, this vividness signal that then predicts reality judgments [whether participants judged the image to be real],” she says.",

Credit: Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library\n\nA man with a severe speech disability is able to speak expressively and sing using a brain implant that translates his neural activity into words almost instantly. The device conveys changes of intonation when he asks questions, emphasizes the words of his choice and allows him to hum a string of notes in three pitches.\n\nThe system — known as a brain–computer interface (BCI) — used artificial intelligence (AI) to decode the participant’s electrical brain activity as he attempted to speak. The device is the first to reproduce not only a person’s intended words but also features of natural speech such as intonation, pitch and emphasis, which help to express meaning and emotion.\n\nIn a study, a synthetic voice that mimicked the participant’s own spoke his words within 10 milliseconds of the neural activity that signalled his intention to speak. The system, described today in Nature1, marks a significant improvement over earlier BCI models, which streamed speech within three seconds or produced it only after users finished miming an entire sentence.\n\n“This is the holy grail in speech BCIs,” says Christian Herff, a computational neuroscientist at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study. “This is now real, spontaneous, continuous speech.”\n\nReal-time decoder\n\nThe study participant, a 45-year-old man, lost his ability to speak clearly after developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a form of motor neuron disease, which damages the nerves that control muscle movements, including those needed for speech. Although he could still make sounds and mouth words, his speech was slow and unclear.\n\nMind-reading devices are revealing the brain’s secrets\n\nFive years after his symptoms began, the participant underwent surgery to insert 256 silicon electrodes, each 1.5-mm long, in a brain region that controls movement. Study co-author Maitreyee Wairagkar, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Davis, and her colleagues trained deep-learning algorithms to capture the signals in his brain every 10 milliseconds. Their system decodes, in real time, the sounds the man attempts to produce rather than his intended words or the constituent phonemes — the subunits of speech that form spoken words.\n\n“We don’t always use words to communicate what we want. We have interjections. We have other expressive vocalizations that are not in the vocabulary,” explains Wairagkar. “In order to do that, we have adopted this approach, which is completely unrestricted.”\n\nThe team also personalized the synthetic voice to sound like the man’s own, by training AI algorithms on recordings of interviews he had done before the onset of his disease.",

Now physicists have combined that feature with blockchain techniques to generate random numbers in a fully transparent process for the first time1.\n\nPublic sources of random numbers are used for various applications, such as lotteries, jury-duty selection and the assignment of placebos in clinical trials. A process that not only produces numbers that are truly random, but also does so in a trackable, verifiable way, can add an extra layer of trustworthiness, say the researchers who developed the new system.\n\nThis is the fastest random-number generator ever built\n\nTheir approach builds on a quantum-physics-based technique for generating random numbers that was first demonstrated in 20182 by physicists at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, Colorado. It uses a device that produces pairs of photons that are entangled with each other, meaning that they share a common quantum state. The photons in each pair are sent to two measuring stations around 100 metres apart, where their polarizations are detected to produce a string of digital bits (0s and 1s).\n\nThe bits are truly random because quantum physics dictates that the photons are not in a well-defined polarization until they are detected, and that the outcome of that measurement is random. Crucially, the way in which the detections are done is chosen at random, and independently, in each location: any coordination between the two locations would require signals to travel between them faster than the speed of light. The results are then independently checked by devices at the University of Colorado across town.\n\nTamper-proof process\n\nIn the latest upgrade to this system, described in Nature on 11 June1, the team has made it possible for third parties to verify the process by time-logging every step in the measurement using blockchain techniques. The change means that anyone who accesses the publicly available data would be able to see whether the process had been tampered with.",

Credit: Salah Obayya\nChangemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates individuals who have fought racism in science and who champion inclusion. The series often highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nWhen Salah Obayya quit his job at the University of Glamorgan (now part of the University of South Wales) in Pontypridd, UK, in 2012 to lead a new venture at Zewail City of Science and Technology, an Egyptian research and technology park now in Giza, it was a risky career move. He had been recruited to start up the Center for Photonics and Smart Materials (CPSM), with a mission to conduct advanced nanophotonics research. He took on the challenge in the hope that it would give him an opportunity to help shape the future of higher-education institutions in Africa.\n\nWhy Africans should be telling the story of human origins\n\nHe became director-general of research institutes at Zewail City in 2015, a role that allowed him to help broker partnerships between research centres and universities in North and sub-Saharan Africa. Now, as the director of CPSM, Obayya leads teams of researchers based at various Egyptian universities, and conducts in-person and virtual training in photonics — the study of light waves. He also lectures at Zewail City’s University of Science and Technology.\n\nIn 2019, the United Nations science organization UNESCO named Obayya as chair on innovative technologies for sustainable development in Africa. And in 2023, the scientific society Optica, Advancing Optics and Photonics Worldwide, which is headquartered in Washington DC, awarded him its Diversity and Inclusion Advocacy Recognition prize for his work to promote equality, inclusion and diversity in photonics research, and his efforts to empower individuals, especially women, from diverse African backgrounds to pursue research in the field.\n\nObayya’s research focuses on developing nanophotonic devices and creating computational modelling techniques using artificial intelligence. In particular, he works on the development of green nanophotonic technology in an effort to enhance the efficiency of solar cells, which is key to boosting sustainable-energy efforts. Through the Advanced Training Programme in Photonics for African Graduate Students, he trained female researchers, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, and helped them to develop their research capabilities in photonics. Since 2019, he has provided free courses and workshops to students from all African backgrounds.\n\nObayya explains to Nature how his passion for promoting science in Africa led directly to his supporting gender equality in photonics, and why development can move forward only if barriers to women’s career advancement are removed.\n\nWhy is diversity and inclusion in science important to you?\n\nDuring my time in the United Kingdom, where I interacted with colleagues from different backgrounds, I was impressed by how that environment fostered good performance. I realized the importance of diversity, and became aware that my home country of Egypt was missing out on the full power of diversity. The lack of highly trained women in nanotechnology research in Africa means a 50% shortage of the creativity and research expertise that diversity can provide.\n\nI want to ensure that Africans take part in the AI revolution\nAfrica needs a scientific renaissance that not only provides opportunities and roles for researchers of different genders and from different ethnic backgrounds, but also unites these efforts through mentorship and continuous support. After I returned home, promoting diversity among my students and in my team for all African races and genders became one of my most important goals.\n\nFunded by UNESCO, my team and I ran the African graduate training programme to provide African university graduates, especially women, with the opportunity to receive free training in advanced technological applications and to develop their skills and research capabilities to improve their access to master’s, PhD and postdoctoral programmes and the international job market.\n\nWhat made you realize that you wanted to work to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in science?\n\nI returned home with a passion for promoting photonics research in Africa. As director of the CPSM, I was shocked to find that the vast majority of applicants for master’s degrees were women, but that there was a severe shortage of female PhD and postdoc scientists.",

          "title": "How to keep weight off after obesity drugs",
          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "Sheree had maintained a healthy weight for 15 years, thanks to a surgery that wrapped a silicone ring around the top of her stomach. But when the gastric band repeatedly slipped and had to be removed, the weight came back — fast. She gained nearly 20 kilograms in just 2 months.\n\nFrustrated, she turned to the latest generation of anti-obesity medications, hoping to slow the rapid weight gain. She cycled through various formulations of the blockbuster therapies semaglutide (sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Zepbound for weight loss), finding some success with higher doses of these drugs, which mimic the effects of the appetite-suppressing hormone GLP-1. But each time, drug shortages disrupted her treatment, forcing her to start again with a new formulation or to go without the drugs for weeks.\n\nTired of the uncertainty around the therapies, she decided to try something different. Sheree, who asked that her middle name be used to protect her privacy, underwent two minimally invasive procedures designed to reduce the size of her stomach and to blunt hunger cues.\n\nDozens of new obesity drugs are coming: these are the ones to watch\n\nDeveloped over the past two decades, these ‘endoscopic’ procedures — performed using flexible tubes inserted through the mouth, and no scalpels — are just one part of a growing toolkit to help people who want to move away from GLP-1 therapy. More-conventional bariatric surgeries, used routinely since the 1980s to reroute the flow of food through the gut or to restrict the stomach’s size, might also gain wider appeal. And the search is picking up for other drugs that could offer lasting alternatives for a post-GLP-1 population.\n\nThat momentum is driven by a convergence of factors: chronic shortages of GLP-1 therapies, high costs, insurance barriers and debilitating side effects. As a result, many people who start the drugs ultimately stop — with discontinuation rates in clinical trials ranging from 37% to 81% in the first year1. And once treatment ends, the weight lost often piles back on.\n\nAs demand grows for complementary strategies, the landscape of weight-loss treatment, which has been overtaken in recent years by semaglutide and tirzepatide, is now broadening again. In this way, says Ricardo Cohen, a weight-loss specialist at the Oswaldo Cruz German Hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, GLP-1 drugs are not just reshaping treatment — they’re pulling more people into often-overlooked avenues of support.\n\n“The new drugs are a gateway for people seeking obesity care,” he says.\n\nSurgical solution\n\nDuring their early ascent, GLP-1 drugs were often viewed not as a gateway, but as a pharmaceutical fix that might render older weight-loss strategies obsolete.\n\nFor decades, bariatric surgery had been the gold standard in obesity care. In its various forms, including the gastric-band surgery that Sheree first had, the treatment induces substantial and sustained weight loss and improves obesity-related health conditions. And it has a strong safety record, with rates of serious complications and mortality that are comparable to, or even lower than, those of common procedures such as gallbladder removal and knee replacement.\n\nStill, many people with obesity view bariatric surgery as a last resort. The proportion of eligible individuals who undergo the procedures has remained stubbornly low — around 1% in the United States, and not much higher in any other country.\n\nThe arrival of semaglutide and tirzepatide offered a way to reach the other 99% — promising to achieve similar weight reductions without the invasiveness, recovery time or stigma often associated with surgical intervention. “The hype generated by the drugs put surgery in a second tier,” acknowledges Cohen, president of the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) in Naples, Italy, a global professional organization for bariatric surgeons. But he hopes to shift that perception.\n\nIn 2022, the IFSO and its US counterpart revised their guidelines, lowering the recommended body mass index thresholds for surgery eligibility, aiming to make the procedure available to more people who could benefit2. Cohen now sees opportunities to expand the surgery’s reach to people who discontinue GLP-1 therapy or who fail to achieve results with medication alone — and he’s hoping to build the case with clinical data.\n\nAt his clinic in Brazil, for example, Cohen will soon begin enrolling participants for a randomized trial in which people who first lose weight on semaglutide will be assigned to receive bariatric surgery, continued semaglutide injections or undergo both treatments.\n\nTummy techniques\n\nRegardless of whether opinions of bariatric surgery shift, there are other ways to shrink the stomach. Starting in the late 2000s, weight-loss specialists began developing non-surgical approaches that achieve similar results (see ‘Shrinking the stomach’). As an added bonus, these techniques tend to be less expensive and simpler to deploy than are surgical methods, because they require fewer hospital resources and involve shorter recovery times.\n\nThe most widely adopted has been endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), a procedure performed under anaesthesia that internally folds and stitches the stomach into a narrow tube. This reduces the stomach’s volume by up to 70% — to about the size of a banana — limiting food intake and promoting a feeling of fullness, although the weight-loss results are generally more modest than with surgery.\n\nPichamol ‘Sigh’ Jirapinyo, a bariatric endoscopist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, says that nearly half of the people who underwent ESG last year at her hospital or at Bariendo, a US-based network of eight non-surgical weight-loss clinics where she serves as medical director, had previously taken a GLP-1 drug. That’s up from about one in six just two years earlier.\n\nESG systems are approved as obesity treatments in the United States, the United Kingdom and beyond, but the procedure doesn’t work consistently for everyone. Sheree, who is from North Carolina and in her 50s, learnt that first-hand in 2022. When she didn’t get the results she desired from the ESG procedure, her physician recommended an experimental endoscopic method that uses a medical device authorized for other applications.\n\nKnown as gastric mucosal ablation (GMA), the procedure uses argon gas and an electrical current to generate ionized plasma, rapidly raising tissue temperatures in the upper portion of the stomach. The result is a controlled thermal injury that creates scar tissue along the gastric lining.\n\nVivek Kumbhari, a bariatric endoscopist at Mayo Clinic Florida in Jacksonville, and his colleagues have shown in studies in rats, pigs and human tissue that this targeted tissue-burning technique can reduce the upper stomach’s secretion of ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates hunger. It also makes the stomach stiffer, effectively shrinking its capacity (see, for example, ref. 3).\n\nObesity drugs: huge study identifies new health risks\n\nEarly recipients of GMA, an outpatient procedure done under anaesthesia, have experienced some side effects, including cramping, nausea and bloating. But these have generally been mild and temporary, and are more than offset by the weight-loss benefits, according to Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who co-founded the True You Weight Loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina.\n\nMcGowan, in collaboration with Kumbhari and others, published a clinical trial of GMA last year4. The study involved ten people with obesity who had tried to lose weight with diet and exercise, but explicitly excluded anyone who had taken weight-loss medications. Now, the researchers aim to fill that gap with a trial targeting individuals who have discontinued GLP-1 therapy, which is more representative of real-world patients navigating multiple treatment options. Demonstrating the effectiveness of GMA in this population could help to persuade more physicians and potential candidates to consider the procedure, says McGowan — and might pave the way for reimbursement by insurers and health-care systems.\n\nIndividual experiences such as Sheree’s could prove anecdotally persuasive, too. Months after undergoing GMA at McGowan’s clinic — where she paid around US$6,000 for the procedure — she has reached a weight that she feels comfortable with, has had no adverse reactions and is maintaining her weight without GLP-1 drugs. “It gave me an outlet to stop chasing these medicines,” Sheree says.\n\nGut reset\n\nIn a mock surgical suite in an industrial park on the outskirts of Boston, Harith Rajagopalan is testing a proprietary device developed explicitly for post-GLP-1 weight maintenance. When he switches it on, a slender, squid-like catheter shimmers to life. Near the tip, a tiny balloon gently inflates with water that is heated to near-boiling point.\n\nThis tool, inserted endoscopically through the throat, creates a precisely controlled tissue burn much as GMA does, but is targeted at the duodenum, the upper portion of the small intestine, rather than the stomach. Called Revita, it aims to minimize tissue damage and promote regeneration, potentially rewiring how the gut senses nutrients and regulates metabolism.\n\nSuch changes could reverse the harm that chronic high-fat and high-sugar diets do over time, restoring “a more normal physiologic state”, says Rajagopalan, who is co-founder and chief executive of the firm Fractyl Health in Burlington, Massachusetts. “The duodenum is not designed to see Coca-Cola and McDonald’s,” he says.",

He brought together pure and applied mathematics, and was awarded the Abel Prize in mathematics in 2005. The prize citation described him as “the most versatile mathematician of his generation” and as “combining a deep understanding of analysis with an extraordinary capacity to find unifying concepts”.\n\nLax was born in Budapest to two Jewish physicians. Noticing his prodigious mathematical gifts, they arranged for him to be tutored by a leading mathematician, Rózsa Péter. Lax’s father resisted fleeing Europe in the 1930s, thinking that Hungary would be spared the worst Nazi atrocities, but the family finally departed for the United States in December 1941, settling in New York City.\n\nRevealed: the unusual mathematics that gives rose petals their shape\n\nLax published his first mathematical paper shortly after finishing secondary school. At the age of 18, he was drafted into the army, but he was sent to study engineering at Texas A&M University in College Station, and then to work on the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons in Los Alamos, New Mexico. He worked on calculations of shock waves, required for the initiation of nuclear chain reactions. After his wartime work, he took classes at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, Stanford University in California and New York University (NYU), where he received his undergraduate degree on the basis of his combined coursework. He also did his PhD at NYU, becoming a research assistant professor there in 1949.\n\nWhile in secondary school, Lax had begun to study with leading mathematician and German émigré Richard Courant, who headed the Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics at NYU (later renamed the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences). Courant emphasized the benefits of working on mathematical problems that were connected to real-world phenomena. Lax’s connection with Courant became lifelong: he spent his entire career at the Courant Institute. He also continued his involvement with Los Alamos throughout the 1950s, working during the summers at the cutting edge of the application of computers to solving problems in engineering.\n\n‘Mind blowing’: quantum computer untangles the mathematics of knots\n\nThe Lax equivalence theorem gives a good demonstration of the style of Lax’s work. Differential equations consider changes in one variable in response to infinitesimally small changes in others. Many cannot be solved formally, although computers can generate results for small — although not minuscule — changes. But do the computer’s results converge to the true answer as the steps become smaller and smaller? This crucial question can be difficult to answer for any given equation. By examining this in a formal way, Lax proved that convergence was equivalent to stability — a property that is easier to prove — facilitating more-robust analyses.\n\nBecause many phenomena can be analysed through partial differential equations, Lax’s work influenced many fields, including fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, weather forecasting and imaging. He also had a key role in applying high-performance computing to a wide range of problems.",

As a scientist, I’m fascinated by how countries with limited resources have consistently produced world-class players.\n\nThe key is availability of opportunity. Everywhere, you find makeshift sports fields, and networks of coaches help to identify, nurture and elevate talent. Shouldn’t we do the same for science?\n\nAI can help to tailor drugs for Africa — but Africans should lead the way\n\nEvery young person with a curious mind — regardless of gender, geography or socioeconomic status — should have a real chance of becoming a researcher. Science benefits humanity by confronting the world’s environmental, health, technological and social challenges. It should be widely seen as a career to aspire to, a source of pride for families and communities.\n\nBuilding scientific capacity in historically over-exploited countries (often referred to as the global south) is crucial. By 2050, for example, an estimated 40% of the world’s children will be in Africa — many in regions where science is chronically underfunded. And those who do become scientists will face overwhelming obstacles: inadequate infrastructure, limited funding, scant mentorship and exclusion from international scientific discussions. Conventional models of cooperation frequently replicate outdated hierarchies, sidelining those that are most needed.\n\nLocal researchers are best placed to address these challenges and create opportunities for promising young talent. Funding, good facilities, mentorship and networking opportunities are needed to train and support the next generation of scientists in the global south.\n\nSome efforts are already under way. I witness daily how scientific excellence can flourish if given the opportunity, in my role as executive director of the World Academy of Sciences for the advancement of science in developing countries (TWAS) — a programme unit of the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO. With even modest investments, scientists can establish laboratories, develop technologies, advance public health, drive climate adaptation and push research boundaries.\n\nCould Africa be the future for genomics research?\n\nFor example, since 1986, TWAS programmes have provided almost 3,000 grants (each worth US$20,000–70,000) to researchers across the global south.

          "authors": "Pragya Agarwal",
          "abstract": "Patriarchy Inc.: What We Get Wrong About Gender Equality and Why Men Still Win at Work Cordelia Fine Atlantic (2025)\n\nIn 2021, white men managed around 95% of US hedge-fund assets. In 2024, only one of the 40 largest banks in the world had a female chief executive. And in an average UK week, men spend more of their time in paid work or education than doing unpaid tasks such as household chores or taking care of children; for women, it’s the reverse.\n\nHow did we get here? We know the answer, as psychologist Cordelia Fine tells us in her engaging book Patriarchy Inc. Yes, the culprit is patriarchy: gender influences who gets power, status, money and access to opportunities. But where this patriarchal framework stems from and how to build a more equitable society are harder to pin down.\n\nSex and gender in science\n\nFine sets out to dismantle two existing “false visions” for gender equality. The first of these is the view that men and women are ‘different but equal’, a stance that emerged in the 1990s. The second is the concept of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) — a framework of policies and initiatives to increase workplace representation of people from marginalized groups — which has spread like wildfire in the business world and beyond since the 2010s. Fine focuses on critiquing ‘business DEI’ — but, in so doing, misses the chance to explore more effective ways to improve gender equity.\n\nThe various strategies that business DEI has sprouted to improve gender diversity in the workplace, such as diversity workshops and numbers games of equal-representational hiring, are aimed more at boosting productivity than at helping women. The approach is also often tokenistic, and fails to prompt much change: stereotypes and gendered norms continue to influence who gets ahead.\n\nViews about how gender bias arose tend to fall into two camps, explains Fine. Many anthropologists and psychologists point to biology and evolution to justify the widespread gendered division of labour: men tend to be stronger, they say, and women more caring. Others insist that cultural conditioning is at the root of gendered roles. In this world view, children pick up norms about what being a girl or a boy is supposed to mean through messaging from their parents, carers, peers and friends, from the media and books around them. They learn from an early age who typically sews clothes or writes computer code.\n\nFine proposes a compromise: both evolution and social conditioning, she suggests, led to the division of tasks by gender. She argues that this has helped societies to succeed in certain situations: everyone is more efficient when roles are clearly defined. But in my field — behavioural science — extensive research has shown how it has also created status hierarchies, in which men continue to assume ‘important’ leading roles (often well-paid) while women are pushed into supportive, invisible ones (often remunerated poorly or not at all).\n\nDispelling intrinsic differences\n\nAlthough Fine doesn’t discuss it, many feminist movements have long challenged gender norms and the gender binary more generally. And many scholars, including me, have been critiquing the insular and superficial approaches of DEI for a while. But clearly, women continue to carry much of the invisible mental load in the workplace and at home.\n\nYet, at the same time, other pockets of society are strengthening gender norms. There is more pressure on women than on men to have children. Once they do, women are expected to carry the majority of the caring responsibilities. Moves to take away women’s bodily autonomy and choices, along with regular media panic about falling birthrates, contribute to this divide. And toxic ideas of masculinity — that men need to be providers, as well as leaders at work and at home, for example — are gaining traction, perpetuated notably by Internet influencers.\n\n‘Different but equal’ approaches to gender equality lose sight of within-group differences.Credit: Eduardo Gonzlez/500px/Getty\n\nIn any case, it’s a mistake to attribute inherently different abilities to women and men simply because of the sex they were assigned at birth — not least because it ignores within-group differences. Not all women are the same. And beyond individual differences, we know how gender norms are racially grounded and how historic legacies of oppression have played out. Black and Brown women often report being held to different expectations from their white colleagues, as I describe in my 2022 book Hysterical. Efforts to ‘define’ gender through biological parameters — such as testosterone levels, used as a primary indicator of eligibility for women’s sports — typically take white European women as a baseline, even though typical ranges can vary with race and ethnicity.\n\nMore broadly, the idea that there is some sort of ‘feminine’ way of thinking and working has hindered efforts to tackle gender inequalities. It pigeonholes women, putting them into new boxes rather than disrupting the ones in which they have long been held captive.\n\nMissing the mark on DEI\n\nFine touches on the idea that gender equality will improve the lives of everyone — not just those of women. This can at first seem counter-intuitive, because men are at a clear advantage in the current patriarchal framework; on the face of it, it might seem as if giving equal rights to women means limiting men’s rights. I wish Fine had laid out more clearly how gendered norms can also harm men by stifling them into a specific role. Emotional vulnerability, for example, is deemed unsuitable for men, a position that can lead to mental-health issues.\n\nBlack women on the academic tightrope: four scholars weigh in\n\nAnd so gender equality should be the goal in itself. But organizations don’t work to break gender barriers just for the greater good — they want to see value and profit. It is to get them on board that some have endeavoured to ‘sell’ equality work by highlighting that diverse teams perform better. Although originally well-intentioned, this approach has moved away from the original goals of DEI and created new forms of gendered labour. It is mostly women, and people from other marginalized groups, who carry the load of DEI initiatives, for example through informal mentorships.",

          "authors": "Mette Bendixen, Lars Iversen",
          "abstract": "Sand is the most extracted commodity in the world.Credit: Marco Longari/AFP via Getty\n\nWe started our faculty positions in Canada after spending two years as postdocs in the United States. At the time, the COVID-19 pandemic was winding down and in-person activities were slowly returning to normal.\n\nIn this phase of our careers at McGill University in Montreal (where M.B., a geographer, started working in 2021, followed a year later by her husband, L.I., a biologist), we noticed that students seemed hesitant to engage during classes and were often reluctant to approach us.\n\nThis felt like a stark contrast to our PhD studies in Denmark, in which students and faculty members interacted more casually, calling professors by their first name or simply knocking on their door to ask questions.\n\nWe noticed a similar reticence from students seeking to join our laboratories as research assistants. We wondered whether, after years of studying in isolation (some of them, like us, new to the country), the students were reluctant to engage informally with both peers and instructors. \n\nTo attract their interest and inject some informality, in March 2022, we launched SandClub; an interdisciplinary journal club focused on global sand scarcity.\n\nSand is the world’s most extracted commodity and most-used natural resource after water. Together with gravel and crushed stone, it is a key ingredient in modern societies, because it goes into concrete and glass. Yet, its extraction remains mostly unregulated and is still an understudied topic.\n\nWe felt that a journal club would be a great place to start raising awareness of the important issue, and provide a casual, welcoming community for students from all backgrounds and disciplines. \n\nWe wondered whether the name was too provocative, because it builds off the 1999 cult movie Fight Club, in which a disillusioned main character establishes a hidden and exclusive brotherhood through a fight club. But with a witty spin, our point was the exact opposite: ‘First rule of SandClub: you talk about SandClub’.\n\nAt first, we followed a classic journal-club format — reading and discussing relevant and recently published articles. We quickly realized that students wanted more than just paper critiques, but we were careful not to add more extracurricular work to their plates. We surveyed the club and were surprised to learn that many indeed wanted presentations and opportunities to undertake research themselves.\n\nAs a result, we expanded the focus to include broader sedimentary processes and impacts of climate change, and pivoted SandClub towards more-participatory activities. Participants have described how they now feel more confident speaking up in class settings, and that it has given them a better understanding of what often seems like a ‘black box of research’; they’ve developed critical-thinking skills and learnt to analyse data and review manuscripts. Some 3 years in, we have run 25 journal-club sessions, involving more than 60 students from 5 faculties, coming from more than 30 majors. SandClub typically is held twice a month during the semester with about 10–15 attendees, and we bring plenty of snacks. At first, the afternoon meetings conflicted with our young son’s schedule, so we just brought him along. At times, he participated in the discussion, at others, he finished homework, sometimes helped by one or more of the students. Their interactions helped to create a relaxed atmosphere, and reinforced the idea that academia does not have to be rigid — it can be a community in which all are welcome. \n\nWe heard that students appreciate the open atmosphere for conversation and learning. One described that the “almost horizontal relationship” between students and professors as “something they had not experienced elsewhere at the university during their studies”. This informal and non-hierarchical relationship helps us to foster a the kind of atmosphere and learning environment in which students flourish. \n\nWe expanded the format and activities in response to student feedback and the growing interest, offering activities that could be included in their CVs. For example, when asked to review papers, we now ask editors whether we can share the manuscript with SandClub members, enabling students to formally participate in the reviewing process. We incorporate some of their comments in our reviews, including for papers in Nature Geoscience and Nature Sustainability. We update the students on manuscript decisions and hope that, by demystifying the peer-review and publishing process, the students are exposed to this often hidden aspect of research, helping them to understand how research moves from draft to publication.\n\nA SandClub session, at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.Credit: Mette Bendixen\n\nWe have been impressed by their ability to think critically about complex topics around sand scarcity. With student backgrounds spanning geography, biology and the environment, anthropology, engineering and political science, it is helpful for us as reviewers to get perspectives that we might not have thought about. And students say that it has deepened their respect for this lengthy, often tedious process of research publishing and peer review, and shown them that their voice matters.",

          "authors": "Celeste Biever",
          "abstract": "Around the world, teenage boys outperform girls on mathematics tests, and men are more likely to pursue related careers — despite baby boys showing no superior sense of numbers or grasp of logic. Now, a gigantic study of schoolchildren in France pinpoints that this ‘mathematical gender gap’ appears during the first year of school. The finding could help to focus efforts to stop girls from falling behind.\n\nBoys and girls receive similar maths scores at the start of school, but boys pull ahead of girls after just four months (see ‘Watch the mathematics gender gap emerge’). A more dramatic gap in mathematical performance emerges after 12 months of school, according to the analysis, published on 11 June in Nature1.\n\n“This paper suggests that the gender inequalities in children’s maths performance aren’t innate or inevitable,” says psychologist Jillian Lauer at the University of Cambridge, UK. “If we want to stop girls from falling behind, we need to focus on their early experiences at school.”\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThe study authors make a host of suggestions for how to do this — including providing support to children to reduce anxiety around maths; teachers encouraging participation from girls as often as boys during class; and encouraging curiosity and problem-solving outside the classroom.\n\n“Ethically speaking, we cannot do nothing when we see these results,” says study author and neuroscientist Pauline Martinot at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission in Paris.\n\nThe latest study is more comprehensive than previous ones that found a similar gender gap in the first year of school. It covers four cohorts: all children who started their first year of school in France in 2018, 2019, 2020 or 2021. This amounts to almost three million five-, six- and seven-year olds. It confirms the finding across the whole country: the gap emerged in all cohorts, socioeconomic groups, regions of France and types of school.\n\nThis “startling” universality suggests that policies aimed at reducing the gap have to target everyone, says economist Andrew Simon at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. “The policy can’t be limited to a certain group if you really want to fix it.”\n\nPower of big data\n\nThe study uses the power of big data to show that it is the start of formal education — not age — that triggers the gap. In France, children start school the September of the calendar year that they turn six. The researchers compare children who were born just a few days apart but are in different school years. The gender gap is present for boys and girls born in December entering their second year of school, the researchers report, but is absent among their peers born days later, in January, who have just started school.\n\nThe lack of average differences in the performance of boys and girls at the beginning of the first year suggests that the causes lie in the environment children experience once they start school, rather than innate differences in interest or ability, say researchers.\n\n“There might be some biological factor that we haven’t been able to clearly link to maths or spatial reasoning,” says Lauer. “But this paper suggests that their experiences with the world are mattering more than anything else.”\n\nAs babies and very young children, girls and boys display very similar grasp of numbers and logic. “We all have this common core knowledge of mathematics,” says Martinot.",

          "abstract": "Africa’s first continent-wide space agency, the African Space Agency (AfSA), which was inaugurated in April, is looking to secure funding as its first projects get under way.\n\nAfSA is an initiative of the 55-member African Union (AU) and is headquartered in Cairo. It was established to coordinate the work of Africa’s existing efforts in space — more than 20 African countries have space programmes. Priorities will include improving satellite communication, which provides crucial connectivity for rural populations. It also aims to generate and access data from space to track the effects of climate change, provide disaster relief and aid agriculture and water and food security.\n\nHowever, the agency is not yet fully staffed and its budget, detailed programme of action and funding sources have not yet been confirmed. AfSA’s core funding will come from the AU’s overall budget, which was US$606 million in 2024. But it will be supplemented by external sources, such as development banks, says Meshack Kinyua Ndiritu, a space engineer with AfSA. Another challenge will be to get countries at different stages of development to agree on common priorities, he adds.\n\nAn analysis by market-research firm Space in Africa, based in Lagos, Nigeria, shows that African nations’ combined space budgets amounted to $465 million in 2024. Although this is less than 1% of the global space expenditure, the value has grown by 64% since 2018.\n\nSource: Spacehubs Africa\n\nThe European Space Agency, Russia’s Roscosmos and the United Arab Emirates Space Agency all signed cooperation agreements with AfSA at its inauguration event on 20 April. China and the United States also sent delegations.\n\nAmong AfSA’s first joint projects is the Africa–EU Space Partnership, an EU-funded, €45-million (US$51-million), four-year project designed to bolster collaboration between the regions and strengthen the space ecosystem in Africa.\n\nAfSA should seek to make connections equally around the globe, while keeping its focus on the continent’s priorities, says Danielle Wood, an aerospace engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, who specializes in collaboration with African space leaders.\n\nChina has also long worked with Africa’s national agencies, and its role in the continent’s space sector is growing. By value, China’s state-backed technology firms won around one-fifth of foreign satellite contracts in Africa from 2005 to 2013 (US$871.5 million), which was second to France and more than 3 times the $250 million going to US firms (see ‘Satellites over Africa’).\n\nChinese state banks have provided loans for various African space projects, says Rebecca Nadin, a specialist in China’s politics and foreign policy at the ODI Global think tank, based in London. Chinese organizations have built and launched communications and remote-sensing satellites for African countries, as well as providing loans for facilities, and such involvement is likely to grow, says Nadin.\n\nChina helped Egypt to send remote-sensing satellite MISRSAT-2 into orbit in 2023.Credit: Wang Jiangbo/Xinhua via Alamy\n\nThe withdrawal of the United States from international-development funding is likely to have consequences. “International partnerships will change over time, and there will be some evolution, which means that the traditional partnerships may not be working for a long time, and we need to devise ways on how to sustain our programmes without, or creatively with, existing partnerships,” says Ndiritu. AfSA will need to become innovative in its approaches, Meshack adds.",

          "authors": "Heidi Ledford, Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Eight new members have been appointed to the US powerful Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which plays a large part in the vaccines taken by US children and adults. Credit: Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty\n\nAn emergency-room doctor, critics of COVID-19 vaccines and an obstetrician who advises a supplement company are among the advisers handpicked by vaccine sceptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the head of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to provide advice on vaccines to the federal government.\n\nKennedy announced his new roster for the influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on 11 June — just two days after he fired all 17 of its previous members and accused the ACIP of “malevolent malpractice”. The ACIP advises US public-health officials as to who should receive approved vaccines, and when. Those recommendations are then often used to guide whether public and private health-insurance programmes will pay for the shots.\n\nKennedy has pledged that the ACIP will re-evaluate the vaccine “schedule” for children — the list of which vaccines children should get and when they should get them. This week’s shakeup of the committee is “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines,” Kennedy said in a post on the social media platform, X.\n\nWill RFK Jr’s vaccine agenda make America contagious again?\n\nSeveral of the new ACIP members have expressed public support for vaccines. But a number of them have also expressed scepticism; one serves on the board of an anti-vaccination organization, and a second has been a prominent sceptic of the COVID-19 vaccines on social media. As first reported by the biomedical news outlet STAT, Kennedy included four of the new committee members in the dedication to his 2021 book The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health.\n\n“This is a disaster for public health,” says Adam Ratner, a paediatric infectious diseases physician in New York City. “It has the potential to set us back decades.” The HHS did not respond to a request for comment before publication.\n\nFar-reaching implications\n\nInfectious-disease specialists worry about the implications of the ACIP potentially voting to recommend fewer vaccines or fewer doses than are currently advised. Paul Offit, an infectious-diseases paediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine who served on the ACIP from 1998 to 2003, says insurers don’t have to cover vaccines that aren’t recommended by the ACIP. And “doctors or pharmacists who give vaccines may feel that they would be liable for giving that vaccine”, he adds.\n\nEven those who can pay for vaccines out of pocket might find them harder to get without an ACIP recommendation, says Arthur Reingold, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley, because overall demand for the shots will decrease. That, in turn, could lead some pharmacies to stop stocking them.\n\nOffit notes that at the ACIP’s next meeting, which starts 25 June, the panel will decide whether to recommend vaccines for COVID-19, the human papillomavirus, meningococcal disease and RSV. “These are established vaccines, and we’re voting on them?” Offit says. “The entire childhood and adult immunisation schedule is on the table.”\n\nHow to speak to a vaccine sceptic: research reveals what works\n\nKennedy has criticized the ACIP for what he says are rampant conflicts of interest among its members. On 12 June, the biopharma news outlet Endpoints News reported that two newly named ACIP members, Robert Malone and Martin Kulldorff, have received payment for serving as expert witnesses in lawsuits against pharmaceutical company Merck over two of its vaccines. Malone said on X that this work ended six years ago.\n\nKennedy has also said that past committee members did not demand what he considers to be adequate safety trials with control groups that received a placebo, before recommending vaccines.\n\nBut many of the vaccine studies included placebo controls, Ratner says, unless it was unethical to conduct the trial with one. And Reingold, who has served on the ACIP in the past, says that the committee has strict policies regarding conflicts of interest and that committee members must recuse themselves from any vote that might pose a conflict. “The issue of potential conflicts of interest has been radically overblown and unfairly called into question the objectivity of this panel,” he says.\n\nOffit says several independent groups have reviewed previous ACIP members and found no conflicts of interest. “Now, the conflict of interest is real because these folks are indebted to RFK Jr, who just gave them this position,” he says.\n\nVetting process\n\nResearchers are also concerned about the loss of expertise. The committee’s new lineup is “disturbing”, says Nancy Bennett, a public-health specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\n\nIn the past, members were nominated and then vetted by staff at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before being sent to the head of the CDC and, finally, the head of the HHS for approval. Bennett says the vetting process sometimes took years. “The ACIP was meant to be composed of people with deep expertise in the area,” Ratner says. “That’s what we have lost.”\n\nJoseph Hibbeln\n\nHibbeln is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist who once worked at the US National Institutes of Health. His recent papers1 have focused on the connection between nutrition and various disorders, including mental-health conditions, and his LinkedIn profile states that twenty-first-century diets are contributing to “inadequate brain nutrients and are likely contributing to the high burden of mental illnesses worldwide”. A search of PubMed, a database of biomedical papers, did not turn up any papers he has authored about vaccines or infectious disease. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMartin Kulldorff\n\nKulldorff is a Swedish epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Brownstone Institute, a think tank based in West Hartford, Connecticut, that formed “to provide an independent voice for personal liberty” and to oppose lockdown policies instituted by public officials during the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with Jayanta Bhattacharya, the current head of the US National Institutes of Health, Kulldorff wrote the Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, which advocated against COVID-19 lockdowns except for vulnerable populations, and drew much pushback from the medical community.\n\nLast year, Kulldorff wrote in City Journal that he was fired from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for refusing a COVID-19 vaccine even though he already had immunity from being infected. He also wrote that “vaccines are a vital medical invention, allowing people to obtain immunity without the risk that comes from getting sick,” but suggested that trials of COVID-19 vaccines early in the pandemic were not properly designed. Kulldorff did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nRetsef Levi\n\nLevi is a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. He has published several papers on COVID-19, including one2 expressing concerns about side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.

          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "Many of Alex Kachkine’s earliest memories revolve around two core passions. One is engineering. Kachkine’s great-grandfather built bridges, their grandmother developed autopiloting systems for Soviet fighter jets, and their parents have engineering degrees. Kachkine spent their childhood building things. Following in the family’s footsteps, they say, was a foregone conclusion. The other passion — a lifelong interest in art — came about by chance. While on a childhood school trip to the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, a tour guide showed the students a seascape by the French Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The subject is hard to visualize close up; only by stepping back does the image fully resolve.\n\nRead the paper: Physical restoration of a painting with a digitally constructed mask\n\n“That was so intriguing to me that I ditched the group, and they had to come find me later,” Kachkine recalls. “I went back to that room and kept walking back and forth in front of this little Renoir piece. From that point on, it just became apparent that I really cared about art.”\n\nToday, these two preoccupations continue to be drivers in Kachkine’s life, spanning both their career as a graduate researcher in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge and their extracurricular activities. Kachkine has become an avid art collector and recently developed a restoration method in which they use digital tools to create a ‘mask’ of pigments that can be printed and varnished onto damaged paintings (see ‘Adoration restoration’). The method, detailed in a study published in Nature, reduces both the cost and time associated with art restoration and could one day give new life to many of the paintings held in institutional collections — perhaps as many as 70% — that remain hidden from public view owing to damage (A. Kachkine Nature 642, 343–350; 2025).\n\nThe obvious path\n\nKachkine’s early interest in engineering found a ready outlet in high school, at which they spent their final two years in an accelerated biotechnology course run through Austin Community College in Texas.\n\nJoseph Oleniczak, one of the instructors, began working with Kachkine around 2016, and was immediately struck by their talent. As well as teaching, Oleniczak co-founded a company called Fabrico Technology, also in Austin, to help academics to commercialize their intellectual property. When Kachkine began duel undergraduate degrees in mechanical engineering and economics at the University of Texas at Austin in 2018, Oleniczak hired them to create the hardware and software for a bacterium-detection assay being developed by researchers at the university.\n\nDigitally constructed mask brings a damaged painting back to life\n\n“Of all of the students that I’ve had — and I’ve had some phenomenal ones — Alex is the only one we’ve ever brought on,” Oleniczak says. Fabrico eventually licensed Kachkine’s inventions back to them so that they could start their own company, GeneTiger, that same year. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Kachkine received a grant from the US National Science Foundation to develop a SARS-CoV-2 detection assay, which the University of Texas at Austin used to screen employees on campus.\n\n“It wasn’t really diagnostic, but if there was a positive, we could encourage people to go get a proper PCR test,” Kachkine says. “I remember the first day we got a real positive. I’d never had that moment of an invention of mine actually being relevant to someone.”\n\nAfter graduation, Kachkine started looking for jobs but found that many positions required a graduate degree. That’s how, in 2021, Kachkine joined the laboratory of Luis Fernando Velásquez-García, a microsystems engineer at MIT. Like Kachkine, Velásquez-García’s research group defies easy classification, bridging engineering with fields such as aeronautics, astronautics, satellite technology and nanotechnology, and mass spectrometry.\n\n“The lab is not affiliated with any particular part of the university, and we really are our own distinct thing,” Velásquez-García says, adding that when he first came across Kachkine’s application, he thought that their core competence in hard science and entrepreneurial mindset would gel well with the group. “That’s great for where we work, because we create things that often don’t exist yet.”\n\nAs a child, Kachkine was captivated by art.Credit: Alex Kachkine\n\nKachkine’s thesis work tackled a long-standing challenge: developing and optimizing ion sources in mass spectrometry. All mass spectrometers include a device for converting the sample material into a stream of charged particles that the machine can analyse. As they dove into the technology, Kachkine realized what a big role evaporation has in the efficiency of mass spectrometers — “we’re working with microlitre-scale liquids that disappear in seconds,” they explain — yet how little other researchers account for that fact when designing and optimizing their own equipment. “It turns out evaporation is freaking complicated,” Kachkine says. When they looked at the papers that had been published over the past decade that highlight improvements in efficiency, many of the unexpected results they found could be explained by evaporation.\n\nVelásquez-García says that this work, which ultimately allowed the lab to create better, more-efficient devices (A. Kachkine and L. F. Velásquez-García in 21st Int. Conf. Micro and Nanotechnology for Power Generation and Energy Conversion Applications 38–41; IEEE, 2022) exemplifies Kachkine as a scientist: understated, but methodical and dedicated. “If there’s something [they want] to figure out, even if it’s complicated, [they] will spend the time,” Velásquez-García says.\n\nBreathing life back into art\n\nIn their spare time, Kachkine continued to purchase and restore art, ultimately amassing dozens of works spanning multiple genres, from abstract expressionism to modernism. “Many people put their money into savings accounts, and I put money into art,” Kachkine says. “As someone with a degree in economics, I should probably know better, but they bring me a lot of joy.”\n\nBut to afford their hobby on a student’s budget, Kachkine has had to purchase damaged pieces. A few years ago, they bought a late fifteenth century painting known as the Adoration after Martin Schongauer, attributed to an unknown artist, that required significant restoration.\n\nMeet the MIT engineer who invented an AI-powered way to restore art",

          "abstract": "I’ve marked today’s date on my calendar app, knowing that Henry won’t see it there. Three years, and he still finds smartphones mystifying, regarding them with the same visceral distrust he has for Ouiji boards and men who say Gesundheit.\n\n*****\n\n“Seeing family for the holiday?” The Lowe’s cashier asks me as he rings up the shovel.\n\n“No,” I answer, too quickly, recalling that first disaster of a trip. Henry and I had only been married a few weeks when my parents had invited us up to their cabin. Our courtship had been a whirlwind of surprises, followed by a hasty elopement — a challenge to the forces of the Universe that might dare try to separate us — so my family knew little about this peculiar, yet gentle man who’d dropped so unexpectedly into my life.\n\nBut that sticky summer night on the lakeshore, Henry had been flung into a state of terror that no one — Henry or myself included — had anticipated or fully understood. I was sick to my stomach the entire time, convinced that he would disappear before our eyes, and I’d be left alone to explain.\n\n*****\n\nHenry kisses my forehead, reads a book in bed, then goes to sleep with the sun. “Waste of oil, staying up past dark.” It’s funny which little things stick with us: little habits, little comforts, little fears.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nIn the yard, my jogging headlamp illuminates a circle of ragged crabgrass. This corner of the yard between the fence and the garden shed is well hidden from prying eyes, but I still worry that someone might start asking questions.\n\nI dig until late into the night, until I can feel the blisters forming on my palms. Then I cover the hole with a tarp and head inside to bed.\n\n*****\n\n“Have you thought more about this weekend?” I ask in the morning over breakfast: canned fruit and fried hominy for him, Lucky Charms for me. “It’s not too late to stop at the pharmacy if you’ve changed your mind about that prescription.”\n\nOver the edge of his Pennysaver, Henry’s brow furrows. He tries — I know he does — but even penicillin is like magic to him and words such as neurotransmitters and serotonin like incantations.\n\n“I think I’ll be fine this time,” he says with the unflagging confidence of a man who’s seen so much and been through so much that his perception of ‘fine’ has been incurably warped. “What about that invite from your friend Sherry? That barbecue? Why don’t you go, and give them my regrets.”\n\nI’m not going without him, but I don’t argue. He just doesn’t want a repeat of last year, when I could do nothing but stand there, helpless, and watch as he tore around the house, crying out to long-dead friends. He’d spent hours panicked, scrambling for a secure position that our suburban rambler can’t provide.\n\nEven worse than feeling helpless is seeing a loved one in that state.\n\n*****\n\nThe hole grows by shovelfuls: deeper, wider, longer.\n\nClouds block the moonlight. If it rains, will my work be ruined? Will the whole thing be flooded or collapse? Then again, being rained out could mean they’d call it off, and then I’d have done the work for nothing.\n\nNo, not for nothing. For him.\n\n*****\n\nWe’ve packed the day full to avoid the thought of night. Holding hands at a concert. Smiling at parade floats. Wading at the beach. Picnicking in the park. Then finally, walking home slowly, worriedly, watching porch flags flap in the evening breeze.",

          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi",
          "abstract": "“There are so many stars!”\n\nThis might sound like an obvious thing for a professional stargazer to say. But astrophysicist Federica Bianco was reacting to something extraordinary — the first full-colour picture from a telescope that promises to image vastly more stars than any that came before it.\n\nBianco and her collaborators got a sneak peek at the sky as seen through the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a US$810 million, US-led facility that is due to start full operations in the coming months at its 2,647-metre-high site on Cerro Pachón in Chile. To be seen at full resolution, each of Rubin’s 3,200-megapixel shots — captured with the world’s largest digital camera — would take several hundred high definition (HD) television screens put together.\n\nThe Rubin Observatory will map the entire southern sky every 3–4 nights, observing each spot around 800 times over its 10 years of planned operations. Eight science collaborations will sift through the data it produces, each focusing on different questions, from mapping the history of the Universe and its dark-matter contents to tracking potentially dangerous objects in the Solar System.\n\nThe observatory will also capture an unprecedented number of transient and variable astronomical events in real time — stars whose brightness changes unpredictably, for example, and those that explode or suddenly disappear. “We are going to be able to release alerts worldwide on anything that moves or changes brightness — 8 million alerts per night,” says Tony Tyson, an astronomer at the University of California, Davis, who first conceived of the concept for the telescope in the 1990s.\n\nThe team will unveil the inaugural image on 23 June; in the meantime, the researchers are keeping quiet about what it shows. “We’ve been very serious about keeping it capped, so that we can do a big reveal,” says Bianco, who is at the University of Delaware in Newark.\n\nWay, way beyond HD\n\nThe Rubin Observatory’s telescope, named the Simonyi Survey Telescope after the philanthropic foundation that contributed to its construction, will not be the largest eye on the sky. With a diameter of 8.4 metres, its primary mirror will not collect quite as much light as the handful of bigger telescopes currently in operation, let alone the 39 metres of the European Southern Observatory’s Extremely Large Telescope, which is expected to come online in 2029, also in Chile. Nor will Rubin peer as far back into the past as the James Webb Space Telescope, which can sense longer wavelengths of infrared light on account of being in space, and can therefore image more distant objects.\n\nBut where Rubin will excel is in its ability to image large swaths of sky — capturing an area of the night sky equivalent to 45 full moons in each shot — and to do so at a staggering speed.\n\nTyson came up with the concept for the telescope while he was helping to pioneer digital sensors that could replace photographic plates at the world’s optical observatories. Tyson says he realized that Moore’s law — which states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years or so — meant that computers would soon be able to process staggering amounts of data, and that digital sensors would pack in more and more pixels. He could imagine taking larger and larger pictures that could map the Universe’s galaxies — and how images of these structures are distorted by clouds of dark matter.\n\nThe effort, originally called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, was named as a top priority in the US Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey of 2010. Construction started in 2015, after the US National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy both committed funding. In 2019, the US Congress officially renamed the telescope after the late astronomer Vera Rubin, who pioneered the study of dark matter.\n\nBuilt for speed",

But how can non-experts achieve understanding from explanations that, by definition, they are ill-equipped to assess? Across 9 experiments with 6,698 participants (Study 1A = 737; 1B = 734; 1C = 733; 2A = 1,014; 2B = 509; 2C = 1,012; 3A = 1,026; 3B = 512; 4 = 421), we address this puzzle by focusing on scientific explanations with jargon. We identify ‘when’ and ‘why’ the inclusion of jargon makes explanations more satisfying, despite decreasing their comprehensibility. We find that jargon increases satisfaction because laypeople assume the jargon fills gaps in explanations that are otherwise incomplete. We also identify strategies for debiasing these judgements: when people attempt to generate their own explanations, inflated judgements of poor explanations with jargon are reduced, and people become better calibrated in their assessments of their own ability to explain.",

          "authors": "Frank Fernandez, Neal Hutchens",
          "abstract": "Historically, the USA has enjoyed greater academic freedom than many countries, and this has likely contributed to its centrality in global research networks. For years, state-level attacks (such as those by Governor Ron DeSantis in Florida) have undermined academic freedom at single campuses or across public university systems2. But under the Trump administration, coordinated attacks on academic freedom are being carried out at the national level and are targeting both public and private universities. The administration has targeted institutional autonomy by threatening large-scale federal funding freezes to specific universities, such as Columbia University, Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania. These attacks on universities and federally funded research undermine the arrangements (such as having university faculty members rather than political appointees review proposals for federal grants) that make the USA a globally competitive producer of scholarly scientific publications. Even private industry works in partnership with universities on basic research. Bibliometric analyses estimate that 85–90% of publications in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, plus health (STEM+) — including those funded by industry contracts — are co-authored by university-based scientists3,4.\n\nAlthough new for American higher education, the Trump administration’s approach is similar to policies followed by Cold War autocratic regimes such as East Germany, where research funding was politicized and research production stalled. Much of the world experienced exponential growth in science production during the latter half of the twentieth century. By contrast, East Germany stood out for its decrease in STEM+ research production5. When former German Chancellor Angela Merkel reflected on working as a physicist in East Germany before reunification, she described the danger of becoming comfortable with the boundaries imposed by the state, and the benefits — after reunification — of a more open society that pushed you “to your limits” as a scientist. Merkel realized how autocratic rule had badly constrained East German physics research.",

          "abstract": "Much of the research quantifying volume and spread of online misinformation measures the construct at the source level, identifying a set of specific unreliable domains that account for a relatively small share of news consumption. This source-level dichotomy obscures the potential for users to repurpose factually true information from reliable sources to advance misleading narratives. We demonstrate this potentially far more prevalent form of misinformation by identifying articles from reliable sources that are frequently co-shared with (shared by users who also shared) ‘fake’ news on social media, and concurrently extracting narratives present in fake news content and claims fact checked as false. Specifically in this study, we use Twitter/X data from May 2018 to November 2021 matched to a US voter file. We find that narratives present in misinformation content are significantly more likely to occur in co-shared articles than in articles from the same reliable sources that are not co-shared, consistent with users using information from mainstream sources to enhance the credibility and reach of potentially misleading claims.",

Establishing whether and how pro-FGMC norms are maintained through social transmission is a key priority for global eradication efforts. Here we present the first large-scale socio-centric social network study estimating social influence and social selection on preference for cutting female relatives using data from 5,163 Ethiopian Arsi Oromo adults. Statistical modelling, which accounts for network dependence in cross-sectional data, finds signals of ‘contagion’ within chatting, respect and money-borrowing networks. This indicates that social influence contributes to FGMC maintenance. We find no clear evidence of social selection within marriage-advice networks, suggesting these networks are not implicated in FGMC maintenance. Contrary to assumptions underpinning current eradication efforts, we find negligible evidence that FGMC is a social coordination norm (with only 6.3% endorsement) or an empirical or normative expectation. We conclude by making intervention design recommendations.",

          "abstract": "Individual sensitivity to environmental exposures may be genetically influenced. This genotype-by-environment interplay implies differences in phenotypic variance across genotypes, but these variants have proven challenging to detect. Genome-wide association studies of monozygotic twin differences are conducted through family-based variance analyses, which are more robust to the systemic biases that impact population-based methods. We combined data from 21,792 monozygotic twins (10,896 pairs) from 11 studies to conduct one of the largest genome-wide association study meta-analyses of monozygotic phenotypic differences, in children, adolescents and adults separately, for seven psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, autistic traits, anxiety and depression symptoms, psychotic-like experiences, neuroticism and wellbeing. The proportions of phenotypic variance explained by single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these phenotypes were estimated ( h 2 = 0–18%), but were imprecise. We identified 13 genome-wide significant associations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, genes and gene sets), including genes related to stress reactivity for depression, growth factor-related genes for autistic traits and catecholamine uptake-related genes for psychotic-like experiences. This is the largest genetic study of monozygotic twins to date by an order of magnitude, evidencing an alternative method to study the genetic architecture of environmental sensitivity. The statistical power was limited for some analyses, calling for better-powered future studies.",

Here we designed a task that reliably engages these strategies and conducted hypothesis-driven experiments to identify the computational constraints that give rise to them. We found three key constraints: a bottleneck in parallel processing that promotes hierarchical analysis, a compensatory but capacity-limited counterfactual process, and working memory noise that reduces counterfactual fidelity. To test whether these strategies are computationally rational—that is, optimal given such constraints—we trained recurrent neural networks under systematically varied limitations. Only recurrent neural networks subjected to all three constraints reproduced human-like behaviour. Further analysis revealed that hierarchical, counterfactual and postdictive strategies—typically viewed as distinct—lie along a continuum of rational adaptations. These findings suggest that human decision strategies may emerge from a shared set of computational limitations, offering a unifying framework for understanding the flexibility and efficiency of human cognition.",

          "abstract": "The evolution of conversation facilitates the exchange of intricate thoughts and emotions. The meaning is progressively constructed by integrating both produced and perceived speech into hierarchical linguistic structures across multiple timescales, including words, sentences and discourse. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these interactive sense-making processes remain largely unknown. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during hours of spontaneous conversations, modelling neural representations of conversational content using contextual embeddings derived from a large language model (GPT) at varying timescales. Our results reveal that linguistic representations are both shared and distinct between production and comprehension, distributed across various functional networks. Shared representations, predominantly localized within language-selective regions, were consistently observed at shorter timescales, corresponding to words and single sentences. By contrast, modality-specific representations exhibited opposing timescale selectivity: shorter for production and longer for comprehension, suggesting that distinct mechanisms are involved in contextual integration. These findings suggest that conversational meaning emerges from the interplay between shared linguistic codes and modality-specific temporal integration, facilitating context-dependent comprehension and adaptive speech production.",

Since the local impacts are neither well quantified nor widely recognized, we lack policies and common practices to mitigate the potential associated welfare loss in affected communities. Based on a nationwide dataset combining property transactions and large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSSPV) sites, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of LSSPV on property prices and the associated causal pathways. Difference-in-differences estimates show that LSSPV significantly increases agricultural or vacant land value by about 19.4% within a 2-mile radius, while simultaneously reducing residential property values within 3 miles by about 4.8%. The estimated average negative impact on home values is primarily driven by site proximity and diminishes with both distance and time. Effect estimates are more robust to alternative specifications when proximity pairs with visibility rather than invisibility, but no evidence suggests visibility significantly amplifies the proximity effect. Heterogeneous effect estimates indicate that high solar lease potential, being in heavily Democratic-leaning counties, and brownfield redevelopment largely mitigate the negative residential value impact. The analysis reveals no significant heterogeneity across a few factors, including varying site visibility, directional orientation of properties relative to the LSSPV site, and different tracking systems. Evidence indicates that the negative impact on residential values might mainly stem from negative perceptions, but channels through physical conditions cannot be entirely dismissed. Our assessment provides benchmark information for local externality mitigation plans, potentially reducing community opposition and expediting the renewable energy transition.",

          "abstract": "Evolution of complexity in human languages has been vigorously debated, including the proposal that complexity can build in small, isolated populations but is often lost in situations of language contact. If it is generally true that small, isolated languages can build morphological complexity over time, but complexity tends to be lost in situations of language contact, then we should find that forms of language complexity that have evolved multiple times will tend to be associated with population size, isolation, and language age. We test this hypothesis by focusing on one particular form of morphological complexity, polysynthesis, where words built from many parts embody complex phrases. By assembling a global database of polysynthetic languages and conducting phylospatial analyses, we show that languages with highly complex word morphology are more likely to have small population sizes, less likely to occur with many other languages in direct contact, and have a greater tendency to be on long phylogenetically isolated lineages. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that languages that evolve in isolation for long periods may be more likely to accrue morphological complexity. Polysynthetic languages also tend to have higher levels of endangerment. Our results provide phylogenetically informed evidence that one particular form of complex language morphology is more likely to occur in small, isolated languages and is prone to loss in contact.",

          "abstract": "Sporting events are powerful social phenomena that extend beyond the game itself, offering a unique lens to study collective emotional dynamics. We examine emotional alignment among football fans during a high-stakes match in Brazil, focusing on both the game and the preceding Rua de Fogo, a pregame ritual marked by chants, flares, and collective anticipation. Using wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) sensors to monitor heart rate patterns, we apply multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to track group synchrony over time. We find that the Rua de Fogo, driven by its sensory-rich and ritualized interactions, elicited the highest levels of emotional synchrony, surpassing even key moments of the game. This synchrony was sustained across participants, including the driver of the team delegation bus, who was not physically engaged in the ritual. Our results demonstrate the importance of pregame rituals in enhancing shared emotional experiences, underscoring the broader appeal of sports as a cultural phenomenon. By identifying the mechanisms underlying emotional alignment, this work contributes to understanding how collective gatherings promote unity and shared identities, with implications extending to other domains, such as religious ceremonies, political rallies, and public celebrations.",

          "abstract": "Though racial disparities in shortened life expectancy have been well established, racial disparities in the burden of bereavement after such premature deaths are severely understudied. This is, in part, due to a lack of measurement tools for characterizing lifetime exposure to loss. We propose three indices that simultaneously quantify premature and cumulative lifetime loss—two typically unmeasured dimensions of loss. Using a longitudinal US sample of 27,985 participants from the Health and Retirement Study (1992 to 2020) who experienced at least one lifetime loss, hierarchical linear models accounting for participants nested within households showed that Black participants and Native American participants had higher premature and cumulative burden of family member loss over the lifetime than all other racial groups across all three indices. These effects remained for Black participants after controlling for covariates such as parental education, household size, and years in the study. Second, we found that loss burden at study enrollment prospectively related to all-cause mortality. Depending on prematurity, each additional loss related to higher odds of dying during the study period after controlling for covariates such as chronic health conditions. Together, our work leverages prospective, longitudinal methodologies to identify racial disparities in exposure to earlier and repeated death and its impact on mortality among the bereaved. The proposed measurement approach has future applications for understanding how loss exposure—both “too soon” and “too much”—predicts poor health and earlier mortality.",

At the city level, population density has the largest effect on walk mode share and has a positive impact on cycling too, as higher densities bring destinations within feasible walk and cycle distances. Density has the strongest effects in wealthier countries where travelers often have more travel choices, while in lower-income places, walking and cycling may be primarily driven by financial constraints. We also find positive effects of bicycle lanes (proxying for a wider array of street design practices) on both walking and cycling. In the median city, each new km of bicycle lanes is associated with ~13,400 additional km yr -1 of bicycle travel. If every city increased the extent of its bicycle network to the level of Copenhagen, Denmark, our simulations indicate reductions in private vehicle emissions of ~6% and health benefits of ~US$435 billion per year.",

This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. The causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, safeguarding, and more.

          "abstract": "In vitro fertilization (IVF) affects human fertility by 1) increasing the probability of multiple births through the transfer of multiple embryos, 2) raising the proportion of dizygotic twins, which leads to a higher occurrence of one-boy-one-girl twins, and 3) enabling gender selection through preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) when parents have specific gender preferences. While the above-mentioned increase in multiple births is well documented, the impact on the twins’ gender composition remains under-explored, partly because 2) and 3) are intertwined. This study uses millions of administrative observations from Taiwan to disentangle the effects of IVF on twin birth rates, gender composition, and parental preferences. Families are grouped by maternal age and family wealth across different periods, enabling a comparative analysis of socioeconomic and temporal factors. By examining the gender composition of first-born twins within these age-wealth-time groups, we can identify and test whether parents have gender preferences for one-boy-one-girl twins. Our empirical evidence reveals a significant increase in IVF adoption, particularly among older and wealthier mothers. The proportion of one-boy-one-girl twins among first-birth twins has risen from 20.42 to 41.86% over the past 30 y, and this proportion increases with wealth ranking, significantly exceeding expected ratios in the absence of gender preference. Parental gender preference contributed to approximately 10.95% of one-boy-one-girl twins among the wealthiest group, revealing a significant impact of parental preference on twin gender composition. These trends raise ethical and social concerns regarding reproductive technologies.",

          "abstract": "Cellular senescence, a major contributor to aging and age-related pathologies, is characterized by irreversible proliferative arrest and a disease-linked, proinflammatory profile known as the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). A critical unanswered question is whether these properties are regulated by specific enhancer subsets, potentially licensing strategies that selectively block deleterious SASP components. Here, we identify two functionally distinct and independently regulated enhancer programs underlying senescence that are controlled by different TGF-β family ligands. Whereas Activin A stimulates recruitment of nuclear factor IA/C (NFIA/C) and SMAD2/3 transcription factors to an enhancer network that induces proliferation arrest, TGF-β2 promotes SMAD2/3-mediated suppression of a p65-dependent enhancer cohort driving the SASP. We have also uncovered reciprocal SMAD2/3-super-enhancer-regulated feedback loops that govern expression of the TGF-β2 ( TGFB2) and Activin A ( INHBA ) transcription units, both of which are significantly up-regulated in replicative senescence. The characteristic enhancer usage and transcriptional landscape of high-passage senescent cells are sensitive to rapamycin treatment, discontinuation of which results in robust but selective senescent enhancer activation and exacerbation of the SASP. Collectively, this study uncovers separable enhancer programs and their key constituent transcription factors that contribute to the canonical features of cellular senescence, potentially informing the development of SASP-targeted therapies.",

          "abstract": "Intermediate filaments are key regulators of cell mechanics. Vimentin, a type of intermediate filament expressed in mesenchymal cells and involved in migration, forms a dense network in the cytoplasm that is constantly remodeling through filament transport, elongation/shortening, and subunit exchange. While it is known that filament elongation involves end-to-end annealing, the reverse process of filament shortening by fragmentation remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of in vitro reconstitution, probed by fluorescence imaging and atomic force microscopy, with theoretical modeling to uncover the molecular mechanism involved in filament breakage. We first show that vimentin filaments are composed of two populations of subunits, half of which are exchangeable and half immobile. We also show that the exchangeable subunits are tetramers. Furthermore, we reveal a mechanism of continuous filament self-repair, where a soluble pool of vimentin tetramers in equilibrium with the filaments is essential to maintain filament integrity. Filaments break due to local fluctuations in the number of tetramers per cross-section, induced by the constant subunit exchange. We determine that a filament tends to break if approximately four tetramers are removed from the same filament cross-section. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of association/dissociation and fragmentation to estimate the binding energy of a tetramer to a complete versus a partially disassembled filament. Our results provide a comprehensive description of vimentin turnover and reveal the link between subunit exchange and fragmentation.",

These algorithms are typically evaluated computationally, using test sets generated by sampling the edges uniformly at random. However, as we demonstrate, this evaluation approach introduces a bias toward “rich nodes,” i.e., those with higher degrees in the network. More concerningly, this bias persists even when different network snapshots are used for evaluation, as recommended in the machine learning community. This creates a cycle in research where newly developed algorithms generate more knowledge on well-studied biological entities while understudied entities are commonly overlooked. To overcome this issue, we propose a weighted validation setting specifically focusing on low-degree nodes and present AWARE strategies to facilitate bias-aware training and evaluation of link prediction algorithms. These strategies can help researchers gain better insights from computational evaluations and promote the development of new algorithms focusing on novel findings and understudied proteins.",

          "abstract": "Plague continues to pose a public health problem in multiple regions of the world, including Madagascar, where it is characterized by a pronounced seasonal pattern. The drivers of plague seasonality remain poorly understood. Using a deterministic compartmental model, calibrated to rat and flea capture data, serological data collected in active rural foci, and human plague surveillance data, we analyzed the effects of seasonal rat and flea population dynamics on plague transmission. The models that incorporated seasonal fluctuations in rat and flea populations provided better predictive performances than those that did not. We found that a simpler mass-action model also performed well. Driven by these seasonal changes, the effective reproduction number (R e ) between rats peaks at 1.45 [95% credible interval (CI): 1.41, 1.48] in October and falls to 0.6 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.63) in March. We estimated that 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.9%) of rats are infected annually, indicating that plague is not the main driver of rat population changes. Using our model, we evaluated intervention strategies and found that targeting both rats and their fleas at the start of the epidemic season (July–September) was the most effective approach for reducing human plague cases. Such an approach contrasts with the reactive strategy currently employed in Madagascar. Our findings highlight the role of flea and rat populations in plague seasonality and identify strategies that could be deployed in Madagascar to better control plague epidemics.",

Our findings elucidate the interactions within the ADAM17–iRhom2 complex, the inhibitory mechanisms of the therapeutic MEDI3622 antibody and ADAM17 prodomain, and the previously unknown role of a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic reentry loop of iRhom2 involved in the mechanism of activation.

          "abstract": "Positive-strand RNA viruses are important pathogens of humans and plants. These viruses built viral replication organelles (VROs) with the help of co-opted host proteins and intracellular membranes to support robust virus replication in infected cells. Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a model (+)RNA virus, assembles membranous VROs, which are associated with vir-condensate substructures driven by TBSV p33 replication-associated protein. In this work, we provide evidence that the peroxisome-associated TBSV and the mitochondria-associated carnation Italian ringspot virus hijack the host small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) machinery in yeast model host and plants. Based on knockdown of components of the SUMO pathway, we show that SUMO machinery acts as a cellular proviral dependency factor during TBSV replication. The sumoylation machinery was found to be partially retargeted from the nucleus into vir-condensate associated with membranous VROs through direct interactions with TBSV p33. We developed a yeast-based sumoylation assay that demonstrated p33 sumoylation. Absence of sumoylation or mutations in SIM SUMO-interacting motif in p33 replication protein reduced the ability of p33 to form droplets in vitro via phase separation. We demonstrate that p33 sumoylation and its intrinsically disordered region play noncomplementary roles in droplet formation. Mutations in p33 sumoylation sites and p33-SIM sequence resulted in reduced-sized VROs, which showed diminished protection of TBSV p33 and the viral RNA from degradation and also reduced viral RNA recombination. Altogether, the co-opted host sumoylation machinery promotes viral replication and RNA recombination. This finding could provide opportunities for antiviral interventions via targeting protein posttranslational modifications.",

          "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness among the elderly. It is characterized by degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which can develop into choroidal neovascularization (CNV) to cause severe and rapid vision loss. Preventing this progression might help save vision, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, using clinical AMD samples and the gene knockout mice, we reported that the m 1 A eraser ALKBH3 reshaped retinal metabolism to promote this progression. In RPE, the dm 1 ACRISPR system demonstrated that ALKBH3 demethylated the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme HK2 to activate glycolysis, resulting in excess lactate production. This lactate promoted histone lactylation at H3K18, which in turn bound to ALKBH3 to amplify its transcription, establishing a positive feedback loop. The ALKBH3 inhibitor HUHS015 disrupted this loop, effectively mitigating RPE degeneration. Furthermore, ALKBH3 directly targeted the proangiogenic factor VEGFA to modulate the metabolic cross-talk between RPE and choroidal capillaries, thus promoting CNV. HUHS015 inhibited CNV synergistically with the anti-VEGF drug Aflibercept. Overall, our study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms and metabolic events that facilitates the progression from RPE degeneration to CNV in AMD, laying the groundwork for new treatments of age-related retinal disorders.",

          "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a prevalent pathogen that chronically infects the majority of human population. Among the many features that allow such widespread HCMV infection, one is its ability to maintain a transcriptionally dormant immune-evasive state called latency by suppressing its own major immediate early promoter (MIEP) via epigenetic alterations. In this study, we show a mechanism of MIEP regulation in which the major immediate early (MIE) gene product, immediate early 1 (IE1) transcript, downregulates its own promoter activity in an m 6 A modification-dependent manner. We found that the loss of the m 6 A writer, METTL3, in host cells impedes latency establishment in these cells. Through transcriptome-wide m 6 A profiling of latently infected monocytes, we identified that the major immediate early gene product IE1 transcript is m 6 A-modified during latent infection. Using IE1-specific m 6 A-abolished mutants, we found that m 6 A modification of the IE1 transcript was necessary for the efficient repression of MIEP, and these mutant viruses exhibited a significant defect in establishing latency and progressed toward lytic-like infection in the human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and primary CD14+ monocytes. Our findings demonstrate that HCMV exploits the host m 6 A machinery to suppress its own lytic program to establish latency and uncover an unexpected role of immediate early gene messenger RNA (mRNA) in regulating its own expression.",

The resulting growth–defense trade-offs constrain the utility of JA-based plant defense inducers to enhance endogenous pest resistance. Here, we designed and screened selective JA receptor agonists by synthesizing 6-substituted 1-oxoindanoyl isoleucine (In-Ile) conjugates and their free-acid forms, structural mimics of the bioactive hormone (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-L-Ile. These compounds differentially activate JA responses through selective binding of specific COI-JAZ coreceptor complexes. Notably, In-Ile treatments enhanced rice resistance to brown planthopper attack, a destructive rice pest, under both laboratory and field conditions, without compromising rice’s growth or yield. Mechanistically, this agonist activates the OsMYB55-mediated lignin biosynthesis defense receptor module [OsCOI1a/2-OsJAZs (3,4,6,7,12)] without activating the growth-suppression receptor module (OsCOI1b-OsJAZs). These findings demonstrate that synthetic JA agonists can provide nuanced manipulations of endogenous plant defenses without yield penalties—a promising biorational strategy for pest control in rice.",

          "abstract": "Cancer therapy is limited by resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapeutic and/or by treatment-associated toxicity. Identifying molecular mechanisms that modulate cellular toxicity is crucial for enhancing treatment efficacy. We characterize CDADC1, a vertebrate-specific orphan enzyme, as an unprecedented eukaryotic dCTP deaminase. CDADC1 catalyzes the conversion of dCTP into dUTP. While bacteria use this activity to sustain proliferation, CDADC1 evolved independently and is not required for mammalian cell proliferation, as demonstrated in cell lines and by the normal growth and standard lifespan of Cdadc1-deficient mice. However, we uncover a role of CDADC1 in metabolizing nucleotide analogs gemcitabine and decitabine. Gain- and loss-of-function assays in cancer cell lines, along with ectopic mouse models of pancreatic cancer, show that CDADC1 reduces these drugs’ efficacy. By the same token, Cdadc1 −/− mice are hypersensitive to gemcitabine. Mechanistically, CDADC1 deaminates the active triphosphate form of gemcitabine and decitabine, rendering them susceptible to inactivation by deoxyuridine triphosphatase. In contrast, the dCMP deaminase DCTD contributes to cell proliferation and promotes gemcitabine and decitabine toxicity. Thus, CDADC1 underpins a previously unrecognized mechanism of intrinsic chemoresistance in cancer cells and has a nonredundant role in protecting from gemcitabine toxicity. CDADC1 reveals a clinically relevant metabolic pathway that might be exploited to enhance the efficacy of deoxycytidine analogs but calls for assessing CDADC1 status to avoid lethal toxicities.",

Here, we recapitulated the entire process of immunotherapy from response to AIR in mice with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). With implanted tumor organoids derived from these models and serial transplants, we demonstrated that tumor cell–intrinsic mechanisms contributed significantly to AIR. Single-cell RNA sequencing and electron microscope assays revealed that resistant tumor cell–expressing collagens, including Col3a1 and Col6a1 , formed multiple physical barriers surrounding tumor cells. Disruption of these barriers by collagenase or knockout of both Col3a1 and Col6a1 in tumor cells could sensitize the tumors of AIR. Mechanistically, the TGFβ pathway was upregulated upon immunotherapy, and treatment with TGFβ significantly increased the expression levels of both Col3a1 and Col6a1 in tumor cells. COL3A1 formed a castle-like barrier for a cluster of tumor cells and prevented T cell infiltration, while COL6A1 formed an armor-like barrier surrounding individual tumor cells to protect them against direct T cell attack. Our data reveal a tumor cell–intrinsic mechanism of AIR, mediated by collagen-containing physical barriers, which immediately suggests a clinical treatment option.",

          "abstract": "Germ cells transmit genetic information to offspring and maintain the genome of the species. In many animals including Drosophila , germ cell formation relies on maternal determinants in the germ plasm. Several proteins present in the germ plasm of oocytes also localize to the perinuclear nuage in nurse cells, where they contribute to the production of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These piRNAs guide the silencing of transposons, thereby protecting the germline genome from invading mobile elements. Aubergine (Aub) is a germ plasm/nuage protein and a piRNA-directed endonuclease that inactivates transposons. Aub is also essential for germ plasm assembly. The Aub-bound piRNAs in the germ plasm are inherited by the progeny germline and serve as templates for piRNA biogenesis in the next generation. Thus, piRNA production in the nurse cell nuage is thought to be coordinated with germ plasm assembly in the oocyte. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that a maternal factor, named tiny pole plasm ( tpp ), mediates this coordination. Tpp is a GTSF1 family PIWI cofactor. In tpp − ovaries, the production of piRNAs, particularly Aub-bound piRNAs, is defective, resulting in reduced Aub localization to the germ plasm and impaired germ cell formation. Notably, the levels of piRNA production required for proper Aub localization are much higher than those required for transposon silencing. We propose that producing abundant piRNAs beyond what is required for transposon silencing in the ovary promotes germ plasm assembly, thereby enabling the progeny germline to properly silence transposons for species survival.",

We have also electroporated M. leprae with a ColE1 -integration proficient plasmid expressing GeNL and shown that the transformed leprosy bacilli could be propagated in mice footpads and detected using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS).

Experimental and simulation evidence shows that this simplistic view is untrue. We demonstrate that the failure of the classical mean curvature flow description of grain growth mainly originates from the shear deformation naturally coupled with GB motion (i.e., shear coupling). Our findings are built on large-scale microstructure evolution simulations incorporating the fundamental (crystallography-respecting) microscopic mechanism of GB migration. The nature of the deviations from curvature flow revealed in our simulations is consistent with observations in recent experimental studies on different materials. This work also demonstrates how to incorporate the mechanical effects that are essential to the accurate prediction of microstructure evolution.",

Although CD18 (LFA-1) has been implicated as a receptor on myeloid cells, the mechanisms underlying HlyA cytotoxicity to epithelial cells are poorly defined. Here, we show that HlyA secretion by UPEC markedly intensifies renal tubular epithelial injury in a murine model of ascending pyelonephritis. A CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen in renal collecting duct cells revealed an unexpected requirement for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in HlyA-induced cytotoxicity. Following internalization, HlyA triggered lysosomal permeabilization, resulting in protease leakage, cytoplasmic acidification, and mitochondrial impairment, culminating in rapid epithelial cell death—a pathway distinct from canonical membrane-disrupting mechanisms of other PFTs. Moreover, we identify the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) as a critical epithelial receptor for HlyA; genetic ablation or competitive inhibition of the HlyA–LDLR interaction fully abrogated cytotoxicity. Our findings detail a paradigm for HlyA function in which epithelial toxicity relies on LDLR-mediated endocytic uptake rather than plasma membrane poration. These mechanistic insights illuminate potential therapeutic strategies to attenuate HlyA-mediated tissue damage during UPEC infections.",

          "abstract": "Human emissions continue to influence Earth’s climate. Effective radiative forcing quantifies the effect of such anthropogenic emissions together with natural factors on Earth’s energy balance. Evaluating the exact rate of effective radiative forcing is challenging, because it can not be directly observed. Therefore, estimating the effective forcing usually relies on climate models. Here, we present an estimate of effective radiative forcing that makes optimal use of observations. We use machine learning to learn the relationship between surface temperature and radiation caused by internal variability in a multimodel ensemble. Combining this with observations of surface temperature and the Earth’s net radiative imbalance, we predict an effective forcing trend of 0.71 ± 0.21 Wm − 2 per decade for 2001–2024. This is an independent assessment of the observed effective radiative forcing since 1985, that can be updated simultaneously with available observations and aligns with our physical understanding of radiative feedbacks. We make advances to close the Earth’s energy budget on annual timescales, by separating the influence of forcing versus the radiative response to surface temperature variations. Effective radiative forcing has substantially increased since 2021 and has not been countered by a strongly negative radiative response until 2024, consistent with exceptional warmth in 2023 and 2024.",

The jump model was completely solved analytically in our previous work and provides the exact distribution of syntenic gene block lengths (SBL) in compared genomes based on gene translocations alone. Comparing the SBL distribution predicted by the jump model with the distributions empirically observed for multiple groups of closely related bacterial and archaeal genomes, we obtained robust estimates of the genome rearrangement to gene flux (gain and loss) ratio. In most groups of bacteria and archaea, this ratio was found to be on the order of 0.1 indicating that the loss of synteny in the evolution of bacteria and archaea is driven primarily by gene gain and loss rather than by gene translocation.",

SMXL proteins control diverse aspects of growth, development, and environmental adaptation in plants through transcriptional corepression and interactions with transcriptional regulator proteins. In flowering plants, the SMXL family comprises four phylogenetic clades with different roles. Functions of the aSMAX1 clade include control of germination and seedling development, while the SMXL78 clade controls shoot architecture. We investigated how SMXL roles are specified in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through promoter-swapping experiments, we found that SMXL7 can partially replicate SMAX1 function, but SMAX1 cannot replace SMXL7 . This implies that the distinct roles of these genes are primarily due to differences in protein sequences rather than expression patterns. To determine which part of SMXL proteins specifies downstream control, we tested a series of protein chimeras and domain deletions of SMAX1 and SMXL7. We found an N-terminal region that is necessary and sufficient to specify control of germination, seedling growth, or axillary branching. We screened 158 transcription factors (TFs) for interactions with SMAX1 and SMXL7 in yeast two-hybrid assays. The N-terminal domain was necessary and/or sufficient for most of the 33 potential protein–protein interactions that were identified for SMAX1. This finding unlocks different ways to engineer plant growth control through cross-wiring SMXL regulatory “input” and developmental “output” domains from different clades and lays a foundation for understanding how functional differences evolved in the SMXL family.",

In analogy to unavoidable energy losses in conventional particle accelerators due to electromagnetic radiation and inelastic collisions, the system displays undesired water-wave dampening, which we address through the synchronized action of underwater wavemakers. Our analogies extend the resonance mechanisms of synchrotrons to generate and sustain gravity waves in closed waveguides efficiently.

          "abstract": "The Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling Protein (MAVS) is a key adaptor in antiviral immunity, mediating type I interferon responses downstream of RIG1 and TLR3. While MAVS regulation is essential for antiviral defense, its modulation in keratinocytes is poorly understood. Here, we examine the role of the CARD14–BCL10–MALT1 (CBM) complex, a skin-specific signaling module, in controlling MAVS-dependent antiviral responses. We identify CARD14 short as a dual regulator that activates NF-κB while inhibiting IRF3 signaling. Psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations are less efficient in restricting IRF3 activation and cytokine production upon Poly (I:C) stimulation, highlighting a potential mechanism in psoriasis pathogenesis. BCL10 is essential for MAVS-induced IRF3 activation, while MALT1 limits IRF3 signaling by promoting MAVS cleavage, K48-linked ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Genetic and chemical inhibition of MALT1 enhances IRF3 activation and type I IFN expression. These findings reveal a MAVS-CBM regulatory network linking innate immunity to epithelial homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "Biological microswimmers exhibit intricate taxis behaviors in response to environmental stimuli and swim in complex trajectories to navigate their environment. How microswimmers respond to stimulus instantaneously, and how adaptation to stimulus influences their long-term behavioral changes, remains largely unclear. Here, we report an oscillatory phototaxis observed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii at intermediate light intensities, where cells swim back-and-forth under a constant, unidirectional light stimulus due to alternation between positive and negative phototaxis. The phototaxis switching can be captured by the change in phase relationship between eyespot and helical swimming. Oscillatory phototaxis of individual cells leads to a global pattern of millimeter-scale propagating density bands that persists for ∼ 30 min. High-speed imaging and long-time tracking experiments at single-cell level verify a unified phototaxis mechanism that couples light detection, light adaptation, flagella responses, and behavioral switching. By experimentally tracking steady swimming and transient turning states, we verify that phototaxis transition is achieved via the modulation of flagella waveforms and flagella phase difference, which can be captured by a hydrodynamic model accounting for photoresponses. Adaptation acts effectively as an oscillator damper to mediate multipurpose tasking across multiple system levels (subcellular flagella beats, oscillatory phototaxis, colonial pattern formation) and timescales (from milliseconds to over 30 min). This adaptive phototaxis mechanism provides a comprehensive understanding of how microswimmers achieve complex behavioral changes across multiple temporal scales with a single sensor–actuator circuit featuring relatively simple adaptive feedback responses.",

Using a nanobody-based BRET method, we demonstrate that oligomerization of endogenous CXCR4 on lymphoid cancer cell lines correlates with enhanced expression levels. Specific disruption of CXCR4 oligomers reduced basal cell migration and prosurvival signaling via changes in the phosphoproteome, indicating the existence of constitutive CXCR4 oligomer-mediated signaling. Oligomer disruption also inhibited growth of primary CLL 3D spheroids and sensitized primary malignant cells to clinically used Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Given its limited efficacy in some patients and the ability to develop resistance, sensitizing malignant B cells to venetoclax is of clinical relevance.

In cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease that arises from mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene, there are signs of multiorgan disease affecting the function of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems already present at birth. Thus, treating CF patients early is crucial for preventing or delaying irreversible organ damage. Here, we demonstrate proof-of-concept of multiorgan mutation correction in CF using peptide nucleic acids encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles and delivered systemically in utero. In utero editing was associated with sustained postnatal CFTR activity, at a level similar to that of wild-type mice, in both respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues, without detection of off-target mutations in partially homologous loci. This work suggests that systemic in utero gene editing represents a viable strategy for treating monogenic diseases before birth that impact multiple tissue types.",

In this study, we investigated whether and how the MMR protein Msh2 affects TI of isogenic donor DNA. We found that HR-dependent TI is suppressed by Msh2 only when a homology arm of donor DNA is as short as 1.7 kb. In contrast, single-strand annealing–mediated TI, which is cell cycle–independent and becomes prominent when HR or non-homologous end joining is inactivated, is weakly but constantly affected by Msh2 irrespective of the size of homology arms. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized type of HR suppression by Msh2 and provide implications for precise genome editing using short-arm donor DNA vectors.",

          "abstract": "PKD2 is a member of the polycystin subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel subunits which traffic and function in primary cilia organelle membranes. Millions of individuals carry pathogenic genetic variants in PKD2 that cause a life-threatening condition called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Although ADPKD is a common monogenetic disorder, there is no drug cure or available therapeutics which address the underlying channel dysregulation. Furthermore, the structural and mechanistic impacts of most disease-causing variants are uncharacterized. Using direct cilia electrophysiology, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and superresolution imaging, we have found mechanistic differences in channel dysregulation caused by three germline missense variants located in PKD2’s pore helix 1. Variant C632R reduces protein thermal stability, resulting in impaired channel assembly and abolishes primary cilia trafficking. In contrast, variants F629S and R638C retain native cilia trafficking but exhibit gating defects. Cryo-EM structures (2.7 to 2.8 Å resolution) indicate loss of critical pore helix interactions which precipitate allosteric collapse of the channels inner gate. Results demonstrate how ADPKD-causing mutations cause mechanistically divergent and ranging impacts on PKD2 function, despite their shared structural proximity. These unexpected findings highlight the need for structural and biophysical characterization of polycystin variants, which will guide rational drug development of ADPKD therapeutics.",

In ecology, predicting the regime of population fluctuations under unobserved levels of an environmental driver has remained an unsolved challenge with important implications for conservation and management. Here, we show that integrating time-series data and information on a putative driver into a Gaussian Process regression model for the system’s dynamics allows us to predict dynamical regimes without the need to specify the equations of motion of the system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict fixed-point, cyclic, or chaotic dynamics under unseen levels of a control parameter for a range of simulated population dynamics models. For a model with an abrupt population collapse, we show that our approach goes beyond an early warning signal by characterizing the regime that follows the tipping point. We then apply our approach to data from an experimental microbial food web and from a lake planktonic food web. We find that we can reconstruct transitions away from chaos in the microbial food web and anticipate the dynamics of the oligotrophic regime in the planktonic food web. These results lay the groundwork for making rational decisions about preventing, or preparing for, regime shifts in natural ecosystems and other dynamical systems.",

Yet LLMs hallucinate, lack common sense, and are biased—shortcomings that may reflect LLMs’ inherent limitations and thus may not be remedied by more sophisticated architectures, more data, or more human feedback. Relying solely on LLMs for complex, high-stakes decisions is therefore problematic. Here, we present a hybrid collective intelligence system that mitigates these risks by leveraging the complementary strengths of human experience and the vast information processed by LLMs. We apply our method to open-ended medical diagnostics, combining 40,762 differential diagnoses made by physicians with the diagnoses of five state-of-the art LLMs across 2,133 text-based medical case vignettes. We show that hybrid collectives of physicians and LLMs outperform both single physicians and physician collectives, as well as single LLMs and LLM ensembles. This result holds across a range of medical specialties and professional experience and can be attributed to humans’ and LLMs’ complementary contributions that lead to different kinds of errors.

To explore liver biology changes across a lactation-wean cycle, we employed transcriptomic profiling. We identified elevated hepatocyte proliferation and anabolic metabolism gene signatures during lactation, consistent with the liver being a major producer of substrates needed for milk production. Rapid loss of these capacities upon weaning correlated with catabolic metabolism, lysosomal-mediated cell death, and an enrichment of immune-suppressive cells. Furthermore, we identified that the transcriptional profiles associated with liver involution share similarities with the gene expression patterns of liver premetastatic niches.

This malignancy usually develops resistance to conventional chemotherapy, underscoring the need for robust preclinical models to guide the development of novel therapies. Here, we introduce an HGSC mouse model generated via Ovgp1 -driven Cre recombinase effecting CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Trp53, Rb1 , and Nf1 tumor suppressors in mouse oviductal epithelium ( m-sgPRN model). Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) inactivation—frequently observed in human HGSC—is associated with poorer outcomes, DNA damage accumulation (including tandem duplications), and increased tumor immunogenicity. In our system, coablation of Cdk12 ( m-sgPRN;Cdk12KO ) recapitulated hallmark features of HGSC, while accelerating tumor progression and reducing survival. In a conventional (Cre-lox-mediated) Trp53/Nf1/Rb1 triple knockout model with concurrent Cdk12 ablation ( PRN ; Cdk12KO mice), we observed T cell–rich immune infiltrates mirroring those seen clinically. We established both models as subcutaneous or intraperitoneal syngeneic allografts of CDK12 -inactivated HGSC that exhibited sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, a CRISPR/Cas9 synthetic lethality screen in PRN;Cdk12KO -derived cell lines identified CDK13—an essential paralog of CDK12—as the most depleted candidate, confirming a previously reported synthetic lethal interaction. Pharmacologic CDK13/12 degradation (employing YJ1206) demonstrated enhanced efficacy in cell lines derived from both m-sgPRN;Cdk12KO and PRN ; Cdk12KO models. Our results define CDK12 as a key tumor suppressor in tubo-ovarian HGSC and highlight CDK13 targeting as a promising therapeutic approach in CDK12 -inactive disease. Additionally, we have established valuable in vivo resources to facilitate further investigation and drug development in this challenging malignancy.",

To address this, we introduce an active learning framework, VIRAL (Viral Identification via Rapid Active Learning), that integrates protein language model, Gaussian process with uncertainty estimation, and a biophysical model to predict the fitness of novel variants in a few-shot learning setting. By benchmarking on past SARS-CoV-2 data, we demonstrate that our method accelerates the identification of high-fitness variants by up to fivefold compared to random sampling while requiring experimental characterization of fewer than 1% of possible variants. We also demonstrate that our framework effectively identifies sites that are frequently mutated during natural viral evolution with a predictive advantage of up to two years compared to baseline strategies, particularly those enabling antibody escape while preserving ACE2 binding. Through systematic analysis of different acquisition strategies, we show that incorporating uncertainty in variant selection enables broader exploration of the sequence landscape, leading to the identification of evolutionarily distant but potentially dangerous variants. Our results suggest that VIRAL could serve as an effective early warning system for identifying concerning SARS-CoV-2 variants and potentially emerging viruses with pandemic potential before they achieve widespread circulation.",

Although a few effector–target–NLR interactions have been characterized, a general understanding of how these molecular interactions give rise to a functioning immune system is lacking. Here, we present a physics-based model of ETI based on protein–protein interactions. We show that the simplest physical model consistent with the biology gives rise to a robust immune sensor and explains the empirical phenomenon of effector interference as a generic consequence of molecules competing for binding partners. Using the evolutionarily conserved ZAR1 defense gene as a model, we explain how more complex interaction networks integrate multiple pathogen signals into a single response. We then examine alternatives to a guarding architecture, including direct sensing, decoys, and blended “integrated decoy” strategies, and reveal that these sensing architectures obey functional trade-offs between their sensitivity, target protection, and proteomic cost. This allows a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs between different forms of ETI. We discuss these findings in the context of the evolutionary forces shaping the plant immune system.",

Although pigs are believed to have been independently domesticated in South China, the timing and initial mechanisms of this process remain debated. This study presents a microfossil analysis of pig dental calculus from two early Neolithic sites in the Lower Yangtze River region: Jingtoushan (8,300 to 7,800 cal. BP) and Kuahuqiao (8,200 to 7,000 cal. BP). Analyses of starch, phytolith, and parasite remains indicate that pigs consumed human-associated foods and waste, including cooked starchy plants and human whipworm ( Trichuris trichiura ) eggs, likely derived from food preparation and fecally contaminated materials. Identified plant taxa include acorns (Fagaceae), rice ( Oryza sp.), underground storage organs such as yam ( Dioscorea sp.), and wild grasses (Triticeae and Panicoideae), all present in the local botanical assemblages. Coefficients of variation in dental metrics further indicate the coexistence of both domestic and wild populations. Together, these lines of evidence point to multiple modes of human–pig interaction, including early domestic pigs under human management, pigs scavenging near settlements, and free-ranging individuals foraging beyond human influence. Pig domestication in the Lower Yangtze had begun by 8,000 y ago, likely following both commensal and prey pathways, in parallel with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifeways. This study also demonstrates the value of dental calculus analysis for revealing early human–animal relationships before the appearance of clear morphological markers of domestication in the archaeological record.",

          "abstract": "Munc13 family proteins are crucial for the secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones necessary for cell communication. They share a conserved C-terminal region that includes C 2 and the MUN domains, which facilitate membrane interactions and the assembly of soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. Neuronal isoforms of Munc13 possess a variable N-terminal region that is essential for neurotransmitter release and short-term plasticity, although the precise functions of this region remain not fully understood. Here, we identified a negatively charged sequence within the N terminus of Munc13-1, termed polyE, which is specific to Munc13-1 among all Munc13 isoforms and potentially derived from a common ancestor of homeotherms. We found that polyE binds significantly to the MUN domain through charge–charge interactions, inhibiting MUN activity in promoting SNARE complex assembly. Disrupting the polyE–MUN interaction by introducing pseudophosphorylated mutations in the MUN domain alleviates this inhibition, thereby enhancing neurotransmitter release. Strikingly, Ca 2+ ions exhibit significant binding to polyE. We found that 40 μM of Ca 2+ adequately competes with the polyE–MUN interaction to reduce polyE inhibition. This concentration is comparable to presynaptic local [Ca 2+ ] i triggered by a single action potential. Taken together, these results indicate an autoinhibition conformation of Munc13-1 mediated by the polyE–MUN interaction. In addition, the relief of this autoinhibition conformation of Munc13-1 by presynaptic Ca 2+ influx and/or posttranslational modifications in the MUN domain may underlie Munc13-1 function in neurotransmitter release and short-term plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Mass-independent isotope fractionation (MIF) enables powerful geochemical tracers for various geological and planetary problems, yet the mechanisms driving MIF for tin (Sn) remain ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that distinct Sn isotope fractionation signatures were produced during photolysis of organic Sn species (i.e., methyltin) under laboratory UV irradiation and natural sunlight. UV irradiation of methyltin induced pronounced Sn-MIF in all odd Sn isotopes (Δ 115 Sn up to 21.82‰, Δ 117 Sn up to 23.16‰, Δ 119 Sn up to 24.01‰), with their ratios (Δ 117 Sn/Δ 115 Sn = 1.069; Δ 119 Sn/Δ 115 Sn = 1.099; Δ 119 Sn/Δ 117 Sn = 1.028) strongly correlating with nuclear magnetic moments. This unambiguously identifies the magnetic isotope effect (MIE) as the driving mechanism, ruling out other causes such as the nuclear volume effect (NVE). Methyl radicals (•CH 3 ) were detectable during the methyltin photolysis experiments, and the magnitude of MIF for Sn was suppressed by the presence of electron spin trapping agent (DMPO) for radicals, supporting that the pronounced Sn-MIF originated from radical-mediated singlet-triplet state transitions of Sn species. Furthermore, the magnitude of Sn-MIF depended nonmonotonically on external magnetic fields (peak suppression at 100 to 180 G), implying competition between hyperfine coupling and Zeeman interactions. Notably, Sn-MIF was absent during photolysis of methyltin by natural sunlight despite significant mass-dependent Sn isotope fractionation (e.g., &gt;3‰ in δ 122/116 Sn), attributed to atmospheric ozone shielding of short-wavelength UV (&lt;290 nm) required for radical generation. Our results register Sn-MIF as a sensitive tracer of UV-driven photochemistry in low-oxygen environments, underlining the potential of Sn isotopes in studies of early Earth’s atmosphere and planetary environments.",

          "abstract": "Cushing’s syndrome (CS) is an abnormal condition characterized by elevated cortisol levels, often resulting from genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA-C). The most common CS mutation, L205R, lies at the P + 1 loop. Understanding how this mutation alters the internal allosteric network within PKA-C and changes nucleotide and substrate cooperativity is a major goal. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and protein residue networks based on local spatial pattern (LSP) method, we compare crystal structures of wild-type PKA-C and L205R. Our findings indicate that L205R not only locally disrupts the P + 1 hydrophobic pocket, leading to the displacement of the P + 1-residue and altered substrate specificity, but also has long-range effects in the linker connecting the A helix to β strand 1. The MD simulations and LSP analyses also reveal critical changes at the phosphoryl transfer site. Some of these changes are captured in the L205R crystal structure while others are not. With this strategy, we also show how the dynamics of local and distal allosteric networks are differentially influenced by backbone and side-chain dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Emergent patterns in biological systems arise through dissipative processes that balance reaction and transport phenomena, producing highly functional properties from self-regulating mechanisms. Synthetic fabrication, by contrast, often relies on user-controlled, multistep methods that lack the self-organizing capabilities of natural systems. Inspired by nature, we sought chemical systems that integrate strongly coupled reaction and transport phenomena, identifying frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) as a method capable of creating diverse forms and functions through reactive processing. By employing discrete molecular initiators, FROMP allows precise control of key reaction steps—inhibition, initiation, and propagation. Using an integrated computational and experimental framework, we uncover how near-equilibrium inhibition dynamics, coupled with far-from-equilibrium reaction kinetics, drive pattern formation in frontally polymerized synthetic materials. We propose the concept of equilibrium-gated pattern formation, demonstrating how initiator chemistry can be tuned to achieve programmable macroscale properties. Our study reveals a surprising insight: Emergent behavior in FROMP systems arises from the inhibition-dominated regime of resin composition, expanding prior observations that such behavior is confined to a narrow compositional space near the boundary between front quenching and uniform front propagation. We identify a broader compositional window, far from the quenching regime, where emergent behavior reliably manifests. This expanded design space significantly enhances the operational flexibility of reactive systems and their capacity for self-organization. These insights provide a roadmap for designing bioinspired materials with self-organizing capabilities, unlocking possibilities in synthetic manufacturing.",

W. Stahle et al ., Q. Sci. Rev. 34 , 1–15 (2012)]. Here, we present analyses of bald cypress trees from a subfossil deposit at the mouth of the Altamaha River on the Georgia Coast, United States. Shifts in tree lifespans and growth rates correspond temporally to the onset of the Vandal Minimum environmental downturn, c. 500 CE. Trees that sprouted after c. 500 CE had significantly shorter lifespans on average (&lt;200 y) than those that sprouted before this point in time (&gt;470 y). Trees sprouting after c. 500 CE also grew significantly faster than those that sprouted before this point. Bald cypress lifespans at the Altamaha River mouth never recovered to pre-Vandal Minimum levels and, in fact, continued to decrease significantly over time. The last long-lived trees retrieved from the deposit died at the beginning of the Little Ice Age, another major climatic shift. This study suggests the enduring, localized impacts of climatic downturns and indicates the vulnerability to climate change of coastal cypress forests of the Southeast. These conclusions pertain to this location and, perhaps, other near-coastal forests. In remaining pockets of old-growth forest with bald cypress in the Southeast, 800 to 2600-y-old trees are still proven to be alive [D. W. Stahle et al ., Q. Sci. Rev . 34 , 1–15 (2012); D. W.

When control measures are initially effective, they may drive evolutionary adaptation that prevents full eradication, as has been documented for some chemical and biocontrol approaches. Although the intensity, directionality, and persistence of selection required to increase the frequency of resistant genotypes in complex natural ecosystems remains an open question, theory predicts that high mortality can cause life-history evolution even in the absence of a strong selective agent. Here, we use annually collected ecological and genetic data to show that rapid evolution of introduced smallmouth bass has undermined a 20-y manual suppression effort in a mid-sized lake. Despite nearly doubling annual mortality, our intensive control program produced a larger bass population dominated by young and early-maturing fish. These shifts were accompanied by large allele frequency changes in three genomic regions associated with earlier maturation and increased somatic growth. Our findings bear out the theoretical prediction that high mortality can drive evolutionary adaptation in target species. Controlling species invasions are worldwide practices that typically remove a substantial proportion of a population during each of many successive generations, hence life history adaptation may be commonplace. Such evolutionary responses could be salient in explaining the widespread failure of invasion control efforts. Genetic and phenotypic monitoring to detect cryptic adaptation and preemptive design of invader eradication programs to deliberately disrupt directional selection for resistance could improve invasion control outcomes.",

Here, we describe a profound chronic itch phenotype in transgenic mice expressing the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) gene within the Phox2a lineage. Phox2a; tTA mice exhibit intense, localized scratching and regional skin lesions, controllable by the tTA inhibitor, doxycycline. As gabapentin and the kappa opioid receptor agonist, nalfurafine, but not morphine, significantly reduce scratching, this phenotype has a pharmacological profile of neuropathic pruritus. Importantly, the Phox2a; tTA expression occurs in a spatially restricted population of skin keratinocytes that overlaps precisely with the skin area that is scratched. Localized G i -DREADD-mediated inactivation of these Phox2a-keratinocytes completely reverses the skin lesions, while inducible tTA activation of keratinocytes initiates the condition. Notably, ablation of TRPV1-expressing primary afferent neurons also reduces scratching and skin lesions, but this occurs slowly, over a course of two months. In contrast denervation induced loss of all cutaneous input rapidly blocks scratching. These findings identify the cellular, molecular, and topographic basis of a robust and chronic sensory neuron–dependent and gabapentin-responsive neuropathic itch that is initiated by genetic factors within keratinocytes.",

In flowering plants, it is hypothesized that AM is initiated by the perception of AM fungi-derived chito- and lipochito-oligosaccharides (COs/LCOs) in the host via Lysin Motif Receptor-Like Kinases (LysM-RLKs). However, it remains uncertain whether plant perception of these molecules is a prerequisite for AM establishment and for its origin. Here, we made use of the reduced LysM-RLK complement present in the liverwort Marchantia paleacea to assess the conservation of the role played by this class of receptors during AM and in CO/LCO perception. Our reverse genetic approach demonstrates the critical function of a single LysM-RLK, MpaLYKa, in AM formation, thereby supporting an ancestral function for this receptor in symbiosis. Binding studies, cytosolic calcium variation recordings and genome-wide transcriptomics indicate that another LysM-RLK of M. paleacea , MpaLYR, is also required for triggering a response to COs and tested LCOs, despite being dispensable for AM formation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the perception of symbionts by LysM-RLK is an ancestral feature in land plants, and suggest the existence of yet-uncharacterized AM fungi signals.",

          "abstract": "Reduction of China’s SO 2 emissions has been found to nonlinearly decrease the atmospheric sulfate (SO 4 2− ) aerosol concentrations in East Asia. Compared to Europe and North America, the lower effectiveness of SO 4 2− reduction in East Asia suggested much effects of “acidity-sensitive” feedback mechanisms in this high anthropogenic emission region, which have not been yet examined. In this work, we investigated these feedback mechanisms in East Asia through long-term measurements of the mass-independent oxygen-17 anomaly (Δ 17 O) in sulfate aerosols, machine learning and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. As China’s emissions reduced, the atmospheric acidity decreased, enhancing the ozone-driven oxidation of S(IV) and production efficiency of sulfate formation. This explained the weaker declining SO 4 2− concentrations than SO 2 emissions. By the evidence from observed Δ 17 O in non-sea-salt sulfate (Δ 17 O-nss-SO 4 2− ) and CMAQ simulations, the highly enhanced contributions of S(IV)+O 3 to sulfate driven by reduced SO 2 emissions explained the low effectiveness of SO 4 2− reduction in East Asia. Additionally, the decreases of acidity by substantial NH 3 emissions are projected to continue until 2050, limiting SO 4 2− reduction effectiveness. Thus, we highlighted that global control of both SO 2 and NH 3 emissions are needed to efficiently mitigate the sulfate-related climate and pollution, especially in high NH 3 emission region, such as East Asia.",

          "abstract": "Fungal pathogens infect billions and kill millions of people each year. Many of these pathogens have evolved strategies to evade our antifungal immune defenses. Candida albicans, for example, masks the proinflammatory pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) β-1,3-glucan, in response to specific host signals such as lactate. In C. albicans , most β-1,3-glucan lies in the inner cell wall shielded, by the outer mannan layer, from recognition by certain immune cells such as macrophages. β-1,3-glucan that becomes exposed at the cell surface can be shaved off by secreted enzymes. By integrating mathematical modeling with experimentation, we show that the dynamics of this shaving, together with the dynamics of β-1,3-glucan exposure during growth, can account for a range of β-1,3-glucan masking phenotypes. The mathematical model accurately simulates the dynamics of β-1,3-glucan exposure during growth and predicts levels of β-1,3-glucan shaving under a variety of conditions, revealing how subtle differences in growth contribute to observed variabilities in lactate-induced β-1,3-glucan masking. For example, clinical isolates previously thought to display minimal lactate-induced masking are shown to mask robustly. Using a range of C. albicans mutants, we confirm the importance of Gpr1/Gpa2-protein kinase A signaling for lactate-induced β-1,3-glucan shaving and define the contributions of the Xog1 and Eng1 glucanases to this shaving. Furthermore, examination of a shielding-defective C. albicans mnn2 x6 mutant confirms that both β-1,3-glucan shaving and shielding contribute to the dynamism of β-1,3-glucan masking at the fungal cell surface. Dynamism in PAMP masking is likely to be relevant to other fungal pathogens of humans.",

          "abstract": "The limited doubling capacity of human cells, known as replicative senescence or cellular senescence, is a major factor in cellular aging. This process is triggered by telomere erosion, which activates a p53-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) that halts cell proliferation. p53, a transcriptional regulator, responds to DNA damage by increasing the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. p21 then arrests cells at specific stages of the cell cycle. Additionally, p53 upregulates serpinB2 (also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, PAI-2), which stabilizes p21 in senescent cells. This study reveals that serpinB2 upregulation activates transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), which selectively deamidates multiple glutamine residues on p21, stabilizing the protein and halting cell proliferation in senescent cells. Moreover, inhibiting TGM2-mediated deamidation accelerates p21 degradation, delaying the onset of senescence. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of TGM2 improves aging phenotypes in an accelerated aging model of chronic kidney disease (CKD). These findings provide crucial insights into the role of TGM2-mediated enzymatic deamidation in senescence and its potential relevance to age-associated conditions.",

Despite their importance in bacterial physiology, the mechanisms behind their enzymatic and regulatory functions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the structures of Escherichia coli protein acetyltransferase Z (PatZ), a Type I GNAT, and examined its ligand interactions, catalytic mechanism, and allosteric regulation. PatZ functions as a homotetramer, with each subunit comprising a catalytic and a regulatory domain. Our results demonstrate that the regulatory domain is vital for acetyltransferase activity, as it triggers cooperative conformational changes in the catalytic domain and directly aids in the formation of substrate-binding pockets. Additionally, a protein structure-based evolutionary analysis of bacterial GNAT types revealed a distinct regulatory domain pattern across phyla, highlighting its crucial role in responding to cellular energy levels.",

Genetic and proteomic studies revealed that fendiline inhibited the essential lipoprotein trafficking pathway (Lol) in both A. baumannii (LolFD) and Escherichia coli (LolCDE). We demonstrate that OXA-23 is an outer membrane lipoprotein and its overexpression resulted in increased lethality in lolFD- depleted A. baumannii . Our results indicate that overexpression of the OXA-23 β-lactamase in A. baumannii stresses normal lipoprotein trafficking, which makes these cells more susceptible to fendiline.

Given the established role of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in binding lipoproteins, our laboratory sought to determine the role of GAGs in AMD BrM. In this study, BrM GAG content in AMD pathobiology was analyzed in human postmortem tissue. Strikingly, increased levels of highly sulfated heparan sulfate were present in AMD Bruch’s membrane as compared to non-AMD samples. In addition, using scanning electron microscopy of postmortem AMD tissue, we show aggregates of lipoprotein-like particles on the retinal pigmented epithelium side of Bruch’s membrane adjacent to heparan sulfate. We also show that heparin displaces lipoproteins rich in apolipoprotein A1 from human BrM, suggesting their identity as high-density lipoproteins. Using human BrM immobilized to quartz crystal microbalance biosensor (QCM) chips, we show that heparan sulfate is required for lipoprotein binding to BrM and soluble heparan sulfate can remove lipoproteins bound to BrM. Thus, our data establish that heparan sulfate regulates lipoprotein deposition in AMD BrM. These findings provide a foundation for targeted therapies capable of either preventing lipoprotein accumulation or removing drusen in the early and intermediate stages of AMD prior to vision loss.",

          "abstract": "The discovery of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and the unraveling of its molecular mechanisms are currently solving previously puzzling challenges that Mendelian genetics based solely on DNA could not explain, leading to significant paradigm shifts across various fields of biology. There has been a long-standing controversy over the factors determining the caste fate of individuals in social insects. Increasing evidence supports heritable influences on division of labor. Here, we provide evidence that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance influences caste determination in a termite. We demonstrate that the age of the king influences the caste fate of offspring, with young kings’ progeny showing a higher tendency for reproductive differentiation compared to offspring from older kings (under controlled conditions). Then, we conducted a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly for the Japanese subterranean termite Reticulitermes speratus . Genome-wide methylome analysis of kings’ sperm reveals a drastic change in DNA methylation patterns with aging. Among 39,399,411 CpG sites, 21,611 sites showed significant age differences in methylation levels. We identified 13 genes whose methylation levels are significantly different between young and old kings and suggestively correlated with the offspring’s differentiation into the reproductive pathway. Our results suggest that sperm DNA methylation, which changes with the age of kings, is a potential transgenerational epigenetic factor involved in offspring caste differentiation in a termite. These findings may have broad applicability to caste differentiation in social insects and to phenotypic plasticity more generally.",

Interestingly, while 21-nt phasiRNAs in anthers (somatic anther wall cells) do not have obvious preference for a particular nucleotide at the 5′ end and target genes implicated in stress response and cellular homeostasis, 21-nt phasiRNAs in male germ cells preferentially initiate with 5′ C and target genes related to meiotic processes in a ZmAGO5c-dependent manner. Our results indicate that mRNA cleavage is a conserved mechanism used by 21-nt phasiRNAs for gene regulation in grasses. However, the sequences of 21-nt phasiRNAs and their targets show little conservation in maize and rice, suggesting that 21PHAS loci and 21-nt phasiRNA targets have undergone fast divergence in grasses.",

          "abstract": "Subcellular compartmentalization is integral to the spatial regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. However, the biological outputs associated with location-specific mTOR signaling events are poorly understood and challenging to decouple. Here, we engineered synthetic intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) that are capable of modulating mTOR signaling with genetically programmable spatial resolution. Epitope-directed phage display was exploited to generate high affinity synthetic antibody fragments (Fabs) against the FKBP12–Rapamycin binding site of mTOR (mTOR FRB ). We determined high-resolution crystal structures of two unique Fabs that discriminate distinct conformational states of mTOR FRB through recognition of its substrate recruitment interface. By leveraging these conformation-specific binders as intracellular probes, we uncovered the structural basis for an allosteric mechanism governing mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) stability mediated by subtle structural adjustments within mTOR FRB . Furthermore, our results demonstrated that synthetic binders emulate natural substrates by employing divergent yet complementary hydrophobic residues at defined positions, underscoring the broad molecular recognition capability of mTOR FRB . Intracellular signaling studies showed differential time-dependent inhibition of S6 kinase 1 and Akt phosphorylation by genetically encoded intrabodies, thus supporting a mechanism of inhibition analogous to the natural product rapamycin. Finally, we implemented a feasible approach to selectively modulate mTOR signaling in the nucleus through spatially programmed intrabody expression. These findings establish intrabodies as versatile tools for dissecting the conformational regulation of mTORC1 and should be useful to explore how location-specific mTOR signaling influences disease progression.",

          "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the world’s largest projected increase in demand for food. Increased dependence on imports makes SSA vulnerable to geopolitical and economic risks, while further expansion of agricultural land is environmentally harmful. Cereals, in particular, maize, millet, rice, sorghum, and wheat, take nearly 50% of the cropland and 43% of the calories and proteins consumed in the region. Demand is projected to double until 2050. Here, we assess recent developments in cereal self-sufficiency and provide outlooks until 2050 under different intensification, area expansion, and climate change scenarios. We use detailed data for ten countries. Cereal self-sufficiency increased between 2010 and 2020 from 84 to 92% despite the 29% population increase. The production increase was achieved by increased yields per hectare (44%), area expansion (34%), and a shift from millet to the higher yielding maize (22%). Outlooks for 2050 are less pessimistic than earlier assessments because of the larger 2020 baseline area, higher shares of maize and somewhat less steep projected population increase. Yet, to halt further area expansion, a drastic trend change in annual yield increase from the present 20 to 58 kg ha −1 y −1 is needed to achieve cereal self-sufficiency. While such yield increases have been achieved elsewhere and are feasible given the yield potentials in SSA, they require structural changes and substantial agronomic, socioeconomic, and political investments. We estimate that amounts of added nitrogen need to at least triple to achieve such yield improvements, but it is essential that this comes with improved context-specific agronomy.",

Here, we compare human behavioral annotations, functional MRI (fMRI) measurements, and deep neural network (DNN) activations to both indoor and outdoor real-world images to demonstrate that the human visual cortex represents locomotive action affordances in complex visual scenes. Hierarchical clustering of behavioral annotations of six possible locomotive actions show that humans group environments into distinct affordance clusters using at least three separate dimensions. Representational similarity analysis of multivoxel fMRI responses in the scene-selective visual cortex shows that perceived locomotive affordances are represented independently from other scene properties such as objects, surface materials, scene category, or global properties and independent of the task performed in the scanner. Visual feature activations from DNNs trained on object or scene classification as well as a range of other visual understanding tasks correlate comparatively lower with behavioral and neural representations of locomotive affordances than with object representations. Training DNNs directly on affordance labels or using affordance-centered language embeddings increases alignment with human behavior, but none of the tested models fully captures locomotive action affordance perception. These results uncover a type of representation in the human brain that reflects locomotive action affordances.",

Despite the importance of PARP7 in these processes, PARP7 signaling networks remain underresearched. Here, we used genome-wide CRISPR screens and multiplex quantitative proteomics in distinct lung cancer cell lines treated with a PARP7 inhibitor to better understand PARP7 molecular functions. We find that manipulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) transcriptional activity mediates PARP7 inhibitor sensitivity and triggers robust changes to the AHR-controlled proteome (AHR-ome). One of the striking features of such AHR-ome remodeling was the downregulation of filamins A and B concurrent with the induction of the corresponding E3 ubiquitin ligase ASB2. We also show that suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) crosstalks to AHR. Inhibition of PARP7 in SOCS3 knockout cells leads to reduced viability compared to wild-type cells treated with a PARP7 inhibitor. Our results reveal signaling interplay between PARP7, AHR, and SOCS3 and establish an invaluable resource to study the role of PARP7 in the regulation of AHR signaling and innate immunity through its ADP-ribosyl transferase activity.",

Receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is a versatile adaptor protein that regulates multiple signaling pathways. Whether RACK1 is implicated in AM alterations remains elusive. Alveolar type 2 cells-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and autocrine transforming growth factor-β1 drive the transcription of Pparg , the gene encoding AM signature transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). The regulation of PPARγ stability during AM development and maintenance remains unexplored. Here, we report that myeloid RACK1 deficiency results in the scarcity of mature AMs and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. A mixed bone marrow chimera approach reveals a cell-intrinsic role of RACK1 in AM differentiation. Bulk RNA-sequencing indicates a considerable loss of AM identity, impaired PPAR signaling, but a largely unchanged Pparg messenger RNA (mRNA) level in the absence of RACK1. Indeed, myeloid deletion of Rack1 halts AM differentiation in vivo and blocks the ability of PPARγ agonist to induce AM-like cells in vitro. Mechanistically, RACK1 directly binds to and stabilizes PPARγ by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation.

Clinical studies have suggested a correlation between periodontitis and sleep deficiency, but the underlying mechanisms involved remain elusive.

Retrograde tracing from the periodontium revealed a neural connection from trigeminal TRPV1 neurons, which may mediate the aggravating effects of sleep deficiency on periodontitis. The ablation of TRPV1 neurons effectively mitigated the aggravating effects of sleep deficiency on periodontitis. Under periodontitis, sleep restriction increased the secretion of substance P from trigeminal neurons in the periodontium, enhancing vasodilation and vascular permeability, which in turn promoted the infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells. Blocking substance P signaling via a Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist or knocking down Tacr1 in vascular endothelial cells alleviated these detrimental effects. Our findings unveil a critical neuron-vessel-immune axis that exacerbates periodontitis during sleep deficiency and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting this axis for managing periodontitis in individuals suffering from sleep deficiency.",

In many molecules, fluorine is incorporated to enhance the half-life and improve bioavailability. Fluorinated compounds enter the human body through food, water, and xenobiotics including pharmaceuticals, exposing gut microbes to these substances. The human gut microbiota is known for its xenobiotic biotransformation capabilities, but it was not previously known whether gut microbial enzymes could break carbon–fluorine bonds, potentially altering the toxicity of these compounds. Here, through the development of a rapid, miniaturized fluoride detection assay for whole-cell screening, we identified active gut microbial defluorinases. We biochemically characterized enzymes from diverse human gut microbial classes including Clostridia, Bacilli, and Coriobacteriia, with the capacity to hydrolyze (di)fluorinated organic acids and a fluorinated amino acid. Whole-protein alanine scanning, molecular dynamics simulations, and chimeric protein design enabled the identification of a disordered C-terminal protein segment involved in defluorination activity. Domain swapping exclusively of the C-terminus conferred defluorination activity to a nondefluorinating dehalogenase. To advance our understanding of the structural and sequence differences between defluorinating and nondefluorinating dehalogenases, we trained machine learning models which identified protein termini as important features. Models trained on 41-amino acid segments from protein C termini alone predicted defluorination activity with 83% accuracy (compared to 95% accuracy based on full-length protein features). This work is relevant for therapeutic interventions and environmental and human health by uncovering specificity-determining signatures of fluorine biochemistry from the gut microbiome.",

          "abstract": "Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures support long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development. We then examined whether these trajectories were associated with literacy (sub)skills or influenced by familial risk of reading difficulty and children’s home literacy environments, two common literacy-related covariates. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to early elementary school decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as one of the strongest behavioral predictors of decoding and word reading skills, may already begin to develop by birth but undergo further refinement between infancy and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.",

          "abstract": "Tumor-infiltrating nerves play a critical role in cancer progression and treatment resistance. Our recent work identified ALKAL2, a ligand for the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) receptor, as a key mediator of inflammatory pain, with its expression significantly elevated in TRPV1+ sensory neurons during inflammation. Here, we explored the regulation of neuronal ALKAL2 in a colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) model. We found that neuronal ALKAL2 is upregulated at early stages of CAC, which in turn activates ALK signaling in the colonic mucosa. Notably, treating mouse colonic organoids with exogenous ALKAL2 triggered ALK activation. In vivo, mice treated with the ALK inhibitor lorlatinib at the onset of colitis exhibited a remarkable 90% reduction in tumor burden without significantly affecting overall inflammation. Moreover, activating TRPV1+ neurons using DREADD technology exacerbated tumor growth, whereas silencing these neurons significantly reduced it. These findings reveal that TRPV1+ nociceptors drive CAC progression via the ALKAL2/ALK pathway.",

          "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are essential tools for estimating individual susceptibility to complex diseases by aggregating the effects of many genetic variants. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), rare and de novo variants can now be detected at scale, presenting new opportunities to enhance PRS performance. Additionally, regulatory mechanisms that govern gene expression play a critical role in disease manifestation, suggesting further potential for improvement. However, most existing PRS methods are not well-equipped to incorporate nonlinear variant effects, rare variant contributions, or regulatory context. To address these limitations, we developed Epi-PRS, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to impute cell-type-specific epigenomic signals from personal diploid genotypes. These imputed signals act as informative intermediates between genotype and phenotype, allowing for more accurate modeling of variant impact. Our simulation studies demonstrate that Epi-PRS improves predictive accuracy by incorporating nonlinear relationships, rare variant effects, and regulatory information across large genomic regions. When applied to real data from the UK Biobank, Epi-PRS significantly outperforms existing PRS approaches in predicting risk for both breast cancer and type 2 diabetes. These results underscore the advantages of integrating WGS data, epigenomic context, and advanced LLMs framework to enhance both the predictive power and interpretability of PRS. Overall, Epi-PRS represents a promising step toward more precise and biologically informed disease risk prediction, with broad implications for advancing personalized medicine and understanding complex genetic architectures.",

Here, we show that internal nutrient storage connects past thermal experience to current growth in phytoplankton. We develop a mechanistic model showing that delays in the response of nutrient stores to changing temperatures produces phenotypic memory. By testing this model against experimental data of phytoplankton growth rates following temperature perturbations, we find general patterns in the population consequences of phenotypic memory: Prior exposure to warm temperatures depletes nutrient stores, and, in doing so, slows growth during subsequent temperature exposure and restricts the breadth of the thermal niche (i.e., the range of acute temperature exposures yielding a positive growth rate). Our model reveals how phenotypic memory produces temporal variation in critical thermal minima and maxima and predicts that the thermal niche is constricted by long-term exposure to warm temperatures (e.g., during summer months), but that high frequency temperature fluctuations can expand a population’s thermal niche. This work provides a mechanistic framework for considering the ecological implications of phenotypic memory.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between genotype and phenotype remains an outstanding question for organism-level traits because these traits are generally complex . The challenge arises from complex traits being determined by a combination of multiple genes (or loci), which leads to an explosion of possible genotype–phenotype mappings. The primary techniques to resolve these mappings are genome/transcriptome-wide association studies, which are limited by their lack of causal inference and statistical power. Here, we develop an approach that combines transcriptional data endowed with causal information and a generative machine learning model designed to strengthen statistical power. Our implementation of the approach—dubbed transcriptome-wide conditional variational autoencoder (TWAVE)—includes a variational autoencoder trained on human transcriptional data, which is incorporated into an optimization framework. Given a trait phenotype, TWAVE generates expression profiles, which we dimensionally reduce by identifying independently varying generalized pathways (eigengenes). We then conduct constrained optimization to find causal gene sets that are the gene perturbations whose measured transcriptomic responses best explain trait phenotype differences. By considering several complex traits, we show that the approach identifies causal genes that cannot be detected by the primary existing techniques. Moreover, the approach identifies complex diseases caused by distinct sets of genes, meaning that the disease is polygenic and exhibits distinct subtypes driven by different genotype–phenotype mappings. We suggest that the approach will enable the design of tailored experiments to identify multigenic targets to address complex diseases.",

Existing behavioral epidemic models often lack real-world data calibration and cross-model performance evaluation in both retrospective analysis and forecasting. In this study, we systematically compare the performance of three mechanistic behavioral epidemic models across nine geographies and two modeling tasks during the first wave of COVID-19, using various metrics. The first model, a Data-Driven Behavioral Feedback Model, incorporates behavioral changes by leveraging mobility data to capture variations in contact patterns. The second and third models are Analytical Behavioral Feedback Models, which simulate the feedback loop either through the explicit representation of different behavioral compartments within the population or by utilizing an effective nonlinear force of infection. Our results do not identify a single best model overall, as performance varies based on factors such as data availability, data quality, and the choice of performance metrics. While the Data-Driven Behavioral Feedback Model incorporates substantial real-time behavioral information, the Analytical Compartmental Behavioral Feedback Model often demonstrates superior or equivalent performance in both retrospective fitting and out-of-sample forecasts.

          "abstract": "The FeMo cofactor (FeMoco), the key active site in the Mo-based nitrogenase, is one of the most complicated metalloenzyme molecules. Synthesis of the FeMoco model cluster ([MoFe 7 S 9 C]) is essential to understanding its function in dinitrogen binding, activation, and conversion. However, the complex framework of the FeMoco cluster, which features a unique trigonal prismatic [Fe 6 C] moiety comprising a µ 6 -bridging carbide, has made the synthesis of the cluster a persistent challenge. In this work, two analogous mimics of FeMoco have been synthesized, using a cluster-coupling synthetic strategy facilitated by the fabrication of unsaturated ligand/metal coordination. The incorporation of a µ 6 -X (X = C 4− or N 3− ) to construct the characteristic triangular prismatic [Fe 6 ( µ 6 -X)] moiety, replicating that in FeMoco, has been achieved synthetically. The two mimics have similar key structural parameters to FeMoco in natural nitrogenase, but differ from the FeMoco structure in two major aspects: the µ 2 -bridging ligands and the metal atoms capping the [Fe 6 S 9 C] cores (Mo/Fe in FeMoco vs. Mo/Mo or W/W in the synthetic models). Quantum chemical studies indicate that the electronic ground states of these clusters resemble those observed for FeMoco, with maximized antiferromagnetic coupling among the iron centers. A future systematic study on the physical and chemical properties of a family of mimics with programmed variations of key structural elements can provide a valuable comparison and facilitate a better understanding of the structure and function of FeMoco.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the number of newly discovered systems that bacteria use to combat bacteriophages is increasing at an impressive rate. To obtain mechanistic insights into several antiphage systems identified in previous studies, we isolated 66 phage escape mutants which had become insensitive to 13 distinct, plasmid-encoded lactococcal phage resistance systems (i.e. Rhea, Kamadhenu, Rugutis, Audmula, PARIS, type II CBASS, Septu, AbiA, AbiB, AbiD/F, AbiG, AbiJ, AbiP). Genome analysis of these phage escape mutants identified a total of 15 mutated genes. Six of the encoded proteins appear to activate specific antiphage systems. Furthermore, AbiA escape mutants were found to be insensitive to AbiJ, while distinct antiphage systems (AbiG and AbiP) were observed to be activated by a major phage tail protein, indicating mechanistic commonalities. PARIS homologues encoded by members of different bacterial genera appear to share similar sensing mechanisms, whereas our data indicate mechanistic differences between Septu homologues from different genera. Based on our escape mutant sequence analysis, previously predicted domains, and experimental data using the purified endolysin of phage c2, we propose that Audmula modifies the cell wall of the host bacterium, delaying cell lysis and release of progeny phages, protecting the host cell by a heretofore unknown mode of action. The obtained advances in our understanding of lactococcal antiphage mechanisms provide fundamental insights into phage–host interactions, which undoubtedly benefits the dairy industry but may also be useful for biotechnological or biomedical applications.",

          "abstract": "Many eukaryotic species undergo programmed elimination of specific chromosomes during embryogenesis, typically retaining these chromosomes only in their germ cells. In some species, programmatic elimination of GRCs, or sex chromosomes, also occurs in a sex-specific manner, with specific chromosomes being transmitted or eliminated by only one sex. As such, these chromosomes provide a unique perspective on the evolution of gene functions that are advantageous to the germline and genetic tradeoffs between somatic vs germline or oocyte vs sperm biology. While GRCs have been extensively characterized in male sea lampreys ( Petromyzon marinus ), the status of GRCs in females has not yet been resolved, though it has been hypothesized that male-specific expression/transmission of these chromosomes might provide a solution to resolving the long-standing mystery of lamprey sex determining mechanisms. To gain insight into the roles of GRCs in female lampreys, we performed several karyological, transcriptomic, and genomic analyses, which demonstrate that GRCs are present in the female lamprey germline, transmitted by oocytes and somatically eliminated in both sexes. These analyses also show that GRCs play important roles in the maintenance and development of female germline but provide no evidence for sex-specific variation in the elimination and transmission of lamprey GRCs. These findings underscore the diversity of germline functions that are carried out by GRCs in both male and female lampreys and highlight the fact that sex-specific transmission/retention of GRCs likely follows no universal rules across the diverse lineages that have independently evolved to undergo developmentally programmed DNA elimination.",

Yet, we do not know whether the consistent phenotypic changes that are associated with polyploidization translate into predictable changes in ecological preferences. Niche modeling studies in mixed-ploidy species provide an opportunity to compare recently originated polyploids with their lower-ploidy ancestors. However, the available isolated studies provide contrasting results and the diverse methodologies used limit generalization. Based on 25,857 georeferenced ploidy-verified occurrence data for 129 mixed-ploidy flowering plant species, we tested in a unified statistical framework whether WGD is associated with consistent changes in climatic niche and in past, current, and predicted future range size. We found that 74% of species exhibited significant niche shifts associated with ploidy transition. However, there was no consistent environmental parameter underlying ploidy differentiation across species, nor was there consistent support for polyploid range or niche expansion in a subset of 75 densely sampled species with sufficient data for modeling. Our results demonstrate that polyploidization is an important factor affecting niche evolution of a species, but the environmental parameters underlying the ploidy-related niche shifts vary from species to species, demonstrating limited predictability of the outcomes of WGD in ecological space.",

We find that the network contracts at a rate set by motor speed but is accompanied by a diffusive-like spread throughout the bulk of the contracting network with effective diffusion constant two orders of magnitude lower than that for freely diffusing microtubules. We further find that on micron scales, the diffusive timescale is only a factor of ≈3 slower than that of advection regardless of conditions, showing that the global contraction and long-time relaxation from this diffusive behavior are both motor-driven but exhibit local competition within the network bulk.",

We provide evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15) enhances viral virulence by suppressing the production of viral double-stranded (dsRNA), a potent inducer of antiviral signaling. The viral variants lacking nsp15 endoribonuclease activity elicited higher innate immune responses and exhibited reduced replication in human stem cell–derived lung alveolar type II epithelial cells, as well as in the lungs of infected hamsters. Consistently, these variants caused significantly less weight loss and mortality compared to wild-type (WT) virus in K18-hACE2 mice. Mechanistically, the cells infected with nsp15 mutants accumulated more viral dsRNA, causing enhanced stimulation of the interferon pathway. Chemical inhibition of interferon signaling dampened immune responses to nsp15 mutants and restored their replication to levels similar to the WT virus. These findings indicate that the endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 contributes to viral virulence by limiting the accumulation of viral dsRNA, thereby allowing robust replication with reduced activation of the host innate immune response.",

SlPLT6 knockout caused precocious ripening initiation and enhanced fruit qualities without penalizing yield in two tomato cultivars. SlPLT6 represses genes involved in ripening initiation and major quality traits by directly binding to their promoters. Moreover, SlPLT6 connects two repressive mechanisms by recruiting Histone Deacetylase 1 via its C-terminal EAR motif and LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1b through the first AP2 domain.

Activation of RIPK1 upon engagement of TNFR1 by TNFα may promote necroptosis by interacting with RIPK3 or apoptosis by activating caspases. RIPK1 is extensively regulated by a variety of dynamic posttranslational modifications which control its kinase activity and formation of downstream complexes to mediate necroptosis and apoptosis. Here, we investigate the functional significance and mechanism by which PARP12, a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, interacts with RIPK1 and RIPK3 in cells stimulated by IFNγ and TNFα. We show that PARP12 catalyzes the mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) of RIPK1 in both the intermediate domain and the kinase domain, as well as the MARylation of RIPK3. PARP12 deficiency reduces necroptosis by inhibiting the activation of RIPK1 kinase and its interaction with RIPK3, as well as sensitizes to apoptosis by promoting the binding of RIPK1 with caspase-8. Thus, upon induction by IFNs, PARP12 may function as a cellular checkpoint that controls RIPK1 to promote necroptosis and inhibit apoptosis. Importantly, while PARP12 is a known interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), PARP12 deficiency promotes the expression of a subset of ISGs and confers protection against influenza A virus-induced mortality in mice. Our study demonstrates that PARP12 is an important modulator of cellular antiviral response.",

          "abstract": "The breaking of translational symmetry at oxide surfaces gives rise to coordinatively unsaturated cations/anions and surface restructuring—key factors that govern surface reactivity. Using direct in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations along with atomistic modeling, we report oscillatory redox behavior in CuO under H 2 , where cyclic surface reconstruction and reactivity modulation occur via the Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. We observe self-switching between oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient surface reconstructions, alternately activating and deactivating the surface for H 2 O formation. During periods of chemical inactivity, the oxygen-deficient surface undergoes slow reoxidation via lattice oxygen diffusing from subsurface and bulk reservoirs, restoring the active oxygen-rich surface termination. The inherent disparity in chemical activity among undercoordinated surface ions, along with sluggish subsurface-to-surface oxygen replenishment, drives this oscillatory redox cycle, modulating H 2 -induced loss of lattice oxygen at the surface and its delayed replenishment from the subsurface. This creates spatiotemporally separated redox steps at the oxide surface. The phenomena and atomistic insights presented here have significant implications for manipulating the surface reactivity of oxides by tuning the separation of these redox steps.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer has now overtaken lung cancer as the “world’s leading cancer,” yet detecting and implementing effective therapies remains a significant challenge. Substantial advances have been made in photothermal therapy (PTT), where photosensitizers use photonic energy to induce localized hyperthermia for cancer eradication. This pioneering approach is gaining traction in clinical settings. However, traditional PTT faces inherent limitations, including the risk of damage to neighboring healthy tissues and potential inflammatory responses due to overheating. Drawing inspiration from the distinct characteristics of aggregation-induced emission the small molecule, PM331, was chosen for study. This donor–acceptor–donor system displays good photothermal conversion efficiencies (40% and 66%) upon excitation at 808 nm and 1,064 nm, respectively. It is also characterized by attractive optical features in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window. Using nanoparticles containing PM331, PM331@F127 , we have developed a PTT strategy, termed dual-laser PTT (DLPTT), that involves successive excitation using 808 nm and 1,064 nm lasers guided by both NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. The DLPTT strategy involves two steps. First, it initiates DNA damage and downregulates heat shock protein expression as the result of an initial brief irradiation with an 808 nm laser. This is then followed by irradiation with a 1,064 nm laser to ablate tumor cells while minimizing inflammation and harm to surrounding healthy tissues. Based on the findings reported here, we suggest that DLPTT could represent an attractive approach to precision medicine and one that could make PTT more amenable to clinical implementation.",

The facultative symbiont Hamiltonella in bacteriocyte induces female-biased sex ratio of whiteflies. Here, we demonstrate that a maternal gene tudor ( tud ) and its encoded protein have lower expression levels in ovaries of Hamiltonella- cured whiteflies. Tud family proteins can interlink the various stages of biosynthesis of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA), a class of small noncoding RNAs. We find that Hamiltonella affects the abundance of a piRNA through the maternal gene tud , thereby regulating the expression of the vacuolar ( H+ ) -ATPase H subunit ( VATPH ), which is the switch of activity of the vacuolar (H+)-ATPase that plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of intracellular energy and supporting mitochondrial respiration. This regulation adjusts the ATP level in ovaries of whiteflies. The ATP level shapes the F-actin pattern in ovaries and eggs of whiteflies, ultimately manipulating whitefly fertilization. Silencing tud inhibited whitefly fertilization by impairing ATP levels and F-actin patterns in ovaries and eggs. This study reveals that symbiont and maternal protein associations can regulate host fertilization by piRNA biosynthesis.",

Yet, in ultrathin strained films with distinctive anisotropic electronic structures, there are no reports, likely due to disorder and defects suppressing metallicity thus hindering its detection. Here, we demonstrate that ultrathin, fully strained 2 nm TiO 2 / t nm RuO 2 /TiO 2 (110) heterostructures, grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, retain metallicity and exhibit a sizeable AHE at a significantly lower magnetic field (&lt; 9 T). Density functional theory calculations reveal that epitaxial strain stabilizes a noncompensated magnetic ground state and reconfigures magnetic ordering in RuO 2 (110) thin films. These findings establish ultrathin RuO 2 as a platform for strain-engineered magnetism and underscore the transformative potential of epitaxial design in advancing spintronic technologies.",

Stem cells located in the antlerogenic periosteum (AP), a tissue overlaying the frontal crest of both male and female deer, play a crucial role in antlerogenesis. Nonetheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms as to how antlerogenesis is regulated by androgens remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that androgens regulate antler growth via macrophages. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a significant enrichment of immune-related factors in the androgen-activated antlerogenic periosteum (AAP), and single-cell RNA sequencing identified a cluster of AAP cells overexpressing macrophage chemokine CCL2. Additionally, the presence of a substantial number of monocytes/macrophages was detected in the skin overlying the AAP. Histological examination confirmed macrophage accumulation in the AAP. Removal of macrophages with clodronate effectively inhibited antler generation in male sika deer as well as in nude mice engrafted with the AP. Furthermore, testosterone up-regulated CCL2 expression in the AP cells (APCs), thus enhancing their chemotactic effect on recruitment of macrophages. Remarkably, female sika deer developed antlers following local injection of CCL2, autologous macrophages, or even immune response inducer lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Therefore, macrophages play an essential role in deer antler generation.",

Here, we demonstrate a synergistic hydrogen embrittlement (SHE) phenomenon in high-strength martensitic steels, where hydrogen interacts with carbon in solution to activate hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP). Microcantilever bending tests revealed greater hydrogen susceptibility with higher carbon content, evidenced by a significant reduction in work-hardening capacity, promoting slip localization and reduced ductility. First-principles calculations and theoretical modeling revealed that carbon intensifies hydrogen–dislocation interactions and amplifies hydrogen redistribution around screw dislocations, inhibiting cross-slip. This work integrates experimental and modeling approaches to elucidate the synergistic interactions between hydrogen and solute elements, providing critical insights for designing high-strength, hydrogen-tolerant structural materials.",

In this study, we report a two-step carbonyl-to-sulfur (CO-to-S) atom swap approach, enabled by a rationally designed N ′-alkyl-hydrazonamide (NAHA) reagent that promotes forming pre-aromatic intermediates twice sequentially by different mechanisms, thereby achieving homolytic cleavage of both α-C−C bonds of the ketone substrates. A Ts-S-Ts (Ts, p -toluenesulfonyl) reagent mediates this process through successive intermolecular and intramolecular alkyl radical trapping by the central sulfur. This method shows a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity, providing a streamlined route to sulfur-containing scaffolds from readily available ketones.",

Mutations in specific cysteine residues of IAA3 disrupt redox-mediated multimerization and interaction with co-repressor TPL, thereby attenuating IAA3 mediated target gene repression.

By contrast, zircon water contents of the adjoining coeval TTGs in the Trans-North China Orogen, formed in a supra-subduction zone setting, are notably higher. These results support a two-stage mantle plume-sagduction process for TTG formation.

Here, we demonstrate a strategy for FDW engineering by tailoring the interfacial electrostatic profile.

The boundaries where the electric field switches polarity drive the formation of 180° FDWs in BiFeO 3 thin films. This mechanism is validated through theoretical calculations and direct experimental observations. Furthermore, atomic-scale analysis reveals localized lattice distortions, structural chirality of the FDWs, as well as the edge effect of SrRuO 3 islands on the position precision of FDW nucleation.

Beginning our investigation in brown adipose tissue (BAT), we identified a mechanism to explain enhanced glucose utilization in cold-adapted BAT. This was characterized by select remodeling of upper glycolysis and pentose cycling to increase oxygen consumption, likely by increasing uncoupling protein 1 activity through the production of reactive oxygen species. Cold-induced remodeling of the plasma proteome appeared to underpin the ability of BAT to modify its fuel preference, stimulating lipolysis in white adipose tissue and glucose production in the liver.

Here, we present a suite of 230 Th ages for fossil corals in the Seychelles within a detailed sedimentary and stratigraphic context to evaluate the evolution of sea level during this past warm period. The rise to peak sea level at ~122 to 123 ka was punctuated by two abrupt stratigraphic discontinuities, defining three distinct generations of reef growth. We attribute the evidence of episodic reef growth and ephemeral sea-level fall to the competing influence of Northern Hemisphere ice melt and Antarctic ice regrowth. Asynchronous ice sheet contributions would mask the full extent of retreat for individual ice sheets during the LIG and imply greater temperature sensitivity of ice sheets than previously inferred.",

Traditional design strategies, based on hydrophobicity and structural propensity, can be biased and could indeed prevent discovery of interesting, diverse, and unconventional peptides with desired nanostructure assembly. Using β sheet formation in pentapeptides as a case study, we used an integrated high-throughput experimental workflow and an artificial intelligence–driven active learning framework to improve prediction accuracy of self-assembly. By focusing on sequences where machine learning (ML) predictions deviate from conventional design strategies, we synthesized and tested 268 pentapeptides, successfully finding 96 forming β sheet assemblies, including unconventional sequences (e.g., ILFSM, LMISI, MITIY, MISIW, and WKIYI) not predicted by traditional methods. Our ML models outperformed conventional β sheet propensity tables, revealing useful chemical design rules. A web interface is provided to facilitate community access to these models. This work highlights the value of ML-driven approaches in overcoming the limitations of current peptide design strategies.",

The TCR libraries were panned against NY-ESO-1, which enabled us to collect thousands of epitope-specific TCR sequences. Leveraging these data, we trained a machine learning TCR-epitope interaction predictor and identified several epitope-specific TCRs from TCR repertoires. Cellular assays revealed that the predicted TCRs displayed activity toward NY-ESO-1 and no detectable cross-reactivity.

Nevertheless, the fundamental, molecular-level mechanisms governing ion selectivity are still not fully understood. This study explores ion selectivity in polyamide desalination membranes, focusing on the partitioning and diffusion mechanisms of co-ions and counterions. Our experimental and molecular simulation results reveal that electrostatic interactions play a key role in impeding co-ion partitioning while enhancing their diffusion. The results further suggest that ion selectivity is predominantly controlled by the partitioning step, particularly the selective partitioning of co-ions. This finding highlights the importance of focusing on ion partitioning at the water-membrane interface to improve membrane ion-ion selectivity. In addition, our results point out to a trade-off between partitioning and diffusion, requiring careful tuning of these processes. Overall, this study provides the scientific foundation for molecular design of membranes with high ion-ion selectivity.",

The study reveals that the autophagy-regulating gene PLAC8 (placenta-specific 8) is significantly involved in Cd-induced prostate carcinogenesis, and NF-κB acts as the upstream transcriptional activator of PLAC8, which then selectively up-regulates BCL-xL, providing a survival advantage to Cd-transformed cells. NF-κB activation stabilizes PLAC8 in the cytosol, disrupting autophagy by allowing PLAC8 to colocalize with LC3B instead of LAMP1. Silencing NF-κB down-regulates PLAC8 and its survival function while inhibiting NF-κB or PLAC8, which restores autophagy and decreases tumor growth in xenograft models. In addition, targeting BCL-xL confirmed this signaling pathway. The findings suggest that sustained NF-κB activation regulates PLAC8 and highlights the NF-κB–PLAC8–BCL-xL axis as a potential target for early detection and therapies in metal-induced prostate cancer.",

          "abstract": "In contrast to global warming, the subpolar North Atlantic has experienced long-term cooling throughout the 20th century. This cooling, known as the North Atlantic cold blob, has been hypothesized to arise from reduced poleward oceanic heat transport associated with a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Here, by diagnosing historical simulations from multiple coupled climate models, we find that ocean heat transport is not the only pathway through which the AMOC modulates sea surface temperature variability. A weakened AMOC is also associated with colder, drier lower atmospheric conditions, which lead to a reduction in surface warming expected from increasing amounts of heat-trapping gases by reducing downward clear-sky longwave radiation at the surface. This radiative pathway and the oceanic processes contribute equally to the North Atlantic cold blob. These results highlight the importance of the AMOC’s impact on atmospheric properties and their radiative effects.",

Z12 showed enhanced molecular interactions, promoting to more compact and ordered stacking, which in turn promotes the DSE formation, benefiting the synergistic enhancement of V OC and J SC . The D18:Z12-based device achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.5%, notably outperforming the other two devices.

They are at least twice as energetic (0.5 × 10 53 to 2.5 × 10 53 erg) as any other known transient, ruling out supernova origins. Instead, the high peak luminosities, long flare timescales, and immense radiated energies of the ENTs are most consistent with the tidal disruption of high-mass ( ≳ 3 M ⊙ ) stars by massive ( ≳ 10 8   M ⊙ ) supermassive black holes (SMBHs). ENTs will be visible to high redshifts ( z ~ 4 to 6) in upcoming surveys, providing an avenue to study the high-mass end of the SMBH mass distribution, complementing recent studies of actively accreting SMBHs at high redshifts with the James Webb Space Telescope.",

These interferometers, built from ultracold Bose-Einstein condensed rubidium atoms, use an original design that operates entirely within the Bloch bands of an optical lattice. Through time-dependent lattice position control, we realize Bloch oscillations in two dimensions and a vector atomic Michelson interferometer. Fits to the observed Bloch oscillations demonstrate the measurement of an applied acceleration of 2 g along two axes, where g is Earth’s gravitational acceleration. For the Michelson interferometer, we perform Bayesian inferencing from a 49-channel output by repeating experiments for two-axis accelerations and demonstrate vector parameter estimation. Accelerations can be measured from single experimental runs and do not require repeated shots to construct a fringe. The performance of our device is near the quantum limit for the interferometer size and quantum detection efficiency of the atoms.",

In total, we measure the nucleation rates of &gt;140,000 variants of Aβ42 to accurately quantify the changes in free energy of activation of the reaction for all possible amino acid substitutions in a protein and, in addition, to quantify &gt;600 energetic interactions between mutations. Strong energetic couplings suggest that the Aβ42 nucleation reaction transition state is structured in a short C-terminal region, providing a structural model for the reaction that may initiate Alzheimer’s disease.

We extend the tuning of language models with reinforcement learning to the chemistry domain, training a transformer model for chemical reaction prediction. Our approach is evaluated using both a rigorously controlled dataset and a realistic high-throughput dataset comprising extensive reaction screenings across diverse catalysts sets and experimental conditions. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging information from as few as 20 positive data points in the controlled dataset, supported by a negative dataset at least 40 times larger.

While stimulation of vagal efferent neurons is known to reduce maladaptive host responses during endotoxemia, only selective vagal afferent neuron stimulation inhibited TLR7-induced macrophage activation and neutrophil recruitment to the lung. These anti-inflammatory actions are dependent on adrenal gland–derived epinephrine, as adrenalectomy or inhibition of epinephrine production eliminated the protection afforded by VNS. Selective afferent VNS induced activation in the nucleus tractus solitarius and the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Inhibition of neuronal activity in this brain region that controls peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity rendered VNS ineffective. Activation of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) is critical for innate immune cell suppression, as the anti-inflammatory effects of VNS were eliminated in β 2 AR knockout mice and with pharmacological inhibition of the β 2 AR.

However, the conformational cycle and inhibitor mechanism of ABCB transporters remain elusive. We reconstituted ABCB19 into lipid nanodiscs, where activity was drastically higher than in detergents, and determined its cryo–electron microscopy structures in substrate-free, substrate-bound, vanadate-trapped, and inhibitor-bound states. Inward-facing ABCB19 moved inward upon substrate binding and fully closed with vanadate trapping, unexpectedly temperature dependent. Two inhibitor molecules locked ABCB19 in the inward-facing conformation. Mutagenesis identified key residues for substrate and inhibitor binding, revealing differential contributions to transporter function and inhibition.

In this work, we investigate the mechanism of air fluorescence from excited neutral N 2 molecules by carrier-envelope phase–stabilized sub–4 femtosecond pulses. Our results show that fluorescence from N 2 + ions reaches a maximum with cosine-like pulses, while fluorescence from excited neutral N 2 molecules peaks with sine-like pulses. In addition, by scanning the chirp of the driving pulse, we find that ionic fluorescence is maximized with chirp-free pulses, whereas neutral fluorescence favors negatively chirped pulses.

Although the transcription factors (TFs) that regulate ROS production and scavenging genes have been studied, the regulation of these TFs to control ROS accumulation remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that during N nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat–mediated immunity, Alfin-like 7 (AL7) is ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 7 (UBR7). UBR7 interacts with AL7 and acts as a molecular brake to mediate the ubiquitination of AL7 at lysine-20, leading to its subsequent proteasomal degradation. UBR7 functions upstream of AL7 to reduce AL7-induced ROS accumulation during N -mediated defense. The phosphorylation of AL7 at serine-174 enhances its interaction with UBR7, thereby increasing AL7 ubiquitination and reducing AL7 stability. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which ROS accumulation is regulated through the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of a TF during the immune response. This ensures precise switching of ROS signaling to prevent excessive defense responses.",

By analyzing the phase-dependent PADs, the partial waves, including their individual amplitudes and phases, involved in the nondissociative and dissociative single ionization of H 2 are unambiguously resolved. In addition, the interaction phases accumulated during the absorption of multiple photons of different polarizations are revealed.

While splenic FRCs are thought to support antiviral T cell responses, their role remains unclear. Here, we found that ablation of splenic FRCs impaired virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Immunofluorescence imaging revealed that FRCs promote CD8 + T cell clustering with type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) in the T cell zone before migration to the infected marginal zone. Without FRCs, T cells instead clustered with cDC1 and virus-infected cells in the marginal zone, leading to suboptimal priming. Mechanistically, FRCs coordinated early viral replication and the inflammatory milieu for optimal DC activation, and an intact FRC network was crucial for generating effector T cells and maintaining protective memory T cells. Thus, splenic FRCs provide essential lymphoid niches for antiviral T cell responses.",

          "abstract": "More than 90% of the world’s hydrogen (H 2 ) is produced from fossil fuel sources, which requires energy-intensive separation and purification to produce high-purity H 2 fuel and to capture the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) by-product. While membranes can decarbonize H 2 /CO 2 separation, their moderate H 2 /CO 2 selectivity requires secondary H 2 purification by pressure swing adsorption. Here, we report hyperselective carbon molecular sieve hollow fiber membranes showing H 2 /CO 2 selectivity exceeding 7000 under mixture permeation at 150°C, which is almost 30 times higher than the most selective nonmetallic membrane reported in the literature. The membrane is able to maintain an ultrahigh H 2 /CO 2 selectivity over 1400 under mixture permeation at 400°C. Pore structure characterization suggests that highly refined ultramicropores are responsible for effectively discriminating the closely sized H 2 and CO 2 molecules in the hyperselective carbon molecular sieve membrane. Modeling shows that the unprecedented H 2 /CO 2 selectivity will potentially allow one-step enrichment of fuel-grade H 2 from shifted syngas for decarbonized H 2 production.",

The Fe-Ni phase diagram provides crucial insights for understanding previous experimental observations and crystallization simulations of the Fe-Ni alloy under core conditions. It also presents complex scenarios for inner core structures, suggesting body-centered cubic (bcc)–liquid coexistence at the inner core boundary and the possibility of multilayer structures consisting of bcc–hexagonal close-packed (hcp) composites within the inner core.

Chordin-mediated “shuttling” of BMP ligands is responsible for the BMP signaling gradient formation in many bilaterians and, possibly, also in the sea anemone Nematostella , making BMP shuttling a candidate ancestral mechanism for generating bilaterality. However, Nematostella Chordin might be a local inhibitor of BMP rather than a shuttle. To choose between these options, we tested whether extracellular mobility of Chordin, a hallmark of shuttling but dispensable for local inhibition, is required for patterning in Nematostella . By generating localized Chordin sources in the Chordin morphant background, we showed that mobile Chordin is necessary and sufficient to establish a peak of BMP signaling opposite to Chordin source. These results provide evidence for BMP shuttling in a bilaterally symmetric cnidarian and suggest that BMP shuttling may have been functional in the potentially bilaterally symmetric cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor.",

However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field has not been attempted. Here, we present a platform for field-dependent CPR measurements in planar JJs made of NbSe 2 and few-layer Bi 2 Se 3 . When a flux quantum Φ 0 threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip CPR structure and nonreciprocal supercurrent flow. We show that these arise from a nonuniform supercurrent distribution that also leads to a robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. Furthermore, despite numerous previous studies, we find no evidence of MBS. Our results establish magnetic field–dependent CPR as a powerful probe of TI-based superconducting devices and offer design strategies for nonreciprocal superconducting electronics.",

During learning, neural selectivity in place- and, to a lesser extent, face-selective regions was greater for subsequently remembered than forgotten events; positively scaled with variability in dorsal attention network activity, within and across individuals; and negatively related to AD pathology, evidenced by elevated plasma phosphorylated Tau 181 (pTau 181 ). Path analysis revealed that neural selectivity mediated the effects of age, attention, and pTau 181 on memory.

Here, we present an empirical fitness seascape in E. coli harboring all combinations of four drug resistance mutations. Incorporating these data into PK-PD simulations of antibiotic treatment, we find that higher mutation supply increases the probability of resistance, and early adherence to the drug regimen is critical. In vitro studies further support the finding that the second dose in a drug regimen is important for preventing resistance.

Subsequently, during the transition from deep to shallow quiescence, Ascl1 induces the expression of Mycn , which drives progression through shallow quiescent states toward a proliferating state.

Here, we investigated the influence of AOM coupled with nitrate and nitrite reduction on soil N 2 O emissions and the associated microbial interactions. We show that AOM coupled with denitrification markedly reduces soil N 2 O emissions, with the type I methanotroph Methylobacter species collaborating with the Methylophilaceae and Gemmatimonadaceae families to perform key roles. The suppression of N 2 O emissions by AOM primarily stems from its role in supplying electrons and carbon sources, fueling complete denitrification by associated bacteria. In addition, we uncovered distinct microbial interaction strategies for AOM-coupled nitrate and nitrite reduction. While nitrite reduction necessitates both bacterial cooperation and extracellular electron transfer during its initial stages, nitrate reduction predominantly depends on methanotrophic bacteria alone at the outset. These findings advance our understanding of carbon-nitrogen cycle coupling and underscore AOM’s potential to simultaneously mitigate both CH 4 and N 2 O emissions.",

It has been hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal (EcM) in contrast to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can reduce tree species diversity in local communities, which remains to be tested at the global scale. To address this gap, we analyzed global forest inventory data and revealed that the relationship between tree species richness and EcM tree proportion varied along environmental gradients. Specifically, the relationship is more negative at low latitudes and in moist conditions but is unimodal at high latitudes and in arid conditions. The negative association of EcM tree proportion on species diversity at low latitudes and in humid conditions is likely due to more negative plant-soil microbial interactions in these regions.

Using a silver tip under visible laser illumination with a constant 1-nm amplitude oscillation, we obtain a material-contrast image of silicon islands on a silver surface with 1-nm lateral resolution, which surpasses the conventional limits of s-SNOM.

Through mass spectrometry analysis and an unbiased small interfering RNA screen, we identify that TFEB protein stability is coordinately regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit DCAF7 and the PAK2 kinase. We derive a series of novel small molecules that interfere with the DCAF7-TFEB interaction. These agents inhibit virus-induced TFEB degradation and demonstrate broad antiviral activities including attenuating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in two animal models.

          "abstract": "Ice-jam floods are a unique yet understudied hydrological hazard, occurring in cold-region rivers when upstream thawing and downstream freezing create ice blockages. Despite their severe impacts, their atmospheric drivers and future trends remain unclear. Using a 160-year documentary record, historical reanalysis datasets, and statistical modeling, we examine the climatic and hydrological controls of ice-jam floods in the lower Yellow River, one of the world’s most flood-prone rivers. Our findings show that ice-jam floods are strongly influenced by large-scale atmospheric teleconnections, including the Arctic Oscillation, Siberian High, and Ural Blocking, which regulate regional thermal contrasts and cold-air intrusions. Over the past century, ice-jam flood frequency has declined, with hot spots shifting toward the river estuary due to weakening upstream-to-downstream temperature gradients under climate warming. Projections using bias-corrected CMIP6 multimodel ensemble indicate a continued decline in ice-jam flood occurrences by 2100. Our study bridges historical and future perspectives, emphasizing the need for adaptive flood management as climate change shifts hydrological risks worldwide.",

These nano-engineered structures enable compact, multidimensional manipulation of light’s amplitude, phase, polarization, and wavefront, producing scalar and vector beams with unique properties such as orbital angular momentum and knotted topologies. This flexibility has potential applications in optical communication and imaging, particularly in complex environments such as atmospheric turbulence and undersea scattering. However, designing metasurfaces for shorter wavelengths, such as visible and ultraviolet light, remains challenging due to fabrication limitations and material absorption.

However, interpreting and sorting the highly variable targeting sequences in secreted and membrane proteins present a substantial challenge for achieving precise localization within the secretory pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that atypical signal sequences, characterized by high hydrophobicity and/or the absence of characteristic charges, are recognized by the signal recognition particle and targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum in a reverse orientation. These misoriented signal sequences are subsequently dislocated by the P5A-ATPase ATP13A1 and delivered to SEC61 for further translocation. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structures of human ATP13A1 in multiple conformations (3.40- to 3.87-angstrom resolution), revealing key residues within its substrate-binding pocket that engage signal sequences through polar interactions.

Here, we evaluated whether low-dose radiation delivered by radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT), known to potentiate immune checkpoint inhibitors, can synergize with CRISPR-edited GD2 TRAC- CAR T cells to improve outcomes in neuroblastoma. We found that in the localized model of neuroblastoma, low-dose radiation delivered by 177 Lu-NM600, an alkylphosphocholine mimetic RPT agent, followed 9 days later by GD2 TRAC- CAR T cells led to complete tumor regression. Irradiation of neuroblastoma before GD2 TRAC- CAR T cells enhanced the release by CAR T cells of perforin, granzyme B, tumor necrosis factor–α, and interleukin-7 while abrogating transforming growth factor–β1. Low-dose RPT up-regulated the death receptor Fas on neuroblastoma, potentially enabling CAR-independent killing. This suggests that low-dose RPT can enhance suboptimal CAR T cell efficacy against solid tumors. However, optimization of radiation dose and timing may be needed for each patient and RPT agent to account for varied tumor radiosensitivity and dosimetry.",

Forces act on the channels by causing their curved blades to flatten and decompact, leading to an activated state, but it is unclear how this is regulated to enable the channels to adapt to different contexts. To identify potential mechanisms, we performed coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on human PIEZO1. We observed an interblade handshake interaction mediated by basic amino acid residues in two flexible helices coordinated with regulated anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The interaction determined the resting configuration of the channel, blade curvature, compactness, and ion pore structure. In experiments, disruption of the handshake by neutralization of helix amino acids or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate depletion increased the channel’s sensitivity to membrane tension. Structural and amino acid sequence analysis for multiple PIEZOs predicted helix amino acid arrangements for varied handshaking intensity. We suggest a dynamic interaction in PIEZO channels that regulates force sensitivity.",

However, plasmon-exciton coupling in semiconductor-metal nanostructures exhibits nanosecond relaxation times, and multi-plasmon metallic heterostructures are not broadly tunable. Here, we develop a biplasmonic heterostructure in which CuS and Au nanoparticle layers, separated by an alumina spacer of variable thickness, exhibit enhanced second- and third-harmonic generation due to dipole-dipole coupling between Au and CuS plasmons, as seen in the characteristic inverse sixth-power dependence of their separation in the measured harmonic enhancement and confirmed by numerical simulations of near-field CuS-Au nanoparticle coupling. Transient-absorption spectroscopy shows faster relaxation in Au/CuS (690 femtoseconds) compared to CuS heterostructures (929 femtoseconds). Moreover, nonlinear absorption measurements provide evidence for harmonic-induced plasmonic resonant energy transfer between the narrow Au and broad, tunable CuS plasmon resonances. This prototype for ultrafast upconversion showcases a strategy for high-efficiency, tunable plasmonic nonlinear devices with promising applications in photocatalysis, parametric down-conversion, and biomedical imaging.",

This uncoating step that is vital for IAV infection remains to be fully understood. The aggresome processing machinery (APM) plays a relevant but not essential role in this. Here, we reveal a mechanism in which light chain 3 proteins (LC3s) and pericentrin (PCNT) form an adaptor complex that is required for vRNPs binding to the dynein 1 and IAV uncoating at endosomes. This function of LC3s and PCNT is independent from their established role in autophagy and centrosome assembly, respectively. LC3s or PCNT depletion severely impairs IAV cytoplasm entry and infection, which can be further inhibited by additional silencing of histone deacetylase 6, an APM component. Collectively, our results show that IAV has adopted two redundant strategies to hijack the dynein biomolecular motors and facilitate VP uncoating.",

However, its role and mechanisms against macroparasites remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila hosts use behavioral fever to defend against Leptopilina parasitoid wasps. This thermal preference increases wasp mortality and enhances host survival. We find that behavioral fever is mediated by up-regulation of Heat shock protein 70 ( Hsp70 ) genes in infected hosts as Hsp70 loss abolishes behavioral fever, whereas its overexpression induces heat-seeking behavior. We further find that behavioral fever up-regulates immune genes in infected hosts, including 12 antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) genes, which disrupt the gut microbiota homeostasis of parasitoid wasps and, in turn, lead to substantial wasp mortality. Our findings elucidate the detailed mechanisms of behavioral fever in Drosophila hosts, advancing our understanding of ectothermic animal defenses against macroparasites.",

          "abstract": "The proper assembly of light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) is critical for photosynthesis and requires the biogenesis of light-harvesting chlorophyll a , b -binding proteins (LHCPs) to be coordinated with chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis. The mechanism underlying this coordination is not well understood. Here, we show that a conserved molecular chaperone, chloroplast signal recognition particle 43-kDa protein (cpSRP43), provides a molecular thermostat that helps maintain this coordination. cpSRP43 undergoes a conformational rearrangement between a well-folded closed state and a partially disordered open state. Closed cpSRP43 is dedicated to the biogenesis of LHCPs, whereas open cpSRP43 protects multiple Chl biosynthesis enzymes from heat-induced destabilization. Rising temperature shifts cpSRP43 to the open state, enabling it to protect heat-destabilized Chl biosynthesis enzymes. Our results reveal the molecular basis of a posttranslational mechanism for the thermoadaptation of LHC biogenesis. They also demonstrate how an adenosine triphosphate–independent chaperone uses conformational dynamics to switch its activity and client selectivity, thereby adapting to different proteostatic demands under shifting environmental conditions.",

Here, we reported a straightforward strategy to achieving visible-to-infrared photoabsorption covering 630 to 2000 nanometers in inorganic perovskites by incorporating supramolecular crown ethers. Crown ethers enable supramolecular host-guest complexation and the formation of self-organizing Turing structures composed of original perovskites and supramolecular hybrid crystals. The visible-to-infrared photoabsorption is attributed to the interphase electron transitions in the Turing-structured perovskite hybrid matter system. Such visible-to-infrared photoabsorption is successfully translated into a photoelectronic response in an interdigitated photodetector.

To investigate diversity in auditory representation within and between the sexes, we used molecular and functional analyses to explore Aedes aegypti mosquito auditory processing. We identified shared and dimorphic neurons connecting mosquito ears to the brains’ primary auditory processing center. Calcium imaging from this brain region facilitated definition of multiple neuronal clusters based on auditory stimulation responses. More clusters with greater complexity were identified in males than females, with these clusters highly differentiated among males. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses found enrichment of ciliary-related factors in male ears compared to females, potentially underlying sexual dimorphisms in hearing systems.",

Our reconstructions indicate remarkable stability of water table depth in a Pacific Northwest aquifer throughout the LGT despite increasing precipitation, closely matching independent Earth system model (ESM) simulations. In the American Southwest, ESM simulations and noble gas isotopes both suggest a pronounced LGT decline in water table depth in in response to decreasing precipitation, indicating distinct regional groundwater responses to climate.

Quantum transport measurements on these chiral nanowires reveal enhanced electron pairing persisting to high magnetic fields (up to 18 tesla) and oscillatory transmission resonances as functions of both magnetic field and chemical potential. We interpret these resonances as arising from an engineered axial spin-orbit interaction within the chiral region.

To create “hybrid” CAR T reg cells with T r 1 cell-like properties, we examined whether the PDCD1 locus could be exploited to endow T reg cells with CAR-regulated IL-10 expression. CRISPR-mediated PD1 deletion increased CAR T reg cell activation, and knock-in of IL10 under control of the PD1 promoter resulted in CAR-induced IL-10 secretion. IL10 knock-in improved CAR T reg cell function, as determined by increased suppression of dendritic cells and alloantigen- and islet autoantigen–specific T cells. In vivo, IL10 knock-in CAR T reg cells were stable, safe, and suppressed dendritic cells and xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease.

Targeting the inactive conformation of LRRK2 is functionally distinct from targeting the active-like conformation using type I inhibitors. We designed these inhibitors with a combinatorial chemistry approach fusing selective LRRK2 type I and promiscuous type II inhibitors using iterative cycles of synthesis supported by structural biology and activity testing. Our lead compounds are selective and potent toward both LRRK2 and LRRK1, a close relative of LRRK2.

          "abstract": "Engineered cardiac patches (ECPs) introduced functional factors that offer a promising strategy for the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). Silicate bioceramics have received widespread attention because of their great potential in the tissue repair field. Inspired by the biological functions of inorganic ions on the cardiovascular system, we prepared an ECP containing lithium magnesium silicon bioceramics (LMS) particles. The release of multiple bioactive ions from LMS-containing ECPs could facilitate the functionalization and intercellular communication between cardiomyocytes (CMs). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the LMS-containing ECPs could promote epicardial cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the Notch pathway and paracrine, which efficiently repaired damaged CMs. In vivo, the regenerative microenvironment induced by LMS-containing ECPs restored normal electrical impulse propagation across scar tissue, activated islands of surviving myocardium, and improved cardiac function. Overall, this study constructed a bioceramics-enhanced ECP, which could promote cardiac repair by activating epicardial EMT, providing a promising strategy for MI repair.",

This dynamic nature of lactation makes it challenging to study under controlled conditions. Given the health benefits of human milk, models of secretory mammary tissue would offer opportunities to study factors that influence this important food source. First, 3D models of the mammary duct/alveoli (D/A) were designed inspired by shapes found in vivo. Photoresins based on mammary decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) were optimized to match the mechanical properties of native breast tissue. Next, these D/A models were printed with a volumetric printer and seeded with human milk-derived mammary epithelial cells (MECs). MECs formed stable epithelial layers on the printed surfaces and secreted the β-casein and milk fat globules. This model offers exciting avenues to explore hormonal, nutritional, and mechanobiological factors involved in lactation, thereby improving understanding of lactation for the benefit of infants and their mothers.",

HDAC7 suppresses the expression of genes mediating branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism. Notably, lower expression of BCAA catabolism genes is strongly associated with worsened survival in ccRCC. Suppression of BCAA catabolism promotes expression of SNAIL1, a central mediator of aggressive phenotypes including migration and invasion. HDAC7-mediated suppression of the BCAA catabolic program promotes SNAI1 messenger RNA transcription via NOTCH signaling activation.

Mice lacking CLEC5A were resistant to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)–induced polymicrobial sepsis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced endotoxemia, as observed by decreased mortality. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed transcriptomic heterogeneity of vascular endothelial cells in CLEC5A-deficient lungs following CLP. Endothelial-specific knockdown of CLEC5A improved survival of CLP-challenged mice, which was completely ineffective with reexpression of endothelial CLEC5A. The survival benefits were attributed to alleviated inflammatory storm and vascular leakage. Furthermore, endothelial CLEC5A deficiency protected mice against Escherichia coli –induced pneumonia. In vitro, CLEC5A deletion maintained trans-endothelial electrical resistance, and inhibited adhesion and trans-endothelial migration of monocytes/neutrophils under LPS stimulation.

Despite their importance in the Earth system, the controls on canyon occurrence remain poorly understood. We report results from a spatial statistical model that explains global canyon distribution. By analyzing &gt;2000 canyons, we show that canyon occurrence correlates with the inclination of continental slopes. Onshore orogeny and associated surface processes, long considered key controls on canyon formation, play a subordinate role. Instead, our results suggest slope inclination as the primary control on submarine canyon density. Because continental slope morphology is fundamentally shaped by marine tectonic and thermal processes, these large-scale forces indirectly govern canyon formation and distribution globally. As a result, they influence the presence of pathways that facilitate the transfer of sediments, carbon, and nutrients to the deep ocean, with implications for biogeochemical cycles over geological timescales.",

Here, we demonstrate that by transiently exciting electrons in a transparent material, the laser drilling speed is increased by a factor of 1 million compared to that in multishot percussion drilling. By irradiating with a single shot of a spatially shaped ultrashort laser pulse, the optical properties are momentarily changed on the picosecond scale, making the material considerably easier to machine by a successive laser pulse. The selective absorption of laser energy in regions with excited electrons leads to the rapid heating and evaporation of material at an extraordinarily high speed. Furthermore, the machining is achieved using a low-power light source, four orders of magnitude lower than conventional femtosecond lasers. The concept of transiently altering material properties is expected to usher in a paradigm shift in research and development for manufacturing.",

We integrated a genetically guided TRAP2 strategy with single-cell Ca 2+ image and found that activity dynamics of serotonin receptor 2c (Htr2c)–expressing neurons in the prelimbic cortical layer 5 encode high social states. We uncovered a long noncoding RNA Lrhcn1 that controls Hcn1 transcription and regulates ensemble activity of Htr2c neurons, and this regulation motivates social investigation.

Generalized to other phytoplankton such as the diatom Thalassiosira , we estimate the production of 39 metabolites that constitute hot spots of dissolved organic carbon described by their amount of carbon produced and their diversity of associated metabolites in ESMs. This modeling approach shows how genome scale–enabled ESMs have the potential to advance our understanding of microbial ecosystem functioning in ocean biogeochemical processes.",

Here, in a manipulative experiment using 118 soils from 15 agricultural sites across the United States, we show that MAOC formation is promoted by both existing MAOC and its counterpart—MAOC saturation deficit. The positive effect of existing MAOC on the formation of new MAOC persists after accounting for soil physicochemical properties that covary with MAOC. In contrast with current theory, we found that MAOC formation was not clearly influenced by microbial carbon-use efficiency (CUE). Our findings demonstrate that existing MAOC and saturation deficit, not microbial CUE, are key to determining new MAOC formation in agricultural soils.",

Caspase-1–dependent tumor pyroptosis releases several inflammatory chemokines, converting αSMA + CAF into iCAFs in a CCR6-dependent manner. This is clinically relevant, as a fibroblast gene signature driven by iCAF markers and collagen type III is enriched in patients with chemoresistant bladder cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Contrary to the current notion, iCAFs, rather than myCAFs, produce collagen III in response to chemotherapy, supporting the expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Thus, tumor cell pyroptosis initiates an iCAF-CSC feedforward loop that drives chemoresistance, indicating that inflammatory cell death is not universally beneficial to anticancer therapy, depending on the target cell type.",

We perform numerical simulations to test under what conditions may lateral compression initiate subduction in Europa’s ice shell. We demonstrate that subduction-like recycling can occur only for shells of thickness ≲ 10 kilometers, transporting the surface ice into the subsurface ocean. We further show that compression large enough to initiate subduction-like behavior in a thin shell is achieved during brief periods of enhanced eccentricity, implying increased hydrothermal activity at the seafloor. Together with the subduction-like transport of surface oxidants, such conjunction should favor chemical disequilibria in the ocean, increasing its astrobiological potential.",

The innermost layers consist of ~60 densely packed lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs), whose function remains largely unknown. Using high-resolution three-dimensional electron microscopy, we found that LSCs do not form concentric rings, but complex, multilayered, and intertwining assemblies that are connected via a high density of desmosomes and gap junctions. LSCs make multiple converging contacts with the afferent axon via desmosomes. Using optogenetic manipulations of LSCs, we demonstrate not only that their activation drives reliable time-locked spiking in the axon but also that their inactivation significantly elevates the thresholds in situ and increases perceptual thresholds behaviorally. Together, these findings provide evidence that LSCs are a key element of somatosensory processing, actively potentiating mechanosensitivity in Pacinian corpuscles.",

We find that global rivers transported ~390 megagrams annually of mercury to the oceans in the preindustrial era, with spatial variability. Human activities have elevated riverine mercury budgets by two to three times in the present day. Establishing a baseline riverine mercury level, our findings reveal rapid responses of riverine mercury to human perturbations and could be used to inform targets for global riverine mercury restoration. Total riverine mercury concentrations could also be used as indicators to comprehensively understand the effectiveness of mercury pollution governance.",

          "abstract": "An electrically controlled, programmable drug delivery system offers substantial potential in personalized biomedical devices. Current methods lack precise control over drug amounts and sequences, which is crucial for optimizing therapy. We present a solution with drug molecules modified onto gallium-based liquid metal nanoparticles (LMNPs) and using the electrochemical corrosion of LMNPs to controllably release the drugs, which allows arbitrary choice of drug types, release speed (fastest at less than 1 second), and sequence of release for customized therapy. This system applies to many types of drugs (molecules containing amine, thiol, hydroxyl, and carboxyl groups) and is integrated onto a stretchable thin film and can be implemented as epidermal or implantable devices. We tested the platform with antibiotics for wound infections and an antitumor drug for subcutaneous melanoma, confirming its excellent therapeutic efficacy and biocompatibility in both in vivo and in vitro tests.",

          "abstract": "Carbon cycling between surface and mantle reservoirs is pivotal in fostering habitability of Earth. A critical yet poorly constrained parameter is whether crustal carbon can “survive” devolatilization processes that accompany slab subduction and therefore influence deep carbon budgets. Carbonatites provide a key record to address this important topic. Here, we present high-precision potassium isotope data for a large set of carbonatite samples from both continental and oceanic settings, spanning from 2 billion years ago to the present. Modeling suggests that the heavy potassium isotopic compositions of carbonatites are inherited from their mantle sources, rather than resulting from magmatic and postmagmatic processes. Our results demonstrate a strong link between the subduction of oceanic crust and the recycling of carbonates into the mantle sources of carbonatites. These findings support the hypothesis that subduction of carbonate-bearing altered oceanic crust has been a critical mechanism for transferring carbon into the deep Earth through time.",

Here, we construct a comprehensive spatiomolecular lipid atlas of the human kidney from 29 donor tissues using integrated multimodal molecular imaging. Our approach leverages high-spatial-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry for untargeted lipid mapping, stained microscopy for histopathological assessment, and tissue segmentation using autofluorescence microscopy. With a combination of unsupervised, supervised, and interpretable machine learning, the atlas provides multivariate lipid profiles of specific multicellular functional tissue units (FTUs) of the nephron, including the glomerulus, proximal tubules, thick ascending limb, distal tubules, and collecting ducts. In total, the atlas consists of tens of thousands of FTUs and millions of mass spectrometry measurements. Detailed patient, clinical, and histopathologic information allowed molecular data to be mined on the basis of these features. As examples, we highlight the discovery of how lipid profiles are altered with sex and differences in body mass index.",

          "abstract": "Oceanic mesoscale eddies play a crucial but underexplored role in regulating carbon fluxes and climate change. While they redistribute heat, salt, nutrients, and other tracers, their effects on CO 2 uptake remain uncertain. Using observation-based machine learning to estimate CO 2 fluxes throughout the lifetimes of thousands of eddies, we show that anticyclonic eddies substantially enhance CO 2 uptake on average, while cyclonic eddies marginally diminish it. This asymmetry yields an overall net increase in CO 2 absorption by 9.98 ± 2.28 and 13.82 ± 9.94% in the Kuroshio Extension and Gulf Stream, respectively, major carbon sequestration regions. The primary driver of this enhanced uptake is the downward pumping of dissolved inorganic carbon within anticyclonic eddies. Asymmetric biological responses between anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies contribute to the overall eddy-induced CO 2 flux imbalance. The finding suggests a potential underestimation of the ocean’s capacity for carbon sequestration because of insufficient incorporation of eddies in current observations, emphasizing the need for expanded monitoring in eddy-rich, undersampled regions.",
