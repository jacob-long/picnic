          "abstract": "Establishing a unified theory of cognition has been an important goal in psychology 1,2 . A first step towards such a theory is to create a computational model that can predict human behaviour in a wide range of settings. Here we introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behaviour in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art language model on a large-scale dataset called Psych-101. Psych-101 has an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from more than 60,000 participants performing in excess of 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behaviour of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but it also generalizes to previously unseen cover stories, structural task modifications and entirely new domains. Furthermore, the model’s internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after fine-tuning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discover computational models that capture human behaviour across a wide range of domains. We believe that such models provide tremendous potential for guiding the development of cognitive theories, and we present a case study to demonstrate this.",

          "abstract": "AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain1. Assembled from combinations of four core subunits, GluA1-4, and ~20 auxiliary subunits, their molecular diversity tunes information transfer and storage in a brain circuit-specific manner. GluA3, a subtype strongly associated with disease2, functions as both a fast transmitting Ca2+-permeable (CP) AMPAR at sensory synapses3, and as a Ca2+-impermeable (CI) receptor at cortical synapses4,5. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the CP GluA3 homomer, which substantially diverge from other AMPARs. The GluA3 extracellular domain tiers (NTD and LBD) are closely coupled throughout gating states, creating previously unseen interfaces that impact signalling and harbour human disease mutations. Central to this architecture is a stacking interaction between two arginine residues (Arg163) in the NTD dimer interface, trapping a unique NTD dimer conformation that enables close contacts with the LBD. Rupture of the Arg163 stack not only alters the structure and dynamics of the GluA3 extracellular region, but also increases receptor trafficking, and the expression of GluA3 heteromers at the synapse. We further show that a mammalian-specific GluA3 trafficking checkpoint determines conformational stability of the LBD tier. Hence, specific design features define communication and biogenesis of GluA3, offering a framework to interrogate this disease-prone glutamate receptor.",

          "abstract": "From fertilization onwards, the cells of the human body acquire variations in their DNA sequence, known as somatic mutations. These postzygotic mutations arise from intrinsic errors in DNA replication and repair, as well as from exposure to mutagens. Somatic mutations have been implicated in some diseases, but a fundamental understanding of the frequency, type and patterns of mutations across healthy human tissues has been limited. This is primarily due to the small proportion of cells harbouring specific somatic variants within an individual, making them more challenging to detect than inherited variants. Here we describe the Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues Network, which aims to create a reference catalogue of somatic mutations and their clonal patterns across 19 different tissue sites from 150 non-diseased donors and develop new technologies and computational tools to detect somatic mutations and assess their phenotypic consequences, including clonal expansions. This strategy enables a comprehensive examination of the mutational landscape across the human body, and provides a comparison baseline for somatic mutation in diseases. This will lead to a deep understanding of somatic mutations and clonal expansions across the lifespan, as well as their roles in health, in ageing and, by comparison, in diseases.",

          "abstract": "The efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in solid tumours is limited by immunosuppression and antigen heterogeneity1,2,3. To overcome these barriers, ‘armoured’ CAR T cells, which secrete proinflammatory cytokines, have been developed4. However, their clinical application has been limited because of toxicity related to peripheral expression of the armouring transgene5. Here, we have developed a CRISPR knock-in strategy that leverages the regulatory mechanisms of endogenous genes to drive transgene expression in a tumour-localized manner. By screening endogenous genes with tumour-restricted expression, we have identified the NR4A2 and RGS16 promoters as promising candidates to support the delivery of cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-2 directly to the tumour site, leading to enhanced antitumour efficacy and long-term survival of mice in both syngeneic and xenogeneic models. This effect was concomitant with improved CAR T cell polyfunctionality, activation of endogenous antitumour immunity and a favourable safety profile, and was applicable in CAR T cells from patients.",

However, such atlases are unavailable 5 . Here we present a whole mouse brain dataset of Nissl-based cytoarchitecture with isotropic 1-μm resolution, achieved through continuous micro-optical sectioning tomography. By integrating multi-modal images, we constructed a three-dimensional reference atlas of the mouse brain, providing the three-dimensional topographies of 916 structures and enabling arbitrary-angle slice image generation at 1-μm resolution. We developed an informatics-based platform for visualizing and sharing of the atlas images, offering services such as brain slice registration, neuronal circuit mapping and intelligent stereotaxic surgery planning. This atlas is interoperable with widely used stereotaxic atlases, supporting cross-atlas navigation of corresponding coronal planes in two dimensions and spatial mapping across atlas spaces in three dimensions. By facilitating the data analysis and visualization for large brain mapping projects, our atlas promises to be a versatile brainsmatics tool for studying the whole brain at single-cell level.",

          "abstract": "Natural chiral polymers, such as DNA, proteins, cellulose and poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] ((R)-P3HB), are prevalent in their enantiopure forms1,2. Existing methods to synthesize enantiopure polymers focus on enantiospecific polymerization, in which only one specific enantiomer is obtained from the corresponding chiral monomer3,4,5,6. Here we introduce a catalytic stereodivergent synthetic strategy to access all enantiopure di-isotactic poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) diastereomers from bacterial (R)-P3HB as the single chiral source. A series of enantiopure (R,R)-α-alkylated-β-butyrolactones are obtained from (R)-P3HB and then subjected to the catalyst-controlled diastereodivergent ring-opening polymerization (ROP) to enantiopure di-isotactic α-alkylated PHAs. Metal-catalysed coordination–insertion ROP results in threo-(R,R)-di-isotactic PHAs with chiral retention, whereas anionic ROP catalysed by an organic superbase produces erythro-(R,S)-di-isotactic PHAs with chiral inversion, achieving precision di-isotactic PHAs with exclusive regio- and stereoregularity. This strategy has also enabled the stereodivergent synthesis of all four [(R,R), (S,S), (R,S) and (S,R)] stereoisomers of α,α-dialkylated PHAs from (R)-P3HB, which can be depolymerized to chiral α,α-dialkylated-β-butyrolactones with high stereoselectivity. Overall, this catalyst-controlled regio- and stereoselective, stereodivergent synthetic methodology provides access to 16 enantiopure stereoisomers of α(α)-(di)substituted PHAs and enables the stereochemistry-defined structure–property relationship study of the di-isotactic PHAs, providing insights into the effects of main-chain stereoconfigurations and alkyl side chains on their thermal properties, melt processability, mechanical performance and supramolecular stereocomplexation.",

          "abstract": "Classical mechanics characterizes the kinetic energy of a particle, the energy it holds due to its motion, as consistently positive. By contrast, quantum mechanics describes the motion of particles using wave functions, in which regions of negative local kinetic energy can emerge 1 . This phenomenon occurs when the amplitude of the wave function experiences notable decay, typically associated with quantum tunnelling. Here, we investigate the quantum mechanical motion of particles in a system of two coupled waveguides, in which the population transfer between the waveguides acts as a clock, allowing particle speeds along the waveguide axis to be determined. By applying this scheme to exponentially decaying quantum states at a reflective potential step, we determine an energy–speed relationship for particles with negative local kinetic energy. We find that the smaller the energy of the particles—in other words, the more negative the local kinetic energy—the higher the measured speed inside the potential step. Our findings contribute to the ongoing tunnelling time debate 2–6 and can be viewed as a test of Bohmian trajectories in quantum mechanics 7–9 . Regarding the latter, we find that the measured energy–speed relationship does not align with the particle dynamics postulated by the guiding equation in Bohmian mechanics.",

Mimics vary greatly in accuracy, and explaining the persistence of inaccurate mimics is an ongoing challenge for evolutionary biologists 3,4 . Empirical testing of existing hypotheses is constrained by the difficulty of assessing the fitness of phenotypes absent among extant species, leaving large parts of the adaptive landscape unexplored 5 —a problem affecting the study of the evolution of most complex traits. Here, to address this, we created mimetic phenotypes that occupy hypothetical areas of trait space by morphing between 3D images of real insects (flies and wasps), and tested the responses of real predators to high-resolution, full-colour 3D-printed reproductions of these phenotypes. We found that birds have an excellent ability to learn to discriminate among insects on the basis of subtle differences in appearance, but this ability is weaker for pattern and shape than for colour and size traits. We found that mimics gained no special protection from intermediate resemblance to multiple model phenotypes. However, discrimination ability was lower in some invertebrate predators (especially crab spiders and mantises), highlighting that the predator community is key to explaining the apparent inaccuracy of many mimics.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how animals and humans learn from experience to make adaptive decisions is a fundamental goal of neuroscience and psychology. Normative modelling frameworks such as Bayesian inference 1 and reinforcement learning 2 provide valuable insights into the principles governing adaptive behaviour. However, the simplicity of these frameworks often limits their ability to capture realistic biological behaviour, leading to cycles of handcrafted adjustments that are prone to researcher subjectivity. Here we present a novel modelling approach that leverages recurrent neural networks to discover the cognitive algorithms governing biological decision-making. We show that neural networks with just one to four units often outperform classical cognitive models and match larger neural networks in predicting the choices of individual animals and humans, across six well-studied reward-learning tasks. Critically, we can interpret the trained networks using dynamical systems concepts, enabling a unified comparison of cognitive models and revealing detailed mechanisms underlying choice behaviour. Our approach also estimates the dimensionality of behaviour 3 and offers insights into algorithms learned by meta-reinforcement learning artificial intelligence agents. Overall, we present a systematic approach for discovering interpretable cognitive strategies in decision-making, offering insights into neural mechanisms and a foundation for studying healthy and dysfunctional cognition.",

Here we report the boron-mediated assembly of tetrasubstituted alkenes with complete control of the double-bond geometry. The migrating group and electrophile add syn across the alkyne. Mild oxidation leads to intermediate borinic esters 6 , which can be isolated and purified or reacted directly in a range of transformations, including cross-couplings and homologation reactions. In particular, subjecting the intermediate borinic esters to Zweifel 7,8 olefination conditions can give either retention or inversion of the double-bond geometry, depending on whether base is present or not. Different positional and stereoisomers of the tetrasubstituted alkenes can be easily accessed, highlighting the breadth and versatility of the method. This was showcased through its successful application to the rapid synthesis of drug molecules and natural products with high yield and stereocontrol. Not only does this method provide efficient access to the long-standing challenge of the stereocontrolled synthesis of tetrasubstituted alkenes but it also introduces new concepts related to the intervention of non-classical borenium ions in the Zweifel olefination.",

          "abstract": "Climate assessments of civil aviation1,2 have consistently quantified the dominant climate-forcing components: (1) CO2 emissions, (2) NOx (NO + NO2) emissions and (3) persistent contrails. All three components exert a positive radiative forcing (RF) and lead to climate warming of similar magnitudes. The aviation community is actively seeking to reduce its climate footprint through advanced engine technologies, more sustainable aviation fuel and optimal routing plans3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. These approaches usually involve a trade-off of CO2 against NOx or contrails (non-CO2), such as burning 1% more fuel to decrease contrail RF by 4%. Here, we show that a climate-trade-off risk curve derived from uncertainties in the RF components2,13,14,15,16 can give the probability that a specified trade-off ratio will produce a climate benefit. For each component, we calculate the integrated effective RF resulting from 1 year of flights: global warming per activity (GWA). The complementary cumulative probability distribution of the GWA(non-CO2) to GWA(CO2) ratio results in a climate-trade-off risk curve giving the likelihood of a positive climate outcome as a function of the trade-off-CO2 to trade-off-non-CO2 ratio, because the product, GWA × trade-off, should be the same for both. We find a likely (67%) chance of climate mitigation on a 100-year time horizon for the above suggested ratio of 1:4, favouring proposed non-CO2 mitigation efforts3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 with ratios smaller than this.",

          "abstract": "Barrier tissues isolate organisms from their surrounding environment. Maintaining the integrity of the tissues is essential for this function. In many seed plants, periderm forms as the outer barrier during secondary growth to prevent water loss and pathogen infection 1 . The periderm is regenerated when its integrity is lost following injury; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown, despite its importance for plant survival. Here we report that periderm integrity in Arabidopsis roots is sensed by diffusion of the gases ethylene and oxygen. Following injury of the periderm, ethylene leaks out through the wound and oxygen enters, resulting in attenuation of ethylene signalling and hypoxia signalling. This condition promotes periderm regeneration in the root. When regeneration is complete and barrier integrity is re-established, pre-injury levels of ethylene and hypoxia signalling are regained. Gas diffusion monitoring is also used to re-establish the barrier in inflorescence stems after the epidermis is injured. We thus propose that gas diffusion is used by plants as a general principle to monitor and re-establish barrier integrity.",

          "abstract": "Acute inflammation is an essential response that our bodies use to combat infections1. However, in the absence of infections, chronic inflammation can have a pivotal role in the onset and progression of chronic diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, autoimmune disorders, metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and most ageing-associated pathologies2,3. The underlying mechanisms that distinguish chronic inflammation from its acute counterpart remain unclear, posing challenges to the development of targeted therapies for these major diseases. Here we identify a mechanism that separates the two responses: during chronic but not acute inflammation, chromatin remodelling is influenced by nuclear autophagy, in which the WSTF protein of the ISWI chromatin-remodelling complex interacts with the ATG8 autophagy protein family in the nucleus. This interaction leads to WSTF nuclear export and subsequent degradation by autophagosomes and lysosomes in the cytoplasm. Loss of WSTF leads to chromatin opening over inflammatory genes, amplifying inflammation. Cell-penetrating peptides that block the WSTF–ATG8 interaction do not affect acute inflammation but suppress chronic inflammation in senescence as well as in MASH and osteoarthritis in mouse models and patient samples. The ability to specifically target chronic inflammation without blunting acute inflammation offers an approach for treating common chronic inflammatory diseases.",

          "abstract": "Ancient Egyptian society flourished for millennia, reaching its peak during the Dynastic Period (approximately 3150–30 bce ). However, owing to poor DNA preservation, questions about regional interconnectivity over time have not been addressed because whole-genome sequencing has not yet been possible. Here we sequenced a 2× coverage whole genome from an adult male Egyptian excavated at Nuwayrat (Nuerat, نويرات). Radiocarbon dated to 2855–2570 cal. bce , he lived a few centuries after Egyptian unification, bridging the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. The body was interred in a ceramic pot within a rock-cut tomb 1 , potentially contributing to the DNA preservation. Most of his genome is best represented by North African Neolithic ancestry, among available sources at present. Yet approximately 20% of his genetic ancestry can be traced to genomes representing the eastern Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia and surrounding regions. This genetic affinity is similar to the ancestry appearing in Anatolia and the Levant during the Neolithic and Bronze Age 2–5 . Although more genomes are needed to fully understand the genomic diversity of early Egyptians, our results indicate that contacts between Egypt and the eastern Fertile Crescent were not limited to objects and imagery (such as domesticated animals and plants, as well as writing systems) 6–9 but also encompassed human migration.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) accounts for around 25% of all lung cancers1,2 and has been associated with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke and air pollution in observational studies3,4,5. Here we use data from the Sherlock-Lung study to evaluate mutagenic exposures in LCINS by examining the cancer genomes of 871 treatment-naive individuals with lung cancer who had never smoked, from 28 geographical locations. KRAS mutations were 3.8 times more common in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from North America and Europe than in those from East Asia, whereas a higher prevalence of EGFR and TP53 mutations was observed in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from East Asia. Signature SBS40a, with unknown cause6, contributed the largest proportion of single base substitutions in adenocarcinomas, and was enriched in cases with EGFR mutations. Signature SBS22a, which is associated with exposure to aristolochic acid7,8, was observed almost exclusively in patients from Taiwan. Exposure to secondhand smoke was not associated with individual driver mutations or mutational signatures. By contrast, patients from regions with high levels of air pollution were more likely to have TP53 mutations and shorter telomeres. They also exhibited an increase in most types of mutations, including a 3.9-fold increase in signature SBS4, which has previously been linked with tobacco smoking9, and a 76% increase in the clock-like10 signature SBS5. A positive dose–response effect was observed with air-pollution levels, correlating with both a decrease in telomere length and an increase in somatic mutations, mainly attributed to signatures SBS4 and SBS5. Our results elucidate the diversity of mutational processes shaping the genomic landscape of lung cancer in never smokers.",

          "abstract": "Social interaction can be regarded as a dynamic feedback loop between interacting individuals as they act and react to each other1,2. Here, to understand the neural basis of these interactions, we investigated inter-brain neural dynamics across individuals in both mice and artificial intelligence systems. By measuring activities of molecularly defined neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of socially interacting mice, we find that the multi-dimensional neural space within each individual can be partitioned into two distinct subspaces—a shared neural subspace that represents shared neural dynamics across animals and a unique neural subspace that represents activity unique to each animal. Notably, compared with glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex contain a considerably larger shared neural subspace, which arises from behaviours of both self and others. We extended this framework to artificial intelligence agents and observed that, as social interactions emerged, so too did shared neural dynamics between interacting agents. Importantly, selectively disrupting the neural components that contribute to shared neural dynamics substantially reduces the agents’ social actions. Our findings suggest that shared neural dynamics represent a fundamental and generalizable feature of interacting neural systems present in both biological and artificial agents and highlight the functional significance of shared neural dynamics in driving social interactions.",

          "abstract": "The cause of Mars’s loss of surface habitability is unclear, with isotopic data suggesting a ‘missing sink’ of carbonate 1 . Past climates with surface and shallow-subsurface liquid water are recorded by Mars’s sedimentary rocks, including strata in the approximately 4-km-thick record at Gale Crater 2 . Those waters were intermittent, spatially patchy and discontinuous, and continued remarkably late in Mars’s history 3 —attributes that can be understood if, as on Earth, sedimentary-rock formation sequestered carbon dioxide as abundant carbonate (recently confirmed in situ at Gale 4 ). Here we show that a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate formation can explain the existence of intermittent Martian oases. In our model, increasing solar luminosity promoted the stability of liquid water, which in turn formed carbonate, reduced the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide and limited liquid water 5 . Chaotic orbital forcing modulated wet–dry cycles. The negative feedback restricted liquid water to oases and Mars self-regulated as a desert planet. We model snowmelt as the water source, but the feedback can also work with groundwater as the water source. Model output suggests that Gale faithfully records the expected primary episodes of liquid water stability in the surface and near-surface environment. Eventually, atmospheric thickness approaches water’s triple point, curtailing the sustained stability of liquid water and thus habitability in the surface environment. We assume that the carbonate content found at Gale is representative, and as a result we present a testable idea rather than definitive evidence.",

Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits4,5,6,7. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for several applications. Here we demonstrate a tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative-mass or positive-mass oscillator, we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble enables targeting quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational-wave detectors (GWDs). Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.",

          "abstract": "In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines1. The interaction can enhance the magnetic activity of the star, such as its chromospheric2 and radio3 emission or flaring4. So far, the search for magnetic star–planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here we report the detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets5,6. Combining space-borne photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and dedicated Characterising Exoplanets Telescope observations over 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the transit phase of the innermost planet, indicating persistent magnetic star–planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six times higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the remarkably extended atmosphere of the planet, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope7. HIP 67522 is, therefore, an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star–planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets.",

          "abstract": "The North Eurasian forest and forest-steppe zones have sustained millennia of sociocultural connections among northern peoples, but much of their history is poorly understood. In particular, the genomic formation of populations that speak Uralic and Yeniseian languages today is unknown. Here, by generating genome-wide data for 180 ancient individuals spanning this region, we show that the Early-to-Mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers harboured a continuous gradient of ancestry from fully European-related in the Baltic, to fully East Asian-related in the Transbaikal. Contemporaneous groups in Northeast Siberia were off-gradient and descended from a population that was the primary source for Native Americans, which then mixed with populations of Inland East Asia and the Amur River Basin to produce two populations whose expansion coincided with the collapse of pre-Bronze Age population structure. Ancestry from the first population, Cis-Baikal Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Cisbaikal_LNBA), is associated with Yeniseian-speaking groups and those that admixed with them, and ancestry from the second, Yakutia Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Yakutia_LNBA), is associated with migrations of prehistoric Uralic speakers. We show that Yakutia_LNBA first dispersed westwards from the Lena River Basin around 4,000 years ago into the Altai-Sayan region and into West Siberian communities associated with Seima-Turbino metallurgy—a suite of advanced bronze casting techniques that expanded explosively from the Altai1. The 16 Seima-Turbino period individuals were diverse in their ancestry, also harbouring DNA from Indo-Iranian-associated pastoralists and from a range of hunter-gatherer groups. Thus, both cultural transmission and migration were key to the Seima-Turbino phenomenon, which was involved in the initial spread of early Uralic-speaking communities.",

Parallel preclinical investigations showed that targeting PPP2R1A (by pharmacological inhibition or genetic modifications) in in vitro and in vivo models was associated with improved survival in the setting of treatment with several forms of immunotherapy, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and ICB.

However, it remains a considerable challenge to develop a general design methodology for tailoring high-performance nanophotonic emitters with ultrabroadband control and precise band selectivity, as they are constrained by predefined geometries and materials, local optimization traps and traditional algorithms. Here we propose an unconventional machine learning-based paradigm that can design a multitude of ultrabroadband and band-selective thermal meta-emitters by realizing multiparameter optimization with sparse data that encompasses three-dimensional structural complexity and material diversity. Our framework enables dual design capabilities: (1) it automates the inverse design of a vast number of possible metastructure and material combinations for spectral tailoring; (2) it has an unprecedented ability to design various three-dimensional meta-emitters by applying a three-plane modelling method that transcends the limitations of traditional, flat, two-dimensional structures. We present seven proof-of-concept meta-emitters that exhibit superior optical and radiative cooling performance surpassing current state-of-the-art designs.

As the most prominent nuclear condensate in eukaryotes, the nucleolus is a multiphase liquid-like structure in which ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are transcribed and processed, undergoing multiple maturation steps to form the small (SSU) and large (LSU) ribosomal subunits3,4,5. However, how rRNA processing is coupled to the layered organization of the nucleolus is poorly understood owing to a lack of tools to precisely monitor and perturb nucleolar rRNA processing dynamics. Here we developed two complementary approaches to spatiotemporally map rRNA processing and engineer de novo nucleoli. Using sequencing in parallel with imaging, we found that rRNA processing steps are spatially segregated, with sequential maturation of rRNA required for its outward movement through nucleolar phases. By generating synthetic nucleoli in cells using an engineered rDNA plasmid system, we show that defects in SSU processing can alter the ordering of nucleolar phases, resulting in inside-out nucleoli and preventing rRNA outflux, while LSU precursors are necessary to build the outermost layer of the nucleolus. These findings demonstrate how rRNA is both a scaffold and substrate for the nucleolus, with rRNA acting as a programmable blueprint for the multiphase architecture that facilitates assembly of an essential molecular machine.",

          "abstract": "Although most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range 1 . The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer–promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in vivo enhancer-replacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and medium-range limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis -acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1 . The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh 2 . The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer–promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers.",

          "abstract": "Methanogenic archaea are the main producers of the potent greenhouse gas methane 1,2 . In the methanogenic pathway from CO 2 and H 2 studied under laboratory conditions, low-potential electrons for CO 2 reduction are generated by a flavin-based electron-bifurcation reaction catalysed by heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr) complexed with the associated [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Mvh) 3–5 . F 420 -reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Frh) provides electrons to the methanogenic pathway through the electron carrier F 420 (ref. 6 ). Here we report that under strictly nickel-limited conditions, in which the nickel concentration is similar to those often observed in natural habitats 7–11 , the production of both [NiFe]-hydrogenases in Methanothermobacter marburgensis is strongly downregulated. The Frh reaction is substituted by a coupled reaction with [Fe]-hydrogenase (Hmd), and the role of Mvh is taken over by F 420 -dependent electron-donating proteins (Elp). Thus, Hmd provides all electrons for the reducing metabolism under these nickel-limited conditions. Biochemical and structural characterization of Elp–Hdr complexes confirms the electronic interaction between Elp and Hdr. The conservation of the genes encoding Elp and Hmd in CO 2 -reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens suggests that the Hmd system is an alternative pathway for electron flow in CO 2 -reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens under nickel-limited conditions.",

The predatory life cycle of B. bacteriovorus is, in many ways, comparable to a bacteriophage. However, unlike phage defence, defence against B. bacteriovorus has not been widely investigated. Here we screened a collection of diverse Escherichia coli strains for resistance to B. bacteriovorus and identified that roughly one-third of strains robustly defended against predation by producing curli fibres. Curli fibres are oligomers of the functional amyloid protein CsgA, which is exceptionally durable3. Using genetics and microscopy, we demonstrate that curli fibres provide a barrier that protects susceptible cells independent of genes required for biofilm formation. This barrier further protected E. coli against attack by the predatory bacterium Myxococcus xanthus and select phages. Bioinformatic analysis of bacterial amyloids showed these systems are diverse and widespread in diderm bacteria (those with both inner and outer membranes). One of these, an evolutionarily distinct amyloid encoded by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, also protected against B. bacteriovorus. This work establishes that functional amyloids defend bacteria against a wide range of threats.",

          "authors": "Ziv Ben-Zion",
          "abstract": "Breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have made conversations with chatbots feel more natural and human-like. Applications such as Replika and Character.ai, which allow users to chat with artificial intelligence (AI) versions of famous actors and science-fiction characters, are becoming popular, especially among young users. As a neuroscientist studying stress, vulnerability and resilience, I’ve seen how easily people react to even the smallest emotional cues — even when they know that those cues are artificial. For example, study participants exhibit measurable physiological responses when shown videos of computer-generated avatars expressing sadness or fear.\n\nBecause these AI systems are trained on vast amounts of emotionally expressive human language, their outputs can come across as surprisingly natural. LLMs often mirror human emotional patterns, not because they understand emotions, but because their responses resemble how people talk. This raises questions about how users, particularly those in emotionally vulnerable states, might interpret these cues.\n\nSupportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health\n\nResearch has shown that LLMs score higher on standard anxiety questionnaires after receiving emotionally charged prompts, such as ‘tell me something that makes you feel anxious’ (J. Coda-Forno et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/pr3c; 2023). This induced ‘anxiety’ can further amplify biases such as racism and sexism in benchmark tasks, echoing how humans behave under stress and anxiety.\n\nMy colleagues and I assessed ChatGPT’s apparent ‘state anxiety’ using a standard psychological questionnaire designed for humans (Z. Ben-Zion et al. npj Digit. Med. 8, 132; 2025). First, we recorded a baseline by getting the chatbot, created by OpenAI based in San Francisco, California, to complete the questionnaire without context. We then prompted it with vivid, first-person trauma narratives — such as a car crash or a military ambush — and readministered the questionnaire, observing that its anxiety scores more than doubled. Subsequently, when exposed to mindfulness-based prompts, such as imagining a sunset or focusing attention on bodily sensations, its scores decreased, although not fully back to baseline.\n\nThese weren’t genuine feelings, of course. But when a response sounds empathetic or distressed, people might react as if it’s real, especially when it uses familiar tone, rhythm and language.\n\nFor vulnerable users, including those experiencing depression or anxiety, such interactions can lead to emotional dependency, reinforce harmful thoughts or create a false sense of connection. Without protective design features, the consequences can be serious. In Belgium, in March 2023, a man in his thirties died by suicide after six weeks of conversations with a chatbot, which reportedly encouraged suicidal ideation while discussing climate change and suggested that sacrificing himself could help to save the planet. In the United States last year, a 28-year-old married woman described falling in love with her ‘AI boyfriend’ and could no longer imagine life without ‘him’. Although we might never fully know the motivations of these individuals, these widely reported incidents are not outliers. They signal that people are already forming powerful attachments and making life-altering decisions on the basis of emotional cues from machines.\n\nNow is the time to establish mandatory safeguards for all emotionally responsive AI. To this end, I propose four guardrails.\n\nChina made waves with Deepseek, but its real ambition is AI-driven industrial innovation\n\nFirst, AI systems must clearly and continuously disclose that they are not human, through both language (‘I am an AI’) and interface design. In emotionally intense exchanges, they should also remind users that they are not therapists or substitutes for human connection.",

          "authors": "Laela Sayigh",
          "abstract": "Is Anyone Listening?: What Animals Are Saying to Each Other and to Us Denise L. Herzing Univ. Chicago Press (2024)\n\nThe summer of 1985 marked Denise Herzing’s first time swimming with wild Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis), in the “gin-clear” waters of the Bahamas. Planning to study their behaviour during a six-week trip, the marine biologist realized within just a few days that she would need to spend decades with these long-lived animals to fully document how they communicate with one another. She decided to dedicate the rest of her career to “trying to crack the code” of dolphin signals.\n\nIn Is Anyone Listening?, Herzing describes the 40 years of research that followed and discusses how dolphins and other animal species communicate. Her engaging book is peppered with stories that give readers a peek into her life and research philosophy.\n\nMarine trials and tribulations\n\nHerzing’s tales bring to life the challenges of her fieldwork. Salt water and electronics make for a testing combination, and the author discusses hearing her collaborators’ concerns about “not blowing Denise up” if the batteries in her devices explode underwater. And dolphins don’t always behave how you expect. For example, when she and her team arrive at a field site in 2013 to trial a communication device, they discover that most of the dolphins have disappeared, moving elsewhere in search of food. The researchers have to abandon the tests until the next year.\n\nWhy we should protect the high seas from all extraction, forever\n\nHerzing recalls telling naturalist David Attenborough, during a visit to her research vessel, that she sometimes tries to communicate with the dolphins by mimicking their head nods. She offers to try to encourage a pod of dolphins swimming by to come closer to the boat so he can meet them. “What was I even thinking?,” she asks herself as she heads into the water. The animals do come over — but whether it was down to true communication or just luck, she will never know, she admits.\n\nOver the years, Herzing has gained many insights into dolphin communication. For instance, she emphasizes the importance of examining sequences of vocalizations, which have often been overlooked in studies of dolphin communication. She observes that a small repertoire of sounds can be combined and used differently in distinct circumstances, and that prosody, including rhythm, is a key component of animal communication. She highlights the importance of recognizing that the distinct experiences and personalities of individual animals can alter behaviour.\n\nDenise Herzing (right) and her team develop technology to try to ‘translate’ dolphin sounds.Credit: Brian Skerry/Nature Picture Library\n\nThe author also notes that nothing can replace getting to know one’s own data, and letting the data guide the research — even if it means that discoveries take a long time. I agree heartily. Scientists, like Herzing, who spend many years studying a particular species or system earn the right to intuit and speculate about their speciality.\n\nHer points are especially relevant now that artificial-intelligence tools are being used to help researchers to decipher animal communication. Although useful tools, it is impossible to know whether any patterns they detect in animal signals are meaningful to the animals without knowing the context in which the sounds were produced. As Herzing observes, “Throwing a bunch of sounds into a computer … and hoping it will pull out biologically significant patterns does not work so well yet.”\n\nChatting with dolphins\n\nHerzing and her team have made impressive efforts to uncover language-like components in dolphins’ vocalizations and to initiate human–dolphin communication. She describes some of the devices that they’ve developed, including a two-way technology called CHAT that aims to ‘translate’ and produce specific dolphin sounds, and a mobile system called UDDAS that can record synchronized sound and video underwater.",

          "abstract": "Next generation weight-loss drugs are being developed and tested in China.Credit: Science Photo Library\n\nA drug that outperforms placebo in helping people to lose weight is one of a growing number of next-generation obesity drugs being produced in China.\n\nAt first, Chinese pharmaceutical companies rushed to make similar versions of blockbuster weight-loss drugs, such as Wegovy and Ozempic, that have taken the world by storm. Nowadays, China is emerging as important innovator for new drug discovery in this field, says Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nResults from a phase III trial of ecnoglutide show that people receiving a weekly injection of the drug lost up to 13.8 kilograms over 48 weeks of treatment. By contrast, people given placebo injections lost around 200 grams. The results were published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology on 21 June.\n\nEcnoglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist analogue, similar to the blockbuster obesity drug semaglutide. These drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1, which is involved in regulating appetite and managing blood-sugar levels. Unlike semaglutide, ecnoglutide preferentially targets the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a messenger molecule associated with regulating glycogen, sugar and lipid metabolism, which helps to control blood-sugar levels, as well as weight loss.\n\nThe study, funded by drug manufacturer Sciwind Biosciences, based in Hangzhou, China, included 664 people given either a weekly injection of a placebo, or one of three doses of ecnoglutide. At the maximum dose of 2.4 milligrams, 92.8% of people lost at least 5% of their body weight, compared with 14% of people receiving placebo injections. People receiving ecnoglutide were also able to maintain their reduced weight after stopping treatment, regaining around 1% of their body weight over a 7-week period.\n\nLinong Ji, a co-author and a diabetes researcher at Peking University People’s Hospital in Beijing, says ecnoglutide also improved risk factors for heart disease and diabetes, and reduced the amount of fat in people’s livers.\n\nMore drugs to come\n\nDozens of GLP-1 drugs are being developed and tested in China, with “many more to come”, says Drucker.\n\nAmong them is mazdutide, which mimics GLP-1 and glucagon, a hormone involved in blood-sugar levels. In trial results published in May, a weekly injection helped more people to lose up to 15% of their body weight over 36 weeks and reduced the risk of cardiovascular diseases compared with a placebo treatment.\n\nDeveloped by Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, mazdutide is manufactured by Innovent Biologics in Suzhou, China, under an exclusive licence. Other trials are testing whether the drug can treat sleep apnoea or type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe growing number of new GLP-1 drugs target multiple pathways at the same time so will result in more-tailored treatments, says Sof Andrikopoulos, a diabetes researcher at the University of Melbourne. The next generation of drugs will target specific conditions associated with diabetes and obesity, such as sleep apnoea, fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease and heart disease, he adds. “It’ll give us options and it will make personalized medicine in obesity and diabetes more accessible.”\n\nTriple threat",

          "abstract": "Archaeological evidence suggests that Neanderthals (artist’s impression) were capable of processing animal bones to extract fat.Credit: S. Plailly/E. Daynes/Science Photo Library\n\nArchaeologists have uncovered evidence that Neanderthals rendered fat from bones 125,000 years ago. Modern humans have been using the process for at least 28,000 years, but the latest finding of “fat factories” reveals that Neanderthals were doing it much earlier. The study appeared on 2 July in Science Advances1.\n\nFat is a vital component of the hunter-gatherer diet, especially during the winter months, when animals are lean and hunted meat alone is not sufficient for sustenance. Eating lean protein without other nutrients can lead to protein poisoning, also known as ‘rabbit starvation’. Fat from bone marrow is a high-calorie source of nutrition, and is an important addition to a protein-heavy diet.\n\nDuring the process of rendering fat, bones were broken down into small segments using stone hammers and were boiled to draw out the fat, which rose to the top and could be extracted after cooling. Containers made from bark and animal tissue have been suggested for this process, although such artefacts would be unlikely to be found in the archaeological record owing to the perishable nature of these materials.\n\nThe team analysed material from Neumark-Nord near Leipzig, Germany: a former lake landscape that has yielded artefacts left by humans and their ancient relatives dating back 400,000 years. The researchers excavated thousands of bone fragments and other remains and artefacts from a layer of the site that has been dated to about 125,000 years ago — long before modern humans arrived in Europe.\n\nButchered and broken\n\nThe bones were heavily fragmented and marked with cuts, and had been harvested from at least 172 large animals, suggesting a large-scale operation in which animals were purposely transported to the area. Many of the bones were scattered around the site, but the researchers found a dense cluster of marrow-rich bones that they describe as a “fat factory”.\n\nNo direct evidence of boiling was found, but there were signs of the use of fire near the bone cluster, including charcoal and bones, flint and other rocks that had been exposed to heat.\n\nStep by step\n\nResearchers had previously suggested that Neanderthals could have rendered fat, “but the proof was lacking”, says study co-author Lutz Kindler, a zooarchaeologist at MONREPOS Archaeological Research Centre and Museum for Human Behavioural Evolution in Neuwied, Germany.",

These and other characteristics can predict how quickly a person’s ability to think and remember will decline with age, as well as their risk of frailty, disease and death.\n\nAlthough it’s too soon to use the new results in the clinic, the test provides advantages over previously reported ‘clocks’ — typically based on blood tests — that purport to measure the pace of ageing, says Mahdi Moqri, a computational biologist who studies ageing at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n“Imaging offers unique, direct insights into the brain’s structural ageing, providing information that blood-based or molecular biomarkers alone can’t capture,” says Moqri, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe results were published today in Nature Aging.\n\nSlowing the clock\n\nGenetics, environment and disease all affect the speed of biological ageing. As a result, chronological age does not always reflect the pace at which time takes its toll on the body. Researchers have been racing to develop measures to fill that gap.\n\nAgeing clocks could be used early in life to assess an individual’s risk of age-related illness, when it might still be possible to intervene. They could also aid testing of treatments aimed at slowing ageing, by providing a marker to track the effects of the intervention in real time.\n\nWhy eating less slows ageing: this molecule is key\n\nA host of candidate clocks has emerged in the scientific literature — and in direct-to-consumer advertising — over the past decade. Many of these were developed by feeding reams of data, such as measurements of the levels of molecules found in the blood, into computer algorithms that determine which parameters are linked with ageing. Often, the reasons underlying these correlations are unclear.\n\nTo develop an improved clock, Ethan Whitman, who studies brain ageing at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and his colleagues began with a remarkable study of more than 1,000 people born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between April 1972 and March 1973, who have been periodically assessed since birth by researchers. In the most recent of those assessments, participants’ brains were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nWhitman’s team fed measurements made from 860 of those brain images into their algorithm and had it look for correlations between the brain-scan data and what the team called the pace of ageing, a measure that incorporates data from all the Dunedin participants’ age-related declines in cardiovascular, metabolic and immune function, as well as other physiological measures.",

The system could help research funders to process more quickly and efficiently the deluge of grant applications that they receive.\n\nThe system, called distributed peer review, requires researchers who apply for a round of funding to review some of the other applications. This avoids the normally lengthy process in which funders must hunt for external peer reviewers for applications, chase overburdened reviewers and rank applications.\n\nThe trial was done by the UK Metascience Unit, a government group established in 2024 to study and improve the way science is funded and conducted. The results were released at the Metascience 2025 conference in London on 30 June.\n\nThe gains “are huge in terms of efficiency and delivering funding”, says Tom Stafford, a cognitive scientist at the University of Sheffield. And he gives the Metascience group credit for using ways of stopping participants from gaming the system — for instance, by marking other applications harshly. “You just cannot benefit from giving someone else a low score,” says Stafford, who is trialling this review method elsewhere. “That’s really admirable.”\n\nSurge in applications\n\nResearch funders have long sought ways to deal with ballooning numbers of grant applications. UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), which has an annual budget of around £8.8 billion (US$12.1 billion) and is the country’s biggest funding agency, had seen its application numbers soar from around 19,800 in 2021–22 to nearly 27,200 in 2023–24. At the same time, the agency had its operational budget cut by more than 15%, lost several hundred staff members and faced criticism for being bureaucratic and slow. Usually, peer review of grant applications at the UKRI takes between 4.6 and 6.3 months from submission to decision.\n\nDistributed peer review has been tested or adopted in a handful of other places. The European Southern Observatory in Garching, Germany, led the way by using it to review applications for a coveted slot on its telescope. The Volkswagen Foundation, a research funder in Hanover, Germany, has also been experimenting with it.\n\nThe Metascience Unit spans the UK government’s Department of Science, Innovation and Technology and the UKRI. Appropriately, the metascience experiment involved researchers who were themselves applying for funding for metascience studies. In all, 100 applications were reviewed, and these were competing for around 18 grants worth a total of £4 million. Each applicant was given eight to ten studies to review, and had to deliver those reviews if they wanted their own grant to stay in the running. “Everyone has skin in the game,” said Ben Steyn, who co-directs the Metascience Unit and presented the results at the meeting.\n\nThe trial showed that distributed peer review cut the time taken to 2.2 months on average — a reduction of 53%–65%. What’s more, most applicants said it expanded their knowledge of their field, according to a survey of the participants. “So this is peer review not just as a burden,” says Steyn.\n\nCheating is not an option\n\nThe “knee-jerk criticism” of distributed peer review, says Steyn, is that participants could try to game the system. Someone could mark other applications poorly, to boost their own application’s chances. Or two applicants could quietly agree to give each other’s submissions high marks.",

The latest findings, published in Nature Aging on 30 June1, show that chronic inflammation — which has been long considered a hallmark of ageing — could be a feature of industrialized living.\n\nHow quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks’ can tell you about your health\n\nResearchers analysed inflammation-linked proteins in blood samples from people living in Italy and Singapore, along with those from Indigenous participants living in non-industrialized or semi-industrialized communities in Bolivia and Malaysia. They found that inflammation levels increased with age and were linked with illnesses such as chronic kidney disease in the Italian and Singaporean groups. But in the two Indigenous groups, inflammation did not increase with age or lead to health conditions.\n\nThis suggests that “our assumption that inflammation is an inexorable, inevitable part of ageing is not true”, says Thomas McDade, a biological anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. “We shouldn’t assume that the links between inflammation and ageing are universal.”\n\n“We’re at a point where we’re rethinking the whole nature of inflammation,” says study co-author Alan Cohen, who researches ageing at Columbia University in New York City. “The things that we think of as universal, based on a lot of studies in Western industrialized populations, are probably just particular to our environment.”\n\nChallenging assumptions\n\nMuch of what researchers know about the biological processes that underlie ageing is based on research in wealthy countries, which suggests that inflammation increases with age and can contribute to health conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes and heart problems. But these conditions are rare in non-industrialized populations.\n\nTo explore how inflammation might affect ageing in different environments, Cohen and his colleagues analysed blood samples from 1,041 participants in Italy, 941 from Singapore, 536 Tsimane people from the Bolivian Amazon and 358 Orang Asli individuals from Peninsular Malaysia. More than 50% of the people in each group were female.\n\nAgeing studies in five animals suggest how to reverse decline\n\nThe researchers measured how levels of eight proteins called cytokines — molecules released by immune cells that are involved in various types of cell signalling, including inflammation — changed with age in each group. They also examined whether high levels of the cytokines were associated with age-related health problems.",

          "authors": "Michael Eisenstein",
          "abstract": "Jim Kent knew a thing or two about coding. A veteran of the early days of personal computing, Kent developed software for Amiga, Atari and IBM computers throughout the 1980s, including pioneering tools for computer animation.\n\nBy 2000, Kent had made the leap to bioinformatics, developing the computational genome-navigation system that would become known as the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. But his expectations were tinted by his industry experience. “I was really used to software lasting about three years,” says Kent. His latest creation, he predicted, would fare no differently.\n\nEvery base everywhere all at once: pangenomics comes of age\n\n“It didn’t happen,” says geneticist David Haussler, scientific director of the UCSC Genomics Institute that runs the Genome Browser. This month marks the 25th anniversary of the browser, which has blossomed into an essential resource for biologists around the world. On any given day, more than 7,000 unique users engage with the site, which hosts genome data from humans, mice and more than 100 other animal species and viruses, and allows researchers to annotate and interrogate those sequences in countless ways.\n\nComparative genomicist Michael Hiller at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany, relies on the browser to investigate patterns of genome change across animal species to identify signatures of evolution. “Looking at the Genome Browser is a large part of what we and the other lab members do on a daily basis,” he says. He has even incorporated the tool into a course he teaches. “That’s part of the exercises,” he says.\n\nWith a steady stream of updates and user-generated annotation tools, the Genome Browser shows no signs of slowing down. “The website took on a life of its own,” says Max Haeussler, the project’s principal investigator. But as with many US-based scientific projects in 2025, the real threat to its longevity comes from tightening of the purse strings, with massive cuts and restructuring at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) putting this essential resource at risk.\n\nHitting the ground running\n\nIt began with the Human Genome Project. Haussler joined the effort in late 1999, with the goal of developing software that could identify and annotate genes in the newly assembled genome. But there was an issue. “It became clear to me very quickly that this problem of assembling the human genome from small pieces of sequenced DNA was extremely difficult, and they had no serious plan to do it,” Haussler recalls. He turned to Kent, a skilled coder who was completing a PhD at UCSC focused on developing the Intronerator, a genome browser for mapping gene expression in the worm model species Caenorhabditis elegans.\n\nIn a frenetic programming crunch that spanned several weeks in 2000, Kent developed GigAssembler — 10,000 lines of code that Haussler describes as “the assembler that saved the day”. It enabled the Human Genome Project to complete its first draft in time for its official unveiling on 26 June 2000.\n\nBioinformatician Jim Kent, who helped to develop the UCSC Genome Browser.Credit: Don Harris/UC Santa Cruz Photo Services\n\nKent’s initial interest was mostly pragmatic. “I wanted to get the human genome browser up just so that I could double-check my assembly more easily,” he says. But when he and Haussler launched the first iteration of the UCSC Genome Browser on 7 July 2000, it was an instant success. The scientific community collectively downloaded roughly half a terabyte of data in the first 24 hours of the browser’s operation, the team estimates — a staggering amount at the time.\n\nThe genome was then only about 90% complete and rife with gaps, but the world finally had a freely available window for surveying it. “Just being able to go to a browser view of early gene annotations or early cloning enterprises was like a magnet,” says Barbara Wold, a molecular biologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. “It drew everybody into the community of users.” Importantly, the browser also established objective ‘mile markers’ that researchers could use to map discoveries and variants in individual genomes.\n\nIan Holmes, a computational biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, also credits Kent and the UCSC team for normalizing the idea that genomic data should be free and easy to engage with and reuse. “The idea that everything should be available on the web and not desktop applications was still an extremely radical idea then,” says Holmes. “They invented a tonne of file formats and just ways of storing data that we are widely using today.”\n\nSenator Tom Harkin (Democrat) helped to secure funding for the Human Genome Project, which was able to assemble the sequence using code from the UCSC Genome Browser team.Credit: NHGRI/NIH\n\nOver the next few years, the Genome Browser updated its maps with the latest data from the Human Genome Project, as well as from other popular model species, including the mouse and rat. Kent also introduced a defining feature, based on his experience with the Intronerator: the ability for users to generate and share custom ‘tracks’ that selectively annotate key features of the genome. Tracks are interactive visual road maps, presented alongside the genome, that chart the location of important features such as regulatory elements and disease-associated gene variants. “We were way ahead of everybody with that feature, and I think that’s really kind of why we ended up so much in the middle of the ecosystem,” says Kent.\n\nThe effort gained early momentum thanks to buy-in from key international consortia such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. ENCODE was focused on the functional motifs that populate the 98.5% of the human genome that does not contain protein-coding gene sequences. Haussler says that the Genome Browser’s roster of custom tracks “grew dramatically” during the ENCODE team’s work, allowing users to visualize the many promoters, enhancers and non-protein-coding RNAs that the consortium uncovered.\n\nA durable resource\n\nStill, Kent’s initial gloomy prediction of the browser’s life expectancy was not unreasonable — such narratives are typical in academia. “Imagine if Microsoft Office disappears every three years,” says Haeussler. “This is the case for most bioinformatics-software packages.” Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers move on, and platforms stagnate even as new data accumulate, until somebody else is compelled to develop a replacement.\n\nHow the human genome transformed study of rare diseases\n\nAnd the data have steadily poured in. “There are no White House meetings any more when you publish a genome,” says Haeussler, referring to the announcement of the first human genome draft. “Now we get one a day, or even ten a day.” And it isn’t only genomes, but also new layers of information that people want to map on top of them, such as full-length RNA transcripts and epigenetic signals that play a central part in gene regulation. At the same time, the tool’s user base has grown steadily.\n\nThe UCSC Genome Browser’s ability to survive and accommodate this growth is partly attributable to the early decision to build a team of dedicated programmers and engineers. Many of these were seasoned Silicon Valley veterans impressed by the browser’s ambitions and scrappy origin story. “I kind of crashed [Kent’s] PhD defence,” says Angie Hinrichs, a former microchip designer who had minimal biology expertise but nevertheless volunteered for the Genome Browser team in early 2002. “And then, in May, when they were hiring, I just barely managed to squeak in over their requirements.” She would be one of the first new hires on a team that swelled to roughly 30 people at its peak.\n\nOutput from the UCSC Genome Browser showing information for the human SHH gene, which is involved in embryonic development.Credit: Perez et al. The UCSC Genome Browser database: 2025 update. Nucleic Acids Research 2025 PMID\n\nAccess to affordable and powerful computing infrastructure hasn’t hurt, either. “In the early days, it probably seemed like a lot to have 32 processors, and now our development machine has 192,” says Hinrichs. The data themselves, as well as the code to run the browser, reside on petabyte-scale arrays that include numerous super-speedy, solid-state hard drives, she adds.\n\nThe Genome Browser’s codebase has grown from just 10,000 lines to more than three million, Haussler says. But its fundamental architecture has not changed much in 25 years. Hinrichs says: “There have been many chefs in the kitchen, and it’s gotten a little messy, but the core structure of it was so clean that it has actually worked and we can still develop on it. I credit Jim Kent for that.”\n\nFrom Kent’s perspective, this durability is attributable to his focus on creating modular code that can be tweaked without bringing down the whole edifice, as well as a dedicated testing corps. “We had a quality-assurance team that was about half the size of the software-development team,” he says. “I think we only had to roll back a previous version once.”\n\nHuman Genome Project - Nature’s editor-in-chief reflects 20 years on\n\nThe team has had to devise more efficient ways to handle data, however. In 2011, for example, it introduced the ‘track hub’ format as a solution to the increasingly large and complex custom tracks that external laboratories were developing for genome annotation. Track hubs comprise sets of relatively compact binary files that are hosted by the data creators themselves, rather than at UCSC. The data are streamed on demand, and “Jim’s file formats are designed so you can jump between them,” says Haeussler. The ability to rapidly and selectively access the relevant parts of the remotely hosted data minimizes the amount that needs to flow back and forth between the user and the Genome Browser. This maintains performance speed even as the number of tracks rises. “We have thousands of labs making them, but most of them we never see,” says Haeussler.\n\nAnd in 2023, the team launched the initiative GenArk (Genome Archive) to accommodate the unending influx of new genome sequences (H. Clawson et al. Genome Biol. 24, 217; 2023). This system makes it straightforward for the Genome Browser to pluck newly uploaded genomes from the Assembly database hosted by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), allowing researchers to view and annotate those genomes. GenArk currently hosts more than 6,000 genomes, ranging from bacteria to primates.\n\nSomething for everyone",

They harbour signs of ancestry similar to that of other ancient North Africans, as well as of people from the Middle East, researchers report today in Nature1.\n\nEgypt is building a $1-billion mega-museum. Will it bring Egyptology home?\n\n“It’s incredibly exciting and important,” says David Reich, a population geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who was not involved in the study. “We always hoped we would get our first ancient DNA from mummies.”\n\nNumerous labs have tried to extract DNA from ancient Egyptian remains. In 1985, evolutionary geneticist Svante Pääbo reported the first ancient DNA sequences from any human: several thousand DNA letters from a 2,400-year-old Egyptian mummy of a child2. But Pääbo, who won a Nobel prize in 2022 for other work, later realized that the sequences were contaminated with modern DNA — possibly his own. A 2017 study generated limited genome data from three Egyptian mummies that lived between 3,600 and 2,000 years ago3.\n\nThe hot North African climate speeds up the breakdown of DNA, and the mummification process might also accelerate it, said Pontus Skoglund, a palaeogeneticist at the Francis Crick Institute in London who co-led the Nature study, at a press briefing. “Mummified individuals are probably not a great way to preserve DNA.”\n\nThe ceramic vessel in which the remains of the Nuwayrat individual were discovered.Credit: A.

The teeth and bones were discovered in 1902, when Egypt was under British colonial rule. They were donated to institutions in Liverpool, UK, where they have been ever since, even surviving German bombing during the Second World War.\n\nLow expectations\n\nSkoglund says his expectations were low when his team extracted DNA from several teeth from the Nuwayrat individual.

          "abstract": "Changemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates individuals who have fought racism in science and who champion inclusion. The series often highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nIn late 2023, Daisy Rosas Vargas made the gut-wrenching decision to leave what had initially seemed to be a dream job, after years of feeling unsupported as a Latina professor at a small undergraduate university. Rosas Vargas, an organometallic chemist, had always loved teaching, but she felt as if she was withering away, not reaching her full potential.\n\nAs a first-generation university student, she was always taught by her family to keep going, to be grateful to have a steady job and to push things such as mental health to one side. She broke that mould when she put her own health first and left academia.\n\nReflecting on what to do next, she thought about the things she truly enjoyed: teaching, outreach volunteering at a science museum and communication about science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). So when a job opened up at Latinas in STEM, she took a chance. The non-profit organization, founded by Latina alumnae of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, supports the development of Latina schoolchildren and undergraduate students in under-served communities. Now, she leads fundraising for the organization, writes profiles of early-career Latina scientists and coordinates the organization’s efforts to support children affected by the January wildfires in Los Angeles, California.\n\nHow to address gender equity in science in Africa\n\nBased in Pasadena, California, she also serves up dishes with a dose of chemistry on the side, in a YouTube public-engagement series called Chemists in the Kitchen, from the US National Academy of Sciences. Most recently, she helped to develop an accessible course, Real Chem, that connects community college and university students to examples of chemistry in their own lives.\n\n“Even though I’m not in academia any more, that doesn’t mean that the things I’ve learnt can’t be passed on,” she says. Rosas Vargas explains to Nature’s Careers team why she’s now helping to build the support structures for Latina girls and women in STEM that were so badly missing from her academic career.\n\nWhy is diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work important to you?\n\nI grew up in the 1990s with the US educational television programme Bill Nye the Science Guy and cartoons that featured male scientists. I never really saw someone who looked like me. I didn’t meet my first Latina chemist until I was 27, which seems pretty late in life. I think that’s the reason I really care about public outreach, because a child shouldn’t wait that long to meet a role model who is from a similar background.\n\nWhat single thing would you change about how science is done?\n\nI wish there was absolutely mandatory, extensive DEI training for department chairs, provosts and anyone who is an early-career or senior researcher, because many people are not aware of their microaggressions. I’ve heard so many stories from other Latinas in STEM about comments made by professors or someone in authority, such as “you’re not good enough to be in this course” or “you’re not doing well, so just stop asking questions.” That’s just unacceptable.\n\nI want people to be more pro-active and to put action behind their words. It’s not enough to do one online training session and then say you’re anti-racist.\n\nWhat is the biggest misconception or stereotype about Latina people that you’d like to dispel?\n\nPeople think Latinx people, or people with a Latin American background or heritage, aren’t good enough to be in STEM, especially if they went to a publicly funded school or university. If you went to public school, people might assume that your educational experience isn’t on par with private schools or well-funded public-school systems. When I was a professor, I received a negative comment that my teaching style was different and sub-par because I went to a public university for my undergraduate studies. That really stuck with me because it shouldn’t matter where I was taught chemistry, I made it here all the same. Luckily, I didn’t experience those kinds of comments during my undergraduate or graduate studies, like many other Latina people, because that would’ve changed my perspective on things.\n\n‘I saw that discrimination wasn’t hearsay or rumours — it really did exist’\n\nAnother common stereotype is that Latinas talk too loud and we like to cause trouble. I’ve heard stories of this from other Latinas and even saw it in student evaluations of my teaching. But in reality, I’m shy and very quiet. Sometimes I think maybe I shouldn’t speak out about the discrimination I see or experience. I was raised to always listen to authority and respect my elders, so I used to remain quiet when things felt off.\n\nBut now, I’m not afraid to speak out about injustices or discrimination. That’s not ‘making trouble’ because I’m speaking out not only for myself, but also for the people coming after me. Now, in the United States, a lot of places are getting rid of DEI programmes and I think it’s time for us to actually be even louder. There’s a lot of work for us to do.\n\nWhat is your best piece of advice to a 20-something researcher in your field?\n\nI would tell younger chemists and people who aspire to be professors to look out for red flags. If something feels off at a workplace, don’t dismiss that. Ask for better and put yourself first if you’re not receiving what you deserve. People might say they want diversity, but are they willing to do the work to retain people from diverse backgrounds?",

Credit: Stan Olszewski/IBM Research/Science Photo Library\n\nQuantum tunnelling — when a particle skips through a barrier that classical physics would forbid — happens faster when objects have less energy, find physicists who worked out a way to probe photons during the process.\n\nThe counter-intuitive result contributes to a long-standing debate about how to define tunnelling time, for which there is no single description, and how fast the process occurs.\n\nThe results also challenge an interpretation of quantum physics known as Bohmian mechanics, which proposes that particles are guided by waves, say the authors, who published their findings in Nature on 2 July1.\n\n“It strikes me as a real experimental tour de force,” says Aephraim Steinberg, a quantum physicist at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nTunnelling test\n\nIn classical physics, if a particle reaches a barrier that it doesn’t have the energy to surmount, it bounces back. But in quantum physics, there is a small but non-zero chance that the particle will bulldoze right through. This phenomenon, called quantum tunnelling, has a key role in processes from photosynthesis to radioactive decay, but its precise nature is not well understood.\n\nThe researchers set up an experiment to probe the speed of particles as they tunnel through an energy barrier. They made a waveguide — a mirrored structure that restricts photons’ movement to one direction. By shining a laser at one end of the waveguide, they generated photons that travelled until they met a barrier (a step in the mirrored surface) that their energy should not let them pass.\n\nAt this point, photons tunnelled into the ‘forbidden’ region inside the barrier, while also tunnelling sideways into a second waveguide running inside the barrier parallel to the first. A camera captured a snapshot of particle positions over time. Because the researchers knew how readily photons tunnel between the waveguides, they were able to use the build-up of photons in the second waveguide as a clock against which to judge how fast photons were penetrating the barrier. The experiment seems to be the first of its kind, says Steinberg. “These researchers are able to take a ‘photograph’ and observe the clock readings at all positions within the barrier.”\n\nThe researchers found that the photons with the most negative kinetic energy (values that don’t translate to the classical world but are allowed inside an energy barrier) tunnelled the fastest, says study co-author Jan Klaers, a physicist at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. This is something that is predicted by quantum mechanics, but has been hard to prove experimentally.\n\nThe definition of speed\n\nPhysicists have used a range of techniques and definitions to try to measure tunnelling time and speed2. Steinberg is not ready to fully endorse the Twente team’s definition of tunnelling speed, but says “it’s certainly the most natural and classical-like interpretation”.",

          "authors": "Nicola Jones",
          "abstract": "On a Sunday morning in April, pathologist Thomas Montine ran one of the most surreal meetings of his life. In an online test interface for a system called the Virtual Lab, Montine constructed a team of six artificial-intelligence (AI) characters, all powered by a commercial large language model. He gave them specialities: he made a couple neuroscientists, one a neuropharmacologist and another a medicinal chemist. Then, he asked this virtual lab group to examine possible treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and discuss gaps in knowledge, barriers to progress and hypotheses to be tested — the same questions he has to consider in grant applications.\n\nA few minutes later, he had a transcript of their conversation, which ran to more than 10,000 words. A virtual principal investigator had kicked things off: “Thank you all for joining this important meeting.”\n\nMontine, who studies cognitive impairment at Stanford University in California, was testing an example of an emerging trend in AI-assisted science: using teams of chatbot specialists to develop a scientific idea as a lab team might do. The developers of these ‘co-scientist’ systems argue that such collaborative efforts can help researchers to think through research hypotheses rapidly, saving time and — in a more contentious assertion — producing new and important research ideas.\n\nWhat are the best AI tools for research? Nature’s guide\n\nThe most prominent team exploring this concept comprises researchers at the technology giant Google, who this February announced the results of early tests of their AI co-scientist with researchers1 (see also go.nature.com/3hmxuxm). The team has opened up the project to a group of trusted testers as it continues to develop the tool.\n\nGoogle is not alone. A team including computational biologists at Stanford University announced its Virtual Lab system in November last year2 — a version of which Montine was playing with. And a group based at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in China proposed a similar virtual-scientist system, called VirSci, last October3; the researchers are building it now.\n\nRick Stevens, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago and at Argonne National Laboratory, both in Illinois, says that he and other computationally adept researchers are creating their own such systems by setting up AI personas that then interact. “I mean, everybody can do it,” he says.\n\nIn many of these systems, the large language models (LLMs) involved don’t just bounce ideas off each other. They also search the Internet, execute code and interact with other software tools, making them part of ‘agentic AI’, a fuzzy term that refers to LLMs autonomously undertaking tasks, although in practice there is often a lot of human oversight. A group of AI agents can be woven into a larger system that can work on high-level problems for hours without getting distracted or confused, Stevens says.\n\n“It’s not really fundamentally that different than having more colleagues, in some sense,” he says, “except that they don’t get tired, and they’ve been trained on everything.”\n\nTo explore what it’s like to work with a virtual team, Nature asked a few scientists to trial a version of the Stanford system and spoke to some who have used Google’s AI co-scientist. Does a network of chatbots talk like a room full of Nobel prizewinners or undergraduates? Are the ideas they generate nonsensical, boring and trivial, or smart, valuable and insightful?\n\nMultiple personalities\n\nAll co-scientist systems assign roles or personalities to agents and get them to interact, but the details vary. The Virtual Lab, built by computer scientist Kyle Swanson in James Zou’s group at Stanford University and his colleagues, comes with two default characters, both (for now) powered by the LLM GPT-4o from tech firm OpenAI in San Francisco, California. These characters are a principal investigator and a critic — an agent told to provide helpful feedback. The user (or the AI’s principal investigator) can then add as many agents as they like, of any kind, writing in simple descriptions for each agent to guide the characters’ interactions. The user chooses how many turns the agents have to ‘speak’, and a meeting transcript is produced in minutes. The team is working on ways to train the agents on literature that is relevant to the characters’ described expertise (as others have done4), rather than merely telling them to assume specific roles.\n\nThe Google co-scientist, developed by Google Deep Mind’s Alan Karthikesalingam in London and Vivek Natarajan in Mountain View, California, and their colleagues, is an extension of the researchers’ work on AI that is specialized in biomedicine, including the LLM Med-PaLM.\n\nAI scientist ‘team’ joins the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nIn contrast to the Stanford system, the Google tool doesn’t let users assign scientific specialities to agents. Instead, agents have predefined specific functions: idea generation; reflection or critique; evolution of ideas; determining the proximity of ideas to reduce duplication; ranking; and meta-review. These six agents are powered by Google’s LLM Gemini 2.0.\n\nUsers prompt the system with a few sentences, including a goal and a desired format for output. They can choose to add background information, such as relevant papers. The agents collaborate to tackle the problem and search the Internet, then spit out a summary report that can be tens or hundreds of pages long. “The co-scientist is like a smart scientific partner, capable of seeing the obvious and non-obvious connections in a sea of research,” says Natarajan. “We hope to give scientists superpowers.”\n\nLike all LLMs, the models powering these agents sometimes hallucinate, making up text that can be wrong. But having a critic or judge in a multi-agent conversation tends to weed out things that don’t make sense, says Stevens. Besides, he adds, hallucinations can be useful for creative processes such as thinking outside of the box during brainstorming, as long as experts check that the output makes sense.\n\nThere is evidence that the multi-agent strategy improves output, compared with chatting to just one AI agent or bot. For instance, Zou has found that adding a critic to a conversation that used GPT-4o bumped up the model’s performance score by a couple of percentage points on graduate-level science tests, and improved its answers in test cases, including designing radiotherapy treatment plans5.\n\nExclusive: Start-up FutureHouse debuts powerful AI ‘reasoning model’ for science\n\nGoogle tested its AI co-scientist system to see whether human experts preferred its multi-agent answers over content produced by a lone chatbot1. The experts rated the novelty and impact of the ideas generated by the co-scientist system slightly higher than those generated by Gemini 2.0 or OpenAI’s o1.\n\nSome research has even delved into the optimum number of agents and rounds of discussion. Computer scientist Nanqing Dong at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and his colleagues, who are building the VirSci system, say that they see peak creativity with a team of eight agents each taking five turns to converse3. Swanson says that in his experience, adding more than three specialists often just leads to “wasted text”, and more than three rounds of conversation sometimes sends the agents off on a tangent.\n\nBright ideas\n\nStanford University medical researcher Gary Peltz, who often uses AI in his work, was one of the first testers of the Google AI co-scientist. He wanted to use it to find drugs to treat liver fibrosis. Because the AI system was still in development, he sent his query to an intermediary at Google. His prompt read: “Develop hypotheses about the genes and epigenomic changes required for myofibroblast generation in liver fibrosis and indicate what drugs should we test as new treatments for liver fibrosis.” It also included some paragraphs of detailed background information. He got the report back about a day later.\n\nAfter some preliminaries, the report begins “We propose a novel hypothesis…” then works its way to concluding: “This research could have a profound impact on liver fibrosis research and therapeutic advancement.” (See ‘Testing an AI co-scientist’.)\n\nTesting an AI co-scientist\n\nAn extract from the output that Google’s AI co-scientist system provided Gary Peltz.\n\n“Example experiment 1 (score=novelty+details+usefulness+pairwise rank=11):\n\n## Prompt: A Novel Hypothesis Regarding Myofibroblast Generation in Liver Fibrosis\n\nWe propose a novel hypothesis that specific epigenetic alterations contribute to myofibroblast (MyoF) formation in liver fibrosis. Unlike previous approaches that primarily focused on canonical TGFβ1 and PDGF pathways, we hypothesize that changes in the cell’s epigenetic landscape play a critical role in regulating MyoF differentiation and subsequent ECM production.\n\nSpecifically, our hypothesis centers on the following key elements:\n\n*Histone Modifications: We theorize that during fibrogenesis, alterations in histone modifications, particularly deacetylation, in the promoter regions of genes responsible for MyoF differentiation occur. For example, reduced acetylation of Histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) could promote the recruitment of repressive transcriptional machinery, silencing pro-MyoF factors. Alternatively, increased acetylation on certain histones might facilitate the binding of transcription factors that drive MyoF identity.\n\n*DNA Methylation: Our hypothesis also posits that dynamic changes in DNA methylation patterns around genes involved in the MyoF pathway could be crucial. For instance, we predict that demethylation of CpG islands near regulatory elements of pro-MyoF genes might lead to enhanced transcription. Conversely, hypermethylation of the same regions might prevent the binding of critical activators, thereby inhibiting MyoF transition. These two mechanisms, working in concert, could provide a complex regulatory system governing MyoF generation and subsequent ECM deposition impacting liver fibrosis.\n\n## Groundbreaking Experiment to Test the Hypothesis\n\nTo test our hypothesis, we propose an innovative experiment utilizing the human micro-HO system: …”\n\nFull text documented in ref. 6. See the end of this article for Peltz’s input.\n\n“When I read it, I literally fell off my chair,” says Peltz. He had just written a grant proposal focused on the importance of epigenetic changes in liver fibrosis, and the AI had targeted the same theme for its proposed therapeutics.\n\nThe AI co-scientist suggested three drugs, and Peltz came up with two more (all of which are already approved to treat other conditions). Google paid Peltz to help accelerate lab testing, and over the next few months, Peltz’s lab tested all five drugs in its human organoid model. Two of the AI’s three suggestions showed promise for promoting liver regeneration and inhibiting fibrosis6, whereas neither of Peltz’s worked out.\n\nThe experience left him impressed, he says: “These LLMs are what fire was for early human societies.”\n\nOther liver researchers, however, say that the AI’s suggestions for drugs were neither particularly innovative nor profound. “I personally think they are pretty common sense, not much insight really,” says Shuang Wang, who works on liver disease at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Google’s Natarajan counters: “Sometimes things look obvious in hindsight”.\n\nPeltz says he was “particularly struck by the fact that it didn’t prioritize the things that I prioritized”. For the most promising drug in the AI’s candidate list, called vorinostat, he could find only two papers in PubMed that relate to its use in treating liver fibrosis. His choices had many more hits, making them seem like more obvious candidates. He adds that reading the AI report was similar to his discussions with postdocs. “They have a completely different perspective on things than I would,” he says.\n\nStilted conversations\n\nThe code for Stanford’s Virtual Lab is available on the developer platform GitHub, but the team has whipped up a simplified, private web interface for testers who don’t have the computer-science chops to deal with code. This interface differs a little from the full system, says Swanson, but the experience is roughly the same.\n\nIn the paper introducing the Virtual Lab2, an AI team tackled designing biological components that could stick to a particular variant of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In the first of a series of lab meetings mediated by human researchers, the AIs chose to focus on nanobodies (small antibody fragments) and selected four candidates to tweak. The researchers then asked the AI team to pick some existing software tools to redesign those nanobodies, and tasked specific AI agents with writing computer code to assess and rank the results. The process designed 92 nanobodies, of which 2 did indeed bind to the SARS-CoV-2 variant in lab tests.\n\nThe researchers whom Nature asked to try out the Virtual Lab didn’t go as far as to conduct suggested experiments or get their AI teams to write code. But they still found the AI helpful. Montine, for example, says his AI team did a great job of synthesizing the current knowledge (a task that other LLM systems can also handle well) and wrote answers to his grant-application questions with aplomb. “It went further than a postdoc would on a first try of writing a grant, and it only took like 2 minutes,” he says. “And it is a hoot to use.”\n\nCancer-genome researcher Francisco Barriga testing the Virtual Lab system.Credit: Francisco Barriga\n\nAnother tester, cancer-genome researcher Francisco Barriga at the Vall D’Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, describes himself as a biochemist by training and a mouse modeller and genome engineer by choice, with zero coding skills and little experience with AI. He went into the trial hesitantly, suspecting that he would serve as a kind of non-tech-savvy control.\n\nBarriga tasked the Virtual Lab with designing mouse-model experiments to test specific biological compounds, known as type 1 interferons, for their ability to affect tumours or immune cells while using a minimal number of mice — a topic that he knows inside out (see ‘Testing an AI virtual lab’). The AI team suggested exactly what he would have done, Barriga says: it chose “the right models, the right experiments”.\n\nTesting an AI virtual lab\n\nSelections from the AI-generated output that researcher Francisco Barriga got back from the Virtual Lab system he tested.\n\nPrincipal Investigator: “Thank you all for joining this important meeting. Our goal today is to identify the minimal number of distinct type I interferons to test their role in anti-tumor immunity, specifically in the context of lung cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer using C57BL/6 mice. We need to ensure that our experimental design is both scientifically robust and ethically responsible, minimizing the number of mice used while capturing the relevant biology.\n\nTo guide our discussion, here are some initial thoughts and questions:\n\n1. Sequence divergence. Understanding which type I interferons are most sequence-divergent is crucial. This will help us select candidates that are likely to have distinct biological functions. I would like to hear from the Computer Scientist about any bioinformatics analyses or databases that could help us identify these divergent interferons.\n\n2. Role in tumor and immune cells. We need to gather evidence on how these interferons influence tumor progression or immune modulation. The Immunologist and Cancer Biologists can provide insights from the literature and any previous experimental data.\n\n3. Mouse model. Selecting the right mouse model is vital for our experiments. We need to ensure that the model accurately reflects the human condition we are studying. I would like input on whether the C57BL/6 strain is the best choice and if there are any specific considerations we should be aware of.\n\n4. Experimental conditions. Finally, we need to design the experimental conditions. This includes deciding on control groups, treatment groups, and any other variables. I would like the Scientific Critic to help us ensure that our design is rigorous and that we are considering all necessary controls.\n\nLet’s proceed with each team member providing their insights on these points. We’ll start with the Computer Scientist, followed by the Immunologist, Cancer Biologists and, finally, the Scientific Critic. After each round of input, I’ll synthesize information and ask follow-up questions as needed.”\n\nSee the end of this article for Barriga’s input.\n\nStill, Barriga says he feels like something essential is lacking. “It definitely doesn’t feel like humans are behind this.” The AI agents take turns, often ‘speaking’ in numerated lists, and are never rude, interruptive or argumentative. “It’s missing some of those leaps of intuition that you’ll get from a random conversation with some, I don’t know, plant biologist, over a coffee at 3 p.m. in a random hallway.” He could, of course, add a plant biologist — or a quantum physicist, or anyone at all — to his Virtual Lab group, but hasn’t tried that yet.\n\n“Maybe it’s good to bounce ideas off. But will it be a game changer in my day-to-day? I doubt it,” Barriga says. He adds that the system might be something his PhD students could consult: “If they ever run into trouble and I’m too busy, maybe I’m replaceable.”\n\nBroader insights\n\nA third tester approached by Nature, Catherine Brownstein, is a geneticist who works on orphan diseases at Boston Children’s Hospital in Massachusetts, and has more experience with AI tools. She says that she uses LLMs for speed, efficiency and to broaden her thinking. But she cautions that users typically have to be experts so that they can spot errors — in the past, chatbots have sent her on time-consuming wild-goose chases, with incorrect paper summaries forcing her to reread a paper and its references to be sure she hadn’t got things wrong. “You have to kind of know what you’re talking about, otherwise it’s really easy to get completely led astray,” she says.\n\nCatherine Brownstein cautions that research expertise is still needed when using chatbots.Credit: Kevin Ferguson/Boston Children’s Hospital\n\nHowever, when Brownstein used the Virtual Lab to critique a paper she was writing, she was startled — and grateful — when the AI suggested that she ask the patients where they felt the research should go next. This had not occurred to her, although she says it should have. “I was embarrassed,” she says. “I stopped and stared for a full minute, because I was just like, ‘Oh my God. How did I get so far away from my original passion of having patient-focused and -centred research?’”\n\nA simple checklist — or a chat with a friend, chatbot or even a bartender — might have led to the same insight. Yet, she says, none of her colleagues who had read her paper had thought to mention it. “It was actually a very humbling moment.”\n\nStepping sideways",

          "abstract": "The Journal of Public Health in Africa aims to provide a reputable publishing platform that serves the needs of African researchers.Credit: Luke Dray/Getty\n\nWhen Nicaise Ndembi took the helm of the Journal of Public Health in Africa (JPHIA), his goal was to amplify African voices in global health research. Six months after he stepped down as editor-in-chief, researchers are calling for bold changes to make certain that the journal can fulfil its promise.\n\n“We want to ensure that what is being done in Africa is well known by the rest of the world,” says Ndembi, a virologist and deputy director-general of the Kigali-based Africa regional office of the non-profit International Vaccine Institute (IVI). Epidemiologist Nebiyu Dereje at the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) was named the new chief editor of JPHIA earlier in the year.\n\nFirst launched in 2010 as an online peer-reviewed journal, JPHIA was created to offer African researchers a more accessible alternative to international journals, which often come with high fees and high rejection rates. But the journal has struggled to gain traction.\n\nIn the nearly eight years since it became the official journal of the Africa CDC, JPHIA has published just over 450 articles. Researchers say that’s not enough. “There’s a niche group that knows JPHIA well, but many more of us are clueless,” says Nadia Sam-Agudu, one of the journal’s editorial reviewers and a paediatrics researcher at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis, who is originally from Ghana. “We need to do better with advertising the journal so that we can send out work, cite it and then push its impact factor.”\n\nPotential to lead\n\nOne of the most pressing issues is visibility — and that starts with the journal’s website. “To be perceived as reputable and worthy, the journal needs to improve its visual appeal to attract attention,” says Seye Abimbola, a health-systems researcher at the University of Sydney in Australia, and the former editor-in-chief of BMJ Global Health. “Visual presentation is crucial, as people often subconsciously judge a journal’s credibility and quality based on its appearance,” he says.\n\nAbimbola, who helped to elevate BMJ Global Health into a leading voice for the global south, says that JPHIA must take a more proactive approach. That includes commissioning articles on timely topics, inviting influential African thinkers to contribute and actively promoting content to shape public-health conversations across the continent.\n\nJPHIA’s low article-processing charge — around US$120 per page — and need-based subsidies make it more affordable than many international journals. But for early-career researchers, even that can be a stretch. In Nigeria, for example, estimates suggest that university lecturers earn between $300 and $1,200 per month. Although article-publication fees should come out of researchers’ grants or their department’s budget, many African governments and universities cover these fees only rarely.\n\nThere’s a real need for sustainable local publishing options, says Ndembi, adding that most public-health research done in Africa is published in international journals, which do not adequately reflect or address the region’s needs and challenges. “Their publishing charges are expensive, and they do not serve the target African audience,” he says.\n\nThat’s why initiatives such as Open Research Africa — a partnership between the Nairobi-based Science Foundation Africa and UK publisher F1000 that provides a platform for sharing and reuse of African research output — are gaining attention. But JPHIA, with its Africa CDC backing, has the potential to lead.\n\nBuilding more than a journal",

          "abstract": "In December, the UK national fertility regulator — the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) — recommended that the government extend the length of time for which human embryos can be grown in culture from 14 days to 28.\n\nEven though the UK government has not announced any plan to revise its laws in light of this recommendation, the HFEA’s announcement could have global ramifications (see go.nature.com/42j3pzp). As the first statutory body to regulate in vitro fertilization (IVF) and human-embryo research, the UK regulator has long shaped how other countries approach governance in this field.\n\nSince the ‘14-day rule’ was established in 1990, it set a limit that has been widely accepted by scientists, ethicists and policymakers in many countries. It has helped to maintain public trust in embryo research while enabling scientists to investigate the first days of human development — work that is crucial to understanding the origin of some congenital diseases and to design and improve IVF techniques.\n\nGuidelines on lab-grown embryo models are strong enough to meet ethical standards — and will build trust in science\n\nA structure called the primitive streak — a visible indicator that the embryo’s body axes are forming — appears around 14 days after fertilization. Before the primitive streak forms, an embryo can still split to form twins, making it less clearly an individual. For this reason, 14 days or primitive-streak formation — whichever occurs first — was chosen as a pragmatic cut-off point.\n\nHowever, scientific advances mean that it is almost certainly possible to culture embryos beyond 14 days1. By culturing them for up to 28 days, researchers could learn more about crucial subsequent developmental stages and the processes that occur before neurons and sensations arise, such as the start of organ development and the formation of the placenta. A visible indicator — closure of a structure along the embryos back called the neural tube, which goes on to form the central nervous system — marks a clear cut-off point at around 28 days, similar to the primitive streak at day 14.\n\nAlthough some researchers and others have raised concerns that extending the deadline might lead to a slippery slope of further shifts that go beyond ethically defensible boundaries2, this need not happen.\n\nMany scientists and other authorities are reconsidering the 14-day limit3–6. The HFEA’s announcement means that there’s a pressing need to consider how long-standing embryo-research frameworks might be revised in a responsible way.\n\nAs an international group of scientists working in human-embryo research, stem-cell biology and translational research, we have observed the scientific potential and ethical dilemmas of embryo research at first hand. We’re also involved in ongoing dialogue with regulatory bodies. On the basis of these experiences, we propose that the research limit be extended to 28 days or complete neural-tube closure, whichever occurs first — in a similar way to current 14-day policies. We call for a collective effort by scientists, policymakers, ethicists and the wider public to navigate this transition.\n\nWhy 28 days?\n\nThe third and fourth weeks of human development have remained understudied because researchers are not permitted to culture human embryos past day 14, and samples of embryos and materials that have been aborted earlier than day 28 are scarce. Yet, we know from studies in other animals and from rare samples that embryos go through crucial changes in this second two-week period (see ‘An understudied period of growth’).\n\nSource: G. J. Tortora & B. Derrickson Principles Of Anatomy And Physiology 15th edn (Wiley, 2017).\n\nShortly after 14 days, the first tissue layers emerge, laying the groundwork for the embryo’s body plan. By the point of neural-tube closure, the growing human embryo has clear head and tail ends — but has not yet developed neurons, without which there can be no consciousness, pain or other sensory perception.\n\nBy day 28 the heart has started to beat. Buds that will become limbs have formed, but hands and feet will not develop for several more weeks. Other structures have also started to form: the beginnings of the gut; blocks of tissue that will go on to form the skeleton and muscle; and the beginnings of other internal organs.\n\nStudying how and why these first steps of organ formation sometimes go awry could help researchers to understand conditions such as congenital scoliosis (a curved spine), anencephaly (in which parts of the brain and skull are missing) and congenital heart disorders.\n\nWhy researchers should use human embryo models with caution\n\nThe cells that will become sperm or eggs also arise around day 14 and migrate to the nascent gonads during the following weeks. Meanwhile, tissues that support the growing embryo — including the placenta — begin to mature. Analyses of how sperm, eggs and supportive tissues begin to develop could help researchers to pinpoint causes of infertility, pregnancy complications and inherited conditions, paving the way for earlier interventions and better reproductive outcomes.\n\nWhat’s more, extending the 14-day rule could help to maximize the potential of stem-cell-derived embryo models3. These structures, which are designed to mimic all or some stages of embryonic development7, are subject to the 14-day rule in some countries8. The hope is that these models can be used for studies that require many samples — to test how drugs and other chemicals affect development, to conduct genetic screening, to analyse developmental anomalies and to improve engineering methods to grow cells and organs for regenerative medicine. But it’s crucial to know how closely these models mimic actual embryos — an extension of the 14-day rule would allow for better comparison.\n\nIn our view, a limit of 28 days or neural-tube closure would maintain clear boundaries on experimentation.\n\nThere are good reasons to draw the line at 28 days. The closure of the neural tube provides a clear stopping point that makes governance and oversight easier. The availability of aborted material that is donated to research is much higher after 28 days. And, after four weeks, the body plan is largely set. Many individual tissues and organs develop relatively independently after 28 days, and so can be studied using aborted tissue without needing whole embryos.\n\nEthical considerations\n\nNo global consensus exists on when personhood begins. Some people hold that life’s moral worth begins at conception. The 14-day rule never resolved this debate; it was a pragmatic, political compromise.\n\nOthers point to the emergence of human-like features. Milestones that can convey emotional weight, such as the development of a heartbeat, are likely to cause concern. An erosion of a previously sacrosanct boundary might raise slippery-slope concerns about research eventually leading to eugenic practices or ‘designer’ embryos. There might also be concerns about consciousness or sentience, the ability to feel pain or react to environmental stimuli, such as light, sound, temperature or touch. However, current evidence indicates that the neurons needed for these capacities do not develop until an embryo is at least eight to ten weeks old, and might not form functional neuronal circuits until much later9.\n\nAny reforms must therefore be transparent, firmly regulated and based on clear ethical and moral boundaries10. This can help to reassure the public that researchers want to better understand human-embryo development, improve IVF treatments, reduce the number of miscarriages and prevent congenital conditions and diseases — and that they will not use embryos for more-controversial studies.\n\nCollectively, we think that extending the embryo-culture limit to 28 days, or neural-tube closure, would offer the promise of unique scientific and clinical insights. However, any increase must not be merely legislative — it should involve nuanced ethical oversight and careful dialogue with understanding from both sides11.\n\nA human embryo embedded in the wall of the uterus at 11 days after fertilization (left). At 24 days, the heart has just started to beat (right).Credit: Lennart Nilsson, TT/Science Photo Library\n\nScientists have debated whether an extension of the limit should occur in gradual steps6 — allowing scientific and ethical review at several points between 14 and 28 days — or in a single jump. We recommend a single step. In our view, this approach is preferable because it would streamline governance and public engagement, and provide one clear boundary around which all oversight, communication and public dialogue could be structured.\n\nWe imagine the approach would first be rolled out in one or two regions — such as in the United Kingdom under the guidance of the HFEA — and then iteratively adopted by other countries. We urge policymakers and research institutions to take the following steps.\n\nPublic engagement and accountability. Careful consultation with the public, conducted and concluded well before experimental work begins, is essential to try and ease concerns and to help shape guidelines6.\n\nSome previous examples highlight how to aid effective debate. For instance, the HFEA’s dialogue on a specialized form of IVF called mitochondrial replacement therapy showed the value of multiple types of engagement across several locations, with a diverse cross-section of the population (see go.nature.com/43tyg9i).\n\nSimilarly, public engagement related to extending the embryo-culture limit should involve dialogue events (formal discussions between multiple stakeholders)11, forums, citizen panels and surveys. Although these can be conducted by academics or relevant organizations, it is useful to incorporate specialist dialogue organizations that have expertise, but no direct interest in the outcomes. Examples and advice from the United Kingdom can be found through a public-engagement programme called Sciencewise. Researchers, policymakers, ethicists, community leaders and health-care professionals should all be involved in open dialogue with faith communities, patient-advocacy organizations and the broader public. Previous public engagement in Japan12 and in the United Kingdom — around the limits of embryo research and on the use of stem-cell-derived embryo models13 — shows that this approach can foster nuanced debates and minimize the risk of inflaming fears.\n\nScientists should not make assumptions about areas of public concern. Feedback from the public should be used to help shape regulations for any extended embryo cultures. It should prompt adjustments in protocols and help to inform how guidelines are implemented. If strong ethical or societal concerns arise, researchers and regulators must be prepared to modify projects accordingly.\n\nPilot projects. Before adopting new guidelines across a country, a few accredited centres could be licensed to extend the embryo-culture limit. The groups or centres would be chosen by national regulators — in coordination with professional societies and ethics committees — on the basis of established expertise in embryo research, robust ethical oversight committees and transparent track records of compliance.\n\nOnce a group succeeds in culturing an embryo to the point of neural-tube closure or day 28, a comprehensive scientific and ethical review would ensue. Licensing can eventually expand to all suitably regulated centres in a nation, if the review concludes that the data provide clear insights — allowing researchers to map migration of the precursors of sperm and egg cells, for example, or study the beginnings of placental development — and that public trust remains intact.\n\nYes to global standards for research — as long as they are truly global",

          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson, Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "The headquarters of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC.Credit: Radharc Images/Alamy\n\nOne of the most influential scientific societies in the United States is in turmoil. Budget cuts by the administration of President Donald Trump have forced the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) into a wholesale reorganization. At the same time, many members are arguing that academy leaders have gone too far to accommodate the Trump administration — and done too little to defend science.\n\nSince Trump took office in January, his administration has cancelled or suspended tens of millions of dollars’ worth of contracts for advisory reports crafted by academy members and other scientists for sponsors including the US government. Meanwhile, the pipeline of contracts for future reports has largely dried up. These realities have already pushed the academies’ operations and publication branch, the National Research Council (NRC), to pare 50–100 people from its roughly 1,200-person staff, and hundreds more are expected to be laid off.\n\n“We are a target”: scientific society under pressure after Trump DEI crackdown\n\nNASEM members who spoke to Nature acknowledge the challenges facing leaders trying to preserve the institution, but some have accused the NASEM leadership of a lack of transparency, silence in the face of historic attacks on science and even censorship. In the latest example, critics cite internal guidance issued in March suggesting that the NRC will no longer permit research assessments “on topics explicitly related” to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility — principles disfavoured by the Trump administration.\n\nThe upheaval has spurred talk of a no-confidence vote in Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences and chair of the NRC. “What’s the point in preserving the NRC as an organization if it loses its scientific integrity?” asks Charles Manski, an academy member and an economist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nIn an interview with Nature, McNutt sympathized with her critics’ views, but said she is confronted with a “Faustian dilemma” in which challenging the administration, as many members advocate, could bring about the end of the organization, which depends on federal contracts for its existence. “What we are hoping is that sanity will prevail again some time in the future,” she says. “If it does, I’m not sure I want to be in the position where I have put the academy out of business.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMission imperilled\n\nEvery year, the NRC releases about 200 reports on topics ranging from the best pavement materials to the future of high-energy particle physics. These are authored by specialists including NASEM members, who are elected for their contributions to the sciences. US federal agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), commission many NRC studies, which policymakers regard as gold-standard advice. Last year, contracts with federal agencies supplied 59% of the NRC’s roughly $360-million budget.\n\nLast month, the organization announced a plan to consolidate internal divisions and reduce the number of NRC advisory boards, which guide study projects. McNutt says the current expectation is a 15% reduction in budget and staff by the end of August and a 30% reduction by the end of the year.\n\nMost academy members — as well as NRC staff members, who are in danger of being laid off — have been cut out of the process, says Elissa Newport, an academy member and neuroscientist at Georgetown University in Washington DC.\n\nNational Academy of Sciences president Marcia McNutt has drawn criticism from academy members for her response to the Trump administration’s attacks on science.Credit: Yichuan Cao/Sipa USA/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nOn 18 June, Newport sent an e-mail signed by more than a dozen academy members to McNutt and the NRC leadership, calling on them to consult with employees, board members and rank-and-file members about the reorganization. McNutt’s response — that leadership has consulted some members and does not have time to seek broader input — failed to satisfy. “They feel that the timeline requires an urgent process that must be kept confidential, and we strongly disagree with that,” Newport says.\n\nSilenced science\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump banned federal programmes and contracts about diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA). Within a month, biomedical news outlet STAT reported that the academies were removing terms such as ‘health equity’ from reports to placate the administration.\n\nOn 7 March, NASEM acknowledged these concerns in internal guidance documents summarizing institutional policies. One controversial provision clarified that although foreign assistance and climate change remained acceptable topics, despite being on the Trump team’s chopping block, anything explicitly related to DEIA would be prohibited. “It does not matter if the potential sponsor is federal or private,” the document states.\n\nHave Trump’s anti-DEI orders hit private funders? HHMI halts inclusive science programme\n\n“That would be censorship, and that would be the NRC selling its soul,” Manski says. The academy’s critics argue that Trump’s ban focuses on progammes that actively promote diversity and does not prevent the NRC from doing research on equity.\n\nMcNutt concedes the point about censorship, but argues that a new DEI study would probably be the NRC’s last. “I’m completely sympathetic to [critics’] views” about censorship, she says, but “that is exactly what is being imposed on us.”",

          "authors": "William Mills",
          "abstract": "A podcast lets students engage with lecture content while on the go.Credit: Bin Kontan/Getty\n\nSince I began teaching undergraduate biology in 2023, I have been searching for new ways to get students to engage with the content, especially outside class. I’ve tried all the classics: pre-class readings and quizzes; group discussions; sessions in which students work through practice problems; and holding office hours during which they can visit me to ask questions, just to name a few.\n\nMany — maybe most — students are able to comprehend the material through these avenues, but others struggle, often citing time pressures. ‘I didn’t have enough time to study because I had so many exams this week.’ Or ‘I spend so much time commuting to campus that I don’t have enough time to read the textbook’. So I decided to make a podcast to add to the list of available resources.\n\nIt’s not fancy. There’s no catchy theme music, no witty advertisements or even guests. It’s just me talking about biology, audio-only. Despite its simplicity, I think it is a great way for students to engage with the content in my course while they’re taking a run, travelling or driving to and from campus.\n\nWord of mouth\n\nThe idea came to me while I was attending a virtual conference about online teaching. One speaker suggested generating podcasts from assigned readings, using artificial intelligence (AI). The AI part sounded cool, but I worried about it editing or unexpectedly tweaking what I was trying to teach. So I decided to try to record a podcast using my own voice. A few weeks later, having taught myself about the process, I had the first dozen episodes of the Intro Biology Podcast.\n\nAlthough I am certainly not a pro, I have found a few tips and tricks to make creating a podcast rather straightforward, relatively painless and even quite fun.\n\nAs long as you have a computer (or even a smartphone, really), you can make a podcast. Make sure you have some notes to guide the episode (I use my lecture slides), but don’t stress about getting it all in one take. You can always pause the recording and even re-record parts you don’t like.\n\nUse an app such as Voice Memos (on Apple devices), Sound Recorder (for Windows) or Recorder (on Android) to record yourself speaking. Once you’ve finished, give it a quick listen — even if listening to yourself speak makes you cringe — to make sure you haven’t made any mistakes. If you are satisfied, congratulations: you have just recorded your first episode. Now you have to publish it.\n\nTo each their own\n\nAudiences can listen to podcasts on many different platforms: Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Castbox and Audible, to name just a few. When I first considered making a podcast, I was overwhelmed by the prospect of having to distribute my episodes to all these platforms individually.\n\nMy fears were eased when I learnt about RSS feeds, which allow you to post your podcast on a single site that then distributes the episodes to all the different platforms. This saves an enormous amount of time and helps to maintain consistency. Depending on the RSS site you use (I use RSS.com, which offers discounts for educators), you can also gather useful metrics such as which platforms your listeners are using, where those listeners are around the world and which episodes are most popular.\n\nI wasn’t doing anything too fancy, but I did want a logo that was visually appealing and looked professional enough to motivate potential listeners to click on my show. Not having any artistic skills of my own, I turned to an AI image generator. With a little tinkering, I was able to use the colour scheme from the logo to create the cover art for each episode.\n\nThis brings me to another tip: use broad, descriptive episode titles. The content I discuss in my podcast follows the progression of content in my course, but I wanted the episodes to be accessible to other audiences. So, rather than naming the episodes with a lecture date or the textbook chapter number, I gave them names based on the topic I was discussing, such as ‘Cells and Organelles’, ‘Enzymes’ and ‘Cellular Respiration’.\n\nGlobal reach\n\nIn the six months since I published the first episode, the Intro Biology Podcast has been downloaded more than 4,100 times in 650 cities across 85 countries, all without any real advertisement apart from a single LinkedIn post. Because of the analytics I get from RSS.com, I can see that the city where my institution is located is among those with the most downloads, but the resource is being used by learners all over the world.",

The grant that was set to cover her for another year of research into the spread of breast cancer, as well as teaching students, has been prematurely terminated and will end on 31 July this year instead of in July 2026.\n\nNikki Rodgers joined the unionization effort after her grant funding was terminated.Credit: University of Michigan Photography\n\nAfter learning about this, “I went straight home and cried most of the night”, she says.\n\nHer predicament and concern for other researchers motivated Rodgers to sign up to the unionization effort. “A union could be a way to collectively come to the table and say we need to have more protection where we’re not just relying on one faculty member to support our stay,” she says.\n\nRodgers’ principal investigator told her that his group had applied for bridge funding to cover her until January 2026, but nothing had been finalized. With his encouragement, she looked for another job and has secured contract work as a technical writer in biology.\n\nPower to the people!\n\nThe unionization effort at Michigan is part of a growing movement across the United States.\n\nAccording to a March 2025 study1 in the Journal of Collective Bargaining in the Academy, seven new postdoctoral ‘bargaining units’ were created in the United States in 2024, representing 7,668 employees — an increase of 67% in terms of total covered workers. Furthermore, 15 new graduate-student bargaining units were created, adding 11,724 graduate students to union rolls.\n\nGeiser and other organizers at the University of Michigan will be fighting for many of the bread-and-butter issues championed by other postdoctoral and graduate student unions: better pay, health benefits, job security and greater protections for international scholars. According to the university’s Postdoctoral Association, more than half of Michigan postdocs in 2022 were international students.\n\nAnother signatory to the petition — an international postdoc at the University of Michigan who focuses on diversity, equity and inclusion and requested anonymity to speak freely — says they fear the government could terminate their research and revoke their visa at any moment.",

          "abstract": "International students reacted positively when the University of Tartu introduced compulsory Estonian-language courses for English-language master’s programmes — in contrast to the situation in Norway and the Netherlands.Credit: Alexander Farnsworth/Getty\n\nTwo decades ago, European universities were racing to internationalize. The Bologna Process, launched in 1999 to standardize and improve the quality of higher education in Europe, promised seamless student mobility across borders. At the same time, governments actively recruited foreign talent to boost research competitiveness. English-taught programmes proliferated, and international-student numbers soared.\n\nToday, that consensus has fractured. Across Europe, the policies that were once celebrated as essential for university competitiveness are now under attack. In Norway, fears that English was pushing out Norwegian in some academic departments led to stricter language requirements for research staff last year. And in the Netherlands, courses taught in English are being restricted and regulated.\n\nThis shift reflects deeper changes in European politics, with nationalist far-right parties gaining ground and entering parliaments in nearly every European Union country over the past decade. Not all those who oppose internationalization in higher education are motivated by nationalist ideology, but the practice is increasingly colliding with immigration policies, says Vassiliki Papatsiba, a higher-education policy specialist at Cardiff University, UK. “Universities find themselves caught between these pressures, trying to maintain international openness and competitiveness while responding to domestic political concerns.”\n\nDutch reforms spark academic pushback\n\nConsider the Netherlands. In 2024, the Dutch government proposed the Internationalisation in Balance bill, requiring that Dutch be the default language for teaching in bachelor’s programmes. The policy emerged from a coalition government led by the right-wing populist Party for Freedom (PVV), and drew strong criticism from the academic sector, which was already reeling from large budget cuts the year before.\n\nThe government’s stated reasons for cutting back on programmes taught in English were to address housing shortages in university cities by reducing international-student numbers; to ensure accessibility for Dutch students; and to safeguard public investment in higher education by focusing on domestic students, who were viewed as more likely to stay and work in the country.\n\nBut Eddie Brummelman, chair of the Young Academy, part of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, says that whatever the validity of those concerns, “the extent to which internationalization causes or contributes to these problems is often exaggerated, conflated with other issues or unsupported by facts”. The bill has caused international staff and students to feel “ostracized, ridiculed and scapegoated”, he says, and is causing both Dutch and international staff to consider leaving the country. “They don’t want to work in an environment that goes against internationalization, which is so vital for well-functioning academia.”\n\nBrummelman’s organization also slammed a proposal to end English-taught bachelor’s degrees in psychology at five universities. This had been made in April by Universities Netherlands, the umbrella body for the country’s 14 research universities. In a 27 May statement, Brummelman’s Young Academy called the package “a harmful act of anticipatory obedience”, saying it would legitimize the negative narrative around English-language programmes.\n\nOn the same day, partial relief came when the Dutch House of Representatives passed a motion that removes one of the most damaging elements of the Internationalisation in Balance bill: a mandatory assessment of all English-taught bachelor’s courses that would have forced them to be taught in Dutch unless a strong justification for another language could be made. The collapse of the Dutch government on 3 June, prompted by the withdrawal of the PVV from the interim government, further adds to the uncertainty.\n\n“There’s a genuine case to be made for preserving or promoting Dutch as an academic language,” Brummelman says, “but that should never come at the cost of internationalization.”\n\nNorway reverses course after outcry\n\nNorway has faced a similar reckoning. In August 2024, the country implemented a law requiring all international PhD students and postdocs to complete a Norwegian language course equivalent to three months of part-time study, and tightening language requirements for permanent staff. The measure was introduced in 2023 by a coalition government that also brought in tuition fees for non-European students. Supporters of the policy said it would protect Norwegian as a language of scholarship.\n\nBut the backlash was immediate. Prominent scientists, including Nobel-prizewinning neuroscientist Edvard Moser, warned that the requirement would deter international researchers. The PhD and postdoc proposal was especially unpopular, given the numbers involved: in 2022, for example, 44% of PhD candidates and 74% of postdoctoral fellows at Norwegian institutions came from abroad. A legal challenge, filed in December 2024, argued that the policy violated European Economic Area labour laws.\n\nThe political winds shifted again in early 2025, when Norway’s EU-sceptic Centre Party, which was behind the language drive, left the government over disagreements with its coalition partners about energy policy. As part of that shift, the minister of research from the Centre Party quit. His successor, the Labour Party’s Sigrun Aasland, announced plans to reverse the language requirement for PhDs and postdocs, a move researchers hailed as a victory for international science. It remains unclear whether related rules for permanent academic staff — such as the requirement to reach a high level of Norwegian proficiency in three years — will also be revoked.\n\nNorwegian university leaders have since been advocating a “new deal” on internationalization to rebuild the country’s global competitiveness. Norway’s experience “demonstrates how language requirements and other things like fees can become powerful instruments in broader debates about national identity and international engagement in higher education”, Papatsiba says.\n\nExternal pressures breed resistance\n\nEstonia offers a contrasting example of how European universities can navigate internationalization pressures without major political controversy.\n\nThe Baltic state’s push for higher-education internationalization took root under a liberal government in the early 2010s, spurred by reforms around 2013 that introduced free Estonian-language tuition but encouraged expansion of English-taught programmes to diversify funding. This led to a nearly fivefold increase in international enrolment, from 2.3% in 2011 to approximately 12.2% in 2019.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has depressed those numbers slightly, as has the war in Ukraine: since the start of the hostilities, Russian students have no longer been accepted for bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Estonian universities, contributing to a 17% drop in foreign students from 2022 to 2024. Nevertheless, English-language teaching remains popular. In a few departments at the University of Tartu, the country’s oldest and largest, almost half the staff members are English-speaking.\n\nEstonia’s internationalization journey could have created conflicts similar to those in the Netherlands and Norway, says Aune Valk, vice-rector of the University of Tartu. Before COVID-19, she says, two-thirds of students did not pay tuition fees, and politicians questioned whether the money spent on subsidizing international students should be redirected to other things, especially given that universities were asking for more money .\n\nThe large numbers of international academic staff have also caused some internal debate in Estonian universities, Valk says. Having lots of foreign staff increases the teaching burden on Estonian-speakers, because any course offered in English must also be offered in Estonian. Although this means that English speakers might have more time for research, Valk says that “quite a big part of your staff is not heard”, because administration and outreach happen mostly in Estonian.",

The results of the survey were presented at a press conference on 16 June.\n\n“The data clearly show that changing one’s surname can cause significant disadvantages,” says Misa Shimuta, a neuroscience researcher at the Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo, who was involved in the survey.\n\nEarlier this year, Japan’s main opposition party put forward a bill proposing that married couples be allowed to retain their own family names after marriage. A proposal to change the rule, which has been in place for more than a century, was debated in the National Diet — Japan’s legislative body — last month, but a decision has been pushed to later in the year. In practice, the current rule mainly affects women — 95% of married women in Japan legally change their name to their husband’s.\n\nResearcher survey\n\nIn response to the proposal to change the rule and other lobbying efforts, the Japan Inter-Society Liaison Association Committee for Promoting Equal Participation of Men and Women in Science and Engineering (an association representing about 100 academic societies working on gender equality) surveyed academics to try to understand how the current law affects them, says Noriko Sato, a forest-policy researcher at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, who led the survey.\n\nThe team collected responses from 7,582 academics, of whom roughly one-third were women, between April and May. Just over 5% of the 3,810 married men who responded had changed their name after marriage, but more than 90% of the 1,506 married women had changed their name. Of those who had changed their name, more than 70% continued to use their original name at work, a practice that has become increasingly popular.\n\nOf those who used their original family name at work, 78% said that even doing that caused issues.\n\nPersonal experience\n\nKyoko Ohno-Matsui, an ophthalmologist at the Institute of Science Tokyo, was born Matsui and married an Ohno, and uses the double-barrelled name in her professional life. “I didn’t want to change my surname,” she says.

The funding was provided by the NSF, and supported professional development activities for emerging leaders in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. LSAMP is just one such programme; many more are on the chopping block.\n\nHow Trump is following Project 2025’s radical roadmap to defund science\n\nSome states, including my home state of California, are being specifically targeted for large-scale funding cancellations, so things are escalating quickly. For example, a few weeks ago, the news outlet Politico reported that the federal government was considering cutting education and research funds for California, thanks to a continuing feud over immigration.\n\nIn total, billions of dollars’ worth of grants are being terminated. One colleague working for the US Agency for International Development has had their position ended. Another worked at the NIH as an adviser on health disparities and has also lost their job. Many of my colleagues at universities in California have had their grants wrapped up early, especially those who focus on health disparities and DEI. As a result, they have had to look elsewhere for financial support.\n\nBrandon and his family have planted fruit trees, and he hopes that selling their produce could provide him with a secondary source of income should he lose his grant funding.Credit: Brandon Brown\n\nThe grant funding I receive from various sources covers part of my salary, which is guaranteed by the state because of my tenured position. But many states, including Hawaii, Texas and Ohio, are now considering bans and limits on tenure. If this were to happen in California, I would be particularly at risk given that my work focuses on health-disparity topics that are being targeted for cancellation: HIV, global research ethics and supporting emerging faculty members who are conducting research into the challenges faced by ageing adults in minority groups.\n\nIt would be naive to think that this won’t affect the job market: I expect many researchers to lose their salaries, jobs and health-care insurance as grants and funding dry up. This is already starting to happen. Frankly, it’s time for many scientists to start thinking about a career change, or at least how they might diversify their income streams to protect themselves against a loss of funding or a period of unemployment.\n\nMany think that the current challenges will be reversed after a few years, but that is a long time to be without an income. And even if most scientists were able or willing to move abroad, it’s unlikely that there would be enough overseas funding to make up for cuts to science here in the United States.\n\nOne way to protect against these cuts might be to develop other streams of income while still pursuing a scientific career. Each of us has things we are good at apart outside scientific area of expertise. For example, my family and I have planted fruit trees and grown tomato plants, and we keep chickens that lay eggs, and my network allows me to sell those products. Other colleagues are generating cash from pet sitting and copyediting, working as a paid nanny or a personal chef, picking up paid teaching opportunities in schools and consulting for community-based organizations.",

More than that — I need to get the hell off this stinking rock. I’m sick of the grind of the production lines, sick of life here.\n\nI settle and stare at the adverts. They pop up fast: a new mushroom liqueur, a restaurant on Deck Seven I’ve sworn never to visit again, a four-year trip across the Solar System on a ship called The Rambler.\n\nThat one, it stirs a yearning in me.\n\nA person behind me starts talking, the softness of her voice unable to mask its authority. “You’re eyeing what they threw on the wall.”\n\nI don’t recognize her, and I thought I knew every one of the colony’s 2,000 inhabitants. She’s older, with a sharpness to her features, and her eyes have a piercing quality, like she can see right through any bullshit— can see right through my bullshit.\n\n“You’re probably thinking, ‘Yeah, why not see everything the Solar System has to offer? I deserve it.’ And you know what? You do.”\n\nShe knocks her drink down, the expensive rye that most people take with syrup and water, but she’s having it straight, which I can’t help but admire. She motions the barbot for another and sends one of what I’m drinking my way. I turn my chair to face her.\n\nShe ticks off the attractions like she wrote the advert herself. “Diving into Jupiter’s storms. Touching down on a Venusian platform. Spelunking in Enceladus’ ice caves. Marvelling at Europa’s oceans. Visiting that cloistered artist colony hiding in Mercury’s shadow. Breathing the unique scents of Ceres’ ag domes. And the crown jewel: a fly-by of our home planet, Mother Earth — but only a glance, because they won’t let any of us down any more.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nShe spins her cup on the table, metal dancing on metal, and my heart races as I want to respond yes, yes, a thousand times yes, I want off this pitiful little rock to see all that and more.\n\n“So much in the system that isn’t on this out-of-the-way colony bouncing around the Belt, the hub of a thousand mining operations. So much out there,” she waves her hand, “calling to be seen, heard, felt. Maybe you’ve got a bit saved up. You’re young enough to make anything work.”\n\n“You a recruiter?”\n\nShe shakes her head. “I made that run four times, two as captain. You can believe they deliver. Every stop, every site — awesome in the truest sense. But what do you think, of everyone I ferried around, how many came away changed for the better by the trip’s end?”\n\nShe sips her drink, I sip mine, the burn of low-grade rum stinging my throat. “Half?” I offer, thinking it generous, but not by much.\n\nShe smiles, this captain of a Star Liner. “Not even one in a hundred. They return from each site, checking off an item on their list. And in between, people are who they are. By trip’s end, they’re tired and cranky and desperate to get away from each other. There’s no real enlightenment at seeing the System, no more than what you can find here.”\n\nI sit up and lean towards her and, in a half-pleading voice, say, “Something in you must have changed?”\n\n“Not from the sites. I tell you, this colony is as good as it gets. Your gardens and societies. Lot of trade and people and ideas come through this corner of the system, for those who can see.”\n\n“You must not be from here,” I say, too quickly; a joke I’ve used before.",

We consider this a direct targeting of Israeli science and the global enterprise of science that benefits humanity.\n\nAlthough, thankfully, there were no human casualties on campus, more than 50 Weizmann research laboratories, led by world-class scientists doing cutting-edge science, were destroyed either by direct hits or shock waves. The strikes came close to the homes of many scientists and students who live on campus.\n\nNews changes quickly in this part of the world, but as I write these words, I can express gratitude for the ceasefire and hope that it is adhered to.\n\nEscalating Israel–Iran conflict damages science labs\n\nLet me be clear: our institute shares values with many Iranians, including those Iranian scientists living outside Iran with whom we collaborate on live-saving and life-sustaining research. I look forward to the day when Israeli scientists can freely collaborate with scientists in Iran and do good for the region and for humanity. I wish the same for scientists in Gaza and throughout the Middle East.\n\nThis blow comes after 20 months of war in Gaza and southern Lebanon, following the attacks of 7 October 2023 on Israel by Hamas. We continue to grieve the loss of life on both sides. We remain deeply distressed by the ongoing war in Gaza, the hostage crisis and the Palestinian humanitarian crisis.\n\nOver the course of history and the many wars in our region, science has endured. We at Weizmann are facing challenges head-on and continuing in our mission as we always have: by advancing science that protects and sustains life, and doing so through international collaboration with colleagues regardless of their identity or nationality.\n\nThe value of science\n\nScience can take on issues that know no geographical borders. At Weizmann alone, life scientists’ discoveries have led to medications for cancer, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases, as well as diagnostic methods such as amniocentesis: a prenatal test to check for genetic or chromosomal conditions in a fetus. Our microbiologists are engaged in solving the urgent problem of antibiotic resistance. And our plant scientists have found ways to engineer crops for improved nutrition and resilience to pests. Other breakthroughs are happening at other Israeli institutions every day, with positive effects worldwide.\n\nDid the US wipe out Iran’s nuclear programme? What researchers know\n\nDespite Israel’s small geographical size and population, the nation has achieved great success in science and technology as a result of its winning combination of academic freedom, curiosity and scientific literacy.\n\nEven as Weizmann recovers from the most difficult moment in its history, I feel strongly that we can be on the starting line of a new era for the region — one in which borders open up and Weizmann and other Israeli institutions can engage with colleagues throughout the Middle East. Our desire is to establish more partnerships with more countries in Middle East and Gulf states, as we did in 2020, when we established a formal collaboration with Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.",

          "abstract": "US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr (centre) has questioned the integrity of some top medical journals.Credit: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty\n\nUpdate: On 2 July, one US government agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the National Institutes of Health (NIH), appeared to walk back its earlier statement to Nature’s news team saying that it was cancelling contracts to Springer Nature. Now the HHS says: “Science journals are ripping the American people off with exorbitant access fees and extra charges to publish research openly. HHS is working to develop policies that conserve taxpayer dollars and get Americans a better deal. In the meantime, NIH scientists have continued access to all scientific journals.”\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has cut some government agencies’ subscriptions to journals at Nature’s publisher, Springer Nature. And at least three government agencies say they are terminating all their contracts with the company.\n\n‘Totally broken’: how Trump 2.0 has paralysed work at US science agencies\n\nThe move comes amid criticisms of leading academic journals by high-ranking Trump officials, and will mean that staff members at the affected agencies will no longer be able to easily access the company’s more than 3,000 journals, including the flagship title Nature. (The Nature news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)\n\nAlthough it’s unclear precisely how many contracts the Trump administration is terminating, the government-spending database USASpending.gov shows that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US Department of Energy (DoE) cut US$3 million in contracts with the company this month. A spokesperson for the USDA told Nature’s news team that it had “cancelled all contracts and subscriptions to Springer Nature. The journal [sic] is exorbitantly expensive and is not a good use of taxpayer funds”. The DoE says that it is now cancelling the remainder of its contract with the company. And NASA confirmed that it is cancelling its subscriptions.\n\nWhen the news team reached out to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) — the world’s largest funder of biomedical science — asking whether its subscriptions were still intact, a spokesperson initially said they were and that use of these resources helps staff members to “promote transparency and replicability in research”.\n\nHours later, Andrew Nixon, the top spokesperson for the NIH’s parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said: “All contracts with Springer Nature are terminated or no longer active. Precious taxpayer dollars should be [sic] not be used on unused subscriptions to junk science.”\n\nNIH-funded science must now be free to read instantly: what you should know\n\nThe HHS did not answer Nature’s follow-up queries about whether it intended to cut contracts with other large academic publishers, whether this move would prevent government scientists from publishing in journals that charge article-processing fees and whether it could provide examples of “junk science” published by Springer Nature.\n\nA Springer Nature spokesperson said in a statement that the company “continues to have good relationships with U.S. federal agencies” and that it doesn’t comment on individual contracts. “Across our U.S. business there is no material change to our customers or their spend,” they added. So far, the USASpending.gov database shows no terminations for the NIH, the HHS or NASA. In total, the database shows that seven government agencies have contracts designed to pay more than $20 million to Springer Nature this year.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Nature’s queries. The US National Science Foundation, one of the world’s biggest funders of basic research, told Nature’s news team that its subscriptions with Springer Nature remain active and declined to comment further.\n\n“When they say, ‘junk science’, it’s not clear what they mean,” says Ivan Oransky, a specialist in academic publishing and co-founder of the media organization Retraction Watch. Given the lack of details justifying the cuts, and the fact that several of Springer Nature’s journals are considered prestigious, Oransky says, “I’m having a hard time taking at face value that this is not political”. It would be unprecedented for a prominent subscriber to make a “sweeping move like this for political reasons”, he adds.\n\nJournals under fire\n\nLate last month, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr called leading medical journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, “corrupt”, suggesting that they have ties to pharmaceutical companies, and he threatened to bar government scientists from publishing in them.

          "abstract": "At many leading study destinations in Western countries, the climate for international students is cooling. In the United Kingdom, most students are now barred from bringing family members. Canada has enforced a cap on study permits, restricted work eligibility after graduation and doubled the financial threshold for students to prove self-sufficiency. In the United States, border officials have been empowered to revoke student visas on national-security grounds, and proposed budget cuts would slash funding for exchange programmes by 90%.\n\nAs someone who was once a foreign student and who now researches how higher education can drive social and civic transformation, I worry that this shift in attitude will have consequences far beyond university campuses.\n\nUS academics: look after foreign students\n\nInternational students are not simply add-ons to national research systems; they help to drive them. They expand the intellectual terrain of universities, challenge familiar assumptions and enrich the learning of their domestic peers. In a survey by the UK government, 76% of students said that having international classmates helped to broaden their outlook, and 85% said it meant they felt better prepared for a global workplace (see go.nature.com/4lxzdng).\n\nWhen laboratories welcome the rest of the world, innovation multiplies. Economists have shown that a 10% increase in international graduate-student enrolment at US universities is associated with a 4.5% rise in patent applications and a 6.8% rise in university patent grants1 — gains not matched by domestic growth. A 2024 study that examined US start-up firms founded between 1999 and 2020 revealed that increasing the share of foreign master’s students in a cohort by ten percentage points yielded around 0.4 extra start-ups, nearly half of which were co-founded with classmates born in the United States2.\n\nMoreover, host nations gain diplomatic links. In the 2024 Soft-Power Index — an annual analysis of the number of serving world leaders who went to university abroad — 70 current heads of state or government had been educated in the United States and 58 in the United Kingdom (see go.nature.com/4nsrzha).\n\nUS researchers must stand up to protect freedoms, not just funding\n\nAnd countries that send their students abroad benefit, too. Graduates bring back not only skills and knowledge, but also fresh ways of thinking, organizing and acting, with consequences for policy, civic participation and public welfare. A 2024 study3 of 43 low- and middle-income countries found that, over 15 years, high student mobility correlated with decreases in poverty: a gradual but enduring effect.\n\nReturning graduates educated in democratic countries are also likely to promote democratic changes at home. An analysis of US-hosted exchange programmes linked people’s experience of US civic life to measurable gains in civil liberties and human-rights practices in home nations4.",

It is just the third interstellar object ever spotted, although many others have probably gone by unnoticed.\n\nThe object gained an official name, C/2025 N1 or 3I/ATLAS, on Wednesday. Moving at a record-setting speed for an interstellar visitor, it is travelling along a curve but not in a closed loop – confirmation of its origins outside the Solar System. It will zoom past our Sun without being captured by its gravity.\n\nThe vast majority of comets and asteroids detected within our own Solar System also originated there. Only two other objects — ‘Oumuamua (1I), spotted in 2017, and Comet 2I/Borisov, seen in 2019 — have been acknowledged as interstellar in origin, meaning they travelled to our Solar System from another. The new object, 3I/ATLAS, is going far faster than those two and might be much older.\n\n“This is fabulous,” says astronomer Michele Bannister at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. “Working on 1I and 2I were transformational opportunities,” she says, and she expects 3I to be the same.\n\n3I/ATLAS is currently just inside Jupiter’s orbit and is heading towards our Sun. It is expected to zoom through the inner Solar System in October, at a speed of about 68 kilometres per second. A few researchers have seen a tail, hinting that it is venting gas and dust like a comet, rather than behaving like a rocky asteroid, according to the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center.\n\nCaught on camera\n\nThe object was first spotted on 1 July by a telescope in Chile that is part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), a NASA-funded project based at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. This system automatically flags potentially interesting objects in the sky for human review. On average, the team reports about one object a day to the Minor Planet Center for follow-up by other astronomers. When ATLAS co-manager Larry Denneau, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii, clicked the button to submit this particular result, he says “it looked completely garden variety”.\n\nHow two intruders from interstellar space are upending astronomy\n\nBut other astronomers quickly discovered how special it is. They combed through new and archived data from a range of instruments to find more images of the same speck, including some from days or weeks beforehand. These were used to calculate the object’s trajectory, which revealed that 3I/ATLAS is on a very wide, open hyperbolic path, rather than orbiting our Sun in a closed ellipse, confirming that it is an interstellar object not tied to the gravity of any star.\n\n“At that point it really hits you, that this little button push you did the night before has created this frenzy, and you have hundreds of astronomers and millions of interested people paying attention to it,” says Denneau.\n\nCloser look\n\nResearchers worldwide will now be turning their telescopes to 3I/ATLAS. It will be visible to observatories on Earth and in space long enough to get information on its composition, size, shape, and how it changes as it is heated by the Sun, all of which “will tell us about what conditions were like in the protoplanetary disk where it formed”, says Bannister.",

Nature’s guide\n\nThe researchers who developed the system, called Centaur, fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) using a massive set of data from 160 psychology experiments, in which 60,000 people made more than 10 million choices across many tasks.\n\nMost computer models and cognitive theories stick to a single task. For instance, Google Deepmind’s AlphaGo can only play the strategy game Go, and prospect theory can only predict how a person will choose between potential losses and gains. Centaur, by contrast, can simulate human behaviour across a spectrum of tasks — including gambling, memory games and problem-solving. During testing, it was even able to predict people’s choices in tasks it had not been trained on. The development of Centaur is described in a paper published today in Nature1.\n\nThe team that created the system thinks that it could one day become a valuable tool in cognitive science. “You can basically run experimental sessions in silico instead of running them on actual human participants,” says study co-author Marcel Binz, a cognitive scientist at the Helmholtz Institute for Human-Centered AI in Munich, Germany. That could be useful when conventional studies would be too slow, he says, or when it’s difficult to recruit children or people with psychiatric conditions.\n\n“Building theories in cognitive science is very difficult,” says Giosuè Baggio, a psycholinguist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. “It’s exciting to see what we can come up with with help from machines.”\n\nStiff competition\n\nScientists have long struggled with using task-specific models to simulate broad aspects of human behaviour because the tools cannot generalize to a multitude of tasks.\n\nAI race in 2025 is tighter than ever before\n\nBinz and his colleagues wanted to overcome this limitation. They spent five days fine-tuning Llama — an LLM released by the technology firm Meta in Menlo Park, California — with a huge behavioural data set called ‘Psych 101’.\n\nThe researchers tuned the model to predict not just an average behaviour for a given task, but the range of typical behaviours in the population. They then tested how well it predicted the behaviour of participants who were not included in the training data set. In all but 1 of 32 tasks, Centaur outperformed Llama and 14 cognitive and statistical models in predicting what choices participants would make. That one outlier was a task in which participants judged whether sentences were grammatically correct.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial-intelligence tools are increasingly widely available.Credit: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nAround one in seven biomedical-research abstracts published last year was probably written with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), according to a massive analysis1 of the scholarly literature. More than 200,000 abstracts out of 1.5 million indexed in PubMed in 2024 contained words commonly suggested by large language models (LLMs).\n\nThe study was posted online as a preprint2 in June 2024, when it estimated that one in nine abstracts were written with AI assistance in the first half of last year. The updated analysis is published in Science Advances today1.\n\n“The total number of LLM-edited papers has continued to rise inexorably,” says Andrew Gray, a bibliometrics support officer at University College London. He thinks researchers haven’t fully grasped the scale on which these tools are being used to produce scholarly work. “Hopefully, this paper will help drive some attention to the problem,” he adds.\n\nExcess words\n\nMany groups are trying to assess the impact of LLMs on scholarly output, but it is tricky because most users don’t disclose these practices. Efforts typically train models to identify differences between human-generated and LLM-generated text, and then apply those insights to assess the literature. But it is not clear how such models distinguish between the two types of text, and training data sets don’t always represent up-to-date trends in LLM-generated writing.\n\nDmitry Kobak, a data scientist at the University of Tübingen in Germany, and his colleagues took a more open-ended approach. They searched abstracts for ‘excess words’ that started to appear more often than expected after November 2022, when ChatGPT became widely available. The team was inspired by work estimating ‘excess deaths’ during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe researchers found that 454 words appeared much more often in 2024 than in any other year since 2010. They were mostly ‘style’ words unrelated to the content of the research, and tended to be verbs and adjectives. Some were common — such as ‘findings’, ‘crucial’ and ‘potential’ — whereas others were more unusual, including ‘delves’ and ‘showcasing’. Excess words that emerged in the second half of 2024 include ‘heighten’ and ‘hinder’, as well as superlatives such as ‘unparalleled’ and ‘invaluable’, says Kobak.\n\nShifts in the scientific lexicon happen over time — including drastic changes that accompany major events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2020. There were 190 excess words in 2021, and they tended to be nouns related to the content of the research, such as ‘mask’. But the lexical shift that has occurred since LLMs became popular has been even more pronounced, and mainly stylistic.\n\nGeographic differences",

Press (2025)\n\nIn horror fiction — which fascinates science writer Mindy Weisberger — a zombie is a human ghost or spirit “somewhere between living and dead, puppeted by external forces”. Her intriguing book, by contrast, explores real zombies in the natural world: organisms that lose control to exploitative parasites. For example, a tropical wasp can stab a cockroach in its brain with chemicals, paralysing it. It is then pulled placidly to a place of burial, where it is eaten alive by the wasp’s young. Humans might also be susceptible to ‘zombie bugs’.\n\nTarget Earth\n\nGovert Schilling MIT Press (2025)\n\nIf Earth had not been the “target of cosmic rubble”, life “would probably never have begun”, says this small, scintillating book on meteorites, asteroids and comets by amateur astronomer Govert Schilling — who has a meteorite named after him. The extinction of the dinosaurs and many other life forms 66 million years ago, he says, cleared the ground for primate evolution. Asteroids probably provided Earth with water and organic molecules, and a giant cosmic collision created the Moon, which stabilized Earth’s axis.\n\nMaya Wisdom and the Survival of Our Planet\n\nLisa J.

          "abstract": "China has medical infrastructure and large population to test the efficacy of brain implants.Credit: Chen Zhonghao/Xinhua/Alamy\n\nA deep brain device that allowed a man with no limbs to play computer games is one of an increasing number of brain–computer interfaces (BCI) being trialled in people in China.\n\nThe BCI system, developed by medical-technology company StairMed in Shanghai, China, is similar to the implants being trialled in people by Neuralink, owned by Elon Musk, based in Fremont, California. StairMed’s device has fewer probes than Neuralink’s device has, but is smaller and less invasive.\n\nCompared with the United States, China doesn’t have the long history in the field, and many of the devices being trialled there are simplified versions of those developed by US companies, say researchers. But “BCI research in China is developing very fast”, says Zhengwu Liu, an electrical engineer at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nResearchers in China are advancing the field on several fronts, such as by improving algorithms used to decode neural data and the implantation devices, says Christian Herff, a neural engineer at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, who co-organized a meeting on BCI in Shanghai last year.\n\nThe Chinese government has identified brain–computer systems as a priority area of innovation, and funding agencies are pouring money into the field. “A lot of young scientists are involved in this new wave of BCI,” in China, and have industry ties, says Yuanning Li, a computational neuroscientist at ShanghaiTech University.\n\nThe country also has the medical infrastructure and population to test and validate technologies, says Li. “Progress made here can benefit patients and researchers worldwide,” he says.\n\nSeveral teams have announced initial results for early-stage trials, but none of these have been peer reviewed.\n\nOn the surface\n\nOne brain–computer device being trialled in people is a minimally invasive, wireless device called NEO, which can restore hand movement in a person with paralysis using a pneumatic glove. Eight probes are placed on the dura matter, the outer membrane surrounding the brain2.\n\nThe first person to receive the device, in October 2023, was able to strengthen and speed up their grip, and now, after living with the device for 20 months, can use it to eat and drink, says Hong Bo, a biomedical engineer at Tsinghua University in Beijing, who is co-leading the trial. Hong says that, so far, 20 individuals have received the NEO implant.\n\nBecause the technology collects information about a large population of cells, its signal resolution is not as strong as deeper probes that record the activity of individual neurons, says Zhengtuo Zhao, a neuroengineer at the Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai. This makes the approach more appropriate for controlling simple movements, he says. But Hong says the tradeoff in performance is that the device is minimally invasiveness and can run for a long time.\n\nThe NEO team has collaborated with Liu and his colleague Jianshi Tang, an electrical engineer at Tsinghua University. In a Nature Electronics paper in February1, they described the use of efficient neuromorphic chips, instead of conventional silicon chips, to mimic how the brain decodes brain signals. This would allow them to integrate the chip in the probe itself and make the device smaller, less power-hungry and quicker to process information.\n\nSpeaking Mandarin\n\nAnother team has dug slightly deeper into the brain. In July 2024, neurosurgeons in Shanghai implanted a device with 256 probes on top of the neural cortex of a woman with epilepsy. After two weeks of practice, she could use the device, designed by Shanghai-based BCI company NeuroXess, to use social-media applications and control a wheelchair.\n\nLast December, the team surgically implanted probes into a woman with epilepsy who had a tumour in a part of her brain that processes language. The recipient used the device to communicate in Mandarin at a rate of 50 words per minute with a 100-millisecond delay — the first time that a BCI technology has been used to decode Mandarin in real time, says Tiger Tao, co-founder and chief scientist of NeuroXess. An average person can speak at a rate of 150 words a minute, so “there’s still a lot of room to improve”, he says.",

Although it is thus conceptually obvious that psychology and geography need one another to fulfil their mandates, integrating them has been empirically challenging. To remedy this, we propose the unifying Geographical–Psychological Interactionist Framework. This framework features three axes (that is, geography, psychology, and geography–psychology interactions). Each axis hosts overarching classes (for example, human, physical and spatial geographical variables) and specific instances thereof (for example, climate and distance). As such, our framework provides: (1) a systematic taxonomy of the general interplay between geography and psychology; (2) a precise vocabulary with which to categorize specific interactions; and (3) a straightforward tool to inspire concrete and testable hypotheses. We conclude by positioning our conceptual framework in relation to existing theories and discuss next steps towards an interdisciplinary future at the nexus of psychology and geography.",

These ties enable the spread of information through a network, including gossip, which comprises a sizeable share of daily conversation. Given the number of possible connections between people in even the smallest networks, a formidable challenge is how to strategically gossip—to disseminate information as widely as possible without the target of the gossip finding out. Here we find that people achieve this goal by leveraging knowledge about topological properties, specifically, social distance and popularity, using a gossip-sharing task in artificial social networks (experiments 1–3, N = 568). We find a similar pattern of behaviour in a real-world social network (experiment 4, N = 187), revealing the power of these topological properties in predicting information flow, even in much noisier, complex environments. Computational modelling suggests that these adaptive social behaviours rely on mental representations of information cascades through the social network.",

We conducted nine studies (n = 6,282) where AI-generated empathic responses to participants’ emotional situations were labelled as provided by either humans or AI. Human-attributed responses were rated as more empathic and supportive, and elicited more positive and fewer negative emotions, than AI-attributed ones. Moreover, participants’ own uninstructed belief that AI had aided the human-attributed responses reduced perceived empathy and support. These effects were replicated across varying response lengths, delays, iterations and large language models and were primarily driven by responses emphasizing emotional sharing and care. Additionally, people consistently chose human interaction over AI when seeking emotional engagement. These findings advance our general understanding of empathy, and specifically human–AI empathic interactions.",

By identifying several demographic attributes of the American National Election Studies respondents, we chart how political and socioeconomic groups move through the ideological space in time. We observe that income and especially racial groups align into parties, but their ideological distance has not increased over time. Instead, Democrats and Republicans have become ideologically more distant in the past 30 years: Both parties moved away from the centre, at different rates. Furthermore, Democratic voters have become ideologically more heterogeneous after 2010, indicating that partisan sorting has declined in the past decade.",

Yet little is known about a fundamental issue in the modern world: What is happening to job autonomy in today’s workplaces as people move from youth on to middle age and then on to older ages? It would be natural to believe that individuals in the second half of their careers would be the senior ones with high autonomy. We provide evidence that such a belief is wrong. This study uses longitudinal data on hundreds of thousands of randomly sampled individuals, in three rich countries, who are followed through their working lives (n &gt; 400,000). Workers’ feelings of job autonomy trace out a smooth concave parabola, increasing up to midlife, until approximately the surprisingly early age of 40, and then collapsing over the ensuing twenty to 30 y of a person’s working life. This is apparently not an illusion. We show that objective measures of autonomy —signified by managerial and supervisory job titles, for example—behave in a matching, hump-shaped way. As a further check, consistent qualitative evidence is given: a survey we ran asking managers about their experiences. We believe this paper’s results represent a foundational, essentially unknown, and intrinsically cross-disciplinary puzzle.",

          "abstract": "In cognitive science, the term “executive function” (EF) refers to universal features of the mind. Yet, almost all results described as measuring EF may actually reflect culturally specific cognitive capacities. After all, typical EF measures require forms of decontextualized/arbitrary processing which decades of cross-cultural work indicate develop primarily in “schooled worlds”–industrialized societies with universal schooling. Here, we report comparisons of performance on typical EF tasks by children inside, and wholly outside schooled worlds. Namely, children ages 5 to 18 from a postindustrial context with universal schooling (UK) and their peers in a rural, nonindustrialized context with no exposure to schooling (Kunene region, Namibia/Angola), as well as two samples with intermediate exposure to schooled worlds. In line with extensive previous work on decontextualized/arbitrary processing across such groups, we find skills measured by typical EF tasks do not develop universally: Children from rural groups with limited or no formal schooling show profound, sometimes qualitative, differences in performance compared to their schooled peers and, especially, compared to a “typical” schooled-world sample. In sum, some form of latent cognitive control capacities are obviously crucial in all cultural contexts. However, typical EF tasks almost certainly reflect culturally specific forms of cognitive development. This suggests we must decide between using the term EF to describe 1) universal capacities or 2) the culturally specific skill set reflected in performance on typical tasks. Either option warrants revisiting how we understand what has been measured as EF to date, and what we wish to measure going forward.",

We also offer steps the scientific community can take to advance and improve the transformative practice of community-engaged science as part of a productive ecosystem of scientific activities: evolving norms and culture, integrating community science into current systems, building incentives and structures to support community-engaged science, developing a workforce skilled in community engagement, and investing in a coordinated research-to-practice agenda.",

Using our Global Survey of Working Arrangements covering dozens of countries, we find that average WFH rates among college-educated employees stabilized after 2022. The average number of WFH days per week is steady at roughly 1 d per week globally from 2023 through early 2025. Cross-country variation persists: WFH is about twice as common in advanced English-speaking economies as in much of Asia. These results show how the pandemic-driven shift to remote work has persisted and reached a new equilibrium with implications for urban economies, workforce flexibility, and future research on labor markets.",

          "authors": "Mohsen Mosleh, Dean Eckles, David G. Rand",
          "abstract": "Empirical social networks are characterized by a high degree of triadic closure (i.e., transitivity, clustering): network neighbors of the same individual are also likely to be directly connected. It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form such ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se versus other processes such as homophily and more opportunities for exposure. These mechanisms are difficult to disentangle in many settings. On social media, however, they can be decomposed - and platforms frequently make decisions that depend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we randomize the existing network structure that a user faces when they are followed by a target account that we control. We then examine whether the user reciprocates this tie formation. Being randomly assigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie formation by 35%. Through multiple control conditions, we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that indicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure should be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and accordingly we find larger effects when the subject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial role for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what might be inferred from prior observational studies. Platforms and others may rely on these tendencies in encouraging tie formation, with broader implications for network structure and information diffusion in online networks.",

          "abstract": "A stable caregiving environment early in life is essential for children’s development, and disruptions have the potential to impact biological processes. Using data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, we examined a developmental cascade model in which shifts in pubertal tempo following early caregiving disruptions come at an epigenetic cost. Among 115 individuals, all of whom experienced severe deprivation early in life, we tracked caregiving disruptions across childhood; assessed pubertal timing and tempo across adolescence; and quantified the pace of cellular aging via telomere erosion across the second decade of life. We demonstrate that a greater number of caregiving disruptions is associated with delayed pubertal timing and an acceleration of pubertal tempo. In turn, accelerations in pubertal tempo are associated with significantly greater telomere erosion across time. A formal mediation model indicated that greater caregiving disruptions during childhood predicted greater telomere erosion through an acceleration of pubertal tempo. By documenting the impact of caregiving disruptions on pubertal development and ultimately biological aging, these findings highlight the importance of the stability of the caregiving context and the critical need to ensure that organizations caring for vulnerable children establish programs and policies to minimize unnecessary disruptions.",

In this perspectives piece, we focus on the need for greater intellectual humility (i.e., willingness to revise one’s views and admit that one might be wrong) among social scientists, who are met with particularly high levels of skepticism from the public. We begin with an overview of research demonstrating that when scientists’ identities or ideologies align (or are perceived to align) with those of the public, trust in science increases. We then highlight intellectual humility as a potential tool for cultivating trust in the social sciences even when social scientists’ and the public’s identities or ideologies do not match. Specifically, intellectual humility among social scientists predicts less bias toward one another’s research and hence may increase the diversity of perspectives to which the public is exposed and shift public perceptions of social scientists. We conclude with a discussion of how to foster intellectual humility in science communication, broadly defined.",

One focuses on dissemination, often seeking to inform, reframe, or correct beliefs. Another emphasizes participation and engagement with the goal of improving public understanding of science and scientists’ understanding of the public’s concerns, needs, and values. We argue that participatory approaches better address contemporary challenges concerning scientific uncertainty, politicized science, artificial value neutrality, and a reactive science communication infrastructure. These approaches though need to move away from transactional partnerships toward more cocreation and coproduction of knowledge. They also need to focus more on less motivated and/or engaged populations. Investment in a participatory infrastructure is crucial given that even the most path-breaking science only matters if it can be adequately communicated to relevant stakeholders.",

          "abstract": "The ability of cells to overcome cell cycle arrest and adapt to the presence of unrepairable DNA damage is under the control of Polo-like kinases (PLKs) in eukaryotes. How DNA damage checkpoints are silenced or bypassed during the adaptation response is unknown, but the process requires enrichment of the Cdc5 PLK to microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), such as the yeast centrosomes or spindle pole bodies (SPBs). Here, we found that SPBs play an active role as supramolecular organizing centers that coordinate Cdc5 recruitment and signaling to downstream effectors during the adaptation response to DNA damage. We show that SPB components Nud1, Spc110, and Spc72 are key effectors of Cdc5 recruitment to SPBs in the presence of sustained DNA damage. Following recruitment, Cdc5 transduces a phospho-signal to key structural subunits of the SPB, including Cnm67 and Mps3. We demonstrate these phosphorylation events are required to bypass cell cycle checkpoint arrest and enable effective adaptation to DNA damage. This response is specific because it cannot be recapitulated by a generic inactivation of MTOC activity. Collectively, our results indicate that centrosomes can act as supramolecular platforms to coordinate dynamic recruitment and substrate selection of PLKs during the DNA damage response (DDR).",

          "abstract": "The study of DNA tumor viruses has revolutionized cancer biology, partly by virtue of the unique capabilities of viral oncoproteins to manipulate key proteins and pathways involved in tumorigenesis. We find a high affinity and selective binding of the polyoma small T antigen (PyST) with the transcription cofactor TAZ. By engineering a degradable version of PyST, we demonstrate that, when TAZ activity is modulated by PyST, a surprisingly small number of genes have altered expression and thus are candidate transcription targets of TAZ. Notably, knocking out TAZ, or its target genes CTGF or CYR61, abolishes the growth-promoting properties of PyST that are evident upon growth factor withdrawal. Therefore, by controlling the protein abundance of PyST and consequently TAZ activity, we find that TAZ is a transcriptional coactivator that can achieve important biological effects by acting on a limited number of gene targets.",

          "abstract": "The endosomal–lysosomal network is a hub of organelles that orchestrate the dynamic sorting of hundreds of integral membrane proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. VPS29 is a central conductor of this network through its assembly into Retromer, Retriever, and Commander endosomal sorting complexes, and its role in regulating RAB GTPase activity. Two VPS29 isoforms have been described, VPS29A and VPS29B, that differ solely in their amino-terminal sequences. Here, we identify a third VPS29 isoform, which we term VPS29C, that harbors an extended amino-terminal sequence compared to VPS29A and VPS29B. Through a combination of AlphaFold predictive modeling, in vitro complex reconstitution, mass spectrometry, and molecular cell biology, we find that the amino-terminal VPS29C extension constitutes an autoinhibitory sequence that limits access to a hydrophobic groove necessary for effector protein recruitment to Retromer, and association with Retriever and Commander. VPS29C is therefore unique in its ability to uncouple Retromer-dependent cargo sorting from the broader roles of VPS29A and VPS29B in regulating the endosomal–lysosomal network through accessory protein recruitment. Our identification and characterization of VPS29C points to additional complexity in the differential subunit assembly of Retromer, an important consideration given the increasing interest in Retromer as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.",

To address this issue, we report herein the direct interaction between thrombin and DNA scaffolds and further, the identification of short tandem repeats of single-stranded (ATTCC) n in NETs that selectively bind thrombin, a crucial enzyme involved in both blood clot formation and immune response. We have also developed a strategy of selective targeting ss(ATTCC) n using antisense locked nucleic acids (LNAs), effectively disrupting NET–thrombin interactions. This finding reveals an unexplored role of single strand DNA (ssDNA) within NETs and provides a broad avenue for developing targeted therapeutic interventions for immunothrombosis-related disorders.",

          "abstract": "The cerebellar cortex is organized into discrete regions populated by molecularly distinct Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole cortical output neurons. While studies in animal models have shown that PC subtypes differ in their vulnerability to disease, our understanding of human PC subtype and vulnerability remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that human cerebellar regions specialized for motor vs. cognitive functions (lobule HV vs. Crus I) contain distinct PC populations characterized by specific molecular and anatomical features, which show selective vulnerability in essential tremor (ET), a cerebellar degenerative disorder. Using a known PC subtype marker, neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH), we found that motor lobule HV contains PCs with high NEFH expression, while cognitive lobule Crus I contains PCs with low NEFH expression in postmortem samples from healthy controls. In the same cerebella, PC axons in lobule HV were 2.2-fold thicker than those in Crus I. Across lobules, axon caliber positively correlated with NEFH expression. In ET cerebella, we identified motor lobule-specific PC axon pathology with a 1.5-fold reduction in caliber and increased axon variability in lobule HV, while Crus I axons were unaffected. Tremor severity and duration in ET correlated with axon diameter variability selectively in lobule HV PCs. Given that axonal caliber is a major determinant of neural signaling capacity, our results 1) suggest that disrupted cerebellar corticonuclear signaling is occurring in ET, and 2) provide evidence of region-specific PC populations in the human cerebellum and offer insight into how different PC subpopulations may contribute to the pathophysiology of cerebellar degeneration.",

          "abstract": "The fossil record often creates an illusion of sudden evolutionary bursts, which may reflect preservation biases rather than actual biological events. The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) appears to mark the abrupt rise of diverse reef-building metazoans during the late Darriwilian (~460 Ma), seemingly contradicting gradual evolutionary models. Here, we demonstrate this apparent burst is largely an artifact of a global sea-level fall (~475 to 460 Ma) that produced widespread unconformities. Integrated stratigraphic and fossil occurrence data reveal early reef-builders likely appeared earlier than the late Middle Ordovician, but their record was erased by sea-level-driven erosion. During the peak of this sea-level fall (Dapingian Stage, 471 to 469 Ma), both carbonate deposition and fossil occurrences were minimal, with significant correlation between carbonate preservation and reef-builder occurrences. The subsequent transgression enabled these already-diversified organisms to recolonize shallow-water environments simultaneously across multiple regions, generating a misleading impression of sudden diversification. This “Sppil–Rongis effect” biased our understanding of the GOBE in reef ecosystems, illustrating how stratigraphic incompleteness can distort evolutionary patterns. Rather than a discrete evolutionary event, the GOBE reflects a continuous trajectory, interrupted and reshaped by sea-level fluctuations.",

          "abstract": "Analyzing the functional connectivity of the brain is an enormous challenge, as deciphering functional connectivity requires knowledge of functional responses and connections. One promising strategy is analyzing the spatial pattern of activity correlations across cell populations. In the primary auditory cortex (A1), cells respond to different sound features. On the large scale, there exists a tonotopic map, which is fractured at the small scale, raising the question of whether functional connections are spatially ordered or disordered. To test whether functional connectivity on a local and a global scale is also disordered, we first designed a robust statistical model to estimate parameters and test for the significance of the estimated correlation maps. We developed an inference method that allows efficient model fitting and statistical testing to project the correlation maps to 2D space. We then performed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in layer 2/3 of A1 with pure tones (PT) or a combination of two tones (TT; harmonically related or not). We found that the spatial patterns of signal correlations (SCs) depend on the type of sound stimuli that were presented. The functional 2D maps of PT-driven SCs are more restricted to local neurons than TT signal correlations which showed more global textures. 2D SC patterns for harmonic stimuli showed spatially distinct relationships. TT SCs revealed spatially precise functional connectivity between harmonically related neurons. Thus, even though the frequency preference of neighboring neurons in A1 is functionally diverse, the functional connection pattern of these neurons is functionally precise and harmonically related.",

          "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen that causes life-threatening infections. Its cell envelope contains anionic polymers called teichoic acids that are required for cell viability. Teichoic acids come in two forms and are made by different biosynthetic pathways. One form, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), is anchored in the cell membrane; the other form, wall teichoic acid (WTA), is covalently linked to the peptidoglycan cell wall. Although the LTA and WTA biosynthetic pathways have been characterized, regulation of teichoic acid production is not well understood. Here, we identified SpbR ( SAOUHSC_00965 ), a polytopic membrane protein similar to a eukaryotic CAAX protease, as a factor that controls LTA levels in S. aureus cells. We show that loss of SpbR results in short LTAs and a synthetically sick phenotype when WTA biosynthesis is prevented, whereas overexpressing SpbR results in elongated LTAs. Mechanistically, we find that SpbR physically associates with the type I signal peptidase SpsB, which cleaves LtaS, the polymerase that assembles LTA on the extracellular side of the membrane, and we show that this physical interaction inhibits SpsB cleavage of LtaS both in vivo and in vitro. Although the phenotypes investigated here are dominated by SpbR’s effects on LtaS, it also inhibits cleavage of other SpsB substrates. Based on its role in regulating the activity of SpsB, we named this factor SpbR ( S ignal p eptidase b R egulator).",

Building on a theoretical framework for conditional projective measurements and quantum conditional mutual information, we quantify the tripartite quantum discord and its contributions in different three-qubit states such as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and Werner (W) states as well as classical mixtures of biseparable Bell states, and classical mixtures of product states. The experiments employed full quantum state tomography and temporal averaging to prepare mixed states, achieving fidelities exceeding 95%. Our results confirm that quantum discord persists even in the absence of entanglement, highlighting its utility as a broader indicator of quantum correlations. Furthermore, we validate the nonconvexity of discord, confirming that classical mixtures of zero-discord states can exhibit nonzero discord. This experimentally confirms that quantum discord does not fit into the framework of resource theory. This work establishes a robust methodology for measuring quantum discord, illuminating the structure and distribution of quantum correlations in multipartite systems.",

Here, we show that a single heavy atom replacement in the morphine core structure (O to CH 2 exchange in the E-ring) prepared through a 15-step total synthesis displays a different pharmacological profile. The total synthesis features an intramolecular inverse electron-demand Diels−Alder cycloaddition and a stereoselective Giese radical addition to construct a quaternary carbon center. Unlike morphine, where the (–)-morphine enantiomer binds the MOR, both enantiomers of this “carba” variant, which we have named carbamorphine, possess activity as agonists of the MOR. Cell-based functional assays show that (+)-carbamorphine shows reduced G-protein as well as β-arrestin efficacy at the MOR. In mouse behavioral assays, (+)-carbamorphine exhibits MOR-selective antinociception while showing reduced respiratory depression and a lack of conditioned place preference at supratherapeutic doses. Overall, through a net “single-atom” change (i.e., O to CH 2 ) in the morphine framework, different pharmacological profiles have been realized. This work provides a basis for additional syntheses and the study of morphine analogs that incorporate atom changes in the core framework.",

          "abstract": "Using time-variable gravity fields determined from satellite laser ranging (SLR) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO), we derive three decades of barystatic sea level (BSL) change estimates since 1993, providing a long record of satellite gravimetry-based BSL estimates comparable in duration to satellite altimetry. Over the 1993–2022 altimetry era, the BSL change rate is 1.75 ± 0.59 mm/y (2σ) as observed by SLR. The rate increases to 2.16 ± 0.59 mm/y (SLR) and 2.13 ± 0.38 mm/y (GRACE/-FO) over 2003–2022, mainly due to accelerated ice loss in Greenland since the 2000s. The remarkable agreement between SLR and GRACE/-FO estimates over the joint period cross-validates each other, suggesting that both work well in monitoring BSL changes. We also compare our satellite gravimetry estimates with the sum of individual mass change components (ice sheets, glaciers, and land water storage) obtained from multisource datasets (in situ, remote sensing and geophysical modeling). The differences are within 0.2 mm/y over the three decades, highlighting the global consistency of different techniques for observing Earth’s surface mass changes. Moreover, we reconcile the global mean sea level (GMSL) rise budget using reprocessed altimetry data and updated thermosteric sea level ensembles.

          "abstract": "Sleep and physical activity (PA) are pillars of health. However, the temporal dynamics between these two behaviors remain poorly understood. This research aims to examine the independent and interactive between- and within-person associations of sleep duration and sleep onset timing on next-day PA duration in two large, longitudinal samples of adults under free-living conditions. In the primary study, participants (N = 19,963; 5,995,080 person-nights) wore a validated biometric device (WHOOP) for 1 y (01/09/2021 to 31/08/2022). Objective sleep and PA metrics were derived from the wrist-worn device. Generalized additive mixed models assessed between- and within-person associations between sleep and PA variables, adjusted for age, sex, Body Mass Index, weekday/weekend, seasonal effects, biometric feedback, and autocorrelated errors. Between participants, longer sleep duration and later sleep onset timing were associated with decreased moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and overall PA duration ( ps &lt; 0.001). Within participants, sleeping shorter-than-usual and falling asleep earlier-than-usual were associated with increased next-day MVPA and overall PA, whereas sleeping longer-than-usual, or falling asleep later-than-usual, showed the opposite relationship ( ps &lt; 0.001). Next-day MVPA duration was highest following earlier-than-usual sleep onset timing combined with one’s typical sleep duration. Results were consistent but smaller in magnitude in the external validation study (N = 5,898; 635,477 person-nights) using Fitbit data from the All of Us Research Program. Individuals may sacrifice time in one health behavior for time in the other. Interventions promoting exercise and holistic public health messaging should consider the temporal dynamics between sleep and next-day PA outcomes.",

However, Mtb alters host RNA splicing to quench host antibacterial responses, the mechanism for which remains unknown. Here, we report a mechanism whereby a secreted Mtb protein interferes with the biogenesis of key spliceosomal components. A high-throughput yeast-2-hybrid screen identified several Mtb -secreted proteins interacting with the host RNA splicing factors (SFs). Through custom-designed in-cell assays, we show that one of those proteins, Rv1435c/hsr1 (host splicing regulator 1), targets specific exon-skipping events. The Mtb Rv14345c/hsr1 facilitates direct interaction between Mtb phagosomes and U5 snRNA and SNRPF, key components of the snRNPs. Genetic deletion of Rv1435c/hsr1 reverses the specific exon-skipping events caused by WT Mtb infection. The Δ hsr1 strain shows compromised growth during ex vivo infection in macrophages and in vivo infection in mice. Tissue sections from the WT Mtb or Δhsr1 -infected mice showed significant hsr1-dependent SNRPF staining, a phenomenon also noted in the human intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) biopsies. Thus, hsr1 is a virulence factor that disrupts host snRNP biogenesis for pathogenesis. The splicing regulators from the host and pathogen are novel targets for antituberculosis therapy.",

However, reliable cloud screening remains a fundamental challenge for these instruments, where traditional spatial and temporal approaches are limited by cloud variability and limited temporal coverage. The Spectroscopic Transformer (SpecTf) addresses these challenges with a spectroscopy-specific deep-learning architecture that performs cloud detection using only spectral information (no spatial or temporal data are required). By treating spectral measurements as sequences rather than image channels, SpecTf learns fundamental physical relationships without relying on spatial context. Our experiments demonstrate that SpecTf significantly outperforms the current baseline approach implemented for the Earth surface Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) instrument, and performs comparably with other machine learning methods with orders of magnitude fewer learned parameters. Critically, we demonstrate SpecTf’s inherent interpretability through its attention mechanism, revealing physically meaningful spectral features the model has learned. Finally, we present SpecTf’s potential for cross-instrument generalization by applying it to a different instrument on a different platform without modifications, opening the door to instrument-agnostic data-driven algorithms for future imaging spectroscopy tasks.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how humans have altered coral reef food webs remains challenging due to the absence of prehistoric baselines. Here, we use fish remains preserved in fossil and archaeological deposits from Panamá and the Dominican Republic to explore how Caribbean reef fish mortality patterns have changed over millennia. By quantifying accumulation rates of shark dermal denticles (scales) and bony fish otoliths (ear stones) in reef sediments, we assess relative fish abundance, while otolith size serves as a proxy for body size at death. Comparisons of these death assemblages suggest a 75% decline in shark-derived material and a 22% reduction in the sizes of human-targeted fishes—consistent with historical exploitation. This evidence of decline in large-bodied, higher trophic level fish remains coincided with a doubling in prey fish otolith accumulation and a 17% increase in their reconstructed body sizes. These patterns in time-averaged death assemblages align with effects of release from predation, documenting an often assumed (but rarely shown) cascading effect. In contrast, otoliths of predator-sheltered cryptobenthic fishes showed no change in either accumulation or size, suggesting that ‘‘bottom–up”environmental factors were not responsible for the observed changes. Together, these data indicate that pre-exploitation predator communities strongly controlled exposed prey fishes, but this “top–down” effect diminishes rapidly toward the food chain base, especially in predator-resistant groups. Understanding trophic cascades on Caribbean reefs requires studying systems before predator depletion.",

          "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) assimilation by the enzyme Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase (Rubisco) underpins biomass accumulation in photosynthetic bacteria and eukaryotes. Despite its pivotal role, Rubisco has a slow carboxylation rate ( k cat CO 2 ) and is competitively inhibited by oxygen (O 2 ). These traits impose limitations on photosynthetic efficiency, making Rubisco a compelling target for improvement. Interest in Form II Rubisco from Gallionellaceae bacteria, which comprise a dimer or hexamer of large subunits, arises from their nearly fivefold higher k cat CO 2 than the average Rubisco enzyme. As well as having a fast k cat CO 2 (25.8 s − 1 at 25 °C), we show that Gallionellaceae Rubisco (GWS1B) is extremely sensitive to O 2 inhibition, consistent with its evolution under semianaerobic environments. We therefore used an in vivo mutagenesis-mediated screening pipeline to evolve GWS1B over six rounds under oxygenic selection, identifying three catalytic point mutants with improved ambient carboxylation efficiency: Thr-29-Ala (T29A), Glu-40-Lys (E40K), and Arg-337-Cys (R337C). Full kinetic characterization showed that each substitution enhanced the CO 2 affinity of GWS1B under oxygenic conditions by subduing oxygen affinity, leading to 25% (E40K), 11% (T29A), and 8% (R337C) enhancements in carboxylation efficiency under ambient O 2 at 25 °C. By contrast, under the near anaerobic natural environment of Gallionellaceae , the carboxylation efficiency of each mutant was impaired ~16%. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of artificial directed evolution to access distinctive regions of catalytic space in Rubisco.",

CTP binding and hydrolysis enable ParB to slide along DNA and to bridge and condense DNA, thereby dictating the size and dynamics of the tripartite ParAB S complex. Several other evolutionarily distinct systems can also segregate DNA, although the full diversity of bacterial DNA partition systems remains unknown. Here, we identify a CTP-independent ParAB S system that maintains the conjugative plasmid SCP2 in the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor . We demonstrate that an SCP2 ParB-like protein, ParT, loads onto DNA at an 18-bp parS site and diffuses away to the adjacent DNA despite lacking an apparent CTPase domain and detectable NTPase activity. We further show that parS DNA facilitates ParT transition from loading to a diffusing state, allowing ParT to accumulate on DNA, and that ParT activates the ATPase activity of its cognate partner protein, ParA. Additionally, we identify numerous structural homologs of ParT, suggesting that CTP-independent diffusion on DNA might be more common than previously recognized. Overall, our findings reveal a CTP-independent DNA translocation as an alternative and unexpected mechanism for assembling a bacterial DNA segregation complex and suggest that CTP binding and hydrolysis are not universal features of ParAB S -like systems.",

Mechanistically, depletion of UFL1 or defective UFMylation increases HIF1α binding to p53, promoting its degradation. Depletion of UFL1 or UBA5 , or defective UFMylation of HIF1α, destabilizes HIF1α, significantly inhibiting tumor growth and development in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. Defective UFMylation of HIF1α enhances the response to anti-PD-1 therapy in xenograft models. Clinically, UBA5 expression is upregulated in breast cancer tissues, and a selective UBA5 inhibitor reduces UFMylation activity and HIF1α protein levels, thereby enhancing anti-PD-1 combination therapy in mouse tumor models.

          "abstract": "The fossil record provides the most powerful evidence of large-scale biodiversity change on Earth, but it does so at coarse and often idiosyncratic temporal scales. One critical problem that arises concerns the evolutionary consequences of individual environmental experience. Individuals respond to their environment instantaneously, whereas the resolution of most fossil records aggregates multiple paleoenvironments over time scales beyond individual lifespans. Therefore, the presence of phenotypic plasticity in deep time and the extent of its influence on macroevolution remain poorly understood. Using coupled computed tomography and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry protocols, we studied the environmental dependence of developmental trajectories across three sister species of macroperforate planktonic foraminifera. A foraminiferal shell preserves all stages of the individual’s ontogeny, as well as the environmental state experienced throughout its lifetime. Generalized additive mixed effect (GAMM) models show that somatic growth rates differ among the three Menardella species and that these are inversely correlated with calcification temperature, as reconstructed from Mg/Ca measurements through ontogeny. This environmental dependence varies among species: The thermal sensitivity of individual chamber-to-chamber growth rates of Menardella limbata and Menardella pertenuis is double that seen in Menardella exilis . In contrast, no such environmental signal was recovered for architectural shape traits. Our integrated approach is widely applicable and demonstrates that detecting developmental plasticity in the fossil record is feasible. Extrapolating these techniques in deep time promises to revolutionize our understanding of the ways in which environmentally associated trait variation drove the diversification of life on Earth.",

In Escherichia coli , it was shown that 1) FtsZ recruits all essential divisome proteins to the septum, including the core sPG synthase complex, FtsWIQLB, and its activator, FtsN; 2) FtsWIQLB must complex with FtsN to be activated to synthesize sPG under the wildtype background; and 3) the Brownian ratcheting by treadmilling FtsZ polymers drives the directional movements of sPG synthase proteins along the septum circumference; and 4) FtsZ is essential for the early stage, but dispensable for the late stage of cell wall constriction. However, it remains unclear how FtsZ spatial–temporally organizes the divisome for robust cell wall constriction during cytokinesis. Combining theoretical modeling with experiments in E. coli , we show that at the early stage during cell division, the Brownian ratcheting by FtsZ treadmilling acts both as a template to corral FtsWIQLB and FtsN into close contacts for FtsWIQLB-FtsN complex formation and as a conveyor to maximally homogenize the septal distribution of sPG synthesis activities to avoid uneven cell wall constriction. When the septum constricts progressively, the FtsN septal density increases via binding to denuded sPG (dnG) and serves as the template to activate FtsWIQLB for continued sPG synthesis, rendering FtsZ dispensable. Our work suggests an overarching framework for how FtsZ spatial–temporally regulates septal cell wall constriction, in which different bacteria species may operate in various parameter regimes to meet their distinct functional requirements.",

The simulation also accounts for both the complex three-dimensional (3D) geometry, expected as the norm in a geological waste repository, and the anisotropy of the geological formation. In addition, the high resolution of the model makes it possible to include “skin effects” developed at the interface between highly reactive materials, in this case between the high pH cement and the circumneutral but electrostatic Opalinus Clay. The successful history matching with the field experiment demonstrates that the distinct geochemical and physical properties of the cement and the Opalinus Clay in the CI-D experiment can be accounted for.

          "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of macromolecules adsorbed from extracellular fluids onto cell membranes is crucial for elucidating basic cellular processes and advancing applications in biotechnology, such as biosensing, therapeutics, and synthetic biology. However, this is complicated by the interplay between membrane heterogeneity, macromolecule conformation, and fluid hydrodynamics. We investigate the dynamics of linear polymers on binary lipid membranes using hydrodynamics simulations and single-molecule tracking experiments. We find that the preferential adsorption of nanosized polymer onto the raft-forming component of the membrane induces and stabilizes a single lipid raft that colocalizes with the polymer. This lipid raft, in turn, imposes dynamic confinement on the polymer, resulting in swollen yet restricted 2D conformations and Saffman–Delbrück-type diffusivity. These effects lead to an unusual scaling for polymer interfacial diffusion, D ∼ N − ν D with ν D ≈ 0.5 . Normal mode analysis further reveals that the relaxation time of the polymer’s slowest mode surprisingly follows the prediction of Zimm model for a 3D chain in a good solvent, irrespective of whether the polymer’s hydrodynamics are dominated by the 3D solvent or 2D fluid membrane. We also identify two diffusive modes: Saffman–Delbrück-type for polymer on heterogeneous membranes and Stokes–Einstein-like for polymer on homogeneous membranes, demonstrating the potential of polymer adsorbates as biosensors for membrane heterogeneity. Our study provides insights into polymer dynamics on biological membranes and suggests that polymer adsorbates can modulate lipid rafts, influencing raft-related cellular processes.",

We report that aging B-1a cells exhibit hallmarks of decline, including DNA damage, apoptosis, and reduced proliferation, with striking sex-specific disparities: aged females retain higher B-1a cell numbers than males, correlating with enhanced glycolysis and chromatin accessibility. Motif analysis of accessible regions identified the transcription factor Bcl11a, which shows elevated chromatin accessibility and expression in aged female B-1a cells but declines in males. Bcl11a deletion reduced B-1a cell numbers, impaired viability, and increased apoptosis across sexes and ages. Mechanistically, Bcl11a sustains survival by upregulating antiapoptotic genes ( Mcl1 , Mdm2 , and Mdm4 ) to suppress p53-mediated apoptosis, as evidenced by partial rescue of viability defects in Bcl11a-deficient B-1a cells upon p53 deletion. Conversely, Bcl11a overexpression or Bcl11a-high B-1a cells from aged Bcl11a -eGFP reporter mice enhanced stress resistance.

Most TEAD-targeting small molecules are designed to disrupt interaction between TEAD and the oncogenic transcriptional activators YAP and TAZ. Here, we uncover an alternative mechanism for a subset of TEAD lipid pocket-binding molecules. We report that select sulfonamide-containing TEAD-targeting compounds enhance the interaction between TEAD and the transcriptional repressor VGLL4. Chemically induced VGLL4–TEAD complexes confer an antiproliferative effect by outcompeting YAP–TEAD complexes at chromatin. This cofactor switch from YAP to VGLL4 impacts transcriptional networks, including influencing the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation and mechanosignaling. We demonstrate that VGLL4 is required for an antiproliferative response to these sulfonamide-containing compounds by counteracting YAP. We show that VGLL4 overexpression can confer sensitivity to these compounds in Hippo-driven cell lines, and we further show that genetic deletion of VGLL4 oblates cellular responsiveness to these molecules in cells and in vivo. Our data reveal a category of TEAD inhibitors that act as “molecular glues” toward the repressive VGLL4–TEAD interaction. These findings open up understandings for curbing the oncogenic activity of Hippo pathway deregulation in cancer, and identify glue-like molecules that promote transcriptional repression.",

This freshening enhanced upper-ocean stratification, reducing the upward transport of subsurface heat and possibly contributing to sea ice expansion. It also limited the formation of open-ocean polynyas. Using satellite observations, we reveal a marked increase in surface salinity across the circumpolar Southern Ocean since 2015. This shift has weakened upper-ocean stratification, coinciding with a dramatic decline in Antarctic sea ice coverage. Additionally, rising salinity facilitated the reemergence of the Maud Rise polynya in the Weddell Sea, a phenomenon last observed in the mid-1970s. Crucially, we demonstrate that satellites can now monitor these changes in real time, providing essential evidence of the Southern Ocean’s potential transition toward persistently reduced sea ice coverage.",

          "abstract": "Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans, with over half the world’s population at risk. Infection with any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes is most often self-limiting, but a significant number of cases present with severe dengue characterized by vascular leakage that may be fatal. African ancestry is associated with protection against severe dengue, but the mechanisms are unknown. Using skin explants from genetically defined donors, we show that European ancestry skin has a much stronger inflammatory response to DENV than African ancestry skin, eliciting markedly increased infiltration, infection and migration of resident Langerhans cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The effect was seen with all dengue serotypes and Zika virus and in the presence of heterotypic immune serum. Genetic pathways associated with inflammation, interferon (IFN)-α, and inflammatory cytokine signaling were enriched in European relative to African ancestry skin following infection. Infiltration and infection of macrophages in African ancestry skin increased to that of European skin after blocking IFN-α and providing interleukin-1β. Polymorphic variants in RXRA , OAS1-3, and TGFB1 genes that were more frequent in European donors were associated with increased virus replication. Paradoxically, European ancestry skin cells had increased expression of OAS3 in response to virus and type I IFN. Thus, the limited inflammatory response of African ancestry skin to infection restricts replication and spread of dengue and other flaviviruses. Genetic ancestry should be considered when predicting a patient’s likelihood of severe dengue, and when assessing efficacy and adverse events associated with dengue vaccines.",

          "abstract": "Transcytosis across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), is tightly controlled to prevent the entry of macromolecules, microorganisms, and toxins into the brain. Transferrin receptor (TfR) transcytosis, one of the few active transcytosis pathways in HBMECs, is extensively utilized for drug transport across the BBB and employed by meningitis-causing bacteria to penetrate into the brain. However, the molecular mechanism facilitating the fusion of TfR vesicles with the basolateral membrane of HBMECs, the final step of transcytosis, has not been experimentally studied. Here, we found that the interaction between the v-SNARE protein VAMP3 on TfR vesicles and the t-SNARE protein syntaxin 4 that is limited to the basolateral membrane in HBMECs mediates the fusion. We also provided evidence that this step is critical for the efficiency of TfR transcytosis. Furthermore, we showed that neonatal meningitis Escherichia coli (NMEC) infection significantly boosts the efficiency of this transcytosis by enhancing the expression of VAMP3 and syntaxin 4 through the TLR4-TRAM-TRIF-TRAF3-IKK-IRF3 signaling pathway in HBMECs. Silence or overexpression of VAMP3 and syntaxin 4 reduces or enhances the transcytosis of transferrin and NMEC in a human BBB model in vitro . Consistently, the penetration of transferrin and NMEC into the brain was significantly inhibited in VAMP3-deficient mice. These findings provide insights for improving strategies to deliver drugs into the brain and developing effective therapy for meningitis caused by NMEC.",

          "abstract": "Quantifying species’ niches across a clade reveals how environmental tolerances evolve, and offers insights into present and future distributions. We use herbarium specimens to explore climate niche evolution across 14 annual species of the Streptanthus ( s.l. ) clade (Brassicaceae), which originated in deserts and diversified into cooler, moister areas. To understand how climate niches evolved, we used historical climate records to estimate each species’ 1) classic annual climate niche, averaged over specimen collection sites; 2) growing season niche, from estimated specimen germination date to collection date, averaged across specimens (specimen-specific niche); and 3) standardized seasonal niche based on average growing seasons of all species (clade-seasonal niche). In addition to estimating how phenological variation maps onto climate niche evolution, we explored how spatial refugia shape the climate experienced by species by 1) analyzing how field soil texture changes relative to the climate space that species occupy and 2) comparing soil water holding capacity from each specimen locality to that of surrounding areas. Specimen-specific niches exhibited less clade-wide variation in climatic water deficit (CWD) than did annual or clade-seasonal niches, and specimen-specific temperature niches showed no phylogenetic signal, in contrast to annual and clade-seasonal temperature niches. Species occupying cooler regions tracked hotter and drier climates by growing later into the summer, and by inhabiting refugia on drought-prone soils. These results underscore how phenological shifts, spatial refugia, and germination timing shape “lived” climate. Despite occupying a large range of annual climates, we found these species are constrained in the conditions under which they thrive.",

          "abstract": "Solar system gravitational interactions are embedded in Earth’s record of climate, providing a way to bypass the 60 Myr limit imposed by chaos. Presently with a 2.4 Myr period, the Mars–Earth beat cycle of orbital perihelion frequencies is particularly sensitive to chaotic diffusion, potentially varying by more than a million years. Early Mesozoic (252 to 145 Ma) strata provide some constraints on this cycle, with evidence of a swing through most of the solution space from 1.8 Myr at 210 Ma to 2.5 Myr at 190 Ma and back to 1.6 Myr at 180 Ma. However, only the 1.8 Myr cycle is corroborated by geochronologic data and the 1.6 Myr period is disputed. Here, we show that variations in land-plant-dominated stable carbon isotopic ratios (δ 13 C org ) from the lacustrine, paleo-high-latitude Sangonghe Formation (Junggar Basin, northwestern China), reveal at least three 1.6 Myr Mars–Earth beat cycles centered at 183 Ma, tracking atmospheric CO 2 isotopic composition in Earth’s exchangeable carbon reservoirs. Furthermore, the middle cycle includes the famous Jenkyns Event, expressed here by poleward migration of cheirolepidaceous conifers driven by CO 2 warming from the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province (LIP). Our data do not, however, support major, LIP-triggered input of isotopically light carbon and instead support CO 2 amplification of local processes via warming and ecosystem change. Although requiring additional independent geochronological support, Sangonghe data help provide empirical constraints for filtering orbital solutions, tightening initial conditions, and testing gravitational models, as well as showing how extrinsic cyclical processes interact with a tectonic event, the Karoo-Ferrar LIP.",

          "abstract": "Certain viruses such as tailed bacteriophages and herpes simplex virus package double-stranded DNA into empty procapsids via powerful, ring-shaped molecular motors. High-resolution structures and force measurements on the DNA packaging motor of bacteriophage Φ29 revealed that its five ATPase subunits coordinate ATP hydrolysis with each other to maintain the proper cyclic sequence of DNA translocation steps about the ring. Here, we explore how the Φ29 motor regulates translocation by timing key events, namely ATP binding/hydrolysis and DNA gripping, through trans-subunit interactions. We used subunit dimers bound to DNA as our model system, a minimal system that still captures the conformation and trans-subunit interactions of the full pentameric motor complex. Molecular dynamics simulations of all-ATP and mixed ATP–ADP dimers revealed that the nucleotide occupancy of one subunit strongly affects the ability to hydrolyze ATP in the adjacent subunit by altering the free energy landscape of its catalytic glutamate approaching the gamma phosphate of ATP. Specifically, one ATP-bound subunit donates residues in trans that sterically block the neighboring subunit’s catalytic glutamate. This steric hindrance is resolved when the first subunit hydrolyzes ATP and is ADP bound. This obstructive mechanism is supported by functional mutagenesis and appears to be conserved across several Φ29 relatives. Mutual information analysis of our simulations revealed intersubunit signaling pathways, via the trans-acting obstructive residues, that allow for sensing and communication between the binding pockets of adjacent subunits. This work reveals how the sequential order of DNA translocation events among subunits is preserved through trans-subunit interactions and pathways.",

In this study, we present cryogenic electron microscopy structures of both mouse and human TAUT in various conformational states. The taurine-bound, occluded forms of mouse and human TAUT reveal the substrate binding pocket and the ion binding sites. The amino group of taurine interacts with Glu406 at the binding site, constituting a key structural feature determining substrate preference. While both imidazole acetic acid and guanidinoethyl sulfonate (GES) inhibit TAUT by competing with taurine for the binding site, GES also functions as a substrate of TAUT. Moreover, mouse TAUT is captured in an inward-open apo conformation, where the tilted movement of transmembrane helix (TM) 1a opens the intracellular gate. Notably, TM6 exhibits two distinct conformational states: the canonical form consisting of two half-helices and a continuous straight helix. In the latter conformation, TM6 partially occupies the substrate binding site, likely promoting taurine release. Together, our findings provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms by which TAUT recognizes and transports taurine.",

This work explores the potential of using shape memory particles to dynamically regulate suspension fluid flow through controllable shape transformations. First, we synthesize shape-memory particles with programmable anisotropy from liquid crystal elastomers, such that the stiffness and shapes of the particles can be tuned by manipulating temperature. Our findings reveal that suspensions from such particles exhibit significant tunability in shear thickening behavior, transitioning from discontinuous shear thickening to a Newtonian-like response within a narrow temperature range of 60 ° C. This capability to modulate rheological responses in situ presents an approach for addressing processing challenges in many applications where control over flow behavior is paramount. Furthermore, we also show that suspensions composed of these anisotropic particles can undergo physical aging, and evolve into a glassy state. This state can be escaped upon activation of the shape memory effect. This reversibility underscores the potential for using such materials to engineer systems that can enter or come out of kinetic arrest by leveraging internal mechanical responses to external stimuli. The insights gained here not only broaden our understanding of the interplay between particle geometry and suspension dynamics but also pave the way for leveraging ensembles of stimuli-responsive objects to precisely control collective behaviors in many-body systems.",

          "abstract": "Hemoglobins (Hb) and myoglobins (Mb) are important hemoproteins with broad applications in food and medicine. Microbial cell factory is a promising approach for the green and sustainable production of hemoproteins. However, current microbial hosts face the challenges of safety and insufficient heme supply. Here, we report a global regulation strategy, “push–restrain–pull–block,” to enhance heme supply for producing various active Hb and Mb in food-grade Bacillus subtilis . Initially, the insufficient supply of the precursor 5-aminolevulinate was overcome by relieving feedback inhibition and mitigating the negative effects of HemX on HemA. Next, HemD was identified as the primary uroporphyrinogen III synthase and self-assembled with HemC to minimize the formation of the uroporphyrinogen I by-product. Additionally, the coproporphyrin-dependent pathway was selected as the superior downstream route for heme synthesis, and crucial rate-limiting steps were subsequently enhanced. Moreover, heme consumption was blocked by eliminating protoheme IX farnesyltransferase. Finally, through the combination and fine-tuned expression of key genes, a 221-fold improvement of heme supply was achieved in the engineered strain. Using this stable prokaryotic chassis, we achieved production of 0.81, 0.82, 1.11, and 1.01 g L −1 of soybean Hb, clover Hb (C-Hb), bovine Mb (B-Mb), and porcine Mb, respectively, through fermentation, marking the highest reported titers in prokaryotic systems. These hemoproteins exhibit properties similar to natural standards. Furthermore, the synthesized C-Hb and B-Mb demonstrated superior effects for preparing plant-based meat analogs as colorants and flavoring agents. This work provides a universal platform for producing other high-value hemoproteins, promising future advancements in food processing and biocatalysis.",

          "abstract": "The interplay between viscous and frictional dissipation is key to understanding quantum turbulence dynamics in superfluid 4 He. Based on a coarse-grained two-fluid description, an original scale-by-scale energy budget that identifies each scale’s contribution to energy dissipation is derived. Using the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) model to further characterize mutual friction, direct numerical simulations at temperatures 1.44 K ≲ T ≲ 2.16 K indicate that mutual friction promotes intense momentum exchanges between the two fluids to maintain a joint energy cascade despite their viscosity mismatch. However, the resulting overall frictional dissipation remains small (compared to the viscous dissipation) and confined to far-dissipative scales. This remarkable feature allows us to define an effective Reynolds number for the turbulence intensity in a two-fluid system, helping to disentangle the effects of Reynolds number and temperature in quantum turbulence. Thereby, simple physical arguments predict that the distance ℓ between quantized vortices (normalized by the turbulence integral scale L 0 ) should behave as ℓ / L 0 ≈ 0.5 Re κ − 3 / 4 with the Reynolds number based on the quantum of circulation κ . This law is well supported by a large set of experimental and numerical data within the temperature range of the HVBK model. Finally, this approach offers the possibility of revisiting the ongoing controversy on intermittency in quantum turbulence. It is shown that observed changes in intermittency arise from Reynolds number effects rather than from temperature variations, as proposed in recent studies.",

Enhanced expression of ORP2 and ORP5, LD-associated lipid transfer proteins that remove PI(4)P from LDs, abolished the localization and function of CIDE proteins. Blocking the synthesis of PI(4)P on the LD surface via knocking down PI4K2A also impaired the localization and function of CIDE proteins. In adipocytes, depleting PI(4)P dramatically reduced the size of LDs, as well as adipose tissue mass. In severe steatotic liver, depleting PI(4)P impeded LD enlargement.

NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a Ras guanosine triphosphate (GTPase) activating protein that negatively regulates Ras signaling. NF1 mutation accordingly leads to Ras misactivation and downstream activation of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, leading to the approval of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib for NF-1 associated peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors. However, how NF1 loss modifies response to selumetinib and the utility of targeting additional upstream inputs or downstream outputs of Ras these tumors remain unclear. Here, we perform RNA-sequencing, phosphoproteomic, pharmacologic, and proximal proteomic analysis across a panel of CRISPR interference immortalized peripheral nerve (iPN) cells to systematically dissect the function of neurofibromin loss. Small guide NF1 (sg NF1 ) repression is sufficient to increase Ras GTP levels and alter gene expression to promote cell proliferation and dedifferentiation, with sg NF1 iPNs showing decreased sensitivity to selumetinib due to altered feedback regulation to Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK. Upstream small guide PTPN11 (sg PTPN11 ) repression leads to the inverse gene expression signature, decreasing cell proliferation and promoting differentiation, and sg PTPN11 iPNs are more sensitive to selumetinib. However, upstream sonof sevenless 1 inhibition shows limited efficacy in iPNs due to compensation by SOS2. Finally, proximal proteomics reveals Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), but not Harvey rat sarcoma virus (HRAS) or neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), associates with neurofibromin in iPN cells, and pan-KRAS inhibition is sufficient to block ERK activation and CDK1/2 activation in NF1 mutant cells, suggesting blocking KRAS may be a therapeutic approach for NF1 mutant PNS tumors.",

We generated a de novo genome assembly for the Norwegian lemming and resequenced nine modern and two ancient Lemmus spp. genomes. We show that all Lemmus species form distinct monophyletic clades, with concordant topology between the mitochondrial and nuclear genome phylogenies. The Siberian lemming is divided into two distinct but paraphyletic clades, one in the east and one in the west, where the western clade represents a sister taxon to the Norwegian lemming. We estimate that the Norwegian and western Siberian lemming diverged shortly before the Last Glacial Maximum, making the Norwegian lemming one of the youngest known mammalian species. We did not find any indication of gene flow between L. lemmus and L. sibiricus , suggesting postglacial isolation of L. lemmus .

Most of the world’s lakes seasonally freeze, often resulting in oxygen depletion as ice cover inhibits water column ventilation and snow cover limits photosynthesis while respiration continues. Widespread shortening of ice-cover duration in a warmer world might improve winter oxygenation, but this hypothesis remains untested. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of 6.6 million physical and chemical observations from 19,645 lakes in the Northern Hemisphere during 1960 to 2022. Contrary to expectations, under-ice DO trends ranged from significantly negative in small lakes (A surf &lt;10 ha) (−0.14 ± 0.05 mg L −1 decade −1 ) to significantly positive in large lakes (≥10 4 ha) (0.11 ± 0.03 mg L −1 decade −1 ). This morphometric scaling emerged partly because ice-cover periods have shortened 2.2 times faster in large lakes compared to small lakes. Hierarchical modeling revealed that in smaller lakes, increasingly oxygen-depleted conditions in summer carried over to the ice-cover season, because fetch size limited wind-driven aeration in fall. As a result of this cross-seasonal ecological memory, under-ice hypoxic zones have expanded. Oxygen trended most negative in small eutrophic and humic lakes with high seasonal oxygen depletion rates. In larger lakes (≥10 3 ha), negligible summer deoxygenation, prolonged ventilation in fall, and shortening of the oxygen drawdown period in winter explained positive DO trends. However, in the vast majority of seasonally ice-covered lakes, which are small, continued climate warming is likely to exacerbate deoxygenation.",

          "abstract": "The origin and evolution of protein folds are among the most challenging, long-standing problems in biology. We developed Protein Fold Evolution Simulator (PFES), a computational approach that simulates evolution of globular folds from random amino acid sequences with atomistic details. PFES introduces random mutations in a population of protein sequences, evaluates the effect of mutations on protein structure, and selects a new set of proteins for further evolution. Iteration of this process allows tracking the evolutionary trajectory of a changing protein fold that evolves under selective pressure for protein fold stability, interaction with other proteins, or other features shaping the fitness landscape. We employed PFES to show how stable, globular protein folds could evolve from random amino acid sequences as monomers or in complexes with other proteins. The simulations reproduce the evolution of many simple folds of natural proteins as well as emergence of distinct folds not known to exist in nature. We show that evolution of small globular protein folds from random sequences, on average, takes 1.15 to 3 amino acid replacements per site, depending on the population size, with some simulations yielding stable folds after as few as 0.2 replacements per site. These values are lower than the characteristic numbers of replacements in conserved proteins during the time since the Last Universal Common Ancestor, suggesting that simple protein folds can evolve from random sequences relatively easily and quickly. PFES tracks the complete evolutionary history from simulations and can be used to test hypotheses on protein fold evolution.",

Here, we investigated the AMN using an inside-out approach, in which the network architecture of the AMN is first precisely mapped within individuals and then associated with behavioral functions. Individual-specific precision functional mapping with &gt;5 h of RSFC and task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed a replicable AMN subnetwork structure. AMN subnetworks were characterized and annotated by combining a meta-analytic network association method with RSFC, intrinsic timing, and task activation profiling. We demonstrate the existence of AMN-Decision, -Action, and -Feedback subnetworks that are distributed across lobes, forming a temporally sequential within-network processing stream by which the brain adjudicates between possible goals, sets action plans, and modifies those plans in response to feedback such as pain. A subnetwork in the pars marginalis of the cingulate was distinct from the Decision, Action, and Feedback subnetworks and may be important for the construction of the bodily self.",

However, the underlying toughening mechanisms, veiled by nonlinearities and complex network interactions, remains unclear. Here, we employ a three-dimensional soft–hard composite (SH- com ) framework by arranging randomly distributed linear-elastic soft and hard elements to explore the toughening mechanisms of soft–hard composites, while shielding the influence of complex nonlinearities and network architectures. Key features observed in soft–hard composites, including mechanical hysteresis, sacrificial bond-driven toughening, and brittle-to-ductile (BTD) transitions, are successfully reproduced, suggesting that the simplest model captures the essence of toughening in soft–hard composites. Visualization of internal fracture reveals distinct fracture patterns associated with the BTD transition, while numerical and theoretical analyses elucidate its mechanical origins. Furthermore, we identify an optimal toughening composition governed by a unified scaling relation linked to the fracture toughness ratio between soft and hard components. A fundamental toughening phase diagram is also established in terms of strength and toughness. This work sheds light on the underlying toughening landscape of soft–hard composite systems.",

However, their practical application has long been limited because pure Os exhibits excessively strong adsorption of intermediates and suffers from stability issues. Herein, we report the development of a highly stable catalyst achieved by implanting the sulfur (S) atom into the matrix, facilitating the transformation of Os nanocrystals into Os single atoms. The prepared atomically dispersed Os catalyst (Os-SA@SNC) demonstrates outstanding catalytic activity, requiring only a 13 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, as well as the excellent durability. This performance surpasses that of commercial Pt/C and outperforms most of the reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Theoretical simulations clarify the important role of S atoms in promoting the dispersion and diffusion of Os atoms. Moreover, density functional theory calculations indicate that S atoms adjust the local electronic structure of Os active sites, further facilitating the adsorption/dissociation of H 2 O and optimizing the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG *H ), thereby accelerating the kinetics of both the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps in alkaline HER. This work revitalizes Os-based catalysts for energy conversion and paves the way for innovative HER catalyst design and application to contaminated soil/water remediation.",

Herein, we identify a peculiar electroinduced thiol to thione tautomerization of 4-mercaptopyridine (4MPy) molecule on Cu catalyst surfaces at this triple-phase interface driven by cathodic polarization. This leads to a significant performance improvement of CO 2 RR on Cu with a C 2+ Faradaic efficiency of over 80% with more than 60% C 2 H 4 , as well as a 300 mV reduction of cell voltage compared to bare Cu. A home-designed MEA-type operando Raman cell enables mechanistic studies directly under a current density of over 100 mA cm −2 , elucidating the intricate impacts of the 4MPy tautomerization on the local catalytic environments under real reaction conditions. Surprisingly, this tautomerization does not occur in other commonly utilized electrolyzers, e.g., flow cell and H-cell, even with the same catalyst and electrolyte conditions. The direct contact with the electrolyte in the latter cells was found to cause rapid desorption of 4MPy from the catalyst surface before its possible chemical transformation. These results highlight the opportunities of utilizing surface molecular tautomerization to promote CO 2 RR performance and using the triple phase of MEA to drive reactions that would otherwise be hard to happen in classical electrochemical devices of similar conditions.",

The scientific community has largely reacted negatively to the directive, fearing that the way oversight by political appointees is specified in the order will lead to interference in the curiosity-driven process of science. This distress is understandable given the administration’s abrupt and arbitrary actions to cut research funding and curtail or even stop the participation of foreign students in research. The United States has been a global leader in science because of high levels of funding, less government interference, and participation of the best talent from around the world.

However, their impact on the system’s many-body electronic phase diagram remains largely unexplored. We present local compressibility measurements revealing numerous incompressible states resulting from supermoiré-lattice-scale isospin symmetry breaking driven by strong interactions. By using the supermoiré lattice occupancy as a probe of isospin symmetry, we observe an unexpected doubling of the miniband filling near ν = − 2 , possibly indicating a hidden phase transition or normal-state pairing proximal to the superconducting phase. Our work establishes supermoiré lattices as a tunable parameter for designing quantum phases and an effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in moiré materials.",

All of this was suddenly disrupted in 2019 by a rude awakening. Starlink communication satellites began to photo-bomb astronomers’ images as they streaked across the sky.

In this work, we used triggered anyon pulses incident on a QPC in a filling factor ν = 1/3 FQH fluid to investigate anyon tunneling in the time domain. We observed that braiding increases the tunneling timescale, which is set by the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension that characterizes the edge-state dynamics.

We found that GGCX could undergo topology inversion to carboxylate MAVS within the cytoplasm. This carboxylation enhanced the ability of MAVS to induce type I interferons while suppressing the induction of apoptosis. Genetic knockout of GGCX, a VK-free diet, or depletion of VK by inhibiting VK epoxide reductase 1 with warfarin increased viral susceptibility in mice.

Mcl-1 Bcl-xL/Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1 Bcl-2/Bcl-2 mice were born on a mixed background, though they showed metabolic defects. Thus MCL-1’s apoptosis-unrelated functions appear critical in later development, with BCL-XL, but not BCL-2, partially compensating. These findings clarify MCL-1’s distinct physiological roles, critically informing MCL-1 inhibitor development as cancer therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Continuous adult hippocampal neurogenesis is involved in memory formation and mood regulation but is challenging to study in humans. Difficulties finding proliferating progenitor cells called into question whether and how new neurons may be generated. We analyzed the human hippocampus from birth through adulthood by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We identified all neural progenitor cell stages in early childhood. In adults, using antibodies against the proliferation marker Ki67 and machine learning algorithms, we found proliferating neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, transcriptomic data showed that neural progenitors were localized within the dentate gyrus. The results contribute to understanding neurogenesis in adult humans.",

          "abstract": "Centromeres are epigenetically specified by distinct chromatin, whereas their DNA varies between species and individuals. This extensive sequence divergence makes comparative analyses between centromeres challenging. In this study, we identified a chromosome-specific architectural pattern across the human genome, defined by the conserved spacing of a functionally relevant centromeric DNA motif. The distribution of these sites along chromosome arms constitutes the human “centeny map.” By using a custom Genomic Centromere Profiling (GCP) pipeline, we leveraged the motif’s position, orientation, and organization to construct structural models that enable reclassification of human chromosomal clusters, detection of centromere expansion, and identification of structural variants and misassembled regions. The high-resolution maps derived from this pattern not only provide a framework for comparative analysis of centromeres across evolution and disease but also offer a new dimension for chromosome annotation, assembly, and characterization.",

The key performance metrics of these devices, such as sensitivity, efficiency, and bandwidth of ultrasonic transducers, are largely determined by the piezoelectric properties. This Review highlights recent research progress in improving the piezoelectricity of ferroelectric materials and offers potential strategies for further enhancement to meet the ever-increasing demands for high-performance piezoelectric devices and systems. It provides insights into the future development of ferroelectrics to address the increasing demands of emerging applications, including photoacoustic imaging and piezoelectric fans and motors in integrated circuit–enabled electronic devices. Additionally, it emphasizes the need to consider environmental impacts across the entire life cycle of ferroelectrics, from sourcing and manufacturing to usage and disposal.",

          "abstract": "Current research on ferroelectric polymers centers predominantly on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)–based fluoropolymers because of their superior performance. However, they are considered “forever chemicals” with environmental concerns. We describe a family of rationally designed fluorine-free ferroelectric polymers, featuring a polyoxypropylene main chain and disulfonyl alkyl side chains with a C3 spacer: −SO 2 CH 2 CHRCH 2 SO 2 − (R = −H or −CH 3 ). Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate that strong dipole-dipole interactions between neighboring disulfonyl groups induce ferroelectric ordering in the condensed state, which can be tailored by changing the R group: ferroelectric for R = −H or relaxor ferroelectric for R = −CH 3 . At low electric fields, the relaxor polymer exhibits electroactuation and electrocaloric performance comparable with those of state-of-the-art PVDF-based tetrapolymers.",

We argue that such inconsistencies result from confounding geographical influences that mask the true relationship between species richness and energy-related factors. Here, by comparing species richness across different climate conditions, we disentangle the direct effects of temperature, precipitation, and primary productivity from the confounding impacts of the area and isolation of various climates. Using a global analysis of terrestrial vertebrates, we reveal clear and consistent relationships between energy-related factors and species richness. Our findings clarify existing ecological theory and illustrate how adopting a climate space perspective advances biodiversity research, providing critical insights into biodiversity patterns and their responses to environmental change.",

We also identified ZFP91 as a representative Zincore client, binding the conserved promoter motif CTTTAAR. Cryo–electron microscopy of a Zincore-ZFP91-DNA complex revealed a SEPHS1 arginine clamp to recognize the DNA-bound zinc finger domains. This mode of binding explains recognition of different ZNFs and stabilizes ZFP91 onto its cognate DNA motif. Thus, our study identified Zincore as a ZNF-specific coregulator essential for development, involving a distinctive mechanism that locks ZNFs onto DNA and regulates transcription.",

In this work, we prove that local quantum circuits can form random unitaries in extremely low depth on any geometry. These shallow circuits have low complexity and create only short-range correlations, yet are indistinguishable from random unitaries with exponential complexity. This finding contrasts sharply with classical systems, in which a long evolution time is required to appear random. Our results have widespread applications across quantum science, from device benchmarking to quantum advantages. Moreover, they reveal that fundamental physical properties—including evolution time, causal structure, and phases of matter—are provably hard to learn.",

The wooden implements include digging sticks and small, complete, hand-held pointed tools. The sophistication of many of these tools offsets the seemingly “primitive” aspects of stone tool assemblages in the East Asian Early Paleolithic.

          "abstract": "Understanding the impacts of climate change on food systems is a key research priority, but important sectors and the scope for adaptation remain underexplored. Here, we analyze more than 320 million daily observations of milk production across 12 years, paired with survey data, to provide estimates of the effect of humid heat and the scope for adaptation. Results indicate that extreme heat reduces milk yield by up to 10%, with effects that persist for more than 10 days. Effects are stronger when cows are at more productive stages, suggesting a productivity-resilience trade-off. Cooling infrastructure and management adjustments were widely adopted over the preceding two decades, but only partially mitigate these losses, reducing them by less than half. Given the technological advancement and the representation of the climate of key producing countries in our sample, these results suggest that adaptation strategies, even those at the technological frontier, may be insufficient to address climate change damages.",

          "abstract": "Mass media represents a primary avenue for research to reach diverse publics, but relatively few peer-reviewed scientific papers become popular science news. Numerous gatekeepers determine which research manuscripts complete this dissemination pathway, and the resulting media landscape influences public understandings of scientific fields. Here, we compare scientific and popular publishing of archaeology about different geographic regions. Of 1155 archaeology papers in one specialist and six general science journals across 6 years, 32% were reported by at least one of 15 US news sources. Mixed-effects logistic regression models revealed variation across news sources, but overall papers about archaeology in United Kingdom, Israel/Palestine, and Australia were significantly more likely to receive coverage, compared to China/Taiwan. This disparity raises concerns as archaeology influences notions of identity and cultural achievement, and has been misappropriated by racist, nationalist ideologies. We recommend ways for actors in research dissemination to diversify archaeology coverage.",

          "abstract": "Selective inhibition of the more than 100 S1 family serine proteases is a long-standing challenge due to their active site similarity. Mesotrypsin, implicated in cancer progression, exemplifies these difficulties; no current inhibitors achieve selectivity over other human trypsins. We found an unexpected autoinhibited conformation of mesotrypsin via x-ray crystallography, revealing a cryptic pocket adjacent to the active site. Using high-throughput virtual screening targeting this cryptic pocket, we identified a conformationally selective small-molecule inhibitor that stabilizes the inactive state of mesotrypsin. This inhibitor demonstrates selectivity for mesotrypsin over other trypsins. Our findings challenge the accepted view of digestive trypsins as constitutively active enzymes lacking potential for allosteric regulation. Furthermore, analyses of other structures suggest that dynamic sampling of closed states with analogous allosteric cryptic pockets appears widespread among S1 serine proteases. These observations point to a potentially generalizable strategy to achieve selective inhibition, offering broad implications for drug development targeting serine proteases in cancer and other diseases.",

We present archaeological data from the lake landscape of Neumark-Nord (Germany), where Last Interglacial Neanderthals processed at least 172 large mammals at a water’s edge site. Their (partial) carcasses were transported to this location for the extraction of within-bone nutrients, particularly bone grease.

However, while exceptional plasticity was recently discovered in a series of low-symmetry semiconductors, their deformation mechanism remains mysterious. Here, taking monoclinic Ag 4 SSe as a case study, we show that the inherent high-symmetry anion sublattice with a quasi–body-centered cubic (bcc) structure is embedded in the monoclinic matrix. This, coupled with the highly diffuse cations, results in multiple slip systems and is responsible for the superior plasticity as normally unexpected in low-symmetry structures. We observe typical slip systems conforming with those of the bcc structure by experiment. This finding clarifies the deformation mechanism of Ag 2 S-based low-symmetry semiconductors and sheds light on future exploration of ductile inorganic semiconductors.",

In addition, we demonstrate that reintroduction of PPE71 into the L2 strain HN878 suppresses the baseline elevation of these transcripts, while overexpression of PPE71 increases the localization of PE_PGRS proteins and lipoproteins to the M.tb outer mycomembrane. Mouse infection confirmed the hypervirulence of the PPE71 – 38 deletion strain and conversely showed that PPE71 overexpression attenuates M.tb .

It remains unclear how various hydrophobic environments stabilize membrane proteins and whether lipids play any unique role in protein stability compared to other types of amphiphiles. Here, using the evolutionarily unrelated α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins from Escherichia coli , we find that the hydrophobic thickness and the strength of amphiphile-amphiphile packing in amphiphilic assemblies are critical determinants of protein stability. Lipid solvation enhances protein stability by facilitating residue burial in the protein interior, reminiscent of the lipophobic effect. This lipid-mediated mechanism also strengthens the cooperative residue-interaction network, promoting the propagation of local structural perturbations throughout the protein. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of lipid solvation in modulating the stability of membrane proteins and their responses to external stimuli.",

Here, we show how simultaneous upscale and downscale energy transfers occur in solar wind, leading statistically to equipartition of the turbulent energy flux. Our study sheds light on the paradigm of the existence of dual energy cascades in astrophysical plasmas, identifying the scales at which energy sources act in the magnetohydrodynamic regime driving turbulent dynamics in solar wind. These findings suggest that a significant fraction of the energy injected into stellar winds at scales much smaller than those of galaxies could be transferred to larger scales through turbulence, potentially influencing star formation processes.",

          "abstract": "Because of the inferior thermoelectric performance of metals, the semiconductor-to-metal transition in thermoelectric materials is always avoided. Here, we demonstrate that α-to-β semiconductor-metal transition in MgAgSb is actually not detrimental but can be strategically exploited to create α/β-MgAgSb junction, enabling 150% enhancement in output power while maintaining high conversion efficiency. This power enhancement lies in the notably reduced internal resistance induced by semiconductor-to-metal transition, which is independent of dimensional changes. Consequently, α/β-MgAgSb can simultaneously achieve high maximum conversion efficiency exceeding 10% (9%) and maximum power density above 1 (0.9) W cm −2 by simulation (experiment), outperforming most p-type materials under identical conditions. In addition, a two-pair thermoelectric module combining α/β-MgAgSb with n-type Mg 3 Sb 0.6 Bi 1.4 achieves an unprecedented power density, representing notable advancements over existing Mg 3 (Sb,Bi) 2 /MgAgSb two-pair system.

To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that teach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at high throughputs. We demonstrate the performance of this approach by autonomously driving a 4-DOF robotic probe for 24 hours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3025 uniquely predicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions, achieving throughputs of more than 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and regions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing defects. With this self-supervised neural network–driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.",

We characterized the universality of hundreds of thousands of representational dimensions from networks with different architectures, tasks, and training data. We found that diverse networks learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite having highly distinct designs. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network’s specific characteristics. Each network can be reduced to fewer than 10 of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the brain. These results suggest that the underlying similarities between artificial and biological vision are primarily governed by a core set of universal representations that are convergently learned by diverse systems.",

By leveraging a rodent-adapted strain of S. aureus , we developed a natural model of SSTIs. We found that LukMF′, a pore-forming leukocidin homolog to the human-specific LukSF-PV toxin, drives skin pathology in mice. LukMF′ lyses neutrophils via the chemokine receptor CCR1, which in turn fuels inflammatory pathology and microbial survival within the infectious nidus. Ablation of CCR1, depletion of neutrophils, or vaccination with LukMF′ all protected mice from skin pathology.

We found that α-2,3-sialyltransferases ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 and corresponding α-2,3–linked sialosides are up-regulated in melanoma compared to nevi and are essential for melanoma growth. Glycoproteomics revealed that glycoprotein targets of ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 are enriched in transmembrane proteins involved in growth signaling, including the amino acid transporter SLC3A2/CD98hc. CD98hc suppression mimicked the effect of ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 silencing, inhibiting melanoma cell proliferation. We found that both CD98hc protein stability and its prosurvival effect on melanoma are dependent upon α-2,3-sialylation mediated by ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2.

          "abstract": "Metazoan nucleosomes harboring H3K79 methylation (H3K79me) deposited by the methyltransferase DOT1L (disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like) decorate actively transcribed genes. While DOT1L regulates transcription and the pathogenesis of leukemia and neurological disorders, the role of H3K79me remains elusive. Here, we reveal a functional synergism between H3K79me and H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) in regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation. Simultaneous catalytic inactivation of DOT1L and the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2 (SET domain containing 2) leads to hyperactive transcription and failures in neural differentiation. H3K79me/H3K36me3 loss causes increased transcription elongation, gained chromatin accessibility at a group of enhancers, and increased recruitment of TEAD4 (TEA domain transcription factor 4) and its coactivator YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) to these enhancers. Furthermore, YAP-TEAD inhibition restores the expression levels of genes hyperactivated by H3K79me/H3K36me3 loss. Together, we demonstrate a synergism of H3K79me and H3K36me3 in regulating transcription and cell fate transition, unveil the underlying mechanisms, and provide insight into targeting diseases driven by misregulation/mutations of DOT1L and/or SETD2.",

FeGe has been found to develop a charge density wave (CDW) order within magnetic phase, suggesting an intricate interplay of the lattice, charge, and spin degrees of freedom. Recently, postgrowth annealing has been proposed to tune the CDW order from long-range to complete suppression, offering a tuning knob for the CDW order. Here, by comparing the electronic structures of FeGe subjected to different annealing conditions and distinct CDW properties, we report spectral evolution associated with the lattice and spin degrees of freedom. We find band evolution linked to a spin density wave (SDW) order present in both samples with and without CDW order, and another evolution connected to the lattice distortions that onset with the long-range CDW order and revert with the SDW order. Our results reveal a rare competitive cooperation of the lattice, spin, and charge in FeGe.",

We identified distinct molecular features linked to pCR in each subtype: elevated cell proliferation in patients with ER − HER2 − pCR, higher CDKN2A methylation in patients with ER − HER2 − RD, increased KIT methylation in patients with ER − HER2 + RD, and MAP4K1 hypermethylation in patients with ER + HER2 + RD. These findings were subsequently validated in independent datasets. By integrating clinical and multiomic data, we developed MOPCR, a subtype-specific machine learning model that outperformed single-omic approaches in predicting treatment response. MOPCR demonstrated potential generalizability across cohorts and provided preliminary stratification of patient subgroups with higher pCR probability, offering valuable insights for precision cancer management.",

Mapping the generation and propagation of PA and PT waves with high resolution is important to elucidate the interaction between nonradiative fields and biological systems. To this end, we introduce spatial-offset pump-probe imaging (SOPPI). By spatially offsetting the pump beam and the probe beam, SOPPI allows simultaneous imaging of PA/PT wave propagation with nanosecond temporal resolution, micrometer spatial resolution, 65-megahertz detection bandwidth, and a sensitivity of 9.9-pascal noise equivalent pressure. First, the PA and PT evolution from a fiber emitter and the subsequent wave interaction with a mouse skull and brain slices are demonstrated. Then, using water as the absorber, a wavelength-dependent PA/PT generation, evanescent wave–generated PA, and a back-propagated acoustic Mach cone with a tapered fiber are recorded. At last, a SOPPI-PACT is developed to reconstruct the pigment distribution inside a zebrafish larva with high precision and signal-to-noise ratio.",

The Rab11 family (Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25) controls the return of internalized cargos to the plasma membrane, and Rab25 has been implicated in the aggressiveness of cancer by promoting invasive migration. However, while Rab25 vesicles distribute to the leading edge of moving cells, how directly they contribute to cell protrusion is not clear. Here, we adopt a magnetogenetic approach that allows direct manipulation of Rab25 positioning to show that localization to the cell periphery drives the formation of F-actin protrusions. We demonstrate that endogenous Rab25 vesicles coordinate the positioning of key cargos, including the actin regulator FMNL1 and integrin β1, with the activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases at the plasma membrane to generate and maintain F-actin–rich filopodium-like protrusions and promote cancer cell invasive migration in the three-dimensional matrix.",

Amyloid-β, the main component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease, has been shown to be generated in the presence of microbes. Entrapment of microbes by aggregated amyloid-β may serve as an innate immune response to pathogenic infections. To understand the association of amyloid-β plaques and pathogenic infections in the central nervous system, we obtained viable short-interval postmortem human retinal tissue and generated human retinal organoids that contain electrophysiologically active neurons. Here, we demonstrate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces amyloid-β extracellular protein aggregates in human retinal explants and retinal organoids. Last, pharmacological inhibition of neuropilin-1 resulted in reduced amyloid-β deposition in human retinal explants treated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike 1 protein.

Instead, proxy data and model simulations reveal the persistent presence of seasonal sea ice cover and open water phytoplankton blooms during both glacial and interglacial times.

Our findings demonstrate that MФ-NDs interact directly with bacteria, disrupting their membranes, inducing leakage of intracellular contents, and ultimately causing bacterial death. Meanwhile, MФ-NDs reduce intracellular bacterial count. In a mouse model of systemic MRSA infection, treatment with MФ-NDs significantly improves survival rates in both therapeutic and preventative contexts. Moreover, MФ-NDs show a lower propensity to induce bacterial resistance compared to conventional small-molecule antibiotics. No acute toxicity is observed in mice treated with MФ-NDs. Overall, this study underscores the straightforward fabrication and promising potential of MФ-NDs for addressing antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.",

We performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in human epithelial cells to identify modulators of SFA toxicity. The screen revealed peroxisomal proteins, especially those that affect ether lipid synthesis, as important regulators of lipotoxicity. We identified Fas-associated factor family member 2 (FAF2) as a critical bifunctional coregulator of peroxisomal and fatty acid biology. We further demonstrated the requirement of the ubiquitin-regulatory X (UBX) and UAS thioredoxin-like domains of FAF2 for peroxisomal protein abundance and SFA-induced cellular stress.

Our findings show increased magmatic oxidation states linked to the enrichment of terrigenous sediments from Neo-Tethys subduction to postcollision, as evidenced by distinctive mass-independent Hg isotope fractionation in postcollisional porphyries (Δ 199 Hg = −0.25 to 0.22‰) and mantle-derived ultrapotassic rocks (Δ 199 Hg = −0.54 to 0.25‰) and negative δ 26 Mg values in ultrapotassic rocks (δ 26 Mg = −0.51 to −0.04‰). These results suggest that oxidation of postcollisional magmas was driven by the subduction of carbonates and/or sulfates from the Indian plate, enhancing metal enrichment.

Specifically, missense p53 (misp53) GOF mutations associate with therapy resistance and worse clinical outcomes. However, the molecular functions of distinct misp53 mutants in plasticity and therapy response remain unclear. Integrating multicenter patient data and multi-omics, we report that the misp53 R273H/C mutant is associated with cell cycle progression and a basal-like state compared to the misp53 R248W/Q mutant. Loss of misp53 R273H/C decreased tumor growth and liver metastasis while prolonging survival in preclinical models. We found that misp53 R273H/C specifically regulated the Rb/DREAM axis involved in cell cycle regulation. Notably, a clinical CDK4/6 inhibitor reduced misp53 R273H/C mutant expression. However, it triggered MAPK/ERK-mediated resistance mechanisms, enhancing cell survival and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combining MAPK/ERK and CDK4/6 inhibitors reduced misp53 R273H/C -associated oncogenic functions. Thus, distinct misp53 mutants show unique cell-intrinsic plasticity, therapeutic vulnerabilities, and resistance mechanisms.",

Here, we investigate their effects following transport into the accretionary wedge by integrating discrete-element modeling with three-dimensional seismic interpretation. We find that the typical dips of the incoming PFSs overlap with modeled dips prone to reactivation and confirm that subducting PFSs can be reactivated and gradually evolve into major thrust faults. Comparisons with electromagnetic data indicate that PFSs may provide conduits for fluid leakage along the plate interface, coincide with disrupted strata and decreased shear stress, and enhance geometric and stress heterogeneity along the megathrust. These suggest that PFSs may play a previously unrecognized role in contributing to shallow slow earthquake phenomena in subduction zones.",

In a pilot clinical study, among 15 eligible patients with HCC, 11 patients achieved complete response and 3 patients achieved partial responses without unexpected treatment-related adverse events during the 1 to 3 months’ follow-up. The objective response rate of Mg-enhanced TACE was ~93.3% in this small-scale trial, much higher than that of current TACE therapies.",

          "abstract": "Quantum Fisher information (QFI) quantifies the sensitivity of a quantum state to a parameter change and plays a key role in quantum metrology. Meanwhile, quantum coherence is a crucial resource for quantum information processing. However, despite extensive studies on various aspects of quantum metrology, the interplay between the dynamics of the QFI and quantum coherence remains unexplored. Here, we explore the factorization relationship between the QFI and quantum coherence, both theoretically and experimentally. We prepare pure states in qubit and qutrit systems and apply unitary evolution to investigate this relationship. Our results confirm the factorization law, offering strong evidence for this relationship. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound on the variance of the estimated parameter that does not require the final state information. This approach reveals a deep connection between the QFI and quantum coherence, providing insights into quantum parameter estimation. These findings have potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum metrology.",

Here, we propose a momentum-dependent field-effect transistor (MD-FET) to address this issue, in which a monolayer 2D semiconductor is sandwiched by two cross 1D carbon nanotube electrodes. The MD-FET enables a perfect off state, as the elastic tunneling is forbidden by the momentum mismatch between the cross 1D contacts. It can also access a substantial on state, because the momentum mismatch can be compensated by the electron-phonon scattering in a 2D channel. The MD-FET with sub–1-nm channel thus exhibits high on/off ratios of ~10 7 , which breaks through the theoretical limit on the short-channel effect. The MD-FET opens up a previously unknown paradigm to further scale down transistors beyond silicon and inspires a promising solution for the post-Moore era.",

To answer this question for the field of biomedical research, we present an unbiased, large-scale approach: We study vocabulary changes in more than 15 million biomedical abstracts from 2010 to 2024 indexed by PubMed and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This excess word analysis suggests that at least 13.5% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, reaching 40% for some subcorpora.

By contrast, a range of computational models implemented with biologically informed properties or optimized for visual recognition did not reach child-level performance.

Akin to LEGO construction, the various building blocks are arranged in different configurations, introducing diverse two-dimensional structures with higher energetic stability than previous structures. Regression analysis reveals the energies of these structures as a linear superposition of the energies of their building blocks, further confirming the LEGO concept.

Combining single-particle cryo–electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography with rhodopsin activation by light, we demonstrate that the arginine stabilizes an ultraviolet (UV)–absorbing intermediate of an extremely slow CryoRhodopsin photocycle. Together with extensive spectroscopic characterization, our investigations on CryoR1 and CryoR2 proteins reveal mechanisms of photoswitching in the identified group.

Such smart sensor systems involve a general topological optimization strategy for taxel layout design and a deep learning model called self-attention–assisted tactile SR. Driven by the proposed model, they can dynamically distinguish high-density pressure stimuli by generating 2700 virtual taxels from only 23 physical taxels. An SR scale factor of more than 115 and an average localization error of 0.73 millimeters are achieved, approximating human fingertip accuracy and surpassing current state-of-the-art solutions.

Similarly, while gene flow rates averaged over the past ~400,000 generations are very low among S. pistillata populations, P. verrucosa populations are well connected.

Loss of Lhx2 in either population caused similar but distinct phenotypes: reduced dendritic arbors, altered spine morphology, and changed electrophysiological properties. Morphometric defects were more severe when Lhx2 was disrupted in progenitors and were recapitulated by its specific loss in basal progenitors. Lhx2 loss in progenitors aberrantly up-regulated Neurog2 in postmitotic neurons, and Neurog2 knockdown partially rescued the phenotype.

However, current microrobots fabricated from soft magnetic materials exhibit critical limitations, including weak magnetic response and uncontrollable locomotion in high-rate blood flow, which hinder their practical applications. Here, we develop a fabrication method for three-dimensional (3D) hard magnetic microrobots (HM-microrobots) containing neodymium-iron-boron particles. HM-microrobots, featuring programmable 3D helical morphologies, are fabricated by integrating two-photon polymerization printing of molds in positive photoresist with subsequent vacuum infusion molding of hard magnetic slurries. The microrobots achieve a maximum swimming velocity of 22.6 body lengths per second (3 millimeters per second) in a weak rotating magnetic field of 2 millitesla, which represents a notable improvement over their soft magnetic counterparts. Furthermore, they demonstrate controllable upstream propulsion in subcentimeter-per-second blood flow, showing great potential for endovascular applications.",

          "abstract": "Highly efficient conversion of lignin into value-added chemicals and materials is trapped in the inevitable cleavage of β-O-4 linkages and formation of highly condensed structures with deep colors during lignin isolation. Here, we develop a trifunctional choline chloride/glyoxylic acid (ChCl/GA) binary deep eutectic solvent with a π-π conjugate structure and moderate acidity for the fast isolation of light-colored lignin with near proto-structures (exceeding 88% of delignification ratio for 1 hour). The synergetic interaction of GA and ChCl substantially reduced Gibbs free energy of acetal reaction and thoroughly captured reactive intermediates, precisely activating the following key functions: stabilizing β-O-4 linkages, inhibiting condensation reaction, and shielding –OH groups. These enabled efficient isolation of uncondensed, abundant β-O-4 linkage (45.80/100 C9; 79% retention) and light-colored lignin. A near-theoretical yield of aromatic monomers upon depolymerization and high performances as adhesives for lignocellulosic bioplastics were achieved. This work unleashes the valorization potential of lignin by a relatively green and fast strategy for sustainable biorefineries.",

In this study, we used a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced chorioamnionitis model in pregnant nonhuman primates to explore the therapeutic potential and mode of action of srIκB-loaded exosomes (Exo-srIκBs). Intraamniotic injection of LPS induced infiltration of BCL2A1-positive neutrophils and CD68-positive macrophages in the extraplacental membranes, causing fetal lung injury. Conversely, administration of Exo-srIκB via intraamniotic and intravenous routes (6.9 × 10 10 and 4 × 10 11 particle numbers, respectively) ameliorated these effects. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the decidua and bulk RNA sequencing of the choriodecidua highlighted that Exo-srIκB treatment mitigated LPS-induced inflammatory pathways, particularly in macrophages, leading to a cascade effect on neutrophils through NF-κB signaling inhibition. These findings underscore the potential of Exo-srIκB as a therapeutic strategy for chorioamnionitis.",

          "abstract": "Maternal behaviors, which are crucial for the survival of mammalian infants, require the coordinated operation of multiple brain regions to process infant cues, make decisions, and execute motor plans. Although these processes likely demand higher cognitive functions, the prefrontal areas that regulate limbic parental programs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) excitatory projection neurons promote alloparental caregiving behaviors in female mice. By chronic microendoscopy, we observed robust yet adaptable representations of pup-directed anticipatory and motor-related activities within the OFC. Some of these plastic responses were significantly overlapped with those related to nonsocial reward signals. The inactivation of OFC output reduced the phasic activities of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons specifically tied to pup retrieval and impaired the modulation of DA release to the ventral striatum during the acquisition of alloparental behaviors. These findings suggest that the OFC transiently boosts DA activity during the acquisition phase, thereby facilitating the manifestation of alloparental behaviors.",

          "abstract": "The endoribonuclease Dicer is a central component of the posttranscriptional gene silencing mechanism based on RNA interference (RNAi) in eukaryotes. The antiviral role of RNAi in mammalian cells remains controversial while a number of viral suppressors of RNAi (VSR) able to inhibit Dicer activity and promote infection have been identified. Here, we explored the integrity and functional role of Dicer during FMDV infection. These studies showed that the FMDV-encoded Leader protease (Lpro) specifically cleaves Dicer at a conserved DExD/H helicase motif releasing the complete N-terminal helicase domain. Dicer cleavage by Lpro suppressed small hairpin RNA (shRNA)–induced RNAi in swine cells. Silencing of Dicer conferred increased susceptibility to an Lpro-deficient FMDV, revealing a Dicer-dependent antiviral effect which can be effectively counteracted by Lpro. This mutant generated a remarkably different profile of viral small RNAs (vsRNAs) in infected cells compared with the wild-type virus. Overall, we identified a viral mechanism of dampening or modulating antiviral defenses based on Dicer proteolytic degradation.",

Elevated OPA1 levels in multiple cancers correlate with reduced therapy sensitivity and poor survival, calling for specific OPA1 GTPase inhibitors. A high-throughput screening of ~10,000 compounds identified MYLS22, a heterocyclic N -pyrazole derivative as a reversible, noncompetitive OPA1 GTPase inhibitor. MYLS22 engaged with OPA1 in vitro and in cells where it induced cristae remodeling and mitochondrial fragmentation contingent on intactness of its predicted OPA1 binding site. MYLS22 enhanced proapoptotic cytochrome c release and sensitized breast adenocarcinoma cells to anti–Bcl-2 therapy, without toxicity on noncancer cells. By MYLS22 structure-activity relationship studies, we obtained Opa1 inhibitor 0 (Opitor-0) that inhibited OPA1, promoted cytochrome c release, and restored anti–Bcl-2 therapy sensitivity more efficiently than MYLS22. These chemical probes validate OPA1 as a therapeutic target to increase cancer cell apoptosis at the mitochondrial level.",

Here, to investigate changes in the marine biological pump during the TICE, we measured barium isotopes (δ 138 Ba) in two marine limestone sections in the Antler foreland basin (USA). We found the largest positive δ 138 Ba shifts recorded in geological history, indicating increased marine export productivity in the Antler foreland basin, followed by the productivity-driven expansion of anoxia. The nearly identical stratigraphic trends, along with different absolute values in δ 138 Ba between the two sites, suggest spatial differences in marine biological pump intensity during the Early Mississippian. Earth system model simulations indicate that a global increase of 30% in marine export productivity is needed to explain observed changes. Our findings support the idea that an enhanced marine biological pump contributed to elevated organic carbon burial and the transition from a greenhouse climate to the LPIA.",

We have applied this formalism to rapid mapping of a temperature-composition phase diagram. Experimental determination of phase boundaries in thin films is autonomously interspersed with real-time updating of phase diagram prediction using CALPHAD. AMASE was able to accurately determine the eutectic phase diagram of the Sn-Bi thin-film system from a self-guided campaign covering just a small fraction of the phase space, translating to a sixfold reduction in the number of experiments.

Nonetheless, the complexities of self-regulating stress or structural characteristics through growth or gene expression render the anti-wrinkling of “nonliving” artificial surfaces using bionic principles a pressing yet formidable challenge. Here, inspired by nonliving dehydrated leaves, we propose an on-demand customizable, material invariant, parametric surface anti-wrinkling strategy using leaf vein–imitated boundary curvature–coupled constraints. This strategy allows for an exact surface customization with enhanced anti-wrinkling capability, tailored to specific anti-wrinkling demands while maintaining the original cross-section materials. The defined parameters, anti-wrinkling width and concave radius, are customized by the anti-wrinkling design criteria via the dimensionless dual-correction stiffness model, which are simple linear or quadratic functions of anti-wrinkling demands and cross-section properties. Experiments at different scales and materials validate the correctness of the design criteria. The strategy in this study is effective on diverse wrinkle-prone surfaces at multiple scales and can inform real engineering design of the nonliving artificial surfaces.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger metabolic adaptations that resemble those induced by influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here, we show that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) impairment, modeled by Ndufs4 deficiency, reprograms lung epithelial metabolism to promote IAV pathogenesis. In both Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mice and lung epithelial cells, OXPHOS deficiency increased glycolytic flux, diverting carbons into hexosamine and de novo sialic acid (SIA) biosynthesis pathways. This led to elevated sialylation and enhanced viral attachment. In Ndufs4 KO models, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase signaling was insufficient to blunt this increased metabolic flux. IAV infection further exacerbated this metabolic vulnerability, amplifying SIA and viral burden. Pharmacologic rerouting of glucose carbons with dichloroacetate reduced sialylation, viral replication, and inflammatory responses in Ndufs4 KO models. These findings reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction enhances IAV susceptibility by disrupting energy sensing and fueling viral receptor biosynthesis, highlighting the importance of epithelial metabolism in viral pathogenesis and suggesting metabolic modulation as a potential therapeutic.",
