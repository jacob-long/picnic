          "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence enables productivity gains from delegating tasks to machines 1 , it may facilitate the delegation of unethical behaviour 2 . This risk is highly relevant amid the rapid rise of ‘agentic’ artificial intelligence systems 3,4 . Here we demonstrate this risk by having human principals instruct machine agents to perform tasks with incentives to cheat. Requests for cheating increased when principals could induce machine dishonesty without telling the machine precisely what to do, through supervised learning or high-level goal setting. These effects held whether delegation was voluntary or mandatory. We also examined delegation via natural language to large language models 5 . Although the cheating requests by principals were not always higher for machine agents than for human agents, compliance diverged sharply: machines were far more likely than human agents to carry out fully unethical instructions. This compliance could be curbed, but usually not eliminated, with the injection of prohibitive, task-specific guardrails. Our results highlight ethical risks in the context of increasingly accessible and powerful machine delegation, and suggest design and policy strategies to mitigate them.",

          "abstract": "Owing to increasing demand for low-cost energy storage with secure material supply chains, the battery community is approaching a pivotal shift beyond conventional lithium-ion (Li-ion) towards next-generation cells. Technologies that include alkali-metal anodes, solid electrolytes and earth-abundant materials such as sodium (Na) and sulfur (S) are reaching commercialization in cells. The abuse tolerance and thermal runaway hazards of such technologies diverge from conventional Li-ion cells. Consequently, designing safe batteries with next-generation materials requires a holistic approach to characterize cells and to understand their responses to abuse conditions from the beginning to the end of life. Here we provide a Perspective on how the safety and abuse tolerance of cells are likely to change for up-and-coming technologies; challenges and opportunities for reimagining safe cell and battery designs; gaps in our knowledge; capabilities for understanding the hazards of thermal runaway and how to address them; how standard abuse tests may need to adapt to new challenges; and how research needs to support affected professionals, from pack designers to first responders, to manage hazards and ensure safe roll-out of next-generation cells into applications like electric vehicles (EVs). Finally, given the large number of next-generation technologies being explored, we encourage giving priority to safety-focused research in proportion to the rate of manufacturing scale-up of each specific technology.",

          "abstract": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by episodes of uncontrolled hypertension that occur in response to sensory stimuli after spinal cord injury (SCI)1. The fragmented understanding of the mechanisms underlying autonomic dysreflexia hampers the development of therapeutic strategies to manage this condition, leaving people with SCI at daily risk of heart attack and stroke2,3,4,5. Here we expose the neuronal architecture that develops after SCI and causes autonomic dysreflexia. In parallel, we uncover a competing, yet overlapping neuronal architecture activated by epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord that safely regulates blood pressure after SCI. The discovery that these adversarial neuronal architectures converge onto a single neuronal subpopulation provided a blueprint for the design of a mechanism-based intervention that reversed autonomic dysreflexia in mice, rats and humans with SCI. These results establish a path towards essential pivotal device clinical trials that will establish the safety and efficacy of epidural electrical stimulation for the effective treatment of autonomic dysreflexia in people with SCI.",

          "abstract": "Accretion disks in strong gravity ubiquitously produce winds, seen as blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray band of both stellar mass X-ray binaries (black holes and neutron stars) 1–4 and supermassive black holes 5 . Some of the most powerful winds (termed Eddington winds) are expected to arise from systems in which radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind material from the inner disk ( L ≳ L Edd ). These winds should be extremely fast and carry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive black holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism linking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies 6 . Here we show the XRISM Resolve spectrum of the galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, which reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines. This Compton-thick wind significantly attenuates the flux, making it appear faint, although it is intrinsically more luminous than usual ( L ≳ L Edd ). However, the wind is extremely slow, more consistent with the predictions of thermal-radiative winds launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disk than with the expected Eddington wind driven by radiation pressure from the inner disk. This puts new constraints on the origin of winds from bright accretion flows in binaries, but also highlights the very different origin required for the ultrafast ( v ~ 0.3 c ) winds seen in recent Resolve observations of a supermassive black hole at a similarly high Eddington ratio 7 .",

          "abstract": "Most neurodevelopmental disorders with single gene diagnoses act via haploinsufficiency, in which only one of the two gene copies is functional1. SCN2A haploinsufficiency is one of the most frequent causes of neurodevelopmental disorder, often presenting with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability and, in a subset of children, refractory epilepsy2. Here, using SCN2A haploinsufficiency as a proof-of-concept, we show that upregulation of the existing functional gene copy through CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) can rescue neurological-associated phenotypes in Scn2a haploinsufficient mice. We first show that restoring Scn2a expression in adolescent heterozygous Scn2a conditional knock-in mice rescues electrophysiological deficits associated with Scn2a haploinsufficiency (Scn2a+/−). Next, using an adeno-associated virus CRISPRa-based treatment in adolescent mice, we show that we can correct intrinsic and synaptic deficits in neocortical pyramidal cells, a major cell type that contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders and seizure aetiology in SCN2A haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, we find that systemic delivery of CRISPRa protects Scn2a+/− mice against chemoconvulsant-induced seizures. Finally, we also show that adeno-associated virus CRISPRa treatment rescues excitability in SCN2A haploinsufficient human stem-cell-derived neurons. Our results showcase the potential of this therapeutic approach to rescue SCN2A haploinsufficiency and demonstrates that rescue even at adolescent stages can ameliorate neurodevelopmental phenotypes.",

          "abstract": "Coral reefs form complex physical structures that can help to mitigate coastal flooding risk 1,2 . This function will be reduced by sea-level rise (SLR) and impaired reef growth caused by climate change and local anthropogenic stressors 3 . Water depths above reef surfaces are projected to increase as a result, but the magnitudes and timescales of this increase are poorly constrained, which limits modelling of coastal vulnerability 4,5 . Here we analyse fossil reef deposits to constrain links between reef ecology and growth potential across more than 400 tropical western Atlantic sites, and assess the magnitudes of resultant above-reef increases in water depth through to 2100 under various shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) emission scenarios. Our analysis predicts that more than 70% of tropical western Atlantic reefs will transition into net erosional states by 2040, but that if warming exceeds 2 °C (SSP2–4.5 and higher), nearly all reefs (at least 99%) will be eroding by 2100. The divergent trajectories of reef growth and SLR will thus magnify the effects of SLR; increases in water depth of around 0.3–0.5 m above the present are projected under all warming scenarios by 2060, but depth increases of 0.7–1.2 m are predicted by 2100 under scenarios in which warming surpasses 2 °C. This would increase the risk of flooding along vulnerable reef-fronted coasts and modify nearshore hydrodynamics and ecosystems. Reef restoration offers one pathway back to higher reef growth 6,7 , but would dampen the effects of SLR in 2100 only by around 0.3–0.4 m, and only when combined with aggressive climate mitigation.",

          "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates growth factor (GF) and nutrient signals to stimulate anabolic processes connected to cell growth and inhibit catabolic processes such as autophagy 1,2 . GF signalling through the tuberous sclerosis complex regulates the lysosomally localized small GTPase RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) 3 . Direct binding of RHEB–GTP to the mTOR kinase subunit of mTORC1 allosterically activates the kinase by inducing a large-scale conformational change 4 . Here we reconstituted mTORC1 activation on membranes by RHEB, RAGs and Ragulator. Cryo-electron microscopy showed that RAPTOR and mTOR interact directly with the membrane. Full engagement of the membrane anchors is required for optimal alignment of the catalytic residues in the mTOR kinase active site. Converging signals from GFs and nutrients drive mTORC1 recruitment to and activation on lysosomal membrane in a four-step process, consisting of (1) RAG–Ragulator-driven recruitment to within ~100 Å of the lysosomal membrane; (2) RHEB-driven recruitment to within ~40 Å; (3) RAPTOR–membrane engagement and intermediate enzyme activation; and (4) mTOR–membrane engagement and full enzyme activation. RHEB and membrane engagement combined leads to full catalytic activation and structurally explains GF and nutrient signal integration at the lysosome.",

          "abstract": "General reasoning represents a long-standing and formidable challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Recent breakthroughs, exemplified by large language models (LLMs) 1,2 and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting 3 , have achieved considerable success on foundational reasoning tasks. However, this success is heavily contingent on extensive human-annotated demonstrations and the capabilities of models are still insufficient for more complex problems. Here we show that the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning (RL), obviating the need for human-labelled reasoning trajectories. The proposed RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as self-reflection, verification and dynamic strategy adaptation. Consequently, the trained model achieves superior performance on verifiable tasks such as mathematics, coding competitions and STEM fields, surpassing its counterparts trained through conventional supervised learning on human demonstrations. Moreover, the emergent reasoning patterns exhibited by these large-scale models can be systematically used to guide and enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models.",

          "abstract": "Directly visualizing vibrational anisotropy in individual phonon modes is essential for understanding a wide range of intriguing optical, thermal and elastic phenomena in materials1,2,3,4,5. Although conventional optical and diffraction techniques have been used to estimate vibrational anisotropies, they fall short in achieving the spatial and energy resolution necessary to provide detailed information4,5,6,7. Here, we introduce a new form of momentum-selective electron energy-loss spectroscopy, which enables the element-resolved imaging of frequency- and symmetry-dependent vibrational anisotropies with atomic resolution. Vibrational anisotropies manifest in different norms of orthogonal atomic displacements, known as thermal ellipsoids. Using the centrosymmetric strontium titanate as a model system, we observed two distinct types of oxygen vibrations with contrasting anisotropies: oblate thermal ellipsoids below 60 meV and prolate ones above 60 meV. In non-centrosymmetric barium titanate, our approach can detect subtle distortions of the oxygen octahedra by observing the unexpected modulation of q-selective signals between apical and equatorial oxygen sites near 55 meV, which originates from reduced crystal symmetry and may also be linked to ferroelectric polarization. These observations are quantitatively supported by theoretical modelling, which demonstrates the reliability of our approach. The measured frequency-dependent vibrational anisotropies shed new light on the dielectric and thermal behaviours governed by acoustic and optical phonons. The ability to visualize phonon eigenvectors at specific crystallographic sites with unprecedented spatial and energy resolution opens new avenues for exploring dielectric, optical, thermal and superconducting properties.",

          "abstract": "Wildfire activity has increased in the US and is projected to accelerate under future climate change 1–3. However, our understanding of the impacts of climate change on wildfire activity, smoke, and health outcomes remains highly uncertain, due to the difficulty of modeling the causal chain from climate to wildfire to air pollution and health. Here we quantify the mortality burden in the US due to wildfire smoke fine particulate matter (PM2.5) under climate change. We construct an ensemble of statistical and machine learning models that link climate to wildfire smoke PM2.5, and empirically estimate smoke PM2.5-mortality relationships using data on all recorded deaths in the US. We project that smoke PM2.5 could result in 71,420 excess deaths (95% CI: 34,930 - 98,430) per year by 2050 under a high warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) – a 73% increase relative to estimated 2011-2020 average annual excess deaths from smoke. Cumulative excess deaths from smoke PM2.5 could reach 1.9 million between 2026-2055. We find evidence for mortality impacts of smoke PM2.5 that last up to three years after exposure. When monetized, climate-driven smoke deaths result in economic damages that exceed existing estimates of climate-driven damages from all other causes combined in the US 4,5. Our research suggests that the health impacts of climate-driven wildfire smoke could be among the most important and costly consequences of a warming climate in the US.",

          "abstract": "Neutrophils, the most abundant and biotoxic immune cells, extrude nuclear DNA into the extracellular space to maintain homeostasis. Termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), these protein-modified and decondensed extracellular DNA scaffolds control infection and are involved in coagulation, autoimmunity and cancer 1,2 . Here we show how myeloperoxidase (MPO), a highly expressed neutrophil protein, disassembles nucleosomes, thereby facilitating NET formation, yet also binds stably to NETs extracellularly. We describe how the oligomeric status of MPO governs both outcomes. MPO dimers interact with nucleosomal DNA using one protomer and concurrently dock into the nucleosome acidic patch with the other protomer. As a consequence, dimeric MPO displaces DNA from the core complex, culminating in nucleosome disassembly. On the other hand, MPO monomers stably interact with the nucleosome acidic patch without making concomitant DNA contacts, explaining how monomeric MPO binds to and licences NETs to confer hypohalous acid production in the extracellular space 3 . Our data demonstrate that the binding of MPO to chromatin is governed by specific molecular interactions that transform chromatin into a non-replicative, non-encoding state that offers new biological functions in a cell-free manner. We propose that MPO is, to our knowledge, the first member of a class of proteins that convert chromatin into an immune effector.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual decision-making is thought to be mediated by neuronal networks with attractor dynamics 1,2 . However, the dynamics underlying the complex neuronal responses during decision-making remain unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings of hundreds of neurons, combined with an unsupervised, deep-learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in the rat frontal cortex and striatum as animals accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes: an initial phase dominated by sensory inputs, followed by a phase dominated by autonomous dynamics, with the flow direction (that is, neural mode) largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that this transition marks the moment of decision commitment, that is, the time when the animal makes up its mind. To test this, we developed a simplified model of the dynamics to estimate a putative neurally inferred time of commitment (nTc) for each trial. This model captures diverse single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping 3,4 . The estimated nTc values were not time locked to stimulus or response timing but instead varied broadly across trials. If nTc marks commitment, evidence before this point should affect the decision, whereas evidence afterwards should not. Behavioural analysis aligned to nTc confirmed this prediction. Our findings show that decision commitment involves a rapid, coordinated transition in dynamical regime and neural mode and suggest that nTc offers a useful neural marker for studying rapid changes in internal brain state.",

          "abstract": "Delta-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), or GluDs, are members of the iGluR ligand-gated ion channel family, yet their function remains enigmatic1. Although GluDs are widely expressed in the brain, play key roles in synaptic organization, and harbor disease-linked mutations, whether they retain iGluR-like channel function is debated as currents have not been directly observed2,3. Here, we define GluDs as ligand-gated ion channels that are tightly regulated in cellular contexts by purifying human GluD2 (hGluD2) and directly characterizing its structure and function using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and bilayer recordings. We show that hGluD2 is activated by D-serine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), with augmented activation at physiological temperatures. We reveal that hGluD2 contains an ion channel directly coupled to clamshell-like ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which are coordinated by the amino terminal domain (ATD) above the ion channel. Ligand binding triggers channel opening via an asymmetric mechanism, and a cerebellar ataxia point mutation in the LBD rearranges the receptor architecture and induces leak currents. Our findings demonstrate that GluDs possess the intrinsic biophysical properties of ligand-gated ion channels, reconciling prior conflicting observations to establish a framework for understanding their cellular regulation and for developing therapies targeting GluD2.",

          "abstract": "Neuroendocrine and tuft cells are rare chemosensory epithelial lineages defined by the expression of ASCL1 and POU2F3 transcription factors, respectively. Neuroendocrine cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC), frequently display tuft-like subsets, a feature linked to poor patient outcomes1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The mechanisms driving neuroendocrine–tuft tumour heterogeneity and the origins of tuft-like cancers are unknown. Using multiple genetically engineered animal models of SCLC, we demonstrate that a basal cell of origin (but not the accepted neuroendocrine origin) generates neuroendocrine–tuft-like tumours that highly recapitulate human SCLC. Single-cell clonal analyses of basal-derived SCLC further uncovered unexpected transcriptional states, including an Atoh1+ state, and lineage trajectories underlying neuroendocrine–tuft plasticity. Uniquely in basal cells, the introduction of genetic alterations enriched in human tuft-like SCLC, including high MYC, PTEN loss and ASCL1 suppression, cooperates to promote tuft-like tumours. Transcriptomics of 944 human SCLCs revealed a basal-like subset and a tuft–ionocyte-like state that altogether demonstrate notable conservation between cancer states and normal basal cell injury response mechanisms10,11,12,13. Together, these data indicate that the basal cell is a probable origin for SCLC and other neuroendocrine–tuft cancers that can explain neuroendocrine–tuft heterogeneity, offering new insights for targeting lineage plasticity.",

Our approach involves rolling to transform 2D bioelectronic devices into 1D NeuroWorm, creating a multifunctional microfibre that houses longitudinally distributed electrode arrays for both bioelectrical and biomechanical monitoring. NeuroWorm effectively records high-quality spatio-temporal signals in situ while steerably advancing within the brain or on the muscle as needed. This allows for the dynamic targeting and shifting of desired monitoring sites. Implanted in muscle through a tiny incision, NeuroWorm provides stable bioelectrical monitoring in rats for more than 43 weeks. Even after 54 weeks of implantation in muscle, fibroblast encapsulation around the fibre remains negligible. Our NeuroWorm represents a platform that promotes a substantial advance in bioelectronics—from an immobile probe fixed in place to active, intelligent and living devices for long-term, minimally invasive and mobile evaluation of the nervous system.",

          "abstract": "The fin-to-limb transition in vertebrate evolution has been central to the study of how development underlies evolutionary change. In this context, the functional analysis of Hox gene regulation to infer evolutionary trajectories has been critical to explain the origin of new features. In tetrapods, the transcription of Hoxd genes in developing digits depends on a set of enhancers forming a large regulatory landscape1,2. The presence of a syntenic counterpart in zebrafish, which lacks digits, suggests deep homology3 or shared developmental foundations underlying distal fin and limbs. However, how this regulatory program evolved has remained unresolved. We genetically evaluated the function of the zebrafish Hoxd regulatory landscapes by comparatively assessing the effects of their full deletions. We show that, unlike in mice, deletion of these regions in fish does not disrupt hoxd gene transcription during distal fin development. By contrast, we found that this deficiency leads to the loss of expression within the cloaca, a structure related by ancestry to the mammalian urogenital sinus, and that distal hox13 genes are essential for correct cloacal formation. Because Hoxd gene regulation in the mouse urogenital sinus relies on enhancers located in this same chromatin domain that controls digit development, we propose that the current regulatory landscape active in distal limbs was co-opted as a whole in tetrapods from a pre-existing cloacal regulatory machinery.",

Bearing a hypertrophied skull roof and elaborate cranial ornamentation, members of the clade are considered to have evolved complex sociosexual systems1,2,3. Despite their importance in understanding behavioural ecology in Dinosauria, the absence of uncontested early diverging taxa has hindered our ability to reconstruct the origin and early evolution of the clade4,5,6,7. Here we describe Zavacephale rinpoche gen. et sp. nov., from the Lower Cretaceous Khuren Dukh Formation of Mongolia, the most skeletally complete and geologically oldest pachycephalosaurian discovered globally. Z. rinpoche exhibits a well-developed frontoparietal dome and preserves the clade’s first record of manual elements and gastroliths. Phylogenetic analysis recovered Z. rinpoche as one of the earliest diverging pachycephalosaurians, pushing back fossil evidence of the frontoparietal dome by at least 14 Myr and clarifying macroevolutionary trends in its assembly. We found that the earliest stage of dome evolution occurred by means of a frontal-first developmental pattern with retention of open supratemporal fenestra, mirroring proposed ontogenetic trajectories in some Late Cretaceous taxa. Finally, intraskeletal osteohistology of the frontoparietal dome and hindlimb demonstrate decoupling of sociosexual and somatic maturity in early pachycephalosaurians, with advanced dome development preceding terminal body size.",

          "abstract": "Brown and beige adipocytes express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial protein that dissociates respiration from ATP synthesis and promotes heat production and energy expenditure. However, UCP1−/− mice are not obese1,2,3,4,5, consistent with the existence of alternative mechanisms of thermogenesis6,7,8. Here we describe a UCP1-independent mechanism of thermogenesis involving ATP-consuming metabolism of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFA) in peroxisomes. These fatty acids are synthesized by fatty acid synthase using precursors derived from catabolism of branched-chain amino acids9 and our results indicate that β-oxidation of mmBCFAs is mediated by the peroxisomal protein acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). Notably, cold exposure upregulated proteins involved in both biosynthesis and β-oxidation of mmBCFA in thermogenic fat. Acute thermogenic stimuli promoted translocation of fatty acid synthase to peroxisomes. Brown-adipose-tissue-specific fatty acid synthase knockout decreased cold tolerance. Adipose-specific ACOX2 knockout also impaired cold tolerance and promoted diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Conversely, ACOX2 overexpression in adipose tissue enhanced thermogenesis independently of UCP1 and improved metabolic homeostasis. Using a peroxisome-localized temperature sensor named Pexo-TEMP, we found that ACOX2-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation raised intracellular temperature in brown adipocytes. These results identify a previously unrecognized role for peroxisomes in adipose tissue thermogenesis characterized by an mmBCFA synthesis and catabolism cycle.",

However, global projections remain incomplete, hindering effective policy interventions amid uncertain warming futures2. Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning framework to project global burned areas and wildfire emissions. This framework accounts for the impacts of future climate change on fire activity and quantifies associated premature deaths and radiative forcing from fire-induced particulate matter (PM2.5). Here we show that from 2010–2014 to 2095–2099, fire carbon emissions are projected to increase by 23% under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5. Increased fire-related aerosols reduce the 0.06 W m⁻² cooling effect north of 60°N. Projections show a surge in premature deaths from wildfire smoke, reaching 1.40 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.66–2.25) million annually during 2095–2099, roughly 6 times higher than current levels. Africa is projected to experience the greatest rise in fire-related deaths (11-fold), driven by emission changes and an aging population. Europe and the U.S. would experience a 1–2-fold increase under SSP2-4.5, linked to rising fire occurrences in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere. Overall, the health burden would become more evenly distributed across nations of differing development levels than present patterns, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts.",

However, modern-day processors often cannot meet the restrained power and time budgets of edge systems because of intrinsic limitations imposed by their architecture (von Neumann bottleneck) or domain conversions (analogue to digital and time to frequency). Here we propose an edge temporal-signal processor based on two in-materia computing systems for both feature extraction and classification, reaching near-software accuracy for the TI-46-Word1 and Google Speech Commands2 datasets. First, a nonlinear, room-temperature reconfigurable-nonlinear-processing-unit3,4 layer realizes analogue, time-domain feature extraction from the raw audio signals, similar to the human cochlea. Second, an analogue in-memory computing chip5, consisting of memristive crossbar arrays, implements a compact neural network trained on the extracted features for classification. With submillisecond latency, reconfigurable-nonlinear-processing-unit-based feature extraction consuming roughly 300 nJ per inference, and the analogue in-memory computing-based classifier using around 78 µJ (with potential for roughly 10 µJ)6, our findings offer a promising avenue for advancing the compactness, efficiency and performance of heterogeneous smart edge processors through in materia computing hardware.",

Using connectomics7,8,9, we identify a specific class of interneurons that provide GABAergic presynaptic inhibition to the axons of movement-encoding proprioceptors. These interneurons receive input from parallel excitatory and inhibitory descending pathways that are positioned to drive the interneurons in a context-specific and leg-specific manner. Calcium imaging from both the interneurons and their descending inputs confirms that their activity is correlated with self-generated but not passive leg movements. Taken together, our findings reveal a neural circuit that suppresses specific proprioceptive feedback signals during self-generated movements.",

However, their instability often compromises the operational performance of devices, strongly hindering their practical applications7,8. Here we employ a cross-linkable co-SAM to enhance the conformational stability of hole-selective SAMs against external stresses, while suppressing the formation of defects and voids in SAM during self-assembly. The azide-containing SAM can be thermally activated to form a cross-linked and densely assembled co-SAM with a thermally stable conformation and preferred orientation. This effectively minimizes substrate surface exposure caused by wiggling of loose SAMs under thermal stress, preventing perovskite decomposition. This enables a certified PCE of 26.92% to be achieved for the best-performing cell, which also possesses excellent thermal stability with negligible decay under maximum-power-point tracking at 85 °C for 1,000 h. It also retains >98% of initial PCE after 700 repetitive thermal cycles between −40 °C and 85 °C, representing the state of the art of the field. This work offers an in-depth understanding of SAM degradation mechanisms to guide the design of a more robust buried interface for SAM-based devices adopting high-roughness substrates to realize highly efficient and durable perovskite solar cells.",

Here we develop a mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach that leverages genetic diversity to nominate functional relationships between 285 metabolites and 11,868 proteins in living tissues. This method recapitulates protein–metabolite functional relationships mediated by direct physical interactions and local metabolic pathway regulation while nominating 3,542 previously undescribed relationships. With this foundation, we identify a mechanism of regulation over liver cysteine utilization and cholesterol handling, regulated by the poorly characterized protein LRRC58. We show that LRRC58 is the substrate adaptor of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates proteasomal degradation of CDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme of the catabolic shunt of cysteine to taurine1. Cysteine abundance regulates LRRC58-mediated CDO1 degradation, and depletion of LRRC58 is sufficient to stabilize CDO1 to drive consumption of cysteine to produce taurine. Taurine has a central role in cholesterol handling, promoting its excretion from the liver2, and we show that depletion of LRRC58 in hepatocytes increases cysteine flux to taurine and lowers hepatic cholesterol in mice. Uncovering the mechanism of LRRC58 control over cysteine catabolism exemplifies the utility of covariation MS to identify modes of protein regulation of metabolic processes.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making in healthcare relies on understanding patients’ past and current health states to predict and, ultimately, change their future course 1–3 . Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records 4,5 . However, their potential has not been fully investigated at scale. Here we modify the GPT 6 (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the progression and competing nature of human diseases. We train this model, Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million UK Biobank participants and validate it using external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual’s past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models. Delphi-2M’s generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years, and enabling the training of AI models that have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods 7 provide insights into Delphi-2M’s predictions, revealing clusters of co-morbidities within and across disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on future health, but also highlight biases learnt from training data. In summary, transformer-based models appear to be well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are applicable to population-scale datasets and provide insights into temporal dependencies between disease events, potentially improving the understanding of personalized health risks and informing precision medicine approaches.",

Here we discover that nicked end degradation, consistent with competing 5′ strand destabilization, can be promoted by Cas9-nickase mutations that relax nick positioning. We exploit this mechanism to engineer efficient prime editors with strikingly low indel errors. Combining this error-suppressing strategy with the latest efficiency-boosting architecture, we design a next-generation prime editor (vPE).

Our integrated experimental and theoretical findings indicate that the process proceeds through a redox sequence of Cu(I)/Cu(III)/Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I). Additionally, we managed to interrupt this sequence by temperature control and captured the reactivity of the copper species through various spectroscopic methods, facilitating in-depth mechanistic analysis. These findings shed light on the intricate behaviour of copper species and challenge the traditional mechanistic proposal for the reaction of Cu(I) with aryl iodide, thus providing fresh perspectives into the mechanistic aspect of the copper-catalysed coupling reactions.",

Furthermore, the symptoms endorsed by young individuals are not fully explained by the extent of p-tau deposition 2 , severely hampering therapeutic interventions. Here we observed a multicellular response prior to the onset of CTE p-tau pathology that correlates with number of years of RHI exposure in young people (less than 51 years of age) with RHI exposure, the majority of whom played American football. Leveraging single-nucleus RNA sequencing of tissue from 8 control individuals, 9 RHI-exposed individuals and 11 individuals with low-stage CTE, we identify SPP1-expressing inflammatory microglia, angiogenic and inflamed endothelial cells, astrocytosis and altered synaptic gene expression in those exposed to RHI. We also observe a significant loss of cortical sulcus layer 2/3 neurons independent of p-tau pathology. Finally, we identify TGFβ1 as a potential signal that mediates microglia–endothelial cell cross talk. These results provide robust evidence that multiple years of RHI is sufficient to induce lasting cellular alterations that may underlie p-tau deposition and help explain the early pathogenesis in young former contact sport athletes. Furthermore, these data identify specific cellular responses to RHI that may direct future identification of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CTE.",

          "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for multimodal sensing and stimulation bioelectronic fibres for both research and clinical applications1,2. However, existing fibres suffer from high rigidity, low component layout precision, limited functionality and low density of active components. These limitations arise from the challenge of integrating many components into one-dimensional fibre devices, especially owing to the incompatibility of conventional microfabrication methods (for example, photolithography) with curved, thin and long fibre structures2. As a result, limited applications have been demonstrated so far. Here we use ‘spiral transformation’ to convert two-dimensional thin films containing microfabricated devices into one-dimensional soft fibres. This approach allows for the fabrication of high-density multimodal soft bioelectronic fibres, termed Spiral-NeuroString (S-NeuroString), while enabling precise control on the longitudinal, angular and radial positioning and distribution of the functional components. Taking advantage of the biocompatibility of our soft fibres with the dynamic and soft gastrointestinal system, we proceed to show the feasibility of our S-NeuroString for post-operative multimodal continuous motility mapping and tissue stimulation in awake pigs. We further demonstrate multi-channel single-unit electrical recording in mouse brain for up to 4 months, and a fabrication capability to produce 1,280 channels within a 230-μm-diameter soft fibre. Our soft bioelectronic fibres offer a powerful platform for minimally invasive implantable electronics, where diverse sensing and stimulation functionalities can be effectively integrated.",

          "title": "Equity in science is a beautiful lie — and I’m done pretending",
          "authors": "Dolors Armenteras",
          "abstract": "For years, I thought equity in science was possible. I believed it in meeting rooms to which I had been invited to speak, until I realized that I had not been invited to shape the discussion. I believed it in working groups that applauded diversity, until I noticed that my ideas only landed when echoed by someone else. And international organizations regularly sought me out, but it was hardly ever for a leadership role.\n\nAcademia needs a more honest, scientific approach to DEI\n\nIn 2021, I proposed ways to build healthier collaborations between countries with unequal resources: currently they benefit mainly the wealthier partner (D. Armenteras Nature Ecol. Evol. 5, 1193–1194; 2021). The article resonated with scientists across Latin America, Africa and Asia, who thanked me for exposing these skewed partnerships. But what also stood out to me was that none of the committees and organizations that had so often solicited my input got in touch.\n\nMany scholars from historically overexploited countries (often referred to as the global south) expected that exposing the problem would trigger change. Four years on, I see it clearly: the scientific system was never designed for equity. For people whose privilege stems from geography, institutional reputation and inherited networks, the system works perfectly the way it is. That’s why institutions focus only on improved access and optics. They look like they are changing, but the same people retain control.\n\nI still believe in science and in justice. But I no longer think that power can be shared equitably in the current system. In 2023, I was invited to contribute to a global map charting the use of controlled fire in ecosystem management. This meant condensing 25 years of research into a 40-minute questionnaire for a chance to win an artwork made by an Indigenous artisan and, perhaps, be invited to a workshop. It was written in Spanish and framed as inclusive. But it exposed how the system works: extract specialist knowledge at low cost and mostly without giving credit, repackage it into global claims and call it collaboration. I declined.\n\nDecolonize scientific institutions, don’t just diversify them\n\nIn 2025, I was invited to contribute to a project developing a global standard for gathering fire data. It used all the right words: co-production, inclusion and diversity. It cited my work. But I wasn’t being invited to co-design or co-lead the project, or even as a peer — only to “contribute regional input”. Time commitment: less than 20 hours. Visibility: none. Influence: symbolic. When I declined, explaining my reasons, I received two replies. One was defensive: “You know I’d never reach out with a symbolic request,” sidestepping my actual concerns. The other was polite, affirming the project’s importance but failing to address its asymmetry. Neither academic offered co-authorship or fresh terms. Nothing changed. These weren’t bad people. That’s the hardest part. They were playing by the rules of a system that rewards extractive collaboration — especially when it’s wrapped in the language of equity.\n\nThe system doesn’t thrive just because of the people at the top. It holds strong because many scientists in less-privileged positions want to be included. Sometimes we are chosen — not for our ideas or our leadership, but because we tick the right box. A woman from Latin America, visible and qualified. But we don’t become a peer. Our work is not cited as often. Our students become local guides instead of co-authors. Grants continue to be written without us.",

          "authors": "Esme Hedley",
          "abstract": "Working scientist profiles\n\nThis article is part of an occasional series in which Nature profiles scientists with unusual career histories or outside interests.\n\nIn 2019, Jenna Keindel came across a research paper that would change her life. The Canadian, then aged 37, found it through a Facebook group of people affected by limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness. Keindel was diagnosed with it when she was 16.\n\nThe paper suggested that another condition, called anti-HMGCR myopathy, a rare autoimmune disease that causes severe muscle weakness, shared some symptoms with specific subtypes of LGMD and was sometimes misdiagnosed as LGMD.\n\nKeindel was struck by the similarity with her own symptoms. And because the paper was open access, and so free to view, she could read and digest the findings before sharing them with her clinical team at the Ottawa Hospital. They agreed it was worth testing her for the condition.\n\n“Doctors and specialists can’t possibly read every article that’s being published,” she says. “So, as a patient with a rare disease, you kind of have to also be a catalyst and a helper for finding those resources.”\n\nSix weeks later, her physician confirmed that Keindel did, in fact, have anti-HMGCR myopathy, not LGMD. Since receiving treatment to fit the new diagnosis, Keindel’s muscle deterioration has slowed considerably. She married in 2023 and now lives and works in Shawville, a small rural community in the northwest of Canada.\n\nKelly Cobey, who directs the Metaresearch and Open Science Program at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, celebrates Keindel’s story as evidence of the benefits of making research data accessible to everyone. Cobey’s work focuses on implementing open-science practices, promoting responsible research assessment and monitoring the quality of research reporting.\n\nJenna Keindel’s clinical experiences demonstrated to Cobey the life-changing benefits of sharing research with people receiving care.Credit: Jenna Keindel\n\nLast year, Cobey’s work in this area, and her focus on advancing awareness of predatory journals, earned her the John Maddox Prize in the early-career category.\n\nA joint initiative between Nature and Sense about Science, a London-based charity, the award celebrates scientists who speak up for sound science in the face of challenges, and who inspire others to do the same.\n\n“We just cannot underestimate how empowering people with information can literally change the course of their life,” says Cobey of Keindel’s story. “Patients need to be active in decision-making and how they’re cared for.\"\n\nCobey had first heard Keindel’s story in 2019, when she worked as an investigator and publications officer at the Ottawa Hospital’s Centre for Journalology. There, she spent half her time researching open science, research integrity, transparent research reporting and predatory journals, and the other half providing training and outreach on these topics.\n\nThe leader of the hospital’s patient–partner network, a link person between individuals interested in taking part in research and researchers looking to engage such people, suggested that Keindel’s story would be a good fit for a series of webinars and blogs that Cobey was developing. The aim of these was to demonstrate the benefits, some of them life-changing, of making information available to people receiving care.\n\nCobey dates her interest in open science and research assessment back to 2011, when she was studying for her PhD in social psychology at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. That year Diederik Stapel, an acclaimed social psychologist at nearby Tilburg University, was suspended on suspicion of widespread data fabrication. In November of the following year, a report concluded that he had fabricated and manipulated data across 55 publications over 15 years, including in chapters of his PhD dissertation at the University of Amsterdam in 1997. “When this happened, some of my early-career colleagues, postdocs or assistant professors retracted major chunks of their CVs as a consequence,” Cobey recalls.\n\nThe experience made her question how something like this could persist for so long. “I’m not saying open science will get at every sort of bad actor, but it was like, how was there no record, how was there no openness?”\n\nWorking Scientist career profiles\n\nCobey decided to look for roles that would allow her to question how research is carried out, incentivized and rewarded. When, in 2015, she came across the role of investigator and publications officer at the journalology centre in Ottawa, she had never heard of meta-research, the practice of applying rigorous methods and analysis to the methods and procedures of research itself.\n\nThe idea that the role would provide evidence to improve the research ecosystem appealed to her. She was also excited by the chance to teach about how to do and report research — topics that, typically, are not formally taught.\n\nClinical epidemiologist David Moher, who leads the journalology centre, remembers being struck by Cobey’s focus on the importance of evidence when he interviewed her for the role. Six years later, she was appointed to her current position, in which a typical day involves offering informal support to institutions. This includes guiding them on providing feedback on proposed federal-policy consultations on open science.\n\nIn her research programme, Cobey conducts a lot of audits on science policy. “In Canada, we have some really excellent science policies around open science, but if they’re not audited or monitored in any way, then what gets measured gets done and what doesn’t get measured doesn’t get done,” she says. For example, a 2023 paper1 that she co-authored found that only 3% of clinical trials in Canada met all three of the federally mandated criteria: prospective registration, reporting in the registry and publishing findings.\n\nCobey also produces tools for researchers wanting to implement open-science practices, such as creating data-management-plan templates for study designs commonly used in biomedicine.\n\nA predatory problem\n\nCobey’s interest in publishing practices led her to investigate the phenomenon of predatory journals: those that accept articles for publication without performing promised quality checks, such as peer review, and often solicit articles aggressively and indiscriminately.\n\nIn 2019, she co-authored a Comment article2 for Nature revealing that elite institutions, including Ivy League universities in the United States, were knowingly publishing in predatory journals. It called for researchers to be trained in how to select appropriate journals when submitting their work, and for a declaration on CVs that the individuals’ publication lists are free of predatory publications.\n\nCobey thinks that the discussion around predatory journals has opened the door to making the practices of all journals more transparent. Partnering with the Public Knowledge Project at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, Cobey has developed a tool called the Publication Facts Label (PFL). Inspired by food products’ nutrition labels, it lists information about the journal in which an article is published, including its acceptance rate; and about the article itself, such as the number of reviewers, details of the research funders and whether the data are available. The aim is to show whether journals or articles published using Open Journal Systems, a publication software platform used by more than 50,000 journals worldwide, adhere to scholarly standards..\n\nResearch assessment toolkit\n\nKarim Khan, a physician and medical researcher based in Vancouver, leads the Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the country’s federal medical research funder. Khan says that Cobey makes organizations take a hard look at their clinical-practice guidelines and their consensus statements.\n\nSupporting her Maddox Prize entry, he commended her for “seeing what needs to be done before others do”, highlighting her efforts to define predatory journals and predatory conferences and provide ways for people to avoid them. The two worked together in 2019 with 41 other leading scholars and publishers who met in Ottawa to establish an agreed definition of predatory publishing. Khan says it was impressive to watch Kelly create a mutually supportive group culture and praises her remarkable knowledge of the literature. “It’s like having studied all of Shakespeare versus someone who knows that one of the stories had something to do with star-crossed lovers,” he says.\n\nCobey’s Maddox Prize win also acknowledged her work with the Declaration On Research Assessment (DORA), a global initiative that aims to change the evaluation of scientific research outputs. It began in 2012, when a group of editors and publishers met to develop a set of recommendations to improve scholarly-research assessment. The idea was to encourage funders and institutions to move away from using publication in highly cited journals as the ultimate deciding factor of research merit. Now known as the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment, DORA covers all scholarly disciplines and has been signed by more than 26,000 individuals and organizations across 166 countries.\n\nCobey joined the DORA advisory board in 2020, becoming co-chair three years later. In this role, she speaks regularly with policymakers at all levels to change how research is assessed. One of her outputs as co-chair is a guide to responsible research. It outlines steps for individuals to design and execute a responsible research-assessment strategy at their institutions.",

          "authors": "Mariana Lenharo, Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "A US vaccine advisory panel decided Friday not to require prescriptions for COVID-19 vaccinations Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty\n\nAn influential panel of US vaccine advisers stopped short of recommending COVID-19 vaccines to the public, advising instead that people should make their own decisions in consultation with a health care provider. But some vaccine experts who spoke to Nature say that the decision should preserve both access to the vaccines and health-insurance programmes’ coverage of the shots.\n\nThe panel, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), narrowly voted against requiring a prescription for the vaccines. The ACIP’s findings help to determine which vaccinations are paid for by both government programmes and private health insurance companies, which fund health care for millions of US residents.\n\nWho is on RFK Jr’s new vaccine panel — and what will they do?\n\nAll 12 ACIP members were appointed by US health secretary and long-time anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who named five of the nominees only a few days ago. Many have made statements against COVID-19 vaccination or vaccine mandates. Kennedy fired the 17 previous members of the ACIP in June.\n\n“The ACIP is meant to provide concrete recommendations on vaccine policy, and today's votes on the informed consent process on COVID-19 … were extraordinarily vague,” said Sean O’Leary, an infectious disease paediatrician at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), in a news conference following the ACIP meeting.\n\nConfusion reigns\n\nThe panel’s decisions on COVID-19 vaccines capped two days of confusion and abrupt reversals by the panelists. The panel was scheduled to issue guidance Thursday on hepatitis B vaccination for newborn babies. But panelists delayed the decision until today and then decided today to delay the decision indefinitely, citing the need for more deliberation. “There's enough ambiguity here and enough remaining discussion about safety, effectiveness and timing that I believe that a vote today is premature”, said panel member Robert Malone, a physician and scientist.\n\nHow to stop mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B\n\nPanel members also voted today to reverse a decision they made yesterday on a childhood vaccine against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV). Panelists voted Thursday to recommend that a US government programme called Vaccines for Children, which provides free vaccinations to many US children, should continue to provide the MMRV vaccine for children under the age of 4; on Friday they voted that it should not.\n\n“It was a bit chaotic both yesterday and today,” says William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and a former member of the ACIP. “They’re all still getting their sea legs.”\n\nVaccine choices\n\nOn Thursday, panelists also voted against the general usage of the MMRV vaccine in children under the age of 4 years — a decision separate from their vote on the use of the MMRV vaccine in the Vaccines for Children programme.\n\nSince 2009, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that children receive their first dose of varicella (the virus that causes chicken pox) vaccine separately from their first dose of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The recommendation is based on a link between the MMRV vaccine and a slightly higher risk of fever-related seizures in children between one and two years of age.\n\nUnder the old guidelines, families could still opt for the single MMRV shot — for example, if they wanted to reduce the number of medical visits for their child. But the panel’s recommendation means that families will no longer have that choice, assuming the panel’s recommendations are approved by the acting CDC director.\n\nACIP member Cody Meissner, a paediatrics researcher at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine in Lebanon, New Hampshire, opposed the decision. “What we're saying is we don't trust parents to make a decision,” he said. “Some parents don't want to administer two doses of a vaccine if they can receive one and get the same degree of coverage. And I prefer that families have the option to make a selection.”\n\nCOVID-19 clarity\n\nThe committee did not vote on whether COVID-19 vaccines should be covered by the Vaccines for Children programme, a decision that typically follows all ACIP vaccine recommendation votes. “I was worried that they were going to forget about that and they did, further demonstrating the lack of familiarity with the process of the folks on this committee,” said O'Leary.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Material deep inside Earth — thousands of kilometres down, near the planet’s core — has undergone a mysterious shift.\n\nIs Earth’s core leaking? Volcanic rocks provide strongest evidence yet\n\nAlthough the change occurred nearly two decades ago, between 2006 and 2008, scientists discovered it only recently, while analysing data from a pair of satellites that once measured variations in Earth’s gravity. The team thinks it might have happened when the structure of some of the rocks near the boundary between Earth’s core and mantle transformed, becoming denser.\n\nThe discovery — which was possible because the geological shift altered the planet’s gravitational field — is an astonishing testament to Earth-orbiting satellites. “It’s a really new observation,” says Isabelle Panet, a geophysicist at Paris City University. Panet, lead author Charlotte Gaugne Gouranton — also at that university — and their colleagues reported the findings last month in Geophysical Research Letters1.\n\nThe work will help scientists to better understand the connections between Earth’s various layers, from its brittle crust to its solid mantle to its partially liquid core, Panet says. Connections between these layers affect where large earthquakes originate, how the planet maintains a magnetic field that protects it from solar storms and more.\n\nFollow the leader\n\nPanet’s team made the discovery using data from a pair of US–German satellites known as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), which orbited Earth between 2002 and 2017. The satellites flew one in front of the other, separated by a set distance.\n\nStrange blobs in Earth’s mantle are relics of a massive collision\n\nWhen they encountered a gravitational tug from, for example, the hulking mass of a mountain range, the lead satellite would pull temporarily away from the trailing satellite — a change that could be measured and correlated with the gravitational shift. Researchers have most often used changes in the distance between the GRACE satellites to measure the displacement of masses of water on Earth, such as when groundwater disappears beneath croplands or when glaciers melt.\n\nBut, as it turns out, GRACE was also able to spot much deeper changes in Earth’s mass. Panet had already used it to look for mass changes happening hundreds of kilometres below the surface ahead of large earthquakes2,3. Then she realized she could probe even farther down, to a depth of nearly 2,900 kilometres, to the complex boundary between the core and mantle.\n\nPanet and her colleagues spotted a strange signal in the GRACE data that peaked around 2007 and was centred off Africa’s Atlantic coast. They were unable to attribute it to water shifting around on Earth’s surface, however. “So at least partially, there has to be an origin within the solid Earth,” Panet says. “It has to come from very deep.”\n\nIn the deep",

          "abstract": "The Great Holocene Transformation: What Complexity Science Tells Us about the Evolution of Complex Societies Peter Turchin Beresta Books (2025)\n\nWhen Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived in Mexico in 1519, he found monarchs, cities, roads, markets, schools, astronomers, law courts and much else that also existed in his native Spain. Put another way, two cultural experiments had been running in parallel for 15,000 years, and when they came into contact, each recognized the other’s institutions.\n\nIt wasn’t just the civilizations of the Americas and Europe that resembled each other by that time. As biologist-turned-historian Peter Turchin observes in his tenth book, The Great Holocene Transformation, more than half of the world’s population in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries lived in five or six large societies with political systems that were remarkably structurally similar. His argument is that this was not a coincidence; although every society is unique, they have features in common that make them comparable.\n\nHow the world’s largest language family spread — and why others go extinct\n\nThis might not seem like a radical statement, but to some scholars it is. They argue that each society’s history is unique and that no meaningful comparison is possible. Others think it is possible in theory, but are uncomfortable with the translation of historical knowledge into binary categories or numbers, saying that it glosses over the inherent difficulty of interpreting the past from the ever-shifting vantage point of the present.\n\nThe small army of archaeologists, economists and other social scientists who work with Turchin on that gargantuan task of translation is convinced that this problem is tractable, and that such quantification will reveal patterns in history. The more data you collect, the more clearly the signal will emerge from the noise, they say. Equipped with large databases, powerful computational and analytical tools and artificial intelligence (AI), scholars can find these patterns and even predict how they might shape societies in the future.\n\nIn this book, Turchin sets out to answer what he calls “perhaps the biggest question in historical social science”: why, over the past 10,000 years — the epoch known as the Holocene — small collectives of foragers and farmers grew by seven orders of magnitude to become the societies familiar to Cortés and his Aztec adversary, Moctezuma II.\n\nWhy Africans should be telling the story of human origins\n\nHis answer, depressingly and paradoxically, is war. It was war that made us “ultrasocial”, to use his word, ratcheting up the size and complexity of those collectives until they became the states and empires that existed on the eve of the Industrial Revolution — the point at which his analysis ends. Ultrasociality was the secret of survival in this perpetual arms race, making it the ultimate military technology — or war the ultimate social technology.\n\nHe addressed the same question in his 2015 book, Ultrasociety, but that was written for a non-mathematically minded audience. This time, he shows his workings, and he has more data and better tools.\n\nThe Great Holocene Transformation is the culmination of more than 20 years’ work, during which he and others built the Seshat database — a storehouse of historical and archaeological information on more than 800 societies around the globe. This and similar databases that have emerged in the past decade form the basis of his cross-cultural and cross-temporal comparisons.\n\nSocial benefits\n\nScientific progress is usually the whittling down of theories to a few, and ultimately to one, through testing them against data. But where the Holocene transformation is concerned, theories have proliferated. The time has come, Turchin writes, “to create a killing field for theories and start retiring them to the cemetery of theories”.\n\nHis starting point is that, ten millennia being too short for biological evolution to have driven notable change, the mechanisms that fuelled this societal shift must have been cultural. Among the theories assessed are that agriculture, internal conflict, warfare or external conflict, and religion were the main drivers of societal complexification. Some ideas are dismissed, some are found to be useful but wanting, and the story that emerges, in a nutshell, goes as follows.\n\nA farmer in a tobacco field in Pinar del Rio, Cuba.Credit: David Silverman/Getty\n\nBefore the Holocene, cumulative cultural evolution — the capacity of humans to build on the advances of their ancestors — produced technologies that allowed communities to adapt to their environment and increase in size. The threat of war between expanding groups drove the shift to agriculture — because agriculture could sustain more people than foraging could for a given patch of land — and further developments in military technology.",

          "abstract": "Scientists have launched a crowdfunded initiative for blue-sky research amid federal funding cuts.Credit: Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty\n\nAmid a backdrop of massive cuts in US federal support for scientific research, a new effort — the Science Foundation — launched last week to raise public funds for transdisciplinary, discovery-based research.\n\nThe Science Foundation’s initial US$100,000 fundraising goal will support ten $10,000 research grants to advance recipients’ careers, akin to the supplemental grants awarded by the US National Science Foundation to collect proof-of-concept data in pioneering research projects. “We’re calling them ‘What IFS’, or interdisciplinary foundation science,” says Maren Friesen, project director and an evolutionary ecologist at Washington State University in Pullman. Scientists at all career levels will be eligible, and projects will ideally span at least two disciplines. “We want to support cross-fertilization of science based on intellectual curiosity, rather than chasing the latest use for artificial intelligence,” she explains.\n\nFriesen and her colleagues are betting that the public will step up to support scientists’ blue-sky endeavours. “In our first request for proposals, we plan to ask: why are you excited about this work?” says Venkatesh Srinivas, deputy project director and a Google software engineer in Seattle, Washington. The non-profit organization has so far raised $20,000, says Srinivas, and secured a pledge to match the next $20,000 in donations, which can be made at science-foundation.org.\n\nSolicitations will focus on five disciplines: maths, physics, chemistry, biology and Earth sciences. “We’re not considering biomedical, engineering or computer science, because we feel those already have plenty of investment,” says Friesen. Once Friesen and her team have proposals in hand, they will assemble a review panel of specialists and at least one member of the public. The foundation aims to release its first request for proposals this year. “We need to give young scientists hope that people continue to believe in the value of science,” she adds.\n\nA lost generation?\n\nSince US President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has blocked or cancelled billions of dollars of funding through the US National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and other sources.\n\nYet even before that, public funding for basic science in the United States had stagnated over the past decade. The federal government’s share of basic-research funding decreased from 52% to 41% between 2012 and 2023, according to a July report by the National Science Board.\n\n“We’re not just doing this in response to the Trump-administration cuts or to replace the National Science Foundation,” says Friesen. “We are trying to build something that that we think will have value in addition to government-funded science.”\n\nSuch support could help to ameliorate one growing concern — a lost generation of scientists. “We are facing a workforce time bomb,” warns David Stern, Science Foundation board member and former president of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “If we don’t have science practitioners, we don’t have science,” he says.\n\nExploratory research is particularly imperilled now, Stern and others argue. “We need alternative models to support basic science,” says Jonathan Eisen, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Davis. “I favour this [the Science Foundation] serving as a model for people to experiment with.”\n\nBut, Stern acknowledges, “Let’s not kid ourselves that this is a solution; it won’t replace federal funding. But it is a need that was already there, and more important now.”\n\nPublic support is strong",

The company says that the system has more than 50 million registered users, and more than 200,000 physicians using the platform.\n\nWhich diseases will you have in 20 years? This AI accurately predicts your risks\n\nFangzhou, based in Guangdong, is a pioneer in AI in health care, says Marina Zhang, a science-policy researcher at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia, who focuses on innovation in China.\n\nChina, like many nations, has a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory disorders and diabetes1. Estimates suggest that some 180 million older adults in the country live with chronic diseases2, and that number is likely to increase as the population ages. There’s hope that AI could help to reduce the strain that managing large populations of people with chronic diseases puts on health-care systems.\n\nGovernment support\n\nIn 2017, the Chinese government announced its intention to become the world leader in AI by 2030. Since then, hundreds of the country’s universities have begun offering undergraduate degrees in AI. Government investment, in the form of scholarships and research grants, has encouraged the forging of partnerships between industry and academia. Last month, the Chinese government announced an ‘AI Plus’ initiative, which is intended to promote the integration of AI in a range of fields. Support for AI technology has included tax cuts and subsidies.\n\nZhang says Fangzhou has also tapped into an underexplored market. “One critical problem driving China’s mounting economic pressures is lack of consumption. Many reasons can explain why this is the case, but fundamentally, people who have money actually do not want to spend,” she says. Older, wealthier populations are particularly unwilling to spend, she says. Combining health care, the care of older people and AI could encourage this demographic to spend on health management and lifestyle interventions.\n\nAI in health care",

          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "Merck and AstraZeneca have paused research and development investments in the United Kingdom.Credit: Matthew Horwood/Getty\n\nA series of statements and funding cuts suggest that the UK pharmaceutical industry and research sector is losing its competitive edge.\n\nFirst, Merck said on 10 September that it was scrapping a plan to develop a £1-billion (US$1.4-billion) research facility in London and cancelling ongoing projects at the nearby Francis Crick Institute. Two days later, it emerged that AstraZeneca was rethinking a £200-million expansion of its research site in Cambridge — a decision that follows a similar U-turn from the company earlier this year on a promised £450-million expansion to its vaccine manufacturing facility in Liverpool. And statements from the US firm Lilly and French company Sanofi have raised doubts about their continued investment in the United Kingdom, too.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giants have blamed a reduction in government investment in the sector on their decisions to de-invest in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). At an emergency parliamentary committee in the Houses of Parliament on 16 September, Ben Lucas, managing director of MSD (Merck) UK and Ireland said that “the UK commercial operating environment does need to be addressed”, adding that the UK government should “reflect on how we can avoid these things moving forward”.\n\nBut the real “crunch issue” is the amount of money the country’s National Health Service (NHS) spends on medicines, according to the UK minister for science, research and innovation, Patrick Vallance, who has also been head of R&D at the drug company GlaxoSmithKline and is a former government chief scientific adviser.\n\nVallance told the committee that Britain would need to spend billions of pounds more on new drugs to convince the pharmaceutical industry to invest in its life-science sector. Britain’s spending on pharmaceuticals has declined from 15% a decade ago to 9% today — a decline that would cost about £12 billion more each year to reverse.\n\n“I think industry has been clear that the ongoing investment in the UK is dependent on having a commercial environment which is conducive to them doing business,” said Vallance.\n\nUK pharma exodus?\n\nThe recent announcements come as talks between the UK government and the pharmaceutical industry remain deadlocked over drug-price reform. Under the current scheme, pharma companies agree to repay a proportion of their revenues from drug sales to the NHS. But the industry was unhappy when the government increased the rebate last year from 15% to 24%.\n\nAlthough many attending the committee meeting drew explicit links between the negotiations and the reversal of planned industry investment by pharmaceutical companies, independent specialists are more sceptical, saying it’s really about underlying weaknesses in the global pharmaceutical sector.\n\nRichard Sullivan, a cancer-policy researcher at King’s College London, says that the companies are using arguments over drug pricing as an excuse for cuts they needed to make anyway. “This is nothing to do with domestic policy towards our pharmaceutical industry,” he says. “This is smoke and mirrors.”\n\nThe ‘most favoured nation’ policy of US President Donald Trump, which aims to reduce the high prices the United States pays for medicines relative to other countries, combined with the rise in high-quality cheaper drugs from China and a reduction in health financing in emerging markets have left Merck and other pharmaceutical companies struggling with an obsolete business model and looking to save money, he says.\n\n“They don’t want to say they are withdrawing because the competition in China’s too fierce and because they made an upfront strategic mistake of putting it here in the first place,” he adds.\n\nWhat does it mean for other countries?\n\nAlexander Schuhmacher, a pharma R&D researcher at Technical University Ingolstadt in Germany says it’s not clear yet how the situation in the United Kingdom might influence or apply to other countries.\n\n“Pharma companies operate under long research and production life cycles,” he points out. That means their strategic decisions are typically the result of long-term planning, not short-term reactions to political changes or even to major geopolitical shifts, he says.",

Can artificial intelligence (AI) help to forecast hurricanes and other extreme weather events? And has the world already blown past the most ambitious target of the Paris climate agreement — to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels?\n\nThe need to address these and other questions is spurring researchers to tap into vast, unused repositories of handwritten weather records that span more than two centuries. These troves of valuable — but in some cases unreadable — data are now becoming easier to access with new, more sophisticated machine-learning tools.\n\n“All meteorological services around the world have some basement where they store data from the 1800s that has not been digitized,” says Marlies van der Schee, a climate scientist at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt. “For many institutes, they don’t even know what is in their archives.”\n\nSearching for data\n\nIn the quest to gather missing climate data, climate scientist Derrick Muheki has travelled farther than most. To access the meteorological archives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) — which contain records from when the DRC became independent in 1960, collected from 37 weather stations across the country — Muheki had to fly from Kinshasa to Kisangani in the country’s north, travel along the Congo River by boat and then take an unpaved road on a motorcycle to reach the Yangambi branch of the DRC’s National Institute for Agronomic Research (INERA). There, he spent two months earlier this year scanning thousands of pages of weather logs.\n\nMuheki had to bring enough batteries to power his digital camera for the duration of the trip, as the remote branch of INERA is not hooked up to the DRC’s national grid. He learnt some of the Bantu language Lingala so that he could communicate with other INERA staff members. He says it helped that many of the words were similar to the language he grew up speaking in his native Uganda.\n\nWeather reports from old ships’ logs — such as this eighteenth century document from British vessel HMS Dolphin — contain data that can be fed into climate models. Credit: The History Collection via Alamy\n\nAfter returning to his research group at the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels, Muheki began to extract data from the more than 9,000 scanned images using a machine-learning tool he designed for reading the weather logs, called MeteoSaver1.\n\nIn initial tests, MeteoSaver could transcribe the data with only 75% accuracy, but further refinements and training of its neural network — on the basis of an open-source package for recognition of handwritten text, called Tesseract — have pushed that to 90%, he says.\n\nThe resulting data will provide crucial information about how conditions have changed over time in the world’s second largest rainforest. Climate scientist Wim Thiery, Muheki’s adviser at the Vrije Universiteit, says that because of a lack of information about past temperatures, the forested heart of the African continent had a major data gap in the 2021 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assessed the severity and speed of global warming in various parts of the world. He hopes that efforts such as Muheki’s will help to rectify this.\n\nForgotten figures\n\nMuheki’s logistical hurdles were unusual, but the DRC is not the only country that is yet to fully digitize its weather records.\n\n“There are paper records still languishing in archives all over the world,” says Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, UK. These include millions of unused rainfall observations in the UK’s National Meteorological Archive.\n\nIs it too late to keep global warming below 1.5 °C? The challenge in 7 charts\n\nHawkins has managed several projects that relied on citizen scientists to manually transcribe climate records. Ten years ago or so, machine-learning tools just weren’t up to the task, he says. The hardest part for AI tools is not reading handwritten text, but recognizing the tabular structure in the documents. “When I and colleagues started trying [AI] tools out, they just would not work on tabulated numbers,” says Hawkins. “It wasn’t in their training.” Much of Muheki’s work consisted of developing custom algorithms for doing just that. Now, the tools are finally becoming good enough to match human performance, says Hawkins, who is a co-author on the research paper that describes MeteoSaver.\n\nSimilar efforts by other teams are showing that machine learning could drastically speed up the rate of recovery of historic records. “It’s really a revolution in our ability to rescue data,” says Thiery.",

          "abstract": "Arnav Kapur, chief executive of AlterEgo, demonstrates the wearable device.Credit: AlterEgo\n\nA wearable device could make saying ‘Alexa, what time is it?’ aloud a thing of the past. An artificial intelligence (AI) neural interface called AlterEgo promises to allow users to silently communicate just by internally articulating words. Sitting over the ear, the device facilitates daily life through live communication with the Internet. “It gives you the power of telepathy but only for the thoughts you want to share,” says AlterEgo’s chief executive Arnav Kapur, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Kapur unveiled the device on 8 September.\n\nThe device does not read brain activity, but predicts what a wearer wants to say from signals in muscles used to speak, then sends audio information back into their ear. The researchers say that their non-invasive technology could help people with motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) who have trouble speaking, but also want to make the devices commercially available for general use.\n\nIn a promotional video on the AlterEgo website, Kapur says that “it’s a revolutionary breakthrough with the potential to change the way we interact with our technology, with one another and with the world around us”.\n\n“The big question about this is ‘how likely is that potential to be realized?,” says Howard Chizeck, an electrical and computer engineer at the University of Washington in Seattle. Chizeck says that the technology seems workable and is less of a privacy risk than listening devices such as Amazon’s Alexa are, but isn’t convinced that the device will catch on for commercial use.\n\nSilent speech\n\nBrain–computer interfaces, like those from Elon Musk’s firm Neuralink, typically require electrodes to be surgically implanted in the brain to record and send signals between neurons. AlterEgo works differently. “It’s using neuromuscular signals that would be used in speech, so it’s like you’re silently talking,” says Chizeck. “The clear advantage is that it’s not invasive. You don’t have to put chips in the brain with risks of infection and surgery.”\n\nThe device works by measuring speech patterns in the face. When you speak aloud, silently mouth words or internally articulate words, the information is sent from the brain to the cranial nerves and articulatory muscles, even if the face doesn’t move. AlterEgo detects electrical signals in the articulatory muscles, then sends the data to AI models that predict what the wearer wants to say. The device then communicates audio back to the wearer through bone-conduction headphones.\n\nThe AlterEgo project was born in the MIT Media Lab in 2018. The original headset was large and ungainly, says Kapur, and its detection of speech was held back by the capabilities of artificial intelligence at the time. It had limited functionality but could search the web and “order pizzas”. Since then, the engineers have incorporated newer AI capabilities of speech recognition, and the project was spun off as a for-profit company earlier this year.\n\nClinical applications\n\nThe technology is aimed at people with conditions that make speech difficult, such as dysarthria or dysphonia. AlterEgo is currently being trialled in people with ALS or MS.\n\n“A totally locked-in patient wouldn’t be able to use the system, but a lot of the time there is a sparse signal that exists in the speech system and that sparse signal is enough,” says Kapur. “We started with early-stage ALS patients, but we also were able to use the system with late-stage ALS patients.” The trials are ongoing, and results are yet to be published.\n\nChizeck thinks that it might be usable for people with early-stage ALS, but because the disease is progressive, gradually reducing people’s ability to move the muscles required for speech, it might be less useful in later stages of the condition. “The device is only as good as the person’s control of speech,” he says.",

          "abstract": "From his spot in the long, orderly queue, Balch could just see the clinic’s large double doors. One intermittently swung open as nurses and national guardsmen ushered the next person inside. The queue then inched forwards like a great lazy caterpillar to fill the vacated space.\n\nBalch kneaded his pockets. His turn would be a while yet.\n\nIdentical clinics had opened worldwide following the parasite’s discovery — a biological oddity colloquially dubbed ‘the Slug’, despite news broadcasts highlighting the microscopic creature’s dendritic shape. How they’d spotted the Slug, Balch couldn’t explain. But he understood why it mattered.\n\nApparently, the Slug had been randomly infecting half the population for centuries. It wasn’t deadly, supposedly. Yet it dulled its host’s every faculty, hampering their ability to do most things — including reasoning cogently, retaining information and even playing sports. How the Slug spread, the World Health Organization couldn’t say. Yet that hadn’t prevented scientists from developing a cure packaged in bubblegum-flavoured oral lozenges. The world’s governments immediately enacted mass screenings among their populations, dosing Slug carriers on detection.\n\nWatching nurses shepherd another person through the clinic’s doors, Balch wondered whether he had the Slug. He couldn’t imagine finding himself smarter and more athletic overnight. The thought made his brain itch. He sighed, wishing the affair was over.\n\n“Boring wait, huh?”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nBalch turned. Behind him stood a youngish, bespectacled man in a tweed suit and bow tie meant for someone four times older.\n\n“If you need entertaining,” he said, “how about a riddle?”\n\n“Why not,” said Balch.\n\n“Picture a game show,” said the man, “involving three doors. One conceals a million dollars. The others, nothing. You’ll win whatever’s behind the door you choose. With me so far?”\n\n“Yup,” said Balch. “Guess correctly, make a bundle.”\n\n“Perfect. Suppose you select Door number 1. Before you turn the knob, the host opens Door number 2, revealing empty space. He then invites you to ditch your initial pick for Door number 3. The question is: should you switch?”\n\nAfter a moment, Balch said, “Weirdly enough, you should.”\n\n“Interesting. Why?”\n\n“Because the original set-up’s a one-in-three chance for the right door, but the second offers a two-in-three chance for Door 2. Much better odds.”\n\n“That’s right,” said the man, grinning.\n\nBalch smiled back. He’d heard the solution before, but kept that to himself. All of a sudden, the man took Balch’s arm, yanking him out of the queue.\n\n“What the …?” Balch sputtered.\n\n“Quiet,” whispered the man. “Nobody must overhear. It’s a matter of vital importance. Most would dismiss me as a crank for what I’m about to say. You, though! You’ve got the right mindset. Because you understand the door puzzle, and how changing circumstances counter-intuitively redefine rational choice.”\n\nBalch remained quiet. Interrupting seemed unwise.\n\n“You see,” said the man, “I’m an economist. Yes, yes, funny occupation. Correctly predicted seven of the last four recessions, et cetera. Whatever. My friend, the reality is, we’re facing probabilistic questions with existential stakes.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Think carefully about the following question: as you await screening … do you hope you have the parasite?”\n\n“Of course not!” said Balch. “Isn’t that the whole point? To be clean, because it’s better not to have a Slug infection?”\n\nThe economist’s expression hardened.\n\n“You’re mistaken. You should pray you’re infected.”\n\n“Nonsense!”\n\n“It’s paradoxical,” said the economist, eyes widening. “You’re unaware whether you’re free of the parasite. But you do know what you’re capable of at this moment. You have a handle on your own abilities — your cleverness and strength relative to others, and what that enables you to achieve. If you’re clean, your abilities will remain unchanged after your screening. Yet, if you’re infected, the calculus changes. You’ll become better at everything you’ve ever tried. As will half the world. You should therefore want to number among them.”\n\nBalch’s damp hands clenched.\n\n“There’s the rub,” the economist continued. “This screening represents a point of no return. You’ll soon learn whether what you are now is all you will be; whether your own mediocrity is mere inconvenience or inescapable fate. Could you live with the results of a clean diagnosis? Could anyone?”",

Although Delphi-2M was trained only on one data set from the United Kingdom, its multi-disease modelling could one day help clinicians to identify high-risk people, allowing for the early roll-out of preventive measures. The model is described in a study published today in Nature.\n\nThe tool’s ability to model multiple diseases in one go is “astonishing”, says Stefan Feuerriegel, a computer scientist at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, who has developed AI models for medical applications. “It can generate entire future health trajectories,” he says.\n\nOracle of health\n\nResearchers have already developed AI-based tools to predict a person’s risk of developing certain conditions, including some cancers and cardiovascular disease. But most of these tools estimate the risk of only one disease, says study co-author Moritz Gerstung, a data scientist at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. “A health-care professional would have to run dozens of them to deliver a comprehensive answer,” he says.\n\nTo address this, Gerstung and his colleagues modified a type of large language model (LLM) called a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), that forms the underpinning of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. When asked a question, GPTs provide outputs that, according to their training on vast volumes of data, are statistically probable.\n\nAn AI revolution is brewing in medicine. What will it look like?\n\nThe authors designed their modified LLM to forecast a person’s likelihood of developing 1,258 diseases on the basis of their past medical history. The model also incorporates the person’s age, sex, body mass index and health-related habits, such as tobacco use and alcohol consumption. The researchers trained Delphi-2M on data from 400,000 participants of the UK Biobank, a long-term biomedical monitoring study.\n\nFor most diseases, Delphi-2M’s predictions matched or exceeded the accuracy of those of current models that estimate the risk of developing a single illness. The tool also performed better than a machine-learning algorithm that uses biomarkers — levels of specific molecules or compounds in the body — to predict the risk of several diseases. “It worked astonishingly well,” says Gerstung.",

          "abstract": "Science under Siege: How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces that Threaten Our World Michael E. Mann & Peter J. Hotez PublicAffairs (2025)\n\nMonths into President Trump’s second term, science and scientists are under attack as never before in the United States. The administration is forcing devastating cuts to previously stable US research investments, dismantling federal science agencies and programmes, ousting independent scientific officials and blatantly disregarding evidence on issues that affect us all, including vaccines, air pollution and fossil fuels.\n\n‘Now is not the time for despair’ — how scientists can take a stand against political interference\n\nThe scientific community needs to recognize these trends and fight back in every way possible. The timely release of Science under Siege by paediatrician and vaccine specialist Peter Hotez and climate scientist Michael Mann is a welcome addition to the scientific community’s arsenal. Both authors work to dispel misinformation in the public and political arenas, and both have experienced personal attacks because of it.\n\nMann, known for his ‘hockey stick’ visual representation of soaring global average temperatures owing to climate change, has faced years of public disparagement and threats to his physical safety. Hotez found himself in the crosshairs of the politicization of public-health guidance, on vaccines in particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic — and had to hire private security. Together, they explore the forces that undermine science in the United States and beyond.\n\nFive forces to contend with\n\nThe duo skilfully establishes parallels in the attacks on climate scientists and on public-health professionals. The two fields might seem disparate, but specialists in both share a responsibility to inform the public about the “one-two punch of climate change and pandemics” — the effects of which are mutually reinforcing to “threaten massive loss in human life” — and find solutions.\n\nWho is on RFK Jr’s new vaccine panel — and what will they do?\n\nIn some cases, Mann and Hotez note, the same tactics are used in attempts to discredit their work in both fields — sometimes even by the same people. For example, climate-disinformation messaging morphed over several years from ‘it’s not real’ to ‘it’s actually good for us’. These same tactics were adopted by peddlers of COVID-19 misinformation, who claimed that widespread infection could lead to herd immunity, and caught on much faster, mere months after the virus began spreading.\n\nBut who’s behind the lies, propaganda and attacks? Mann and Hotez identify five forces — the ‘five Ps’ — that drive threats to science and scientists: plutocrats, petrostates, pros (that is, academics and specialists who use their credentials to promote disingenuous, and lucrative, contrarian views), propagandists and the press. Mann and Hotez detail how bad actors continue to propagate misinformation, persecute scientists, undermine science-based decisions from policymakers and the public and threaten global health and safety.\n\nFighting back\n\nAs the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists — a science-advocacy non-profit organization that spends its time fighting these known enemies — I found this thorough naming and shaming resonant and indeed cathartic. I imagine that this exploration of just how pervasive and well-funded these forces are might also bring relief to scientists wondering why their commitment to truth-telling isn’t enough.",

Then there are the other awards — the Ig Nobel prizes, which were devised to highlight research that makes people laugh, then think.\n\nHighlights of this year’s Ig Nobel recipients include a nutrition prize for studying the preferred pizza toppings of rainbow lizards at a seaside resort in Togo1 (their favourite is four-cheese), and a physics award for figuring out how to prepare the perfect cacio e pepe2 — a pasta dish made with grated pecorino romano cheese and black pepper that is surprisingly hard to get right (see ‘The 2025 Ig Nobel prizewinners in full’).\n\n“For us, this represents the greatest award to creativity in science,” says Giacomo Bartolucci, a physicist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, who was a co-author of the cacio e pepe study. His team investigated the phase transitions that can cause the sauce to clump up and uncovered a recipe with consistently delicious results. “The goal was both to satisfy our curiosity and to frame the problem in physical terms, showing that even everyday frustrations like a failed pasta dish can be linked to interesting scientific problems,” says Bartolucci.\n\nCelebrating silliness\n\nThe Ig Nobels were founded in 1991 by Marc Abrahams, editor of satirical magazine Annals of Improbable Research.

Abrahams says that Robert May, the chief scientific adviser to the UK Government from 1995 to 2000, once wrote him an angry letter demanding that they stopped giving Ig Nobel prizes to British scientists.\n\nBut many have come to see the Ig Nobels as career-changing in their own right.\n\n“When we first got the phone call about winning an Ig Nobel, we honestly thought it was a prank. Once we realized it was real, we were thrilled and genuinely honored,” says Fritz Renner, a psychologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany and a winner of this year’s peace prize for work showing that drinking alcohol can improve your ability to speak in a foreign language6.\n\nHow a silly science prize changed my career\n\n“It all started out at an international conference in Vienna,” he says of the research. “We had some drinks with colleagues at a bar at the end of a long conference day. Someone was joking that their English — to them a foreign language — was getting better with a drink.”\n\nThe discussion ultimately led to a study showing that people are more impressed by your ability to speak another language after you’ve had a small amount of booze. However, Renner stresses that “we do not encourage anybody to use alcohol as a learning tool or to ditch language classes in favour of a drink”.\n\nContinuing the theme of tipsiness, there was an aviation prize for a study on how alcohol can impair bats’ ability to fly and echolocate7, which explains why the animals tend to avoid eating fermented fruit.",

          "authors": "Lucila Pinto",
          "abstract": "Support for this article was provided by the Pulitzer Center.\n\nLast month, a parade of vehicles wound its way through three cities in Brazil, releasing clouds of mosquitoes into the air. The insects all carry a secret weapon — a bacterium called Wolbachia that lowers the odds that the mosquitoes can transmit the dreaded dengue virus to humans.\n\nThis is the world’s largest ‘mosquito factory’: its goal is to stop dengue\n\nThese infected mosquitoes are the latest weapon in Brazil’s fight against dengue, which infects millions of people in the country each year and can be fatal. A biofactory that opened in the town of Curitiba in July can produce 100 million mosquito eggs per week — making it the largest such facility in the world. The company that runs it, Wolbito do Brasil, aims to protect about 14 million Brazilians per year through its Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.\n\nThat will come as welcome news for the Brazilian health officials battling the rapidly growing threat of dengue. In 2024, the country experienced its worst outbreak yet: with 6.6 million probable cases and more than 6,300 related deaths. This year’s outbreak, although less severe, is also one of the highest on record, with 1.6 million probable cases so far (see ‘Dangerous outbreaks’). And the problem is spreading. Argentina, Colombia and Peru also experienced record-breaking outbreaks in 2024 and have seen a sustained increase in cases in recent years. Across Latin America and the Caribbean, deaths from dengue last year totalled more than 8,400 and the global figure reached more than 12,000 — the highest ever recorded for this disease.\n\nSOURCE: Brazilian Ministry of Health\n\nAs outbreaks grow larger and the crisis becomes more urgent, the Wolbachia method isn’t Brazil’s only bet. A locally produced dengue vaccine is now awaiting approval by the country’s drug-regulatory agency, and its health ministry expects to start administering tens of millions of doses by next year.\n\nThese twin advances offer some hope to other countries — in the region and beyond. Driven by forces such as climate change, mosquito adaptation, globalized trade and movements of people, dengue is becoming a crisis worldwide, with an estimated 3.9 billion people at risk of infection. As Brazil rolls out its armies of infected mosquitoes and a vaccine in the coming year, the rest of the world will be watching closely.\n\nThe local approach\n\nCurrently, there is one main dengue vaccine in use around the world: Qdenga, licensed by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda. The vaccine has been approved in many countries, including Brazil, which was the first nation to include it in its public-health system.\n\nHowever, Qdenga’s roll-out in Brazil is limited. The country bought nine million doses of the two-dose vaccine this year: enough to vaccinate 4.5 million of its population of more than 210 million. So far, Qdenga has been administered to children between the ages of 10 and 14, one of the groups most likely to end up in hospital after contracting dengue, together with older people. Its safety and efficacy have not yet been tested in adults aged over 60.\n\nThe main reasons for such a limited roll-out in Brazil are availability and cost. Even though Brazil secured Qdenga from Takeda at one of the cheapest prices in the world —around US$19 per dose — the cost is still high compared with other vaccines. And even in the most optimistic scenario, the maximum number of doses Takeda could provide by 2028 is 50 million — enough to vaccinate 25 million people. What’s more, for people who have not had dengue before, clinical trials did not show Qdenga to be effective against all four variants — or serotypes — of the dengue virus.\n\nWhen will dengue strike? Outbreaks sync with heat and rain\n\nBrazil is trying to address all of those limitations with its one-dose vaccine candidate, developed at the Butantan Institute, a public biomedical research centre in São Paulo. “Having local production capacity gives us independence on decisions — how many doses we need, and at what speed to vaccinate,” says Esper Kallás, Butantan’s director. “You can practise prices that are more suitable and absorbable by a public-health system such as Brazil’s.”\n\nButantan is also optimistic that its vaccine will be effective against all four forms of dengue. Severe disease usually occurs when a person is infected by a different serotype to their first infection. That means that a successful vaccine needs to generate antibodies for all four serotypes without triggering severe reactions, which makes it a difficult vaccine to develop. “It was indeed a challenge, as each serotype behaves differently,” says Neuza Frazatti Gallina, manager of the viral vaccine development laboratory at Butantan.\n\nThe vaccine’s development began at the US National Institutes of Health in the late 1990s, where scientists transformed dengue viruses they had isolated from patients into weakened vaccine strains that could trigger the production of protective antibodies without causing disease. In 2009, Butantan extended that research by working to solve the challenges of combining the four strains into a vaccine.\n\nEggs of mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria.

The study reported that two years after vaccinations, the formulation was 89% effective in preventing infections in people who had previously been infected with dengue, and 74% effective in those with no previous exposure1.\n\n“It was a well-designed trial,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, who is team lead for vaccine development at the World Health Organization (WHO). But she says one limitation of the trial is that it was conducted in a single country, and therefore runs a risk that all four serotypes were not circulating at the time.\n\nIn fact, serotypes 3 and 4 were not prevalent during the data-collection period of the clinical trial, although they are now circulating in Brazil. Butantan researchers suggest that the vaccine will be effective against serotypes 3 and 4, pointing to data from a phase II trial2 in 300 adults that showed participants produced neutralizing antibodies to each of the serotypes. That study evaluated safety and immunological response in the short term, rather than looking at the vaccine’s long-term efficacy in preventing infections. The full results of the Brazilian phase III trial — which will provide data on long-term effectiveness — are not yet public and are undergoing peer review.\n\nThe vaccine is already moving through the country’s regulatory process. And although there’s still no certainty about when Anvisa, Brazil’s regulatory agency, will approve the vaccine, the government is counting on it. In February, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced that, starting in 2026, the Ministry of Health would be buying 60 million doses annually.\n\nTo meet that demand, Butantan is now producing the vaccine at its São Paulo facility. On its lush campus, an entire building is dedicated to churning out doses.\n\nRegarding the vaccine’s approval, “We are very confident,” says Kallás. “We also anticipate that there is a very prominent need to have this product in the arms of people. So we hit the road running and started producing vaccines late last year.”\n\nAlthough Butantan’s production efforts will focus initially on meeting Brazil’s need for millions of doses, Kallás expects that the vaccine could reach other countries. Butantan has been discussing with its development partner — the pharmaceutical giant Merck — and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) how to make the vaccine accessible to other countries. The logical first step, he says, would be to roll it out through PAHO to Latin America and the Caribbean, and then to other regions.\n\nIn the meantime, Merck is developing a potential vaccine for Asia with an almost identical formulation, which builds on the knowledge that Butantan has developed. In a statement, the drug firm said that Butantan is “sharing clinical data and other learnings”. In June, Merck started enrolling participants for its own phase III trial. “All the data, experiences and insights they have collected with the Butantan vaccine will be helpful,” says Wilder-Smith.\n\nInfecting mosquitoes\n\nWhile Butantan awaits news about the vaccine’s approval, the Wolbachia method to control dengue is gaining momentum. The World Mosquito Program (WMP) — a non-profit group of companies owned by Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, where the strategy was developed — has operations in 14 countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico and Colombia, but Brazil leads the way in terms of the scale of its expansion.\n\nThe method’s arrival in the Americas is tied to Brazilian researcher Luciano Moreira, now the chief executive of Wolbito do Brazil. Wolbachia is naturally present in around 50% of insects, but not in the mosquito species Aedes aegypti, which is the main transmitter of dengue and many other viruses.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Chatbots give positive, human-like responses to prompts from users.Credit: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nAccounts of people developing psychosis — which renders them unable to distinguish between what is and is not reality — after interacting with generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have increased in the past few months.\n\nSupportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health\n\nAt least 17 people have been reported to have developed psychosis, according to a preprint posted online last month1. After engaging with chatbots such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, some of these people experienced spiritual awakenings or uncovered what they thought were conspiracies.\n\nSo far, there has been little research into this rare phenomenon, called AI psychosis, and most of what we know comes from individual instances. Nature explores the emerging theories and evidence, and what AI companies are doing about the problem.\n\nCan AI trigger psychosis?\n\nPsychosis is characterized by disruptions to how a person thinks and perceives reality, including hallucinations, delusions and false beliefs. It can be triggered by brain disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, severe stress and drug use.\n\nThat AI can trigger psychosis is still a hypothesis, says Søren Østergaard, a psychiatrist at Aarhus University in Denmark. But theories are emerging about how this could happen, he adds. For instance, chatbots are designed to craft positive, human-like responses to prompts from users, which could increase the risk of psychosis among people already having trouble distinguishing between what is and is not real, says Østergaard.\n\nUK researchers have proposed that conversations with chatbots can fall into a feedback loop, in which the AI reinforces paranoid or delusional beliefs mentioned by users, which condition the chatbot’s responses as the conversation continues. In a preprint published in July2, which has not been peer reviewed, the scientists simulated user–chatbot conversations using prompts with varying levels of paranoia, finding that the user and chatbot reinforced each other’s paranoid beliefs.\n\nStudies involving people without mental-health conditions or tendencies towards paranoid thinking are needed to establish whether there is a connection between psychosis and chatbot use, Østergaard says.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nPeople who have already experienced some kind of mental-health issue are at the greatest risk of developing psychosis, Østergaard says. It seems that some people can experience their first psychotic break from interacting with chatbots, he adds, but most of them will already be susceptible to developing delusions or paranoia owing to genetics, stress or misuse of drugs or alcohol. Østergaard also theorizes that chatbots could worsen or trigger mania, a period of extremely elevated energy and mood associated with bipolar disorder, because they reinforce symptoms such as elated mood.\n\nPeople who are isolated and do not interact with friends, family or other people are also at risk, says Kiley Seymour, a neuroscientist at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia. Interacting with other people protects against psychosis, she adds, because “they can offer those counterfactual pieces of evidence to help you think about how you’re thinking”.\n\nBut the risk of developing psychosis for people without a predisposition is the same whether they do or don’t interact with chatbots, adds Seymour.\n\nHow might AI reinforce delusional beliefs?\n\nChatbots can remember information from conversations that occurred months earlier, which can trigger users to think that they are “being watched or that their thoughts are being extracted, because they can’t remember ever sharing that information”, says Seymour. Grandiose delusions, in which users think they are speaking to a god through the chatbot or have discovered a truth about the world, can also be reinforced, she adds. In an analysis of chats posted online, The Wall Street Journal reported finding dozens of instances in which chatbots validated mystical or delusional beliefs or made claims that they were in contact with extraterrestrial beings.",

          "abstract": "AI-designed bacteriophages were capable of infecting and killing host bacteria. Credit: Lee D. Simon/Science Photo Library\n\nScientists have created the first ever viruses designed by artificial intelligence (AI), and they’re capable of hunting down and killing strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli).\n\n“This is the first time AI systems are able to write coherent genome-scale sequences,” says Brian Hie, a computational biologist at Stanford University, California. “The next step is AI-generated life,” says Hie, but his colleague Samuel King adds that “a lot of experimental advances need to occur in order to design an entire living organism”.\n\nThe study, by Hie, King and colleagues, was posted on the preprint server bioRxiv on 17 September1 and is not yet peer reviewed, but the authors say that it shows the potential of AI to design biotechnological tools and therapies for treating bacterial infections. “Hopefully, a strategy like this can complement existing phage-therapy strategies and someday augment the therapeutics [to] target pathogens of concern,” says Hie.\n\nGenomes from the computer\n\nAI models have already been used to generate DNA sequences, single proteins and multi-component complexes2. But designing a whole genome is much more challenging owing to complex interactions between genes and gene replication and regulation processes. These AI systems are now capable of helping scientists to manipulate highly intricate biological systems, such as whole genomes, says Hie. “There are many important biological functions that you can only access if you’re able to design complete genomes.”\n\nTo design the viral genomes, the researchers used Evo 1 and Evo 2, AI models that analyse and generate DNA, RNA and protein sequences. First, they needed a design template, which is a starting sequence that guides the AI model to generate a genome with desired characteristics. They chose ΦX174, a simple single-stranded DNA virus that contains 5,386 nucleotides in 11 genes, and all the genetic elements required to infect hosts and replicate inside them.\n\nThe Evo models had already been trained on more than 2 million phage genomes, but the researchers further trained the models — using a method called supervised learning — to generate ΦX174-like viral genomes with the specific function of infecting E.coli strains, especially those resistant to antibiotics.\n\nFive ways science is tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis\n\nThe researchers evaluated thousands of AI-generated sequences and narrowed their search down to 302 viable bacteriophages. Most candidates shared more than 40% nucleotide identity with ΦX174, but some had completely different coding sequences. The researchers synthesized DNA from the AI-designed genomes and inserted them into host bacteria to grow phages. These phages were then experimentally tested to see whether they could infect and kill E.coli.\n\nSome 16 of the 302 AI-designed bacteriophage showed host specificity for E. coli and could infect the bacteria. The researchers found that combinations of AI-designed phages could infect and kill three different E. coli strains, which the wild-type ΦX174 was unable to do.\n\n“It was quite a surprising result that was really exciting for us because it shows that this method might potentially be very useful for therapeutics,” says King.\n\nBiosafety concerns",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "Update: Soon after Nature posted this story, some US$11 million from the US National Science Foundation began flowing back to Harvard. The Harvard Crimson also reported that $46 million in funds from the US National Institutes of Health are now going to the university. This afternoon, in a joint status update before a judge, both Harvard and the US government asked for more time to “work through implementation issues” of complying fully with the court order.\n\nHarvard University scored a victory in court two weeks ago, when a US judge ruled that its research grants should be reinstated and its funding unfrozen. But the administration of Republican President Donald Trump does not yet seem to be fully complying with the court order.\n\nHarvard vs Trump: what this epic battle means for science\n\nIn May, Trump’s team terminated roughly 1,000 grants awarded to Harvard worth more than US$2.8 billion, citing the institution’s alleged failure to protect its students from antisemitism. An internal e-mail sent on 12 September to staff members at Harvard, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, noted that the university had “received indications” that most of its grants from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) — a massive funder of biomedical research — had been restored. But researchers have told Nature that they still aren’t receiving the money.\n\nA Harvard spokesperson confirms that “payments have not been restored”, meaning that although the NIH is reactivating grants, the payment system — which operates separately — is still blocked. When asked about the freeze on funding, the NIH declined to comment on the record.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it will appeal the Harvard court decision. The case is likely to end up before the US Supreme Court, says David Super, a specialist in administrative law at Georgetown University in Washington DC.\n\nHong Kong universities woo Harvard international students targeted by Trump\n\nBut in the meantime, legal scholars have told Nature that the government should, by this point, have unfrozen Harvard’s money. “You should comply with a court order as rapidly as you reasonably could,” Super says.\n\nAt least one US funding agency seems to be restoring funding, however. On Wednesday, the US National Science Foundation (NSF), which financially supports about 25% of basic US academic research, sent an e-mail informing Harvard that its grants have been reinstated and its funding unfrozen. “You may begin drawing funds,” the e-mail states. (The NSF uses a different payment system from the NIH’s.)\n\nOne affected researcher is Julia Mundy, a condensed-matter physicist at Harvard who lost a prestigious NSF award for early-career scientists. “This is a positive step,” she says. “But we also still feel a lot of uncertainty, because it doesn’t feel that everything is resolved yet.”\n\nHarvard vs Trump\n\nHarvard has been central to the Trump administration’s campaign to reshape US higher education, which it has said is too left-leaning. In April, government officials froze federal funds to the institution — the wealthiest in the world — and demanded, among other things, that it eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programmes and achieve “viewpoint diversity” in student admissions and the hiring of faculty members.\n\nTwo students work in the laboratory of Julia Mundy, a condensed-matter physicist at Harvard who studies atomically-thin materials.Credit: Charles Brooks\n\nWhen Harvard refused to fully comply, the Trump team terminated the institution’s federal grants across 19 US agencies, alleging that the university allowed “pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment”. The school sued, and on 3 September, Massachusetts district court judge Allison Burroughs ruled that the grant terminations were illegal because they violated Harvard’s constitutional right to free speech.\n\n“There is, in reality, little connection between the research affected by the grant terminations and antisemitism,” Burroughs, who was appointed by former Democratic president Barack Obama, wrote in her decision. She called the claim of antisemitism a “smokescreen” and cited Trump’s social-media posts, including one saying that Harvard is “hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and ‘birdbrains’ who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students”.\n\nCourt conundrum\n\nThe bottleneck in which Harvard’s NIH grants are now held up is a system called Payment Management Services (PMS), which processes requests for withdrawing money from grants and is run by the NIH’s parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). When asked why grant payments aren’t flowing, PMS directed Nature to submit a Freedom of Information Act request to the HHS.\n\nHarvard researchers devastated as Trump team cuts nearly 1,000 grants\n\nAlthough it can take time to resume payments, it should not take two weeks, Super says. It seems that the government could be violating the court’s order by only partially complying, he adds.",

Credit: Yui Mok/PA Images via Alamy\n\nLast week, a study involving more than nine million pregnancies reported that children whose mothers had gestational diabetes during pregnancy had a higher chance of developing attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism than did children whose mothers didn’t have the condition.\n\nThe study, presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Vienna, is under review at a peer-reviewed journal. It is not the first to link gestational diabetes to neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but it is one of the largest. Researchers pooled results from 48 studies across 20 countries, finding that children born to people with gestational diabetes had lower IQ scores, a 36% higher risk of ADHD and a 56% higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. Estimates suggest the prevalence of autism in the general population is one in 127 people1 and between 3-10%2 of children and teenagers have ADHD.\n\nThe latest results mirror those of another meta-analysis3 published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal in June, which included 56 million mother–child pairs and found that all types of diabetes in pregnancy, including type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes, increase the risk of the baby developing ADHD and autism. But none of these studies have been able to show that diabetes during pregnancy causes these conditions. “There’s no doubt that there is a signal here, but certainly further research is required,” says Alex Polyakov, an obstetrician and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.\n\nLong a topic of research, the causes of autism have been thrust into the spotlight by the administration of US President Donald Trump. On Sunday, while speaking at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump said: “I think we found an answer to autism. How about that?” The Washington Post reports that Trump’s administration is poised to announce a link between autism and the use of acetaminophen, also called paracetamol, during pregnancy. Medical guidelines say acetominophen is safe to use during pregnancy.\n\nOverall, genetics has the strongest influence on the risk of developing ADHD and autism. Environmental factors, such as folic-acid deficiency, air pollution and gestational diabetes, have a small-to-moderate effect on the risk of these conditions, says Ling-Jun Li, a clinician–scientist at the National University of Singapore and a co-author on the latest gestational diabetes study.\n\nPolyakov agrees: “In practice, both genetic predisposition and environmental factors likely interact.”\n\nHealth impacts\n\nStudies over the past two decades5 have shown that gestational diabetes has long-term effects on women’s health, such as increasing their risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease.\n\nLi and her colleagues decided to review the evidence for effects of the condition on neurocognitive development in children.",

Kennedy Jr demanded that she take actions that would not improve the health of people in the United States.\n\n“I was fired for holding the line on scientific integrity,” she said. “The stakes are not theoretical — we have already seen the largest [US] measles outbreak in more than 30 years, which claimed the lives of two children.”\n\nDuring the nearly three-hour hearing, Monarez and Debra Houry, who resigned as the agency’s chief medical officer when Monarez was fired in late August, were praised by Democratic senators for speaking out. Some Republican senators, meanwhile, portrayed Monarez as untrustworthy and out-of-step with Trump’s and Kennedy’s priorities.\n\nHere, Nature outlines three key ways that science is being set aside at the CDC in favour of politics, according to the former public-health officials.\n\nPre-approving vaccine changes\n\nA panel of advisers will meet, starting tomorrow, to review how and when children should be given established vaccines for COVID-19, hepatitis B and more diseases. Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate, fired all 17 members of the panel in June and replaced them with a handpicked slate that included some who have publicly questioned the safety of immunization.\n\nMonarez testified that Kennedy told her there would be changes coming this month to the ‘schedule’ of vaccines recommended for children — and that, if she wanted to keep her job, she was expected to accept the forthcoming votes from the panel. (The CDC director has the ultimate say over any panel recommendations.) Monarez said she would want to see the data justifying their recommendations, rather than blindly approving them.\n\nDebra Houry resigned as chief medical officer at the CDC on the same day that Monarez was fired.Credit: Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nHer concerns with Kennedy’s ultimatum were so grave that she contacted the chair of the Senate committee charged with overseeing the CDC: Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana. Kennedy felt betrayed that she had taken her concerns to the US Congress, telling her never to do it again and calling Monarez untrustworthy, she testified. According to her testimony, she told him that, if he felt that he could not trust her, he should fire her.\n\nKennedy gave an alternative version of events at a hearing on 4 September, saying he fired her because she responded “no” when he asked whether she was a “trustworthy person”. Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for Kennedy’s agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), says Monarez “acted maliciously to undermine the president’s agenda and was fired as a result” — a claim that Monarez disputed at today’s hearing.\n\nSidelining agency scientists and data\n\nKennedy announced on 27 May that COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for “healthy children and healthy pregnant women” in a video on the social-media platform X. The health secretary, who has said many times that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous, without providing evidence, never consulted Houry or other top agency officials before making the announcement, she testified.\n\nRFK Jr slings accusations and defends public-health upheaval at fiery hearing\n\nPatty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington state, said she was shocked by this testimony. “It’s unthinkable that the chief medical officer at the CDC was left in the dark about such a consequential public-health decision that affected real people,” she said.\n\nMonarez also testified that, in August, Kennedy directed her to speak only with the agency’s political appointees — not career scientists, who are government employees hired for their expertise. She added that any policy decisions had to first be vetted by political appointees in Kennedy’s office, mirroring a 7 August order by Trump that strips power from career staff members who award research grants, in favour of employees chosen by the administration.\n\nAfter the hearing, Houry told Nature about her discomfort with the situation: “The CDC director should be given autonomy on how to lead the agency.”\n\nMeanwhile, career scientists, such as Houry, tried repeatedly to brief Kennedy on public-health matters and to correct false statements he’d been making in public, she testified, but his office never replied.",

          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "Illustration: The Project Twins\n\nCells are poor storytellers. They live complex, eventful lives — dividing, migrating, responding to their environment. But by the time they reach the laboratory, whatever narrative they once carried is gone. Plucked from their native context and pinned beneath a microscope or cracked open to expose the genetic ledger inside, they reveal only their final state, not the path that led them there. For cell biologists, it’s like glimpsing a play’s finale and working backwards to deduce the plot.\n\nMolecular barcodes reveal tumour lineages\n\nFor decades, researchers have strained to reconstruct cellular backstories through indirect means: static snapshots, fluorescent footprints and algorithmic inferences. But these are forensic efforts at best, post mortems of a vanished process.\n\nA new generation of DNA-recording tools promises to change that. By outfitting cells with the molecular equivalent of flight recorders, scientists can now log, in real time, the signals that cells receive, the paths they travel and the decisions they make — all inscribed indelibly in genomic ink.\n\nEarly versions of these recording systems were crude, able to track branching lineages of cellular fate through cycles of division, but little else. With advances in gene editing and single-cell sequencing technologies, however, cells can now also record the cues they sense, the states they pass through and even the timing and intensity of signalling events and gene activity.\n\nResearchers have used these tools to trace developmental decisions in mouse embryos, capture gene activity in animal brains and analyse gene expression in engineered bacteria as they pass through the gut. Yet these remain early demonstrations, and the research community is still focused on expanding its technical capabilities.\n\n“The field is nascent,” says Randall Platt, a genome engineer at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in Basel. “There are more examples of concepts than practical use cases that have led to biological or medical breakthroughs.”\n\nJay Shendure helped to kick-start the development of cell-recording devices as a graduate student in 2003.Credit: Ron Wurzer/AP Images for HHMI_(2015)\n\nEven so, momentum is building. Proof-of-concept studies are pointing towards real-world potential. And, backed by fresh investments, the pace of innovation is only expected to accelerate. “Many threads have matured,” says Jay Shendure, a genome scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. The goal now, he explains, is to “push the engineering to the next level”.\n\nOnce optimized and broadly adopted, DNA-based recording tools could transform how scientists study development, disease and cellular decision-making in real time. “If we can now engineer cells to record in ways that are predictable and programmable,” Shendure says, “that just opens up all kinds of frontiers.”\n\nDNA diaries\n\nThe dream of writing data into life’s code dates at least to 2003, when Shendure was an MD–PhD student at Harvard Medical School (HMS) in Boston, Massachusetts. That year, he and his supervisor, geneticist George Church, filed a patent for what they called a “nucleic acid memory device”: a primitive recording system in bacteria that used ‘recombinase’ enzymes to flip segments of DNA back and forth, like a toggle switch.\n\nIt was an ambitious vision for molecular data storage — but one constrained by the technology of the time. Even if the concept could, in principle, log gene activity, the DNA-sequencing methods then available made interpreting the records slow and impractical. “It was too early,” says Church. It took another decade — and the advent of next-generation sequencing, which drastically sped up DNA reading and reduced the cost — before the first molecular recorders capable of capturing large amounts of biological information over sustained periods could be built.\n\nNatureTech hub\n\nSynthetic biologist Timothy Lu, then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, led the charge, showing in 2014 how engineered bacteria could convert fleeting transcriptional signals into changes in DNA. By pairing this process with the expression of recombinase enzymes, Lu and his colleagues created permanent genetic barcodes1. Two years later, they extended the approach to record the identity of diverse chemical stimuli and the order in which they occur2.\n\nBut this strategy soon hit a wall. Every extra piece of memory — every transcriptional event, signalling cue or developmental decision — demanded its own distinct enzyme that could operate independently of the others. And there were simply too few known recombinases to expand memory capacity in any substantial way.\n\nA new technology platform was needed — and it arrived in the form of CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing.\n\nIn 2016, just a few years after CRISPR was adapted for editing human DNA, Shendure harnessed the tool to induce serial mutations at defined genomic sites, enabling his team to record lineage information across successive rounds of cellular division3. Known as GESTALT (genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing), the system comprised two components: a stretch of DNA engineered with multiple CRISPR targets; and the Cas9 machinery that introduced edits at those sites (see ‘Cellular recording devices’).\n\nAs cells divided, cuts were repaired imperfectly, leaving unique barcodes that accumulated over time. By sequencing these evolving barcodes, researchers could reconstruct cellular family trees across tissues or even entire organisms — as Shendure and his colleagues, including Aaron McKenna, then a graduate student and now a cancer geneticist at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine in Lebanon, New Hampshire, demonstrated in cultured human cells and zebrafish embryos. Others soon followed suit with CRISPR-based recorders for use in mouse and cancer models, achieving much greater memory capacity than with recombinase systems, and opening fresh avenues for studying cell dynamics in development and disease.\n\nArmed with these molecular timekeepers, researchers revealed hidden routes for how cancer cells spread (known as metastasis) as well as insights into how cancer clones expand4. Developmental biologists, using similar strategies in embryonic mice, challenged long-standing views of blood formation, uncovering progenitor cell populations that make lasting contributions to the blood system5. “The level of detail and resolution it supports is unparalleled,” Sarah Bowling, a developmental biologist at Stanford School of Medicine in California, says of the CRISPR-based lineage-tracing mice that she helped to pioneer.\n\nBut CRISPR–Cas9 also comes with trade-offs. Because it relies on double-strand breaks in DNA, it can be toxic to cells. And repeated cutting across target sites can erase the very record it is meant to preserve. As a result, although CRISPR enables richer lineage tracing than do older recombinase-powered tools, the barcodes it produces eventually saturate, cautions HMS synthetic biologist Sahand Hormoz. “If you delete enough, then everything’s deleted — and you don’t have any pattern you can use to reconstruct the lineage tree,” he says.\n\nPrime time\n\nThat concern has pushed the field towards more-refined editing strategies such as base editors and, more recently, prime editors, that rewrite DNA without inducing double-strand breaks. Both are built on a CRISPR–Cas framework, but whereas base editors swap one DNA letter for another at a single position, prime editors use a guided reverse transcriptase to write short custom sequences into the genome.\n\nThese next-generation editors are pushing the field beyond lineage recording, allowing precise logging of gene expression and signalling dynamics, and empowering researchers to record not just that an event occurred, but also what preceded and followed it. “Before, there wasn’t really a good way to translate sensing what’s happening in the cell to genome editing,” says Junhong Choi, a synthetic biologist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\nPatterns of DNA modifications provide a ‘barcode’ for cell-lineage tracing\n\nNow, by tying the activity of prime editors to stimulus-responsive promoters or transcriptional circuits, researchers can convert transient molecular events — such as bursts of gene expression or protein–protein interactions — into permanent, time-stamped DNA changes. What’s more, this kind of genomic bookkeeping can be parallelized to respond to diverse cellular signals, creating simultaneous, chronological recordings of molecular activity in a type of multitrack data ledger, notes Theresa Loveless, a synthetic biologist at Rice University in Houston, Texas. “That modularity is a real advantage,” she says.\n\nCollectively, these systems — accessible through the biological materials repository Addgene — represent more than just clever uses of genome editing. They are sophisticated pieces of synthetic-biology design that integrate finely tuned logic circuits with modular genetic components: sensors to detect cellular or environmental cues; actuators to relay inputs; and writers to inscribe information into DNA. “It wraps together many components of synthetic cell manipulation into these complex machines,” says Seth Shipman, a bioengineer at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, California.\n\nStill, even as these tools grow more powerful and intricate, researchers continue to find value in simpler approaches — including the kind that Shendure and Church first imagined more than two decades ago.\n\nLast year, biophysicist Harry McNamara and his colleagues at Princeton University in New Jersey used a recombinase-based system to track the activity of key signalling molecules during early mouse-embryo development. This revealed distinct groups of cells whose molecular experiences were correlated with their eventual locations along the embryo’s anterior–posterior axis6. It was a task for which recombinases were well suited, because the biological question required only a durable yes/no record of signalling activity, not the detailed logs that CRISPR-based tools can provide, says McNamara, who is now at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n“It allowed us to really look back in time and identify these key decision points when cells decide, in a sense, where they’re going to end up,” he says.\n\nFluorescent focus\n\nNot everyone is sold on DNA as the universal recording medium, however.\n\nBioengineer Changyang Linghu at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, for one, favours a system in which protein monomers are added to a growing super-molecular assembly in response to transcriptional events7. This strategy works best in non-dividing cells such as neurons, because the protein assemblies are diluted during cell division. But the approach also offers a significant advantage: by pairing fluorescence imaging with event-specific protein tags, researchers can determine not just when and how strongly a gene was active, but also where in the cell this activity occurred.\n\nMost DNA-based recording platforms lose this spatial context, because sequencing requires cell lysis, which destroys cellular architecture. To address this, synthetic biologist Amjad Askary at the University of California, Los Angeles, developed imaging-based systems that link fluorescence signals to genetic barcodes, enabling his team to trace transcriptional histories in intact tissues8. Notably, however, “these are nowhere close to as easy and adaptable for labs to do as single-cell sequencing”, says Askary.",

          "abstract": "Madeleine Cheung in front of a model of the Voyager spacecraft during one of her visits to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Credit: Madeleine Cheung\n\nM.C.: In October 2023, two months into an America and World Relations course at my secondary school in Los Angeles, California, our teacher told us to find a mentor working in a field in which we were interested in pursuing a career.\n\nI wanted mine to be a scientist who could tell me about their day-to-day role and how they use their work to further humanity’s knowledge.\n\nBut I wasn’t sure how to find one. My teacher suggested using my existing network, such as friends’ parents. But a friend encouraged me to approach C.M., a carbon-cycle and ecosystems researcher, when he spoke to our class about his work at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), based at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. This was my first interaction with someone in environmental science, a field I hope to work in. He agreed to be my mentor.\n\nOur first virtual meeting was in May 2024, and was followed by a couple more over the summer break. We talked about how a scientist finds and publishes knowledge, which introduced me to various types of journal. We also made a plan for the upcoming school year (during which we met virtually for 30 minutes each week), focusing on the research areas I was interested in learning more about and, hopefully, contributing to.\n\nGetting started\n\nDuring our weekly meetings, we talked about C.M.’s research on Arctic tipping points (an abrupt or irreversible change into a qualitatively different state), and I gradually started to play a more active part in the sessions by finding papers and summarizing their findings. This February, I visited C.M. at JPL, where I met his colleagues, who shared their career journeys with me.\n\nAt the end of my two-year America and World Relations course, I gave a presentation reflecting on my experience with C.M., including how we met, what we did and what I learnt. His mentorship provided invaluable exposure to careers in science and gave me a real understanding of research. Tasks I completed, such as literature reviews, could form part of C.M.’s research paper on Arctic tipping points, and that has given me confidence in my ability to contribute to scientific work.\n\nThe mentorship also challenged some of my misconceptions. I had assumed that, to go into environmental science, I would need to focus on this for my bachelor’s degree. However, C.M.’s degree is in chemistry and history. This taught me that you can take various routes into science, and that your undergraduate years should be a time of exploration.\n\nI learnt that science is, first and foremost, one big group project (often a global collaboration, in fact), rather than a lonely pursuit full of technical jargon and rigid methods, which is how some of my peers perceive it.\n\nThe mentorship also introduced me to resources such as Google Scholar and the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, showing me how open science can provide free, accessible knowledge. I realized that C.M. uses some of the same tools that I used at school, such as group to-do lists and presentations to summarize work for others. As a result, science feels more attainable, and less like a far-off fantasy restricted to the most brilliant minds.\n\nMixing it up\n\nMy mentoring experience with C.M. wasn’t my only exposure to careers in science during my time at school; I also took part in the Summer High School Intensive Next-Generation Engineering program at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. As part of environmental engineer Burçin Becerik-Gerber’s research group, I worked on a project that aimed to understand how energy dashboards in residential homes can motivate people to reduce their energy usage.\n\nThe other two school students in that group were male, as were the two PhD students we worked with. Meanwhile, at school, in my combined physics and chemistry class, I was one of only two female students in a class of seven, with a male teacher.\n\nThese experiences reminded me that being a young woman in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) can seem daunting, despite the strides society has made to embrace gender equality in the STEM fields.\n\nOverall, I now feel more comfortable about stepping into a male-dominated field. I hope to use my experience to relate to and motivate girls and young women to pursue STEM-related careers.\n\nHere are three tips I would give to any secondary-school student looking to get immersed in the world of science and research.\n\nFirst, keeping an open mind allows you to step into situations and experiences that you might not have thought possible. Throughout the mentorship, I carried out tasks despite having doubts about my ability. Although it is important to have some goals in mind, having too many expectations while still at school can prevent you from reaching your potential and truly getting the most out of the journey.\n\nMentoring resources\n\nSecond, asking about the possibility of a mentorship in person, rather than digitally, such as over e-mail, makes the relationship more personable from the beginning and gives you a higher chance of receiving a follow-up. Before meeting C.M., I had reached out to three people online, but found that cold e-mailing was ineffective.\n\nLast, I found that having the support of your school, and specifically that of a teacher who can vouch for you, is indispensable in ensuring that the process goes as smoothly as possible. If other adults are already aware of your goal, it can open the door to more connections, and reassure the person you reach out to.\n\nMoving on\n\nThe world I was born into has changed from simply questioning climate change and the reasons for it to joining together to mitigate its effects. I have grown into a young woman confident in following a path of environmental advocacy through STEM. By 2030, I will have finished the undergraduate degree that I started last month, and hope to have been witness to a crucial climatic milestone: the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 45% to keep the global temperature increase under 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nBut immersing myself in professional science while still at school has convinced me that I need not be just a witness; with the right tools, I feel ready to use my voice to be a positive contributor to a more sustainable world.\n\nSecondary-school student Madeleine Cheung visited environmental scientist David Miller at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.Credit: Madeleine Cheung\n\nC.M.: My daughter attends the International School of Los Angeles, and once or twice a year I go there to talk to the science classes.

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Deep in the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mélissa Berthet found bonobos doing something thought to be uniquely human.\n\nHow to detect consciousness in people, animals and maybe even AI\n\nDuring the six months that Berthet observed the primates, they combined calls in several ways to make complex phrases1. In one example, bonobos (Pan paniscus) that were building nests together added a yelp, meaning ‘let’s do this’, to a grunt that says ‘look at me’. “It’s really a way to say: ‘Look at what I’m doing, and let’s do this all together’,” says Berthet, who studies primates and linguistics at the University of Rennes, France.\n\nIn another case, a peep that means ‘I would like to do this’ was followed by a whistle signalling ‘let’s stay together’. The bonobos combine the two calls in sensitive social contexts, says Berthet. “I think it’s to bring peace.”\n\nThe study, reported in April, is one of several examples from the past few years that highlight just how sophisticated vocal communication in non-human animals can be. In some species of primate, whale2and bird, researchers have identified features and patterns of vocalization that have long been considered defining characteristics of human language. These results challenge ideas about what makes human language special — and even how ‘language’ should be defined.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, many scientists turn to artificial intelligence (AI) tools to speed up the detection and interpretation of animal sounds, and to probe aspects of communication that human listeners might miss. “It’s doing something that just wasn’t possible through traditional means,” says David Robinson, an AI researcher at the Earth Species Project, a non-profit organization based in Berkeley, California, that is developing AI systems to decode communication across the animal kingdom.\n\nAs the research advances, there is increasing interest in using AI tools not only to listen in on animal speech, but also to potentially talk back.\n\nCombining calls\n\nResearchers studying animal communication ask some of the same types of question that linguists do. How are speech sounds physically produced (phonetics)? How are sounds combined to make meaningful units (morphology)? What rules determine how phrases and sentences are structured (syntax)?\n\nUntil about a decade ago, researchers thought that only humans used a feature known in linguistics as compositionality. This is the combining of meaningful words, calls or other noises into expressions that have a meaning derived from those of their parts.\n\nA human gene makes mice squeak differently — did it contribute to language?\n\nBut in 2016, a study of Japanese tits (Parus minor) changed how scientists thought about compositionality. The birds looked for predators when they heard an ‘alert’ call and approached a sound’s source after hearing a ‘recruitment’ call. When they heard the calls in that order, they performed both behaviours3. But they didn’t do so when the order was reversed, suggesting compositionality: the combination of calls had its own meaning.\n\nA study in 2023 extended that work. By presenting chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with fake snakes in the wild, scientists showed that the primates similarly combine ‘alarm’ and ‘recruitment’ vocalizations into a message that prompts others to gather around the caller to respond to a threat4.\n\nHowever, humans remained the only species known to use compositionality in more than one way. For instance, by ordering words differently to change the meaning of the phrase, adding endings to words to modify meaning and creating metaphors and idioms to produce a figurative expression.\n\nBonobos in the Democratic Republic of the Congo combine calls into phrases in several ways.Credit: Christian Ziegler/Nature Picture Library\n\nBut the study by Berthet and her colleagues softened that distinction between humans and other animals. They recorded 700 calls by 30 adult bonobos and found that the animals combined a finite number of calls in four ways1. One — a yelp–grunt combination — the authors considered to have ‘trivial’ compositionality, because the meaning of the individual calls had merely been combined. (For instance, ‘the red car’ describes an object that is both red and a car.) In the three other cases, one call modified the other, resulting in ‘non-trivial’ compositionality. (‘A terrible actor’ describes a person who is bad at acting, not someone who is terrible and an actor.)\n\nEvolutionary biologist Cédric Girard-Buttoz at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, France, and his colleagues reported in May that chimpanzees also combine a finite number of calls in several ways5. For some vocalizations, the meaning of the combined phrase can’t be determined from the meaning of the individual calls, as is the case for some idioms in human languages. For example, a hoot, used when resting on the ground, followed by a pant, which signifies playing and affiliation, prompted the chimpanzees to climb a tree, make a nest and rest together, even though neither call is typically associated with tree climbing, says Girard-Buttoz. Generating meaning in several ways is a building block of language, he adds.\n\nWhales, too, have some notable features of human language. Researchers at Project CETI, a non-profit organization in New York City, have been tracking and recording sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) off the coast of the Caribbean island of Dominica to compile a large data set of movements and sounds. By finding patterns that link whale sounds and behaviours, the scientists hope to translate ‘whale speak’.\n\nCETI linguist Gašper Beguš has been training generative-AI models to produce sounds and sequences of sounds that mimic those made by sperm whales. Whereas humans create distinct sounds by sending air through vocal folds in the throat, which vibrate at different frequencies, these whales send air through a lip-like structure in their nasal passage, which vibrates and creates clicks. The clicks are grouped into units called codas.\n\nScientists attach sensors that can gather bioacoustic and other data to sperm whales using drones.Credit: Jaime Rojo\n\nCETI scientists reported last year that sperm whales have their own ‘phonetic alphabet’, with codas varying in characteristics such as tempo and rhythm6. Beguš and his colleagues have since found that whale codas can differ in ways analogous to vowels and diphthongs in human language. Vowels in human speech differ on the basis of the tongue’s position and the shape of the lips, such as for the ‘ee’ in cheese versus the ‘o’ in hot. Diphthongs, or gliding vowels, are created by combining two vowels in a single syllable, such as in ‘pout’, resulting in a frequency change as the lips and tongue move.\n\nBeguš’s team identified two codas with distinct sound patterns that the researchers called an a-vowel and i-vowel. They also found that these vowels changed frequency in four ways: they can rise, they can fall, they can fall then rise or they can rise then fall7. The frequency changes could be indicative of diphthongs.\n\nWhat’s in a language\n\nWhether the sophistication of animal communication is enough to qualify it as language depends on how a person defines the term and what they think about how animals think. There are two prevailing views, Beguš says. “One world view says that language and complex thought are intrinsically connected.” According to this view, complex thought came first and language is a way to externalize thoughts. If so, animals can’t have a language unless they are capable of complex thought.\n\nThe other view holds that language is just one kind of communication, like gestures or facial expressions, and complex thought isn’t required. In this case, animals could have a language with or without complex thought. Experiments that train animals to communicate with humans, such as those with the bonobo Kanzi, who died earlier this year, have hinted that animals might be capable of having a language. But that’s a different question from whether they use language on their own in the wild.\n\n“The word is still out on whether we’ll find a full-on language,” says Robinson.\n\nFor one, some aspects of human language haven’t been found in other species yet. Three of the 16 features — displacement, productivity and duality — on a language checklist created by linguist Charles Hockett haven’t been identified in non-human animals.\n\nWhat do dolphins talk about? One biologist is trying to listen in\n\nDisplacement is the ability to talk about abstract concepts, such as the past, the future or things that are distant. This feature hasn’t been seen convincingly in animal communication, although there is anecdotal evidence in some instances, such as dolphins calling the names of other dolphins that had disappeared years ago, and orangutans (Pongo spp.) telling others about a predator that was previously in an area, Berthet says.\n\nProductivity is the ability to say things that have never been said or heard before, and be understood by another individual.\n\nAnd duality describes meaningful messages made up of smaller meaningful units, which consist of even smaller, meaningless sounds. Although whales use clicks to create longer codas, scientists haven’t yet shown that clicks are meaningless and codas are meaningful.\n\nRecursion is another feature that might be unique to human language. This is when sentences or phrases are embedded in each other to create deeper levels of meaning. By training crows (Corvus corone) to peck at open and closed brackets in the appropriate sequence on a touch screen, Diana Liao, who studies vocal communication and cognition at the University of Tübingen in Germany, and her colleagues found evidence that the animals are mentally capable of recursion8. “They do this even better than macaque monkeys and on par with human toddlers”, Liao says. However, it’s not clear whether crows use it in their communication.\n\nIt’s also unclear whether animals have grammatical rules that define how vocal communication is structured. And, although primates have been shown to mix and match calls to generate meaning, the number of meanings that they can produce is “really far from what humans can do”, says Girard-Buttoz.\n\nAI decodes the calls of the wild",

          "abstract": "Social norms approaches have been widely applied in health promotion as a cost-effective behaviour-change strategy, but have been little evaluated as a whole. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using social norms messaging in developed countries targeted at changing health behaviours among 16+-year-olds to evaluate their effectiveness. Relevant studies were identified through searches in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, TRIP, Cochrane and grey literature sources. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A random-effects meta-analysis standardized effect sizes to Cohen’s d , assessed heterogeneity with I ² and applied robust Bayesian meta-analysis to adjust for publication bias. Searches resulted in 89 studies ( n = 85,759), which exhibited a small effect of social norms messaging on health behaviours (Cohen’s d = 0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.09, 0.19], P &lt; 0.001). However, this effect disappeared after controlling for publication bias. We conducted moderator analyses, finding no significant differences from the overall effect for different types of social norms message, delivery modalities, health domains or target populations. The review is limited by the lack of studies assessing whether normative information changed participant perceptions, inconsistent use of manipulation checks, and high heterogeneity across studies in terms of target behaviour, population and intervention delivery, affecting the robustness of conclusions. Our analysis suggests that when appropriately controlling for publication bias, social norms messages are not effective at improving health behaviours. Thus, future attempts at improving public health should focus on alternative approaches.",

          "authors": "Kathleen Segerson",
          "abstract": "There are a variety of contexts in which “pitching in” to address environmental or resource management problems could benefit from individuals or firms working not just on their own but also working together collaboratively as a group. Examples include working together on promoting conservation or habitat protection, the sharing of information, or the development of less polluting products or production processes. However, to date, the literature on environmental policy has considered only the incentives for individual parties (e.g., firms, landowners, or individuals) to take steps (i.e., exert “effort”) to reduce pollution or meet resource management goals where those steps impact that party’s own environmental footprint or performance. Missing from the literature is any consideration of the ability of one party to undertake activities that instead help another improve the latter’s performance. Such help could be either a substitute for or a complement to one’s own effort. This paper presents an analysis showing that traditional policy approaches based on individual performance cannot generally efficiently incentivize both effort and help, but a (properly designed) collective approach where rewards or punishments are based on group performance can. This suggests an additional rationale for the use of collective approaches as a potentially important tool for promoting sustainability that has not been recognized in the literature.",

          "abstract": "Social networks scaffold the diffusion of information on social media. Much attention has been given to the spread of true vs. false content on online social platforms, including the structural differences between their diffusion patterns. However, much less is known about how platform interventions on false content alter the engagement with and diffusion of such content. In this work, we estimate the causal effects of Community Notes, a novel fact-checking feature adopted by X (formerly Twitter) to solicit and vet crowd-sourced fact-checking notes for false content. We gather detailed time series data for 40,078 posts for which notes have been proposed and use synthetic control methods to estimate a range of counterfactual outcomes. We find that attaching fact-checking notes significantly reduces the engagement with and diffusion of false content. We estimate that, on average, the notes resulted in reductions of 46.1% in reposts, 44.1% in likes, 21.9% in replies, and 13.5% in views after being attached. Over the posts’ entire lifespans, these reductions amount to 11.6% fewer reposts, 13.3% fewer likes, 6.9% fewer replies, and 5.5% fewer views on average. In reducing reposts, we observe that diffusion cascades for fact-checked content are less deep and less “viral,” but not less broad, than synthetic control estimates for non-fact-checked content with similar reach. This structural difference contrasts notably with differences between false vs. true content diffusion itself, where false information diffuses farther, but with structural patterns that are otherwise indistinguishable from those of true information, conditional on reach.",

We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in ~400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and ~13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g., upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% (SE = 4%) and 14% (SE = 3%) of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56 (SE = 0.17). Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset.

          "abstract": "Scientific explanation is one of the most sophisticated forms of human reasoning. Nevertheless, here we hypothesize that scientific explanation is susceptible to some of the same biases that influence everyday thinking—particularly during the initial stages of theory building, when scientists are first grappling with complex phenomena and are thus more likely to rely on explanatory “guesses.” Specifically, we investigated whether scientific explanation exhibits an inherence bias—a tendency to explain phenomena through inherent or intrinsic features rather than extrinsic factors such as context or relations. Consistent with this hypothesis, a comprehensive analysis of major explanatory transitions across the history of Western science revealed that initial scientific explanations systematically favored inherent properties, while subsequent explanations incorporated extrinsic factors more consistently. Seven experiments with lay participants (both adults and children; N = 1,673) and two experiments with practicing scientists from top departments worldwide ( N = 275) provided converging evidence for this bias and identified the psychological mechanisms involved. When explaining unfamiliar phenomena, even leading scientists showed a robust tendency to overweight inherent properties and underweight extrinsic factors relative to established scientific understanding. This bias appears rooted in basic cognitive constraints on attention and memory that excessively narrow the space of hypotheses initially considered. These findings advance our understanding of both the psychology of explanation and the development of scientific knowledge, while suggesting specific ways to improve scientific training and education.",

In addition, its moderate temperature enables its atmosphere to host a range of carbon and oxygen species (H 2 O, CH 4 , CO, CO 2 , NH 3 ). In this paper, we present a panchromatic emission spectrum of WASP-80 b, the first gas giant around a late K/early M-dwarf star and the coolest planet for which the James Webb Space Telescope has obtained a complete emission spectrum spanning 2.4 to 12 μ m, including NIRCam F322W2 (2.4 to 4 μ m) and F444W (4 to 5 μ m), and MIRI LRS (5 to 12 μ m). We report confident detections of H 2 O, CH 4 , CO, and CO 2 , and a tentative detection of NH 3 . We estimate WASP-80 b’s atmospheric metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio and compare them with estimates for other gas giants. Despite the relative rarity of giant planets around low-mass stars, we find that WASP-80 b’s composition is consistent with other hot gas giants, suggesting that the formation pathway of WASP-80 b may not be dissimilar from hot gas giants around higher-mass stars.",

Since necroptosis leads to the release of intracellular content, the fate of RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils after necroptotic cell death has not been investigated. Here, we tracked RIPK1 and RIPK3 coassemblies and found that these fibrillar aggregates could be released into the culture medium after the membrane rupture in necroptotic cells. Interestingly, these RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils were capable of infiltrating recipient cells and acting as seeds for the nucleation and formation of the endogenous necrosome. Cryo electron microscopy structural analysis unveiled a distinctive S-shaped conformation common to RHIM fibrils of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which can facilitate the cross-seeding of RIPK3 by RIPK1 or RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils. Our findings suggest the ability of functional RIPK1/RIPK3 amyloid fibrils in intercellular spreading to induce protein conformation change in recipient cells and provide structural insights into the mechanism of RIPK1 and RIPK3 cross-templating to drive necroptosis.",

          "abstract": "Crops genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have revolutionized pest management, but their benefits have been reduced by evolution of practical resistance in at least 31 cases. To delay evolution of resistance, farmers have shifted from crops producing one Bt protein to crops called pyramids that produce two or more Bt proteins or other traits targeting each pest. Here, we focus on resistance to transgenic corn pyramids in the western corn rootworm ( Diabrotica virgifera virgifera ) and northern corn rootworm ( Diabrotica barberi ), which cost farmers in the United States $2 billion yearly in yield losses. We analyzed 998 relevant data values for 2005 to 2023 from 12 published field studies. The results support the hypothesis that rootworm resistance to Bt proteins Cry3Bb and Gpp34/Tpp35Ab reduces the efficacy of pyramids that produce one or both of these proteins and an RNA interference trait (DvSnf7) targeting rootworms, despite no apparent strong cross-resistance between the Bt proteins and DvSnf7. The reduced efficacy of pyramids producing Bt proteins and DvSnf7 entails increased root injury and emergence of adult beetles. Efficacy of DvSnf7 was substantially lower for reducing root injury than emergence. Because root injury decreases yield, the increased root injury has immediate practical consequences. More sustainable control may be achieved by deploying pyramids with traits that are each highly effective against rootworms, increasing the abundance of host plants that do not target rootworms, and combining transgenic corn with crop rotation and other control tactics in integrated pest management programs.",

We quantified EIB kinetics by measuring excitatory (Glx) and inhibitory (GABA+) levels and assessed their temporal coupling with dynamic functional connectivity states, revealing a dependence that scales with cognitive load. Notably, we found that as cognitive challenges intensify, brain networks transition toward more specialized and enduring connectivity configurations, accompanied by imbalances that favor excitation, changes that may impact cognitive adaptability. Fluctuations in EIB and functional connectivity occurred on comparable timescales and were both associated with individual differences in cognitive performance.

          "abstract": "Across all domains of life, cobalamin-dependent methyltransferases have diversified to perform a range of crucial functions, such as methionine synthesis and the demethylation of various reduced nitrogen and sulfur compounds. These large modular enzymes typically possess three substrate-binding domains, two binding either the methyl donor or methyl acceptor, as well as a cobalamin-binding domain. Here, by challenging the current paradigm of glycine betaine (GBT) catabolism, we have identified a unique methyltransferase in aerobic environmental bacteria that has a dual function both as a methionine synthase and a GBT methyltransferase. Using the marine bacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 as a model, we demonstrate that a core cobalamin-binding domain (MtgC) and a bidirectional methyltransferase (MtgD) are essential for both methionine synthesis and GBT demethylation. MtgC is phylogenetically distinct from the cobalamin-binding domains of either the classical methionine synthase (MetH) or the GBT methyltransferases found in anaerobic bacteria and archaea. Across the global ocean, mtgC expression is frequently greater than previously known GBT catabolic pathways due to its occurrence in abundant cosmopolitan marine bacteria. Thus, we uncover a unique relationship between GBT catabolism and methionine synthesis in nature and identify a major route for N-osmolyte demethylation in the global ocean.",

          "abstract": "In an ever-changing environment, animals make optimal decisions to ensure their well-being. Faced with limited food sources, they often seek foods that provide the nutrients they require to maintain homeostasis. Under extreme circumstances (e.g., infection), they may exhibit ingestive behaviors, such as seeking out substances (e.g., toxins) that suggest self-medication. Few studies, however, have investigated the mechanisms that ensue self-medication. Here, we report the selective intake of antioxidants by Drosophila melanogaster during a period of heat stress or sleep deprivation. This preference was alleviated by prefeeding them vitamin C or dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) before exposure to stress. Heat stress led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the gut, which was alleviated by the intake of vitamin C. Heat stress reduced vitamin C in hemolymph, whereas the consumption of vitamin C or DHA increased it. Furthermore, the intake of vitamin C ameliorated the intestinal barrier dysfunction and extended the survival of flies that had been exposed to chronic heat stress. The heat-induced preference for vitamin C appears to develop independently of the known peripheral chemosensory receptors for this micronutrient. We propose that fruit flies possess an interoceptive mechanism that mediates the detection of vitamin C to overcome environmental challenges.",

Yet, in many cases and especially when stakes are high, humans still make final decisions. The critical question, therefore, is whether AI helps humans make better decisions compared to a human-alone or AI-alone system. We introduce a methodological framework to answer this question empirically with minimal assumptions. We measure a decision maker’s ability to make correct decisions using standard classification metrics based on the baseline potential outcome. We consider a single-blinded and unconfounded treatment assignment, in which the provision of AI-generated recommendations is assumed to be randomized across cases, conditional on observed covariates, with final decisions made by humans. Under this study design, we show how to compare the performance of three alternative decision-making systems—human-alone, human-with-AI, and AI-alone. Importantly, the AI-alone system encompasses any individualized treatment assignment, including those not used in the original study. We also show when AI recommendations should be provided to a human-decision maker, and when one should follow such recommendations. We apply the proposed methodology to our own randomized controlled trial evaluating a pretrial risk assessment instrument. We find that the risk assessment recommendations do not improve the classification accuracy of a judge’s decision to impose cash bail. Furthermore, replacing a human judge with algorithms—the risk assessment score and a large language model in particular—yields worse classification performance.",

          "abstract": "This study presents a comparative cradle-to-gate environmental and economic evaluation of nine synthetic routes for Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801), a broad-spectrum antiviral drug. Integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with Life Cycle Costing (LCC), we quantified the environmental impacts alongside capital and operational costs, net present costs, and break-even prices of each route. The results reveal significant variation across the schemes, with Schemes #1 and #2 exhibiting the highest impacts and costs due to intensive use of chloroform and diethyl ether, while Scheme #8 demonstrated the lowest impacts and costs, benefitting from higher batch output, greener solvents, and process intensification. Scenario analyses showed that solvent recovery improves sustainability only when high recovery rates are combined with clean electricity; otherwise, the additional energy demand may offset benefits. Scale-up analysis confirmed that higher production scales substantially reduce per-gram impacts and costs, supporting economies of scale. These findings highlight the critical role of solvent management, energy sourcing, the use of sustainability assessment at the earliest stages of innovation, and process design in aligning green chemistry with economic viability. The proposed integrated LCA-LCC framework provides transferable insights to guide sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing and supports the development of evidence-based policy for greener antiviral drug production.",

          "abstract": "Tissue deformations during morphogenesis can be active, driven by internal processes, or passive, resulting from stresses applied at their boundaries. Here, we introduce the Drosophila hindgut primordium as a model for studying boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis. We characterize its deformations and show that its complex shape changes can be a passive consequence of the deformations of the active regions of the embryo that surround it. First, we find an intermediate characteristic “triangular keyhole” shape in the 3D deformations of the hindgut. We construct a minimal model of the hindgut primordium as an elastic ring deformed by active midgut invagination and germ band extension on an ellipsoidal surface, which robustly captures the symmetry-breaking into this triangular keyhole shape. We then quantify the 3D kinematics of the tissue by a set of contours and find that the hindgut deforms in two stages: An initial translation on the curved embryo surface followed by a rapid breaking of shape symmetry. We extend our model to show that the contour kinematics in both stages are consistent with our passive picture. Our results suggest that the role of in-plane deformations during hindgut morphogenesis is to translate the tissue to a region with anisotropic embryonic curvature and show that uniform boundary conditions are sufficient to generate the observed nonuniform shape change. Our work thus provides a possible explanation for the various characteristic shapes of blastopore-equivalents in different organisms and a framework for the mechanical emergence of global morphologies in complex developmental systems.",

A key challenge is that we still do not know how best to describe—and quantify—the many-to-many dynamical interactions that characterize their complexity. To address this limitation, we introduce the mathematical framework of Integrated Information Decomposition, or Φ ID. Φ ID provides a comprehensive framework to disentangle and characterize the information dynamics of complex multivariate systems. On the theoretical side, Φ ID reveals the existence of previously unreported modes of collective information flow, providing tools to express well-known measures of information transfer, information storage, and dynamical complexity as aggregates of these modes, thereby overcoming some of their known theoretical shortcomings. On the empirical side, we validate our theoretical results with computational models and examples from over 1,000 biological, social, physical, and synthetic dynamical systems. Altogether, Φ ID improves our understanding of the behavior of widely used measures for characterizing complex systems across disciplines and leads to new more refined analyses of dynamical complexity.",

          "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) entry into host cells begins with interactions between the viral envelope proteins hemagglutinin (HA)/neuraminidase (NA) and sialic acid moieties on the cell plasma membrane. These interactions drive IAV’s lateral diffusion along the cell membrane and trigger membrane morphological changes required for endocytosis. However, directly visualizing these dynamic processes, which are crucial for IAV entry, has been challenging using conventional microscopy techniques. In this study, we enabled live-cell observation of nanoscale morphological dynamics of IAV and the cell membrane by reducing the mechanical invasiveness of atomic force microscopy (AFM). A customised cantilever with less than half the spring constant of conventional cantilevers enabled virus-view AFM imaging that preserved IAV–membrane interactions. By combining virus-view AFM with confocal microscopy, we performed correlative morphological and fluorescence observations of IAV lateral diffusion and endocytosis in living cells. Variations in diffusion coefficients of single virions suggested heterogeneity in sialic acid density on the cell membrane. NA inhibition decreased diffusion coefficients, while reduced sialic acid density increased them. The timing of clathrin accumulation at virion binding sites coincided with a decrease in diffusion coefficients, a relationship that was maintained independent of NA activity or sialic acid density. As clathrin assembly progressed, ~100-nm-high membrane bulges emerged adjacent to the virus, culminating in the complete membrane envelopment of the virus at peak clathrin accumulation. Our virus-view AFM will deepen our understanding of various virus–cell interactions, facilitate the evaluation of drug effects and promote future translational research.",

          "abstract": "While air heat waves often grab headlines, riverine heat waves have gone quietly unnoticed because rivers are commonly perceived as cool refuges. Analysis of riverine heat waves has been hindered by fragmented datasets, despite a proliferation in water-temperature monitoring with sensors and satellites. Here, we analyze riverine heat wave events by training one single deep learning (long short-term memory) model and reconstructing consistent and continuous daily water temperatures (WT) in 1471 sites in the Contiguous United States (1980–2022). We show that riverine heat waves occur at about half the frequency (2.3 versus 4.6 events/year), a third intensity (2.6 versus 7.7 °C/event), but almost double the duration (7.2 versus 4.0 d/event) of air heat waves. Riverine heat wave events have increased at double to quadruple rates of air heat wave events, amounting to an additional 1.8 events/year in frequency, 0.43 °C/event in intensity, 3.4 d/event in duration, and 7 to 15 additional thermal stress days for aquatic ecosystems in 2022 compared to 1980. Rising riverine heat waves have outpaced those of air heat waves in 65 to 76% of the sites, particularly in regions experiencing accelerated warming (e.g., the Rockies). Riverine heat wave trends are driven predominantly by climate-induced changes such as warming and dwindling snowpacks and water flow. Human activities do play important roles: large dams elongate, whereas agriculture reduces heat waves. These results highlight anthropogenic climate change as the primary external driver, whereas human-induced structural changes as the secondary internal modulators of river response to heat disturbance. The widespread rise of riverine heat waves threatens aquatic ecosystems and water-energy-food security, underscoring the need for their global characterization and risk assessment.",

          "abstract": "R-loops are an important class of non-B DNA structures that form co-transcriptionally. Using in vitro transcription and unbiased quantitative sequencing readouts, we show that the addition of single-strand DNA binding proteins co-transcriptionally can drive a 3- to 5-fold increase of R-loop frequency without significant changes to R-loop distribution. We propose that this is caused by stabilizing and preventing the collapse of short nascent R-loops. This suggests that R-loop formation is highly dynamic and highlights single strand binding proteins as players in cellular R-loop regulation. We further show that nontemplate strand DNA nicks are powerful initiators of R-loop formation, increasing R-loop frequencies by up to two orders of magnitude. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the nontemplate strand in nick-initiated structures is often flayed away from the RNA:DNA hybrid and engaged in self-pairing, creating unique forked R-loop features. DNA nicks, one of the most frequent DNA lesions in cells, are therefore potential hotspots for opportunistic R-loop initiation and may cause the formation of a distinct class of R-loops. Overall, this work highlights the importance of the displaced single-strand on R-loop initiation and dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Creativity in the arts, such as painting and musical performance, hinges on the ability to produce a wide spectrogram of perceptual experiences. In music, it has long been believed that the timbre of tones can be altered by nuanced movements of performers. Previous studies have described relationships between fundamental elements of auditory perceptions (e.g., loudness, tempo) and physical movements (e.g., force, speed), but it remains unknown whether and how delicate features of perceptual experiences such as tone timbre are manipulated through dexterous motor skills. Here, we bridge this gap using a twofold experimental approach. First, our listening test revealed that the timbral qualities pianists intended to express in piano playing were perceived as intended by both pianists and musically untrained individuals, with pianists showing a greater perceptual sensitivity to different timbres. Second, through a motor behavioral experiment using a noncontact, high-resolution sensing system, we identified five specific movement features in piano touch that were intricately linked to three categories of perceived timbre; weight, clarity, and brightness. Furthermore, the direct manipulation of a specific key movement feature resulted in systematic changes in perceived timbre, providing evidence for a causal relationship. The result indicates that pianists share common motor skills to modify perceived tone timbre by manipulating specific movement features. Our findings underscore the pivotal roles of subtle physical gestures in creating the rich timbral palette of piano tones, advancing our understanding of the intersection between motor control and artistic expression.",

          "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a clinically important herpesvirus that has coevolved for millions of years with its human host, and establishes lifelong persistent infection. A substantial proportion of its 235 kb genome is dedicated to manipulating host immunity through targeting antiviral host proteins for degradation or relocalization. Quantitative proteomics of the infected cell has extensively characterized these processes, but the cell-free virion has been less well studied. We therefore carried out proteomic analysis of a clinical HCMV strain (Merlin) virion. This revealed 18 novel components, including the viral protein gpUL141, which is recognized as an NK immune-evasin that targets several host proteins (CD155, CD112, and TRAILR) when expressed within the cell. Coimmunoprecipitation of gpUL141 from virions identified interactions with viral entry glycoproteins from the trimer (gH/gL/gO), pentamer (gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A), and gH/gpUL116 complexes, as well as gB. Only interactions with gH/gB occurred in the absence of other viral proteins. Analysis supported a model in which gpUL141 homodimers independently interacted with separate gB/gH-containing complexes. gpUL141 encodes an ER retention domain that restricts trafficking through the ER/Golgi, and limited the transport of glycoprotein complexes bound by gpUL141. As a result, gpUL141 reduced levels of multiple glycoprotein complexes on the infected cell surface as well as in the virion. This reduced syncytium formation, inhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. Thus, gpUL141 represents an immune-evasin that not only targets host proteins to limit NK-cell attack, but also alters the trafficking of multiple viral glycoprotein complexes in order to evade humoral immunity.",

          "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases and biological invasions pose increasing threats to public and ecosystems health. Proactive measures—such as prevention and surveillance taken before initial detection of the pathogen or species—are essential to ensure minimal spread prior to first detection. We developed an optimization model to determine where, when, and how much effort should be allocated to prevention versus surveillance. The model accounts for imperfect detection, system dynamics, spatial heterogeneity in risk and costs and is scalable to large landscapes. We found that the most cost-effective strategy is to maintain the prevention and surveillance efforts at stable equilibrium for the majority of the time, with deviations occurring only initially to steer the system toward the equilibrium. The equilibrium effort is jointly determined by the introduction risk, management costs, and total budget. Application of this model to chronic wasting disease in New York State suggests that the optimal strategy could reduce the cumulative disease cases before initial detection by an average of 22% compared to current practice. The optimal surveillance strategy could detect the disease on average over 8 mo earlier than the current strategy.",

Previous proteomics studies identified an interaction between eVP35 and the host E3 ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb 2 (MIB2). Here, we show how an NNLNS (Asn-Asn-Leu-Asn-Ser) motif (residues 201 to 205) within eVP35 serves as a binding site for MIB2. This motif is critical for eVP35-dependent inhibition of MIB2-mediated interferon induction. It is also important for EBOV RNA synthesis as MIB2 binding to eVP35 inhibited EBOV minigenome activity.

Incurring AL during sensitive developmental periods such as childhood may affect health outcomes later in life, but longitudinal measures to test these life course effects are lacking. This study tested associations between childhood AL and adult cardiometabolic health in a large sample of youth repeatedly measured across ages 9 to 16, and their adult cardiometabolic health at age 30. AL scores were calculated at each age by summing across sex- and age-standardized values for biomarkers representing immune (C-Reactive Protein, Epstein–Barr Virus antibodies), neuroendocrine (cortisol, DHEA-s), and cardiometabolic indicators (body mass index; BMI). Adult cardiometabolic health was measured using a composite sum score of sex-standardized systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio. Multiple approaches aggregating repeated AL scores were tested, including mean, maximum, oldest available AL score across childhood, and a version omitting BMI from the index. Childhood AL was significantly associated with adult cardiometabolic health ( P &lt; 0.001), with higher AL predicting worse cardiometabolic outcomes at age 30 in all models, regardless of how AL was defined. Sensitivity analyses to address potential bias from missing observations using 20 imputed datasets were consistent with unimputed models. Follow-up analyses suggested risk for adult cardiometabolic outcomes was primarily associated with C-reactive protein, DHEA-s, and childhood BMI. In this cohort study, physiological dysregulation experienced in early life had lasting consequences. These results underscore the importance of childhood as a sensitive period during which cumulative stress exposure can shape long-term health trajectories.",

To address this gap, we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate fracture propagation in LCEs. We stretch edge-cracked monodomain LCE samples, recording their stress-stretch responses and crack paths under varying initial directors and stretching rates. Our findings reveal that cracks can change direction during propagation, which are highly dependent on both the initial director and the stretching rate. To further understand LCE fracture behavior, we develop a rate-dependent phase-field fracture model, which is validated through experiments, and demonstrates the ability to predict complex fracture paths.

Humanized mice, generated by transplanting human hematopoietic stem, progenitor cells into genetically modified mice, are invaluable to study human immune development and function in vivo. However, a major limitation of current models is suboptimal myelopoiesis, particularly lack of functional human neutrophils, hampering the modeling of human immune responses and chronic diseases. Here, we describe a humanized mouse model, named MaGIC for genes replaced, in the C57Bl/6 N strain, which improves human myelopoiesis and enables development of functional human neutrophils. In MaGIC mice, human cytokines M-CSF/CSF1(M), GM-CSF/CSF2(G) and IL-6(I) are knocked-in replacing mouse genes and murine IL2rg and Rag1 (a) are deleted. Human THPO in these mice supports human hematopoiesis. More importantly, insertion of human CD47 (C) under the control of endogenous mouse CD47 promoter enables xenotransplantation and human neutrophil development. MaGIC mice support all human neutrophil subsets found in human bone marrow and blood, a major improvement. This is achieved by creating a niche postirradiation for human granulocyte–macrophage progenitors via reduced murine CD47 and physiological levels of human CD47. These mice also have mature human monocytes, tissue macrophages, alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells, enabled by humanized M-CSF and GM-CSF. Human neutrophils in MaGIC mice are fully functional in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation in response to inflammation. MaGIC mice address critical gaps in current models and enable incisive translational research on human neutrophils, advancing studies in infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.",

Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we identify ddbABCDEF , a six-gene locus encoding secreted nucleases and an outer membrane transporter, essential for exogenous DNA metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron . Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with ddbABCDEF mutants reveals that this pathway significantly alters nucleobase pools in a gnotobiotic mouse model. Comparative genomic analyses demonstrate that ddbABCDEF is evolutionarily related to a natural transformation system present in Bacteroidota and has diversified into four distinct subtypes, each linked to unique DNA-processing activities in closely related gut Bacteroidales strains.

          "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) can be both activators and repressors of gene transcription. This can manifest as “duality,” where the transcriptional response increases (activation) with TF concentration in one context but decreases (repression) in another context, or as “nonmonotonicity,” where, in the same context, the response increases in part of the concentration range and decreases outside that range. Here we use biophysical models of gene regulation to investigate how duality and nonmonotonicity relate to the interactions between a TF, Polymerase and the regulatory DNA. We distinguish two modes of TF action on Polymerase: “coherent,” with interactions either positive or negative, and “incoherent,” where interactions are a mix of both. For TFs that act incoherently from a single TF–DNA binding site, nonmonotonicity can arise, but only under nonequilibrium models. For single-site models, we show that nonmonotonicity can never happen under the common thermodynamic models of gene regulation, which consider equilibrium conditions and ignore the dissipative nature of the transcription process. Moreover, we show that merely changing the TF–DNA binding affinity, while keeping other features fixed, can tune the response between activation and repression, with responses either evaluated as a function of TF concentration or site number. Using the mammalian Sp1 as a case study and synthetically designed target sequences, we find experimental evidence for nonmonotonicity, and activation or repression tuned by affinity, which we interpret as evidence of incoherent action. Our work highlights the importance of moving from a TF-centric view to a systems view when reasoning about transcriptional control.",

          "abstract": "The [FeFe]-hydrogenase employs an active-site 6Fe H-cluster to catalyze the reversible reduction of protons to H 2 . A [4Fe-4S] subcluster of the H-cluster is synthesized by housekeeping iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery, and then dedicated hydrogenase maturation enzymes, together with components of the glycine cleavage system, build and deliver a [2Fe] subcluster to generate the full H-cluster. Here, we report that the Escherichia coli iron-sulfur carrier protein NfuA supports in vitro maturation of fully active [FeFe]-hydrogenase, with H 2 production rates comparable to that of the in vivo - matured Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [FeFe]-hydrogenase ( Cr HydA). Inclusion of NfuA in the in vitro maturation process improves its efficacy by delivering the iron essential for formation of the [Fe II (cys)(CN)(CO) 2 ] – synthon at the dangler iron site of the HydG auxiliary cluster. NfuA serves an additional role in reconstituting and maintaining the catalytically essential iron-sulfur clusters on the maturase enzymes HydE, HydF, and HydG. Further inclusion of a high CO affinity myoglobin variant (Mb H64L ) sequesters free CO generated during the maturation process, minimizing formation of the CO-inhibited H ox -CO enzyme state, significantly increasing hydrogenase activity. The addition of NfuA and Mb H64L to the fully defined maturation system thus results in an in vitro [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation system that generates highly active enzyme while providing insights into factors important to in vivo maturation.",

To enhance our understanding of dietary niche breadth, we used DNA metabarcoding to examine how diets of a widespread, model herbivore (woodrats, genus Neotoma ) respond to changing resources and the extent to which dietary specialization is conserved across space and time. We used diet data from 13 species, 57 populations, and over 500 individuals to examine predictors of niche breadth and interindividual diet variation at a landscape scale. Then, to test whether these patterns are conserved across scales, we explored the same questions using a single population sampled over 5 y and mark-recapture data from individuals sampled at least three times. We found that woodrats exhibited a continuum of dietary specialization that included species-level dietary generalists and specialists. Specialist species maintained narrow population-level niche breadths with little evidence of interindividual diet variation. In contrast, generalist species consisted of populations with varying degrees of dietary specialization and interindividual diet variation. Across sampling scales, increased population-level niche breadth was explained by both increased interindividual diet variation and increased diet richness. These results are consistent with the Niche Variation Hypothesis and suggest that diet breadth is constrained by costs of both specialization and generalization.",

          "abstract": "Deep mutational scanning (DMS) assays provide a powerful method to generate large-scale datasets essential for advancing AI-driven predictions in biology. The tripartite β-lactamase assay (TPBLA), in which a protein of interest is inserted between two domains of β-lactamase, has previously been reported as capable of detecting and quantitating the aggregation of proteins and biologics in the oxidizing periplasm of Escherichia coli and used as a platform for identifying small molecule inhibitors of aggregation. Here, we repurpose the TPBLA into a high-throughput DMS platform. We validate this format using a single-site saturation library of the intrinsically disordered peptide Aβ 42 , linked to Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating strong agreement between observed variant fitness scores and variant behavior using our previously reported low-throughput TPBLA. The results of DMS revealed variant fitness scores that correlate with known amyloid-promoting regions. An in silico approach using FoldX-derived per-residue thermodynamic stability confirmed that the TPBLA reports on amyloid fibril stability. In vitro experiments support this finding, showing a strong correlation between variant fitness scores and the critical concentration of amyloid formation. Machine learning using the DMS dataset identified β‐sheet propensity and polarity as primary drivers of variant fitness scores. The derived model is also able to predict thermodynamically stabilizing regions in other amyloid systems, underscoring its generalizability. Collectively, our results demonstrate the TPBLA as a versatile platform for generating robust datasets to advance predictive modeling and to inform the design of aggregation‐resistant proteins.",

To examine whether C4d-PirB interactions can drive pruning, dendritic spines—the postsynaptic structure of excitatory synapses—were monitored on L5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex: A significant decrease in dendritic spine density occurred in WT with C4d exposure, but KO of PirB completely prevented this loss.

          "abstract": "G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large class of membrane proteins that mediate cellular responses to a wide range of external signals and as such constitute major drug targets. While oligomerization has been shown to play a well-established role in modulating signaling for class C GPCRs (e.g., the glutamate and GABA receptors), the functional relevance of oligomerization for class A receptors, such as the β 1 -adrenergic receptor (β 1 AR), remains unclear. Here, we have examined the influence of the membrane mimetic environment on the dimerization propensity of β 1 AR using a combination of pulsed Q-band double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and single-molecule fluorescence brightness measurements in an Anti-Brownian Elektrokinetic trap. While β 1 AR is predominantly monomeric in docecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) micelles, reconstitution of β 1 AR in lipid nanodiscs preferentially favors symmetric parallel dimers. Using nanodiscs of different diameters we observed a clear size-dependent increase in the dimer fraction, reaching over 50% of the β 1 AR molecules in large (~12.5 nm diameter) nanodiscs. Addition of cholesteryl hemisuccinate, an analog of cholesterol, suppresses β 1 AR dimerization in lipid nanodiscs, recapitulating the behavior in DDM micelles. This work provides quantitative evidence that β 1 AR possesses an intrinsic, membrane sensitive predisposition for dimerization, and highlights the importance of spatial membrane constraints in the modulation of class A GPCR dimerization.",

Here, we combine nutrient analysis of fish samples with national household surveys from across East and West Africa to understand the importance of dried fish in diets. We find that small portions of dried fish contribute over 15% of recommended intakes for multiple essential dietary nutrients (calcium, iodine, iron, selenium, zinc, and vitamins B12 and D), with low heavy metal concentrations, and are consumed weekly by ~one-third of households in six countries (Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda) (~144 million people). Dried fish consumption was more prevalent than fresh fish, reaching 54% more people, particularly those in poor households and near to marine coastlines or urban centers. The widespread prevalence of nutritious dried fish suggests that these foods and their distribution networks play critical roles in food security and nutrition, even in households distant from fisheries or urban centers. Dried fish can fill nutrient gaps across the tropics but will require policies that mitigate negative effects of overfishing, environmental changes, and competition with international markets, while providing postharvest support to fish processors.",

Using two-dimensional numerical models of mantle convection with sharp and broad mineral phase transitions for pyrolite, we show that both scales of upwellings can be generated in a stagnant lid planet with an interior temperature 250 to 400 K warmer than Earth’s. The smaller plumes originate from a ~600 km deep internal layer that exists as a consequence of the different sequence of mineral phase transitions that occur in warmer mantles less processed and differentiated by partial melting and volcanism.

          "abstract": "Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First, we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced λ -jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the λ -jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become “soft” under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked “kineo-elastic” term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree–Fock calculations.",

          "abstract": "The noncoding small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) associate with a large set of proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). While the function of snRNAs is well characterized, the regulation of their transcription remains poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that SUMO conjugation regulates snRNA3′ end processing. To further study the connection between SUMOylation and snRNA biogenesis, we generated a CRISPR/dCas9 tool comprising a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) fused to the catalytic domain of the SUMO protease SENP1 (dCas9-SENP1). Here, we show that snRNA transcription decreases when dCas9-SENP1 is delivered to their promoter-proximal sequence elements (PSE), indicating that SUMO conjugation to proteins associated with snRNA promoters is necessary for proper transcriptional activity. Focusing on SNAPC1, a subunit of the snRNA-specific transcription complex SNAPc, we identified lysine residues 245 and 333 as SUMO acceptor sites and generated a SUMOylation-deficient mutant of this protein (SNAPC1 2KR). To explore the relevance of SNAPC1 SUMOylation on snRNA transcription, we generated a cell line carrying an inducible degron system for depletion of the endogenous SNAPC1 protein. This system led us to demonstrate that SNAPC1 2KR is unable to sustain basal levels of snRNA transcription. By tagging endogenous SNAPC3 and SNAPC4, two other subunits of SNAPc, we show that while SNAPC1 SUMOylation-deficient mutant is able to interact with SNAPC3, its interaction with SNAPC4 is affected, despite the fact it is still recruited to the PSE. Altogether, these results indicate that SNAPC1 SUMOylation is required for proper snRNA transcription and SNAPc complex assembly.",

          "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases present one of the most significant global health challenges. These disorders are defined by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates that impair synaptic function and cause progressive neuronal degeneration. Therefore, stimulating protein clearance mechanisms may be neuro-protective. Variants in FBXO7/PARK15 cause Parkinsonian Pyramidal Syndrome, an early-onset parkinsonian neurodegenerative disorder in humans, and inactivation of this gene in mice recapitulates many phenotypes seen in patients. The proteasome regulator PI31 is a direct binding partner of Fbxo7 and promotes local protein degradation at synapses by mediating fast proteasome transport in neurites. PI31 protein levels are reduced when the function of Fbxo7 is impaired. Here we show that restoring PI31 levels in Fbxo7 mutant fly and mouse strains prevents neuronal degeneration and significantly improves neuronal function, health, and lifespan. Notably, Fbxo7 inactivation in mouse neurons causes hyperphosphorylation of tau, and this was suppressed by transgenic expression of PI31. Our results demonstrate that PI31 is a crucial biological target through which Fbxo7 deficiency drives pathology. Therefore, targeting the PI31-pathway may represent a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",

          "abstract": "Palytoxin (PTX), a potent marine toxin, has long been known to transform Na + ,K + -ATPase (NKA), an indispensable ion pump, into a nonselective cation channel. It has been postulated that PTX takes control of the two gates on either side of a channel-like pore. These gates normally open and close alternately, synchronized with chemical events, never opening simultaneously. A critical question is whether palytoxin takes over the control of the two gates or creates a new pathway. Here, we present structures of NKA with bound palytoxin in three different states. PTX binds to NKA in E2P, occupying the physiological Na + exit pathway, similar to istaroxime, a new-generation cardiotonic steroid. Adding Na + and ATP/ADP to the NKA·PTX complex induces an open channel traversing the entire membrane alongside the physiological ion pathway. As AlF x , a stable transition state analog of phosphate replaces phosphate in the NKA·PTX complex preformed in E2P, the complex appears to undergo the normal reaction cycle from E2P to E1· n Na + . PTX occupies the space between the transmembrane helices M4 and M6, thereby preventing the closure of the extracellular half of the ion pathway. These structures demonstrate that the architecture of NKA is fundamentally different from “a pore with two gates.” Each half of the ion pathway comprises three segments, including a movable component that plays a pivotal role in translocating the bound cations by connecting the constant part to an appropriate inlet. The ion pathway of NKA transforms dynamically, ensuring that the two halves never exist simultaneously.",

          "abstract": "Insulin potently decreases blood glucose; thus, tight control is required to prevent excessive insulin release and hypoglycemia. Central to this inhibition is somatostatin released from delta cells that are clustered with beta cells in pancreatic islets. This communication is of interest because the loss of functional beta cells in diabetes leads to uncontrolled delta cell activity that disrupts islet paracrine crosstalk. While it is established that insulin and somatostatin secretion are coordinated, the specific mechanism is unsettled. We have previously demonstrated that beta cells release the hormone Urocortin 3 to stimulate delta cells at high glucose, demonstrating a paracrine negative feedback loop. Others have proposed direct coordination via gap junctions. To resolve this conundrum, we used the genetically encoded fluorescent Ca 2+ reporter GCaMP6s to simultaneously record the activity of hundreds of beta and delta cells in low (2.8 mM) (LG) and high (16.8 mM) glucose (HG). Surprisingly, while many delta cells exhibit Ca 2+ oscillations in HG that are coordinated with beta cells, the activation of these delta cells precedes beta cells and is more variable than beta cell responses. The selective delta cell knockout of connexin 36 confirmed the involvement of gap junctions. However, blockade of vesicle release with the Rho-GTPase inhibitor ML-141 completely removed coupling between beta and most delta cells in HG. Our data reveal considerable functional heterogeneity among delta cells, where most delta cells are entrained by oscillatory Ca 2+ behaviors of beta cells that are mediated by a combination of paracrine signaling and low-density gap junction coupling.",

          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle-wasting disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and inflammation caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Chronic inflammation in DMD exacerbates the complications associated with disease progression. Since the lymphatic system plays a crucial role in regulating and resolving inflammation, our primary goal was to investigate whether lymphatics were dysregulated in skeletal muscle of DMD animals. We used the D2.mdx murine and golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) canine models, as well as mouse and rat lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) to determine the role of dystrophin in lymphatic structure and function in skeletal muscles. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from control LMCs showed dystrophin expression, and protein results demonstrated that the 427-, 140-, and 71-kDa dystrophin isoforms were detectable in the LMCs from control mice, whereas the 427 kDa isoform was undetectable in LMCs derived from D2.mdx mice. Microlymphangiography and magnetic resonance lymphangiogram results showed a significant decrease in lymph transport in D2. mdx mice and GRMD dogs, respectively. Isolated flank lymphatic vessels from D2. mdx mice exhibited an increase in tonic contraction and a significant decrease in the phasic contractile frequency and amplitude, supporting lymphatic vessel dysfunction. The gene expression profile and immunofluorescence analyses of dystrophic muscle revealed inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in dystrophic muscle. Skeletal muscle tissues that showed improvement in function after adeno-associated virus-microdystrophin treatment also showed significant improvement in inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in GRMD dogs. Thus, these results show a linkage between lymphatic function and DMD pathogenesis that merits further investigation in DMD patients.",

Of the five known viral TAP inhibitors, only the herpes simplex virus (HSV) protein ICP47 has been structurally resolved. We now report cryoelectron microscopy structures of TAP in complex with the remaining four: BNLF2a (Epstein–Barr virus), hUS6 (human cytomegalovirus), bUL49.5 (bovine herpesvirus 1), and CPXV012 (cowpox virus), assembling a structural atlas of viral TAP evasion. Despite employing divergent sequences, folds, and conformational targets, these viral inhibitors converge on a common strategy: they stall TAP from the alternating access cycle, precluding peptide entry into the ER and shielding infected cells from cytotoxic T cell surveillance.

          "abstract": "Cyclic dimeric-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that regulates a variety of cellular processes, including motility, biofilm formation, secretion, cell cycle progression, and development, and also contributes to the virulence of many bacterial pathogens. While the genes encoding c-di-GMP cyclases and hydrolases are readily identifiable in microbial genomes, known c-di-GMP receptor domains are quite few, with only PilZ and MshEN broadly distributed across bacterial phyla. Recently, a new c-di-GMP receptor, named CdgR or ComFB, has been identified in cyanobacteria and shown to regulate cell size and natural competence. We demonstrated that CdgR proteins exhibit sequence and structural similarity to the Bacillus subtilis late competence development protein ComFB, a conserved protein of unknown function associated with bacterial competence. This prompted us to hypothesize that ComFB and ComFB-like proteins could also serve as c-di-GMP receptors. Here, we comprehensively investigated the ComFB protein family and demonstrated that ComFB proteins are evolutionarily widespread among bacteria and function as a novel family of c-di-GMP receptors. We showed that ComFB proteins from Gram-positive bacteria ( B. subtilis , Thermoanaerobacter brockii ) and Gram-negative pathogens ( Vibrio cholerae , Treponema denticola ) bind c-di-GMP with high affinity. Several ComFB proteins also bind cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), suggesting that ComFB represents a widely distributed bacterial protein family with dual specificity for c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP. Our physiological studies further showed that ComFB plays vital roles in controlling motility in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner in two phylogenetically distant bacteria, B. subtilis and the gram-negative Shewanella oneidensis , attesting to the biological relevance of ComFB as a c-di-GMP binding protein.",

Sub-Neptunes are expected to be the most diverse family of the exoplanet population, potentially including rocky gas dwarfs, water worlds, and mini-Neptunes, with a wide range of atmospheric, surface, and interior conditions. With no analogue in the solar system, these planets open fundamental questions in planetary processes, origins, and habitability, and present avenues in the search for life elsewhere. Atmospheric observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are enabling unprecedented characterization of sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. We survey the present landscape of JWST observations and atmospheric inferences of sub-Neptunes, which in turn provide key insights into their atmospheric processes, internal structures, surface conditions, formation pathways, and potential habitability. The atmospheric abundance constraints reveal evidence of chemical disequilibria, and insights into the planetary mass–metallicity relation in the sub-Neptune regime. Similarly, for sub-Neptunes with H 2 O-rich interiors, increasing atmospheric H 2 O abundances with the equilibrium temperature may indicate the existence of a critical temperature for transition from H 2 dominated atmospheres with tropospheric cold traps to those with steamy atmospheres. The chemical abundances also provide initial evidence for diverse planet types, from potentially habitable hycean worlds to steam worlds with supercritical water layers. These planet types serve as benchmarks for an emerging taxonomy of volatile-rich sub-Neptunes as a function of their equilibrium temperature and atmospheric extent, heralding a new era of chemical classification of low-mass exoplanets with JWST.",

Detecting biosignature gases via exoplanet atmosphere transmission spectroscopy is in principle within JWST’s reach. We reflect on JWST’s early results in the context of the potential search for biological activity on exoplanets. The results confront us with a complex reality. Established inverse methods to interpret observed spectra—already known to be highly averaged representations of intricate three dimensional (3D) atmospheric processes—can lead to disparate interpretations even with JWST’s quality of data. Characterizing rocky or sub-Neptune-size exoplanets with JWST is an intricate task, and moves us away from the notion of finding a definitive “silver bullet” biosignature gas. Indeed, JWST results necessitate us to allow “parallel interpretations” that will perhaps not be resolved until the next generation of observatories. Nonetheless, with a handful of habitable-zone planet atmospheres accessible given the anticipated noise floor, JWST may continue to contribute to this journey by designating a planet as biosignature gas candidate. To do this we will need to sufficiently refine our inverse methods and physical models for confidently quantifying specific gas abundances and constraining the atmosphere context. Looking ahead, future telescopes and innovative observational strategies will be essential for the reliable detection of biosignature gases.",

          "abstract": "γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA A R) is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that plays a crucial role in inhibition in the adult brain. Structural and electrophysiological studies have provided numerous insights into the receptor’s functioning but the complete molecular mechanism of GABA A R action remains elusive. Herein, we used high-resolution single-channel recording to analyze point-mutated α 1 β 2 γ 2 receptors and applied so called Φ value (REFER, rate-equilibrium free energy relationship) analysis which allows to infer the order of domains engagement during activation, offering a complementary “dynamic” insight into the receptor’s function. As anticipated, point mutations at the orthosteric binding sites reduced GABA binding affinity, with the magnitude of this effect diminishing progressively with increasing distance from the binding site. On the contrary, mutations located all over the macromolecule’s structure, e.g., in “peripheral top position,” extracellular/transmembrane interface, and channel pore, affected the receptor with a clear tendency to influence entire gating including opening/closing, preactivation, and desensitization with no clear correlation with the distance to the channel gate. Interestingly, the calculated Φ values for the GABA A R showed a relatively narrow range (0.42 to 0.81), suggesting that the conformational transitions are highly synchronized and coordinated by a global network of interactions. This prediction is also in agreement with observation that, typically, single GABA A R residue mutation alters the kinetics of not just one but many (often all) conformational transitions. We thus propose a dictum reflecting modus operandi of the GABA A R: Binding is local and gating is global. In conclusion, our analysis indicates that GABA A R shows particularly strong functional compactness manifested as global gating mechanisms and high allostery.",

          "abstract": "Bubble-mediated gas exchange associated with wave breaking is a critical pathway for ocean–atmosphere exchange of low solubility gases such as oxygen. Yet, ocean and climate models, as well as observation-based products, usually rely on wind-only air–sea flux formulations derived from carbon constraints that ignore the asymmetric nature of the bubble flux, contributing to discrepancies between estimates of oxygen inventories and their response to climate change. Without bubbles, gas exchange is controlled by a symmetric wind-driven exchange, with the ocean–atmosphere gas partial pressure difference controlling whether outgassing or uptake occurs. Bubbles entrained by wave breaking can enhance this symmetric turbulent exchange, and contribute an additional asymmetric flux, always leading to an uptake, as they get squeezed by hydrostatic pressure (large bubbles) or collapse and fully dissolve (small bubbles). We present an observation-constrained theoretical framework of the air–sea flux accounting for air entrainment due to wave breaking and symmetric and asymmetric bubble exchange. The combined evidence from theory, laboratory, and field measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes, oxygen concentration, and noble gas supersaturation yields a universal formulation of gas exchange which we implement into a global ocean biogeochemical model. We discuss the resulting oxygen fluxes and demonstrate that our wind–wave–bubble formulation better reproduces observed in situ oxygen concentrations in water mass formation regions, where air–sea exchange is high, than a commonly used wind-only formulation. We show that the asymmetric bubble flux is essential for evaluating air–sea oxygen fluxes and estimating the magnitude of the ocean oxygen loss associated with global warming.",

          "abstract": "In biological membranes, proteins face a fundamentally different environment than in water. To avoid untenable lipid contacts with polar backbone atoms, they use the continuous hydrogen bonding achieved by α-helices or β-barrels to traverse membranes. Here, we show that integrin αX, and by homology αM, undermine this paradigm by partially unfolding the N-terminal third of their transmembrane (TM) helix. Unfolding results in a dynamic, frayed helix that weakens the association with its partnering β2 subunit to lower the activation threshold of integrin αXβ2-mediated cell adhesion. The extent of unfolding depends on membrane geometry, thereby establishing a mechanism for sensing membrane properties. The combination of adhesive control with sensory capacity in integrin αXβ2 and αMβ2 may achieve membrane localization-dependent receptor activation in leukocyte phagocytosis. The unfolding of the αX TM helix arises from a high number of α-helix-destabilizing residues that TM helices in general approach but do not exceed. Accordingly, backbone dynamics of TM helices may disrupt hydrogen bonds, modulate protein function, and optimize TM helix rigidity.",

Specifically, multistability is harnessed to sequence the motion of different degrees of freedom in a programmed order.

          "abstract": "The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is critical for maintaining cerebral homeostasis, and its deterioration with age is an important pathogenic factor in the etiology of vascular dementia. Extracellular matrix–integrin interactions play a central role in regulating vascular stability. The αvβ3 integrin is not expressed by brain endothelial cells under stable conditions but is strongly induced by hypoxia. However, it is currently unclear whether αvβ3 integrin exerts a destructive or protective influence on BBB integrity. In young (8 to 10 wk) and aged (20 mo) mice, we examined the impact of a function-blocking β3 integrin antibody as well as the inhibitory peptide cilengitide on BBB disruption during exposure to CMH (8% O 2 ). Hypoxic induction of brain endothelial β3 integrin was much stronger in aged mice. In both young and aged mice, β3 integrin inhibition greatly amplified hypoxia-induced BBB disruption, correlating with loss of tight junction proteins and induction of the leaky BBB marker mouse endothelial cell antigen (MECA)-32. Consistent with this, β3 integrin null mice showed increased levels of hypoxia-induced BBB disruption and MECA-32 expression. Cilengitide also reduced the integrity of a brain endothelial monolayer in vitro, prevented β3 integrin localization to focal adhesions, and reduced expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and tight junction proteins. These observations suggest that hypoxic induction of endothelial αvβ3 integrin enhances BBB integrity by stabilizing endothelial adhesion. This raises the interesting possibility that pharmacological upregulation of endothelial αvβ3 integrin in the aged brain might hold therapeutic promise for vascular dementia.",

However, the role of pseudouridylation in infection is poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate that Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) manipulates the pseudouridylation pathway to enhance replication. We show that the pseudouridine synthases (PUS), PUS1, and PUS7 are essential for efficient KSHV lytic replication, supported by their redistribution to viral replication and transcription complexes. We present a comprehensive analysis of KSHV RNA pseudouridylation, revealing hundreds of modified RNAs at single-nucleotide resolution.

Enhanced susceptibility can be driven directly by mutations in genes essential for control of the virus or indirectly via the production of autoantibodies against components of host defense. While the impact of viruses on individuals carrying these genotypes permitted their identification and has been amply studied, little is known about the impact of these human genotypes on the natural history of viruses, including not only persisting but also emerging viruses. We envisage several scenarios, including the possibility that genetically susceptible individuals serve as patient zeros, superspreaders, or mutation incubators, or that genetically resistant individuals even permit the selection of new viral mutants. Viruses are continually shared between individuals and even host species, where they can benefit from adaption to new environments. Current human viruses, as well as novel viruses from animal reservoirs, will continue to threaten the human population. Improvements in the scale of human genomic sequencing and analysis will permit testing hypotheses about the impact of human genetics on the origin and trajectory of viral infections, including future pandemics, which may ultimately help to prevent or curtail impending outbreaks.",

These proposals were based on studies of the principal σ factor of Escherichia coli , σ 70 , which generally, albeit not obligatorily, is released from RNAP upon the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. Here, we show that, in contrast to E. coli σ 70 , the Bacillus subtilis principal σ factor, σ A , is not released and is retained on RNAP core throughout transcription elongation. We further show that a mutant E. coli σ 70 derivative lacking σ region 1.1 (σ R1.1) is not released and is retained on RNAP core throughout transcription elongation. We also observe that B. subtilis σ A and the mutant E. coli σ 70 derivative lacking σ R1.1 interact much more stably with RNAP than full-length E. coli σ 70 . Our results indicate that the σ cycle is not a universal phenomenon in bacteria.",

          "abstract": "Our spontaneous thoughts encompass various dimensions, such as task-relatedness (off vs. on task), and thought orientation (internal vs. external). However, their distinction remains unclear. Our study addresses this issue by focusing on their timescales at both the behavioral level (using fast and slow finger tapping) and the neural level (using EEG) using two independent datasets (N = 84 and 35). Behavioral results revealed a double dissociation: Task-relatedness was linked to fast tapping only, whereas thought orientation was associated with slow tapping only. At the neural level, we assessed topographic similarity in EEG to quantify the temporal influence of past neural activity on current ones. Task-relatedness modulated topographic similarity only during fast tapping, while thought orientation did so only during slow tapping. Critically, topographic similarity was phase-based, as shown by its correlation with phase-locking value and the loss of associations with thought after phase-shuffling. This indicates that the neural signatures of both thought dimensions are strongly phase-dependent. Finally, we demonstrate that nonlinearity plays a distinct role mediating the impact of different timescales (slow and fast finger tapping) on spontaneous thoughts at both behavioral (precision error) and neural levels (topographic similarity). Overall, these results demonstrate that task-relatedness is associated with short timescales, whereas thought orientation is associated with long timescales. This highlights how distinct temporal dynamics shape different spontaneous thought dimensions on both their behavioral and neural features.",

We quantified the effects of Triad zoning on biodiversity in (sub)montane eutrophic European beech forests. Using a European-wide multitaxon database and a “virtual” landscape approach (i.e., by resampling empirical data), we evaluated how the proportion of Triad management categories affected the landscape-level species diversity of birds, saproxylic beetles, vascular plants, epiphytic bryophytes, lichens, and wood-inhabiting fungi, as well as multitaxonomic diversity. The results varied greatly among taxonomic groups. Multitaxonomic diversity peaked in landscapes composed of 60% unmanaged and 40% intensively managed forests. While intensive management can benefit some taxa through the creation of open habitats, unmanaged forests are the backbone of biodiversity conservation, underlining the need to safeguard the remaining old-growth forests under natural dynamics, and to extend the current area of unmanaged forests in Europe. Extensive forest management, however, did not contribute to biodiversity conservation as expected. As withdrawing such a high proportion of European forest landscapes from management is unfeasible given the increasing demand for timber, efforts are needed to increase the presence of structural features supporting biodiversity into extensively managed forests.",

Both traditional regression methods and modern machine-learning approaches require specialized data labels, which often cannot be sufficiently obtained from experiments. This data demand makes many sophisticated models impractical for real-world problems. Improvements in digital image correlation techniques have enabled accurate measurements of displacement data, providing an alternative kinematics-based approach for model identification. However, for materials undergoing plastic deformation, fracture, and damage, the corresponding inverse problem could be inherently challenging due to the dependence on loading history. We overcome this by formulating an inverse problem to discover interpretable plasticity models parameterized by neural networks (NN) from kinematic observations, leveraging a differentiable simulator with a smooth constitutive update that enables backpropagation for the NN training. The ability to use kinematic observations to infer complex material models may pave the way for a massive generation of material models that can be game-changing for emerging applications such as the design of metamaterials, response surface analyses, and the design of experiments.",

          "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains the deadliest infectious disease caused by a single pathogen, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. A deeper understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis metabolism could uncover specific vulnerabilities and inform the development of new treatments. Sulfur, essential for bacterial growth and survival, fuels key pathways including redox buffering and coenzyme production. Although previous studies suggest that M. tuberculosis utilizes various substrates to meet its sulfur requirements, the primary sources of sulfur exploited during in vivo infection remain unclear. Here, we reveal that M. tuberculosis acquires inorganic sulfate through the SubI-CysTWA transporter during macrophage infection. Using nanoSIMS (high spatial resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) analysis, we observed significant sulfate-derived 33 S enrichment in intracellular bacteria, correlating with metabolic activity. Deletion of subI abolished sulfate uptake, impairing bacterial growth in vitro and reducing M. tuberculosis survival in murine macrophages and lungs of infected mice. Finally, our data demonstrate that sulfate acquisition is essential for maintaining mycobacterial redox balance and resisting nitrosative stress in vitro and in vivo. Thus, unlike many intracellular pathogens, M. tuberculosis depends on an energetically costly inorganic sulfate assimilation pathway to survive in the nutrient-limited host environment. These findings challenge prior assumptions that organic reduced sulfur sources, such as methionine, fuel M. tuberculosis sulfur metabolism during infection. Since animal cells lack a sulfate assimilation pathway, uncovering the critical role of SubI-CysTWA-mediated sulfate import in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis highlights this pathway as a promising pathogen-specific therapeutic target. Targeting this system could either directly impair M. tuberculosis survival during infection or sensitize bacilli to antibiotic-induced oxidative stress by disrupting redox homeostasis.",

Robust methylation requires rapid hydrolysis of the methylation by-product S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by S -adenosylhomocysteinase (Ahcy). Ahcy is essential for maintaining methylation potential; however, the mechanisms governing its enzymatic activity, particularly in response to cellular stress, remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we show Ahcy is a redox-sensitive enzyme that is inhibited by oxidation of a conserved cysteine, C195, in vitro resulting in elevated SAH levels upon oxidative stress in vivo. We leveraged High-Throughput Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry to directly quantify Ahcy enzymatic activity and observed that H 2 O 2 -induced oxidation significantly reduced its catalytic efficiency. Notably, while C195 is essential for enzymatic activity in Drosophila melanogaster and humans, this residue is not conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans Ahcy that is also insensitive to H 2 O 2 . Structural analysis revealed that C195 is positioned near NAD + in the active site, close to a second cysteine residue that is also lacking in C. elegans Ahcy. Ahcy oxidation is neuroprotective in a Drosophila light stress model that increases oxidative stress. Moreover, Ahcy knockdown suppresses light stress–induced gene expression changes in photoreceptors, although this response is uncoupled from changes in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels, which were previously reported to alter in response to Ahcy knockdown in cultured cells. Thus, the one-carbon metabolism enzyme Ahcy senses changes in cellular redox homeostasis through a conserved cysteine residue that alters its activity, enabling rapid changes in gene expression that enable a neuroprotective response.",

However, our understanding of these interactions remains unclear. We approach this issue from the view that the river incision histories and their bedload provenance provide complementary evidence for reconstructing the evolution of the ancient river system. Zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He data from the middle Jinsha (upper Yangtze) River gorge reveal two episodes of accelerated river incision at 18-17 Ma and 8-7 Ma. The onset of the former incision event, coeval with other incision events along the upper-middle Jinsha and Lancang Rivers, implies their hydrological connection and formation of a south-flowing river system. Additionally, detrital geochronology and thermochronology data of late Oligocene–Miocene fluvial-alluvial sediments along the Red River valley provide constraints on their ages and provenance, suggesting emergence of a throughgoing paleo-Red River in the early-middle Miocene. This ancient Red River was disconnected from the upper Jinsha River but connected with Yalong River (upper Yangtze tributary), forming another south-flowing river system. Landscape evolution modelling supports the view that these south-flowing rivers were successively captured by the westward-propagating Yangtze River in the middle-late Miocene, giving birth to the modern drainages of southeastern Tibet. The resultant integration of the upper-middle and lower Jinsha River is manifested by the progressively upstream-propagating acceleration in river incision from 13-9 Ma to 6-5 Ma along the gorges. Our findings from southeastern Tibet suggest that orogen-scale topographic change, river reorganization, and a coeval increase in biodiversity were driven by extrusion tectonics.",

To identify tumor-intrinsic regulators of immunotherapy resistance and explore therapeutic strategies to restore T cell–mediated tumor control, we employed three functional genomics approaches using in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screening. Cancer USP14 was identified as the critical immune evasion driver. USP14-high HCC patients exhibited poorer anti-PD1 antibody therapy responses and reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration. Inhibition of USP14 suppressed HCC cell growth in coculture with activated CD8+ T cells and restored cocultured CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. In vivo USP14 targeting synergized with anti-PD1 antibody therapy. Mechanistically, USP14 deubiquitinated and stabilized GLUT1 through the removal of Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains at Lys-245, which enabled HCC cells to outcompete CD8+ T cells for glucose, generating a glucose-deprived tumor microenvironment that suppressed CD8+ T cell function. Our findings show USP14 in cancer has a proimmunoevasive role in CD8+ T cell–based tumor immunity through GLUT1-mediated glucose competition. These findings position USP14 inhibitors as promising adjuvants to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in HCC, providing actionable insights for overcoming resistance.",

Streamflow decline since the 1990s, driven by frequent and prolonged droughts, is 76% more intense than the 16th-century drought—the closest historical analogue. This drying exceeds natural variability, highlighting the dominant role of anthropogenic factors. Despite CMIP6 models projecting increased streamflow under warming scenarios, the recent decline indicates complexities associated with future water availability projections. Our findings underscore the urgent need to examine the interactions among the factors that control summer monsoon precipitation, including large−scale climate variability and anthropogenic forcings.

Functional characterization using Slc39a8 A391T knock-in mice and kidney-specific Slc39a8 knockout mice reveals that loss of SLC39A8 function reduces renal zinc accumulation, thereby mitigating susceptibility to kidney injury and disease progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that perturbed zinc homeostasis drives renal damage, and limiting zinc levels—whether via impaired SLC39A8 activity or direct chelation—activates the zinc–AKT–FOXO1–G6PC axis to confer protection. Critically, zinc chelation with EDTA recapitulates this benefit, significantly preventing and ameliorating experimental acute and chronic kidney disease.

BP—predating previously known Chinese records by at least 4,000 y (approximately 6,000 y considering published directly dated evidence alone).

Morphometric analysis of adzuki beans from 41 archaeological sites across East Asia reveals a gradual increase in seed size over time when regional data are aggregated, yet highlights distinct regional trajectories. These patterns reflect complex, multiregional domestication processes shaped by both cultural practices and ecological conditions.

Surface organic films are ubiquitously present but have very low partitioning volume being only 10’s of nanometer thick, whereas other surface reservoirs such as building materials and furnishings can be permeable or porous with large surface areas at the molecular level. Here, we assess the total partitioning capacity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an indoor environment from the measured kinetics of VOC surface uptake after injection of compounds with variable volatility into a well-characterized, unoccupied test house. We show that the size of the indoor surface reservoirs is very large with an octanol-equivalent average thickness on the order of micrometers, indicating that permeable/porous materials such as painted surfaces and wood are likely the major surface reservoirs in the house rather than organic surface films. Large surface reservoirs result in compounds with octanol-air partition coefficients ( K OA ) larger than 10 5 being predominantly partitioned to indoor surface reservoirs, making them hard to be removed via ventilation. This result significantly impacts our understanding of VOC fate and human exposure in indoor environments. With such a large partitioning capacity, organic contaminants will have much longer indoor residence times than previously predicted.",

          "abstract": "Immunotherapy modalities have revolutionized cancer treatment for a number of metastatic and treatment-refractory tumor types. Still, many malignancies that lack T cell infiltration and are termed immunologically “cold” fail to respond to these modalities. One approach to increase tumor immunogenicity has been to induce stimulator of interferon gene (STING) and downstream interferon signaling that is often dysregulated in cold tumors. Despite some early success of STING agonists in preclinical cancer models, these approaches have not been successful in the clinic due to poor tumor penetrance and systemic toxicities. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to uncover therapeutic targets to activate STING expression in human tumors. We identified the lysosomal hydrolase Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase1 (PPT1) as a negative regulator of STING highly expressed in cold ovarian and prostate tumors. Genetic or pharmacological PPT1 suppression increased STING protein stability and its downstream activation of interferon and inflammatory cytokine signaling to enhance T cell migration. Treatment of preclinical prostate and ovarian cancer models expressing low levels of STING with the small molecule PPT1 inhibitor GNS561 enhanced STING expression and activation, leading to infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells that turned these tumors “hot” and reduced tumor growth, fibrosis, and dissemination without toxicity. Further analysis demonstrated that PPT1 is associated with reduced STING expression, CD8 + T cell numbers, overall survival, and immunotherapy outcomes in ovarian and prostate cancer patients.

          "abstract": "Elastic turbulence (ET) and elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) of viscoelastic fluids are unique flow states with features distinct from the inertial turbulence of Newtonian fluids. Whether these two states are connected or entirely decoupled remains controversial. We here resolve this controversy by providing experimental evidence of a continuous transition between ET and EIT in Taylor-Couette flow. Through experimentally quantifying the roles of elasticity and inertia in flow stability, we find that elasticity is the primary driving mechanism for both elastic and elastoinertial instabilities, and inertia plays a secondary role in the latter. Remarkably, the critical condition for these instabilities can be described by a unified function derived from stability analysis, revealing that the transition between elastic instability to elastoinertial instability is continuous. Moreover, we show that the flow structures and the energy spectrum evolve seamlessly from ET to elasticity-dominated EIT, transitional EIT, and inertia-modulated EIT, with inertia playing an increasingly important role in the last three regimes. Our results offer insights into the fundamental nature of turbulence in viscoelastic flows and would have implications for applications involving drag reduction and polymer processing.",

Understanding the link between boundary phenomena and bulk stationary distributions could enable the design of optimized container shapes for the geometric control of confined active particles. Here, we propose a boundary method based on the flux transfer formalism typical of radiometry problems, where surface elements transmit and receive “rays” of active particles with infinite persistence length. We demonstrate the power of this boundary method in the case of the swimming microalgae Euglena gracilis trapped in light-defined billiard geometries. Quite surprisingly, we found that Euglena scatters with a nearly Lambertian cosine law, resembling the behavior of blackbody radiation and consequently resulting in nearly uniform distributions inside simple cavity geometries. Nevertheless, leveraging our boundary method, we were able to design a stacked multistage billiard geometry, with a connection scheme between subunits that breaks spatial symmetry and achieves an exponential amplification of cell concentration between its two ends. Our method can be applied to confined active matter in contexts ranging from spatial control and sorting of microorganisms to the design of efficient navigation strategies for microscopic and macroscopic robots.",

Herein, we establish a multimodal coherent X-ray diffraction imaging framework for spatiotemporal mapping of mesoscale structural dynamics in precipitation-strengthened alloys. As a demonstrative application, we visualized the structural evolution in Mg 97 Zn 1 Gd 2 during isothermal annealing at 700 K, revealing real-time dynamics of nucleation, growth, and coarsening. Ptychographic reconstruction enabled imaging of microstructural transformations across a wide field of view (~100 μm 2 ) with temporal resolution spanning several hours. We observed decomposition of (Mg, Zn) 3 Gd and concurrent precipitation and coarsening of long-period stacking ordered phases. To resolve local dynamics at finer spatiotemporal scales, we combined dynamic coherent diffraction imaging with X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, targeting selected regions (~10 μm 2 ) with time resolution down to tens of seconds. This approach revealed the rapid formation of nanoscale precipitates within 10 s after heating, followed by coarsening over several hundred seconds. Additionally, we applied optical flow analysis—a computational method to track motion patterns—to visualize and quantify the nucleation, growth, and coarsening kinetics. The abovementioned findings demonstrate the capability of in situ coherent X-ray techniques to acquire the real-time evolutions of mesoscale structures in complex materials. Our methodology offers a robust framework for investigating dynamic phenomena in diverse material systems, including metals, polymers, and functional nanomaterials, under realistic thermal or mechanical conditions.",

          "abstract": "Thrombopoietin (TPO), predominantly produced by the liver, is the key regulator for platelet production and the hematopoietic stem cell niche. Our earlier report demonstrated that platelet GPIbα is required for hepatocellular TPO generation, which is the major resource of TPO in the blood circulation. However, how hepatocytes physically contact circulating sinusoidal platelets across the liver endothelium for this process is unknown. Kupffer cells reside in contact with both sinusoidal blood and underlying hepatocytes, and mediate senescent platelet clearance, but their role in TPO regulation has never been explored. Here, we found Kupffer cell depletion via either clodronate liposomes or specific transgenic models abrogated circulating TPO. Kupffer cell depletion also prevented TPO level increase in GPIbα-deficient mice following wild-type (GPIbα + ) platelet transfusion, signifying an interdependent mechanism for TPO regulation. Mice treated with arsenite had significantly decreased liver endothelial fenestrations and hepatocyte sinusoidal protrusions as well as TPO levels. This effect was exacerbated by Kupffer cell depletion, and Kupffer cells were identified to enhance liver endothelial fenestrations. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis of the liver revealed platelets arrested on Kupffer cell surface were in contact with hepatocyte protrusions. Thus, we elucidated that Kupffer cells promote endothelial fenestrae and hepatocyte protrusions, accumulate circulating platelets, and facilitate cellular interactions between hepatocytes and platelets, which drive TPO generation. This connection between platelet clearance and thrombopoiesis should have broad implications for hematology and pathologies such as Bernard–Soulier syndrome, thrombocytopenias, as well as liver diseases.",

          "abstract": "The five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer patients remains below 50%, underscoring the need for innovative therapies. One promising approach involves engineering T cells to specifically target proteins uniquely overexpressed in tumors, thereby controlling tumor growth without toxicity to healthy tissues. Mesothelin (MSLN) contributes to the malignant and invasive phenotype in ovarian cancer and has limited expression in healthy cells, making it a candidate immunotherapy target. Our previous results in a mouse model of ovarian cancer demonstrated that T cells engineered to express a T cell receptor (TCR) targeting MSLN (TCR MSLN ) mediated therapeutic activity, delaying tumor growth and prolonging mouse survival. However, inhibitory ligands expressed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) interacted with inhibitory receptors on activated T cells, suppressing antitumor function. We hypothesized combining engineered T cells with checkpoint blockade would enhance T cell function and improve therapeutic efficacy, but administration of monospecific antibodies targeting individual inhibitory pathways had no significant impact on T cell efficacy. By contrast, the combination of PD-1, Tim-3, and Lag-3 blockade with engineered T cells significantly improved T cell function and overall animal survival relative to treatment with antibody alone or TCR MSLN with singlet or doublet antibody combinations. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed TCR MSLN T cells treated with the triplet antibody combination increased expression of genes involved in interferon responses and metabolic function, and reduced expression of genes associated with exhaustion. These results suggest that strategies to disrupt multiple inhibitory pathways simultaneously may be necessary for improved adoptive T cell therapy efficacy in patients.",

          "abstract": "Recent discovery of “extreme clustering” of inertial particles in isotropic turbulent flow suggests a hidden mechanism of particle–particle interaction at sub-Kolmogorov separations unexplained by hydrodynamic interaction. The near-contact radial distribution function (RDF) reaches O ( 10 4 ) , resulting in a collision kernel four orders larger than direct numerical simulation predictions. Statistical stationarity is lost in the particle-laden turbulence, suggesting the particles experience a nonequilibrium process. We hypothesize dielectric particles in isotropic turbulence experience contact electrification through interparticle collisions, creating inhomogeneous mosaic surface charge. These mosaic charges lead to attractive forces and thereby extreme clustering and collision amplification, forming a positive feedback loop. To explore this potential mechanism, we investigated hollow glass spheres dispersed in a high-Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic air turbulence chamber using high-resolution 3D particle tracking velocimetry and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). We measured RDF, particle-pair mean-inward radial relative velocity, and mean radial relative acceleration (RA) with time up to 10 min. We sampled particles from the flow chamber through time and evaluated their nanoscopic charge distribution using KPFM. We found that both RDF and mosaic surface charge increase with time; RA at close separations is attractive, intensifies as particles approach, and grows in time; and the turbulence-exposed RA curves collapse when nondimensionalized by the dipole–dipole acceleration calculated from mosaic charge distributions. These results support the proposed mechanism—Inhomogeneous Mosaic Potential Amplified Collisions in Turbulence (IMPACT). Better understanding and modeling of these effects could improve predictions for air pollution, weather patterns, and drug manufacturing—where particle interactions have big impacts.",

          "abstract": "Winds generate waves over the oceans with a wide range of properties. The largest wave heights and periods are important parameters in the design of marine structures. Extreme waves also play an outsize role in air–sea fluxes and coastal dynamics, and leave imprints on seismic and sediment records. Rare events have so far escaped measurements, with few wave heights from satellite altimeters exceeding 16 m, and no associated measurement of wave periods. Here, we use swells radiated from storms to reveal long wave periods within the storms, and their generation mechanism. Swells are resolved in the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite sea level measurements. Patterns of increasing swell wavelength and decreasing swell height away from storms are consistent with a nonlinear transfer of energy from short to long period waves. We propose an updated parametric shape for wave spectra in storms that aligns with SWOT swell measurements. It reduces energy levels by a factor of 20 at 1.2 to 1.4 times the peak period compared to commonly used spectral shapes and allows estimation of storm wave periods from swell heights. Consistent with less extreme conditions, the peak period generally increases with wave height. This was particularly verified for the largest storm peak period of 20.2 ± 0.6 s, obtained for the event with the largest significant wave height 19.7 ± 0.3 m measured by altimeters. These observations of long period swells should have a wide range of applications from coastal dynamics to seismology.",

          "abstract": "Arsenic contamination in rice poses a global challenge to food safety and agricultural productivity, as toxic methylated arsenic species—dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and its highly toxic derivative, methylated monothioarsenate (DMMTA)—accumulate in rice grains. These arsenic species endanger human health and trigger rice straighthead disease, a crop disorder that drastically reduces yields. However, the microbial ecological processes driving arsenic speciation in paddy soils, and their link to striking geographic disparities in rice arsenic speciation profiles and disease prevalence, remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate soil chronosequences spanning 1 to 2,000 y of rice cultivation, a global metagenomic survey of 801 paddy soils, controlled incubations, and field surveys to demonstrate that the balance between arsenic-methylating and arsenic-demethylating microbes is the key determinant of rice grain arsenic speciation and straighthead disease susceptibility. We show that young and moderate-age paddy soils (&lt;700 y), common in regions such as the Americas and Europe, are enriched in arsenic-methylating bacteria, leading to elevated DMA and DMMTA in soils and rice grains. In contrast, ancient paddies in Southeast Asia harbor robust populations of DMA-demethylating methanogenic archaea that effectively mitigate the buildup of these toxic arsenic species. We identify core microbial taxa whose abundances serve as predictive biomarkers and construct a global risk map linking a high methylator-to-demethylator ratio in soils with increased straighthead disease incidence. These findings advance our understanding of arsenic biogeochemistry in agroecosystems and establish a predictive framework for identifying regions at elevated risk of arsenic-induced crop disorders and food contamination.",

          "abstract": "Rocky exoplanet characterization has been a top priority for early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) science operations. Several milestones have been achieved, including the most precise rocky planet transmission spectra measured to date, and the first detection of thermal emission for rocky worlds below 800 K. Despite these advances, no atmospheres have been definitively detected. Several transmission spectra show tentative evidence for molecular absorption features, but these hints are marginally significant and the spectra may be affected by stellar contamination. Features from many plausible atmospheres, including those dominated by oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, are below the current noise level. Meanwhile, the emerging picture from thermal emission spectra is that the planets have hot daysides, consistent with either a bare rock composition or low surface pressure atmospheres ( &lt; 10 bar). Higher surface pressures and high carbon dioxide abundances are generally ruled out, assuming cloud-free atmosphere models. The absence of strong CO 2 features hints at a limited initial volatile inventory or rapid atmospheric escape during the planets’ early lifetimes. Taken together, these results motivate a push toward higher precision data, as well as observations of cooler planets that may be more likely to retain atmospheres. As a goal for future transmission spectroscopy, we suggest a “five scale height challenge,” to achieve the precision necessary to detect CO 2 features in nitrogen-rich atmospheres. Detecting rocky planet atmospheres remains challenging, but with JWST’s excellent performance and a continuing investment of telescope time, we are optimistic these uncharted atmospheres will be detected in coming years.",

Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. The confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its ~1-kilobase coding region.

We identify paired electrolysis as an enabling strategy to both selectively generate the requisite bis -sulfonium intermediate and drive its rapid elimination in situ.

Shallow coseismic wavespeed reductions recovered within months, whereas a deeper postseismic wavespeed drop persisted without measurable recovery over several years. The deep, persistent wavespeed drop likely reflects accumulating damage driven by postseismic deformation, suggesting two possible scenarios: (i) a slow interseismic recovery where wavespeed and anisotropy track long-term stress evolution; or (ii) permanent deformation of an immature fault zone.

          "abstract": "The Turkana pastoralists of Kenya inhabit arid, water-limited environments and rely largely on livestock for subsistence. Working with Turkana communities, we sequenced 367 whole genomes and identified eight regions with evidence for recent positive selection. One of these regions includes a putative regulatory element for STC1 —a kidney-expressed gene involved in metabolism and the response to dehydration. We show that STC1 is induced by antidiuretic hormone in human cells, is associated with urea levels in the Turkana themselves, and is under strong and recent selection in this population as well as a second East African population, the Daasanach. This work highlights how integrating anthropological and genomic approaches can lead to a new understanding of human physiology with biomedical relevance.",

Despite progress in ground-state cooling of a levitated solid particle, realizing its nonclassical states has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate quantum squeezing of the motion of a single nanoparticle by rapidly varying its oscillation frequency. We reveal appreciable narrowing of the velocity variance to –4.9 ± 0.1 decibels of that of the ground state using free-expansion measurements. Our work shows that a levitated nanoparticle offers an ideal platform for studying nonclassical states of its motion and provides a route to developing applications in quantum sensing and exploring quantum mechanics at a macroscopic scale.",

General design strategies for electrode, electrolyte, and interphase are proposed to enable horizontally deposited metals with preferred crystallographic orientations and stable SEIs with distinct chemical compositions yet similar structural homogeneity. Finally, we assess the specific advantages and unresolved challenges of each system, providing cross-disciplinary insights to advance high-energy and low-cost metal-anode batteries for next-generation energy storage.",

This electrolyte is compatible with several metal-hydrogen electrodes, such as titanim hydride and magnesium hydride (MgH 2 ), allowing for high-capacity, reversible hydrogen storage at low temperatures.

          "abstract": "Vocal communication in social animals involves the production and perception of various calls that ethologists categorize into call types based on their acoustical structure and behavioral context. Whether these categories indicate distinct meanings for the animals remains unknown. The zebra finch, a gregarious songbird, uses ~11 call types that are known to communicate hunger, danger, or social conflict and to establish social contact and bonding. Using auditory discrimination tasks, we show that the birds both discriminate and categorize all the call types in their vocal repertoire. In addition, systematic errors were more frequent between call types used in similar behavioral contexts than could be expected from their acoustic similarity. Thus, zebra finches organize their calls into categories and create a mental representation of the meaning of these sounds.",

Each atom binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepared and measured a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 − 5 + 5 % and a concurrence of 0.67 − 0.05 + 0.05 .

Using data from &gt;700 strains collected worldwide, we uncover similar and recurrent hypomethylation at hundreds of these TE loci, often near genes. Most natural epivariants we tested can be inherited without DNA sequence changes and are therefore bona fide epialleles, although genetic factors modulate their recurrence or persistence. Epiallelic variants often cause gene expression changes and may be targets of selection, thus revealing their contribution to heritable phenotypic variation in nature.",

Although El Niño events in the equatorial Pacific are known to suppress total summer rainfall throughout India, we show using observational data spanning 1901 to 2020 that, counterintuitively, they simultaneously intensify extreme daily rainfall. This is partly driven by increases in extreme daily values of convective buoyancy, provided that both the undilute instability of near-surface air and the dilution by mixing with drier air above are considered. El Niño could plausibly drive similar changes in other tropical regions, and our framework could be further applied to changes in hourly extremes, to other internal variability modes, and to forced trends under climate change.",

But climate change may be a greater culprit. Using spatially disaggregated, nationwide data from Mongolia, from 1984 to 2024, we exploited seasonal variation in grazing locations to quasi-experimentally estimate the causal effects of livestock herd size, weather, and climate change on rangeland primary productivity. At interannual frequency, herd size modestly but significantly negatively affects primary productivity, with notable variation across ecological zones. The effects of weather fluctuations are, however, an order of magnitude larger. At the decadal scale, over which herders can adapt to climate change, herd size effects disappear, and temperature effects dominate. In Mongolia, climate change seems to drive most long-term change in rangeland primary productivity.",

Using genomic samples taken at a single time point to generate contemporary effective population size estimates in a temperate montane forest, we accurately predict fluctuations across three censuses. Our approach facilitates the use of genomic demography to parameterize multispecies community models in ecology and shows that population genomic data can provide accurate predictions for ecological dynamics.",

Despite high genetic diversity, the species shows stable but considerable continental population structure. Although one population showed little differentiation over a century and 4000 kilometers, nearby, we found two genetically distinct ecotypes. Vector control has resulted in strong signals of selection, with some resistance alleles shared across populations through gene flow and others arising independently. Fortunately, we found that a promising gene drive target in Anopheles gambiae is highly conserved in An. funestus .

Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, rather than structural boundaries. The genomic separation–dependent scaling of the search time for cis interactions violated predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor-driven folding.

While structural distortion from symmetry breaking occurs in femtoseconds, the timescale to lift electronic state degeneracy has remained elusive. We use the vibrationally resolved attosecond chronoscope to capture the electronic symmetry breaking induced by the Renner-Teller effect in bent CO 2 molecules after photoionization by an extreme ultraviolet photon by measuring attosecond ionization delays. Relative photoionization delays between the four cation states are observed, with vibrational state–dependent delays, we analyze the evolution of the degenerate A 2 Π u state to the nondegenerate A ′ and A ″ states due to molecular bending. With the help of theoretical analysis, we show that the relative photoionization delays of up to 72 as between the vibrational levels originate from the symmetry breaking–induced shape resonance.

Current treatments, including repeated intraocular anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections, are invasive and often lead to discomfort and complicated hemorrhages. Here, we developed a noninvasive nanozyme eye drop capable of penetrating the fundus to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby inhibit neovascularization. The nanozyme eye drops consist of liposomes formed by fluorinated and arginine–glycine–aspartic acid–modified phospholipids, which enhance the penetration of ocular barriers. The encapsulated superoxide dismutase–catalase cascade nanozyme within these liposomes allows for efficient ROS scavenging. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that these nanozyme eye drops achieve deep retinal tissue penetration, alleviate oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial function, and suppress aberrant insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 signaling, thereby inhibiting pathological neovascularization. Enhanced ocular bioavailability and minimal toxicity further underscore its promise as a safe and effective noninvasive treatment for retinal neovascularization diseases.",

Integrated analyses across species identified diverse subtypes of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that are highly conserved across primates. Compositional analyses revealed that subdivisions of the primate basolateral complex contain distinct classes of glutamatergic neurons and divergent gene expression profiles for parvalbumin and somatostatin GABAergic neurons. Referencing primate neuron types to transcriptomic atlases of the murine amygdala highlighted primate-specific specializations for glutamatergic neurons and identified which neuron types are conserved across mammals and amygdalar subdivisions.

Enabled by high-precision frequency metrology, this approach reveals systematic discrepancies with state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, exposing subtle electron correlation effects in the dipole moment curve. Applied to line-intensity ratio thermometry (LRT), our technique determines gas temperatures with 0.5 millikelvin statistical uncertainty, exceeding previous LRT precision by two orders of magnitude. These results redefine the limits of optical gas metrology and enable International System of Units–traceable measurements for applications from combustion diagnostics to isotopic analysis.

Unlike mice on conventional high-fat diet, KD-fed mice remain insulin sensitive and display low-insulin levels. Hyperglycemic clamp and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assays revealed systemic and cell-intrinsic impairments in insulin secretion. Transcriptomic profiling of islets from KD-fed mice indicated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi stress and disrupted ER-Golgi protein trafficking, which were confirmed by electron microscopy showing a dilated Golgi network consistent with defective insulin granule trafficking and secretion. Together, these results suggest that long-term KD leads to multiple aberrations of metabolic parameters that caution their systematic use as a health-promoting dietary intervention.",

Using deep learning–based image analyses, including particle tracking, spatial distribution, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology analysis, we found that ER junctions facilitate stop-and-go motion switching and serve as platforms for endolysosome interactions. Within the ER network, endolysosomes exhibit three dynamic states: fast movement, local slow movement, and pausing. Pauses occur mainly at ER junctions, where transient endosome-lysosome interactions often coincide with organelle fission and are followed by departure. Disruption of ER junctions impairs lysosomal motility and maturation. We further show that actin condensation around endolysosomes mediates motion switching, involving VAP-STARD3 interaction and the actin regulator YWHAH. Other organelles, such as lipid droplets and peroxisomes, also pause near ER junctions. These findings highlight ER junctions as regulatory hubs that orchestrate organelle dynamics, contributing to the spatial coordination of organelle distribution and interactions within the cytoplasm.",

Further accretion proceeds through the inner structures, including a Keplerian disk and an inner disk (~100 au), which are thought to be driving a collimated bipolar outflow. These multiscale structures (spiral arms, bar, streamers, envelope, disk, and outflow) have been simultaneously observed as a physically coherent structure within an MDC. Our discovery suggests that well-organized hierarchical structures play a crucial role during the gas accretion and angular momentum buildup of a massive disk.",

In the heterotaxy syndrome, abnormal left-right patterning leads to a spectrum of severe congenital heart defects, including ventricle malposition. A postulate anchored in the clinical nomenclature assumes that the looping direction of the embryonic heart tube determines ventricle position at birth. However, this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we performed a unique longitudinal analysis of heterotaxy with right isomerism, using multimodality imaging of Nodal mouse mutants. Using direct correlations and advanced statistics, we dissected the contribution of heart looping variations to specific structural heart malformations, and uncovered unexpected plasticity of ventricle position after looping in 30% of revertant samples. Genetic tracing and topological associations show that plasticity involves a further step of heart remodeling at E13.5, rather than molecular reprogramming. Human patient scans are consistent with ventricle plasticity and suggest association with poorer prognosis. Our work reveals distinct asymmetric events shaping organs.",

Herein, we developed chemotactic chaperone nanomotors (CNMs) that exploit the unique pathological microenvironment of PD lesions, characterized by elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels. The CNMs consist of a chemotactic-targeting module capable of sensing an iNOS concentration gradient, an α-syn–specific recognition module with conformation-sensitive binding domains, and a protein regulatory module with a hydrophobic microdomain that can stabilize α-syn and prevent misfolding. Results demonstrate that CNMs can achieve active chemotactic navigation across BBB and dual modulation of α-syn proteostasis through aggregate dissolution and prevention of misfolding. CNMs not only supplement exogenous chaperone activity but also restore endogenous protein stabilization mechanisms, concurrently reducing neuroinflammatory markers, promoting the application of nanochaperones for PD treatment.",

However, a key challenge remains to distinguish signaling functions of metabolism from its canonical bioenergetic and biosynthetic roles, which underlie cellular homeostasis. Here, we tackled this challenge using mouse embryonic axis segmentation as an experimental model. First, we found that energetically subminimal amounts of glucose can support ongoing segmentation clock activity, providing evidence that glycolysis exerts a signaling function. Using a dynamical systems approach based on entrainment, we identified fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as the potential signaling metabolite. Functionally, we demonstrated that glycolytic flux/FBP control the segmentation clock period and Wnt signaling in an anticorrelated manner. Critically, we showed that the slow segmentation clock phenotype caused by elevated glycolysis is mediated by Wnt signaling rather than cellular bioenergetic and biosynthetic state. Combined, our results demonstrate a modular organization of metabolic functions, revealing a signaling module of glycolysis that can be decoupled from its canonical metabolic functions.",

The mass-independent fractionation of even mercury isotopes (even-MIF, denoted as Δ 200 Hg) is widely used to trace atmospheric Hg sources and fluxes. However, the chemical processes inducing even-MIF remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a three-dimensional atmospheric Hg isotope model linking Hg redox processes with even-MIF. The results show that the previous hypothesis of even-MIF occurring exclusively at the tropopause may not fully explain the global Δ 200 Hg patterns. We speculate OH-initiated reactions and photoreduction of Hg II (p) as likely dominant drivers. Simulations show that even-MIF primarily originates in the free troposphere and propagates downward to surface air. Our results reveal distinct spatial Δ 200 Hg variations that were previously unaccounted for in tracing Hg sources. This study provides critical insights into even-MIF drivers and serves as a reference for using Δ 200 Hg to trace atmospheric Hg sources.",

          "abstract": "Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids with important roles in cell signaling and neuroprotection. While present on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—key mediators of intercellular communication—their role in EV biogenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify gangliosides as key modulators of EV biogenesis, with the specific composition of their glycan headgroup and the presence or absence of sialic acid and N -acetyl- d -galactosamine residues dictating whether they promote or inhibit EV biogenesis. GM1 and other complex gangliosides enhance EV secretion, while disruption of ganglioside synthesis impairs it. GM1 supplementation restores EV secretion in Huntington’s disease (HD) fibroblasts and cell models with ganglioside deficiency, including models of neurodegenerative diseases caused by a genetic block of ganglioside synthesis. Notably, GM1 enhances EV-mediated secretion of pathogenic misfolded proteins, including mutant huntingtin (mHTT), α-synuclein, and tau, reducing intracellular burden and providing mechanistic insight into the mHTT-lowering effects of GM1 in HD models. Our findings shed light on the neuroprotective roles of gangliosides and their therapeutic potential in misfolded protein disorders.",

          "abstract": "Polarization vortices, crucial constituents of singular optics, manifest as vortices of polarization states around singularities. Recent progress has linked polarization vortices with bound states in the continuum (BICs) in optical waves. However, this association has not been explored in the realm of thermal emission, which holds the potential for generating arbitrary polarizations in a single thermal emitter. Here, we implement a polarization vortex thermal emitter (PVTE) based on BICs in a photonic crystal slab (PCS), allowing for the generation of various polarization states simultaneously along different directions. Using a custom-designed polarized angle-resolved thermal emission spectrometer (PARTES), we experimentally confirm polarization vortices of thermal emission originating from BICs with different charges and types. The proposed PVTEs present effective strategies for controlling thermal emission and show promising applications in infrared optical technology.",

We show that global warming significantly alters BSISO propagation by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 projections. Under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5 scenario, the eastward mode’s expansion propagation speed shows a twofold increase from 5.1 ± 1.9 to 10.3 ± 2.0 meters per second by the late 21st century, with a remarkable eastward extension by ~30° longitude compared to the present climate. The accelerated eastward mode frequency is expected to rise by 15%, intensifying subseasonal precipitation whiplash worldwide and shortening disaster preparedness time. This acceleration results from an asymmetric pattern of boundary layer moisture convergence anomalies, driven by weakened Rossby wave westerlies and enhanced Kelvin wave response linked to warming-induced atmospheric stabilization and El Niño–like ocean surface warming pattern. Conversely, a projected weakening of easterly vertical shear over the northern Indian Ocean attenuates the Rossby wave response and favors more eastward expansion events.",

          "abstract": "Natural environments typically contain a blend of simultaneous sounds. A substantial challenge in neuroscience is identifying specific neural signals corresponding to each sound and analyzing them separately. Combining frequency tagging and machine learning, we achieved high-precision separation of neural responses to mixed melodies, classifying them by selective attention toward specific melodies. Across two magnetoencephalography datasets, individual musicality and task performance heavily influenced the attentional recruitment of cortical regions, correlating positively with top-down attention in the left parietal cortex but negatively with bottom-up attention in the right. In prefrontal areas, neural responses indicating higher sustained selective attention reflected better performance and musicality. These results suggest that musical training enhances neural mechanisms in the frontoparietal regions, boosting performance via improving top-down attention, reducing bottom-up distractions, and maintaining selective attention over time. This work establishes the effectiveness of combining frequency tagging with machine learning to capture cognitive and behavioral effects with stimulus precision, applicable to other studies involving simultaneous stimuli.",

Here, we synthesized the response of growing season carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions to experimentally manipulated warming of ~2°C for permafrost in alpine and Arctic regions. Warming weakened the GHG sink of alpine permafrost, thereby increasing (13%) its global warming potential, but strengthened the GHG sink of Arctic permafrost and decreased (−10%) its global warming potential. When warming caused drying of alpine permafrost soils, the CO 2 sink weakened but the CH 4 sink increased. In contrast, warming of relatively wet Arctic permafrost increased the CO 2 sink and CH 4 source. Warming led to much stronger increases of the N 2 O source in alpine than Arctic permafrost. Although keeping additional warming below 2°C in permafrost regions can avoid the positive permafrost-climate feedback, measures are needed to maintain fragile carbon sink of alpine permafrost ecosystems.",

Treatment with specific RGF peptides in the absence of hosts triggered prehaustoria and induced expression of PjYUC3 , a gene required for auxin biosynthesis and prehaustorium formation. CRISPR-mediated knockouts showed that PjRGFR1 and PjRGFR3, receptors activated by the haustorium-specific RGF peptides PjRGF2 and PjRGF5, are essential for prehaustorium formation, revealing functional redundancy. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PjRGF2 is broadly conserved among Orobanchaceae, whereas PjRGF5 appears to have recently evolved through segmental tandem multiplication.

As a proof-of-concept application demonstration, the nanofluidic device exhibits an ionic memory property as a nanofluidic memristor.

In silico modeling replicated these experimental characteristics and suggested that properties of the inhibitory currents rather than motoneuron size are responsible for net functional inhibition.

This approach revealed a molecular hierarchy in which cell class–distinguishing features emerge first, followed by subclass- and type-related characteristics. Acquisition of cellular identity and diversity remained stable across in vivo models. In contrast, in vitro glutamatergic neurons showed decreased expression of identity-defining genes, reduced diversity, and alterations in connectivity.

The sign and the magnitude of η are tunable not only by B ‖ but also by the back-gate voltage. This diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano–superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and B ‖ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop.

Single-cell analyses revealed purely tactile, purely acoustic, bimodal, and decision-mnemonic responses. Population analyses of the VPC network and a recurrent neural network trained on the BDT uncovered notably similar latent dynamics. In both networks, neural trajectories diverged sharply from rest along modality-specific directions during stimulus presentation, while remained at rest during stimulus-absent trials. Subsequently, trajectories rotated toward a mnemonic subspace, where perceptual decisions (acoustic, tactile, and absent) were maintained in three distinctly different stable attractors. Using low-dimensional modeling, we propose a universal mechanism for the transition from sensory processing to memory retention explaining both biological and artificial latent neural dynamics in a simple dynamical motif.

Under +2°C of warming, 73% of the snow zone would experience more extreme earlier postfire snowmelt compared to historically average conditions. Regions with the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt timing under average climate conditions also have the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt under +2°C warming.

Herein, a multifunctional additive 3,4,5-trifluorobenzamide (TFBZ) was introduced to enhance the crystallinity and passivate defects of the methylammonium (MA)–free WBG perovskite films.

          "abstract": "Human attraction to alcohol may derive from an evolutionary association between ethanol and fruits consumed by animals in nature. Fermentative yeasts are widespread in the terrestrial biosphere, and simple carbohydrates underpinning ethanol production are commonplace within fruits. We determined ethanol concentrations within fruits representing a substantial portion of the diet of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. Ripe fruit pulp from 20 angiosperm species in Côte d’Ivoire and Uganda contained an average value of 0.31 (± 0.21 SD) and 0.32% (± 0.20) ethanol (weight/weight), respectively, as scaled by annual chimpanzee feeding time per species at each site. Chimpanzees typically eat ~4.5 kilograms of fruit per day, corresponding to an estimated ethanol ingestion of 14 grams (±9), or the equivalent of 1.4 (±0.9) standard drinks by international standards. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol is widespread within tropical fruits and that modern predisposition to alcohol consumption derives from ancestral exposure to this psychoactive substance among frugivorous primates.",

Although the mechanisms of DDR activation have been extensively studied, how DDR is kept inactive is far less well understood, especially in plants. Here, we show that the plant-specific transcription factor SOG1, a master regulator of the plant DDR, interacts with PRL1, which functions as a substrate adaptor of the Cullin4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 PRL1 to polyubiquitinate SOG1, promoting SOG1 degradation through 26 S proteasome. When DNA damage occurs, PRL1 is degraded and SOG1 is phosphorylated, both of which impair the polyubiquitination and degradation of SOG1. This study demonstrated that plants dynamically control DDR by regulating the phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of SOG1.",

Solid surface roughness poses fundamental limitations including contact-line pinning and solid friction. Here, we report an experimental strategy and theoretical design principles for patterned liquid surfaces (PaLS) that combine the controlled wettability from patterning with the ultrasmoothness of a lubricant-infused surface. In contrast to a solid, on PaLS, a droplet can be in 10 different wetting states. This richness arises from the adaptation of the liquid lubricants and can be harnessed to control the apparent contact angle of the droplet over the full range of wettability while removing contact-line pinning effects induced by the solid surface. In the limit of thin liquid films, we derive surface-averaged laws for the apparent contact angle for each wetting state, which capture both experimental and simulation data. Our results provide a distinct approach to surface patterning that exploits the interaction of fluids with lubricant-impregnated surfaces.",

Using spectrally resolved ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that FAD •– photoexcitation in the absence of substrate leads to the formation of the oxidized flavin FAD ox (the resting state in the catalytic cycle) within 100 femtoseconds. While this feature is similar to that occurring in flavoprotein oxidases, the ensuing photocycle is more complex. Upon excitation at the lowest-energy transition, the ejected electron is initially captured as a hydrated electron ( e – H ) before transferring to a secondary acceptor in 2.5 picoseconds and returning to the flavin in 37 picoseconds. This implies that e – H can be generated within a protein environment, an unprecedented finding. This assessment is supported by molecular dynamics simulations showing an expansion of the flavin-binding pocket without substrate, allowing water molecules to fill the void.

This flexibility facilitates the study of biomolecular behavior under dynamically adjustable conditions, including controlled confinement fluctuations. The device can manipulate diverse analytes such as double-stranded DNA, liposomes, and DNA nanotubes and facilitates introducing molecules into confined environments intact from bulk while providing enhanced tunability.

Applying a periodically modulated laser light to optomechanical oscillators allows for stable and precise control of oscillator couplings. This enables us to not only explore the physics of quantized integer and fractional phase slips but also synthesize multioctave synchronizations of mechanical oscillators that exhibit tailorable multistability. Furthermore, the dynamically manipulated synchronizations lead to an exotic phase-space trajectory, which has a nontrivial winding number and giant nonreciprocity.

After footshock and fear extinction, these mutants chronically develop occluded neuronal activation in the basal amygdala (BA) detectable at remote fear memory retrieval, which involves suppressed spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. Chemogenetic activation of mutant BA neurons during fear extinction improves fear memory extinction and remote fear memory responses without affecting anxiety- or social-related phenotypes.

Although the posttranslational regulation of PILS is important for acclimating growth responses, the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. This study demonstrates that components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery regulate the proteasome-dependent degradation of functional PILS proteins under nonstressed conditions. We further reveal that both internal and external signals use the ERAD complex to differentially modulate the turnover rates of PILS proteins. Our findings uncover an additional physiological role of the ERAD complex in regulating PILS protein turnover.

We demonstrate that F-actin retains NiV-M assembly sites at the PM by analyzing NiV-M assembly kinetics. Disrupting actin dynamics or NiV-M–actin interaction alters M nanoscale organization and reduces membrane retention, without affecting initial recruitment. We also show that the Arp2/3 complex, an actin-branching factor, promotes VLP production.

While the exact densities are obtained from accurate configuration interaction (CI), the exact XC energies and XC potentials are obtained via inverse DFT calculations on the CI densities. We demonstrate how simple neural network (NN)–based local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), trained on just five atoms and two molecules, provide remarkable improvement in total energies and densities. Particularly, the NN-based GGA functional attains similar accuracy as the higher rung SCAN meta-GGA on various thermochemistry datasets.

          "abstract": "Adipocyte hypertrophy during obesity triggers chronic inflammation, leading to metabolic disorders. However, the role of adipocyte-specific inflammatory signaling in metabolic syndrome remains unclear. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, LUBAC, is an E3-ligase that generates nondegradative linear ubiquitination (Lin-Ub). LUBAC regulates NF-κB/MAPK-driven inflammation and prevents cell death triggered by immune receptors like TNF receptor-1. Here, we show that mice lacking HOIP, the Lin-E3 ligase catalytic subunit of LUBAC, in adipocytes ( Hoip A-KO ) display lipodystrophy and heightened susceptibility to obesity-induced metabolic syndrome, particularly metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Mechanistically, loss of HOIP attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation and promotes cell death in human adipocytes. Inhibiting caspase-8–mediated cell death is sufficient to prevent lipodystrophy and MASLD in Hoip A-KO obese mice. HOIP expression in adipose tissue positively correlates with metabolic fitness in obese individuals. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental developmental role for Lin-Ub in adipocytes by mitigating cell death–driven adipose tissue inflammation and protecting against obesity-related metabolic syndrome.",

          "abstract": "Marine diatoms are an abundant and ecologically important phytoplankton group susceptible to changing environmental conditions. Currently available data assessing diatom responses focus on empirical comparisons between present-day and future conditions, rather than exploring the mechanisms driving these responses. Here, we conducted high-resolution growth experiments to map the fitness of diatoms across broad carbonate chemistry landscapes. Our results reveal species-specific carbonate chemistry niches, which can be used to predict ecological shifts between species under changing conditions driven by ocean acidification or ocean alkalinity enhancement. The results demonstrate that changes in diatom fitness are almost exclusively driven by carbon dioxide and proton concentrations, with bicarbonate exerting no discernible effect. Thus, current assumptions regarding the role of bicarbonate as a primary carbon source supporting diatom growth may be overestimated. This study presents a methodological and conceptual framework as a foundation for future studies to collate data capable of predicting species-specific responses and shifts in ecological niches driven by changes in marine carbonate chemistry.",

The main challenges that still need to be addressed to ensure high competitiveness of magnonic devices include finding ways to efficiently amplify spin waves in nanostructures and developing nanocircuits that can operate without the need for an external bias magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate how these two challenges can be solved using nanowaveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator. We show that using local parametric pumping with a power of only a few milliwatts, one can achieve coherent amplification of spin-wave pulses by more than two orders of magnitude at zero bias magnetic field.

These unique observations provide high-resolution (18 meters per pixel) measurements of light scattered by aerosols in the atmosphere. The observations are characterized by subkilometer-scale layering, ±20% variations in color of the individual layers, and high radiance ( I / F  &gt; 1). Strong spatial (latitudinal) variability is also evident, suggesting highly inhomogeneous absorption and atmospheric heating. Models of the radiance, while likely to be degenerate, indicate good agreement with lower-resolution results inferred from other techniques. Mesospheric aerosol layers (strongly blue in CaSSIS color ratios) are also evident. The observed decrease in the CaSSIS RED/BLU color ratio with altitude is indicative of a decrease in particle radius.",

A quantitative correlation between capacitance changes and x-ray dose rate is established, enabling stable, high-resolution imaging. Using this method, we achieve three-dimensional internal structure reconstruction with a simple single-pixel detector.

We demonstrate that HTT organizes F-actin into bundles. Cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA) structural analyses reveal that HTT’s N-terminal HEAT and Bridge domains wrap around F-actin, while the C-terminal HEAT domain is displaced; furthermore, HTT dimerizes via the N-HEAT domain to bridge parallel actin filaments separated by ~20 nanometers.

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials often face limitations in molecular adsorption due to the absence of dangling bonds, affecting their performance as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. We address this by engineering defects, specifically nanopores, in monolayer WS 2 through controlled plasma treatments. These nanopores create dangling bonds to improve molecular adsorption for molecule enrichment and dynamically modulate the WS 2 bandgap to optimize band alignment with rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules. This leads to a shift in photoluminescence peaks from red to blue with increasing defect density. Furthermore, the Raman signal is amplified by localized electromagnetic fields around the nanopores and carefully chosen resonance laser wavelengths. This combination allows blue-shifted WS 2 to achieve single-molecule SERS detection, with a sensitivity limit reaching 1 × 10 −20 M for R6G. Using SERS mapping, we visualize adsorption sites, confirming the nanopores’ role as active sites. Our study introduces a pioneering method for developing ultrasensitive 2D SERS substrates and advances the understanding of SERS mechanisms on 2D materials.",

Under a 50-fold salinity gradient, the NP-MXene membrane achieved a record power density of 85.1 watts per square meter and an osmotic potential of 181.5 millivolts, the highest reported for a single device. Harnessing ion-specific signals from multi-ion transport, we further demonstrated an iontronic transistor capable of modulating ion flow by salinity gradients, eliminating the need for external gate voltage. This advance enables encoded signals and robotic control for advanced human-machine interfaces.

We investigate how slow shear and stick-slip transition depend on the roughness alignment between contacting surfaces. By rotating one surface with respect to the other, we precisely control roughness matching, enabling nearly an order-of-magnitude variation in the maximum static friction coefficient. Both the variation amplitude and the angular range over which the frictional strength varies are governed by roughness alignment. Universal statistical patterns emerge in micromechanical quantities, including the microcontact area, orientation, deformation, and their evolutions under shear, following generalized extreme value distributions. To quantify asperity interactions, we introduce the contact fabric tensor, whose anisotropy provides a unified measure of roughness matching and a predictor for frictional strength and sliding onset. These findings advance our understanding of friction at rough interfaces and inform the design of mechanical systems, adhesives, and fault models.",

To address which proglucagon peptides stimulate insulin secretion, we developed an assay to quantify levels of GLP-1(7–36)NH 2 . We also generated three transgenic mouse lines that allow α cell-specific, inducible deletion of the genes for the two prohormone convertase enzymes that process proglucagon . Our studies reveal that both mouse and human islets contain GLP-1(7–36)NH2, but glucagon mediates α cell–to–β cell communication in mice. However, in the absence of normal production of glucagon, α cells up-regulate prohormone convertase 1 (PC1/3) to generate GLP-1 and enhance glucose tolerance. Human islets have substantially higher levels of GLP-1 than mice, which positively correlate with rates of insulin secretion.
