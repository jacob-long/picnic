          "abstract": "Ferrous iron (Fe2+) is essential in all eukaryotic cells for various oxidoreductase reactions, including the demethylation of DNA and proteins. Histone demethylation is required for normal epigenetic regulation of the Y-chromosomal sex-determining gene Sry in developing gonads during male sex determination1,2. Here we investigate the potential connection between iron metabolism, histone demethylation and sex determination in mammals. We found that Fe2+-producing pathways are substantially activated in mouse embryonic gonads during the sex-determining period. Chelation of iron in cultured XY gonads reduced the level of KDM3A-mediated H3K9 demethylation of Sry, mostly abolished Sry expression and caused the gonads to express ovarian markers. In vivo, conditional deletion of the gene Tfrc—which is required for iron incorporation—in fetal XY gonadal somatic cells, or acute pharmaceutical suppression of available iron in pregnant mice, resulted in male-to-female gonadal sex reversal in a proportion of offspring, highlighting the pivotal role of iron metabolism in male sex determination. Finally, long-term feeding of pregnant mice with a low-iron diet, when combined with a heterozygous variant of Kdm3a that by itself has no observable effect, suppressed Sry expression and caused male-to-female sex reversal in some of the progeny, revealing a connection between maternal dietary iron and fetal developmental outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) signal reward-prediction errors that teach recipient circuits about expected rewards1. However, DANs are thought to provide a substrate for temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning (RL), an algorithm that learns the mean of temporally discounted expected future rewards, discarding useful information about experienced distributions of reward amounts and delays2. Here we present time–magnitude RL (TMRL), a multidimensional variant of distributional RL that learns the joint distribution of future rewards over time and magnitude. We also uncover signatures of TMRL-like computations in the activity of optogenetically identified DANs in mice during behaviour. Specifically, we show that there is significant diversity in both temporal discounting and tuning for the reward magnitude across DANs. These features allow the computation of a two-dimensional, probabilistic map of future rewards from just 450 ms of the DAN population response to a reward-predictive cue. Furthermore, reward-time predictions derived from this code correlate with anticipatory behaviour, suggesting that similar information is used to guide decisions about when to act. Finally, by simulating behaviour in a foraging environment, we highlight the benefits of a joint probability distribution of reward over time and magnitude in the face of dynamic reward landscapes and internal states. These findings show that rich probabilistic reward information is learnt and communicated to DANs, and suggest a simple, local-in-time extension of TD algorithms that explains how such information might be acquired and computed.",

However, accurately resolving the local metal coordination environments remains challenging, hindering the advancement of structure–activity relationships needed to optimize their design for diverse applications 1,2 . Although electron microscopy reveals atomic dispersion, conventional spectroscopic methods used in heterogeneous catalysis only provide average structural information. Here we demonstrate that 195 Pt solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing atomically dispersed Pt sites on various supports, so called single-atom catalysts (SACs). Monte Carlo simulations allow the conversion of NMR spectra into SAC signatures that describe coordination environments with molecular precision, enabling quantitative assessment of Pt-site distribution and homogeneity. This methodology can track the influence of synthetic parameters, uncovering the impact of specific steps and support types, and can also monitor changes upon reaction. It offers critical insights for the reproducible development of SACs with targeted structures. Beyond SACs, this approach lays the foundation for studying more complex architectures, such as dual-atom or single-cluster catalysts, containing various NMR-active metals.",

          "abstract": "Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe a broad range of phenomena in condensed matter and particle physics. A prominent example is confinement, responsible for bounding quarks inside hadrons such as protons or neutrons1. When quark–antiquark pairs are separated, the energy stored in the string of gluon fields connecting them grows linearly with their distance, until there is enough energy to create new pairs from the vacuum and break the string. Although these phenomena are ubiquitous in LGTs, simulating the resulting dynamics is a challenging task2. Here we report the observation of string breaking in synthetic quantum matter using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays3,4,5. We show that a (2 + 1)-dimensional LGT with dynamical matter can be efficiently implemented when the atoms are placed on a Kagome geometry6, with a local U(1) symmetry emerging from the Rydberg blockade7. Long-range Rydberg interactions naturally give rise to a linear confining potential for a pair of charges, allowing us to tune both their masses and the string tension. We experimentally probe string breaking in equilibrium by adiabatically preparing the ground state of the atom array in the presence of defects, distinguishing regions within the confined phase dominated by fluctuating strings or by broken string configurations. Finally, by harnessing local control over the atomic detuning, we quench string states and observe string-breaking dynamics exhibiting a many-body resonance phenomenon. Our work provides opportunities for exploring phenomena in high-energy physics using programmable quantum simulators.",

Endotheliopathy and dysregulated blood coagulation are prominent in COVID-19 and are considered to be major causes of microvascular obstruction1,2. Here we demonstrate extensive endothelial cell (EC) death in the microvasculature of COVID-19 organs. Notably, EC death was not associated with fibrin formation or platelet deposition, but was linked to microvascular red blood cell (RBC) haemolysis. Importantly, this RBC microangiopathy was associated with ischaemia–reperfusion injury, and was prominent in the microvasculature of humans with myocardial infarction, gut ischaemia, stroke, and septic and cardiogenic shock. Mechanistically, ischaemia induced MLKL-dependent EC necroptosis and complement-dependent RBC haemolysis. Deposition of haemolysed RBC membranes at sites of EC death resulted in the development of a previously unrecognized haemostatic mechanism preventing microvascular bleeding. Exaggeration of this haemolytic response promoted RBC aggregation and microvascular obstruction. Genetic deletion of Mlkl from ECs decreased RBC haemolysis, microvascular obstruction and reduced ischaemic organ injury. Our studies demonstrate the existence of a RBC haemostatic mechanism induced by dying ECs, functioning independently of platelets and fibrin. Therapeutic targeting of this haemolytic process may reduce microvascular obstruction in COVID-19, and other major human diseases associated with organ ischaemia.",

Until now, CO 2 and CH 4 emitted from rivers were thought to be predominantly derived from recent (sub-decadal) biomass production and, thus, part of ecosystem respiration 3–6 . Here we combine new and published measurements to create a global database of the radiocarbon content of river dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO 2 and CH 4 . Isotopic mass balance of our database suggests that 59 ± 17% of global river CO 2 emissions are derived from old carbon (millennial or older), the release of which is linked to river catchment lithology and biome. This previously unrecognized release of old, pre-industrial-aged carbon to the atmosphere from long-term soil, sediment and geologic carbon stores through lateral hydrological routing equates to 1.2 ± 0.3 Pg C year −1 , similar in magnitude to terrestrial net ecosystem exchange. A consequence of this flux is a greater than expected net loss of carbon from aged organic matter stores on land. This requires a reassessment of the fate of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial systems and in global carbon cycle budgets and models.",

          "abstract": "To thrive in complex environments, animals and artificial agents must learn to act adaptively to maximize fitness and rewards. Such adaptive behaviour can be learned through reinforcement learning1, a class of algorithms that has been successful at training artificial agents2,3,4,5 and at characterizing the firing of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain6,7,8. In classical reinforcement learning, agents discount future rewards exponentially according to a single timescale, known as the discount factor. Here we explore the presence of multiple timescales in biological reinforcement learning. We first show that reinforcement agents learning at a multitude of timescales possess distinct computational benefits. Next, we report that dopaminergic neurons in mice performing two behavioural tasks encode reward prediction error with a diversity of discount time constants. Our model explains the heterogeneity of temporal discounting in both cue-evoked transient responses and slower timescale fluctuations known as dopamine ramps. Crucially, the measured discount factor of individual neurons is correlated across the two tasks, suggesting that it is a cell-specific property. Together, our results provide a new paradigm for understanding functional heterogeneity in dopaminergic neurons and a mechanistic basis for the empirical observation that humans and animals use non-exponential discounts in many situations9,10,11,12, and open new avenues for the design of more-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.",

          "abstract": "RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes highly demanded RNAs grouped into three types of classical promoters, including type 1 (5S rRNA), type 2 (tRNA) and type 3 (short non-coding RNAs, such as U6, 7SK and RNase H1) promoters1,2,3,4,5,6,7. While structures of the Pol III preinitiation complex (PIC)8,9,10,11 and elongation complex (EC)12,13,14,15,16 have been determined, the mechanism underlying the transition from initiation to elongation remains unclear. Here we reconstituted seven human Pol III transcribing complexes (TC4, TC5, TC6, TC8, TC10, TC12 and TC13) halted on U6 promoters with nascent RNAs of 4–13 nucleotides. Cryo-electron microscopy structures captured initially transcribing complexes (ITCs; TC4 and TC5) and ECs (TC6–13). Together with KMnO4 footprinting, the data reveal extensive modular rearrangements: the transcription bubble expands from PIC to TC5, followed by general transcription factor (GTF) dissociation and abrupt bubble collapse from TC5 to TC6, marking the ITC–EC transition. In TC5, SNAPc and TFIIIB remain bound to the promoter and Pol III, while the RNA–DNA hybrid adopts a tilted conformation with template DNA blocked by BRF2, a TFIIIB subunit. Hybrid forward translocation during ITC–EC transition triggers BRF2-finger retraction, GTF release and transcription-bubble collapse. Pol III then escapes the promoter while GTFs stay bound upstream, potentially enabling reinitiation. These findings reveal molecular insights into Pol III dynamics and reinitiation mechanisms on type 3 promoters of highly demanded small RNAs, with the earliest documented initiation–elongation transition for an RNA polymerase.",

          "abstract": "North Atlantic Ocean circulation and temperature patterns profoundly influence global and regional climate across all timescales, from synoptic 1 to seasonal 2–4 , decadal 5 , multidecadal 6,7 and beyond 8,9 . During 2023, an extreme and near-basin-scale marine heatwave developed during Northern Hemisphere summer, peaking in July. The warming spread across virtually all regions of the North Atlantic, including the subpolar ocean, where a cooling trend over the past 50–100 years has been linked to a slowdown in the meridional overturning circulation 10,11 . Yet the mechanisms that led to this exceptional surface ocean warming remain unclear. Here we use observationally constrained atmospheric reanalyses alongside ocean observations and model simulations to show that air–sea heat fluxes acting on an extremely shallow surface mixed layer, rather than anomalous ocean heat transport, were responsible for this extreme ocean warming event. The dominant driver is shown to be anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling (shallowing) mixed layers, resulting in a rapid temperature increase in a shallow surface layer of the North Atlantic. Furthermore, solar radiation anomalies made regional-scale warming contributions in locations that approximately correspond to some of the region’s main shipping lanes, suggesting that reduced sulfate emissions could also have played a localized role. With a trend towards shallower mixed layers observed over recent decades, and projections that this will continue into the future, the severity of North Atlantic marine heatwaves is set to worsen.",

This raises several fundamental questions, such as why LOY in PBMCs drives cancer mortality and whether there is a relationship between LOY in PBMCs, PBMC-derived immune cells and cancer cells (and, if so, what its consequences are). We sought to answer these questions through a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data from 29 human tumour types, along with autochthonous and syngeneic mouse models. In human and mouse tumours, malignant epithelial cells had the highest LOY prevalence, yet LOY was also present in tumour stromal and immune cells, with LOY in malignant epithelial cells predicting LOY in benign cells. LOY also correlated between paired tumour and PBMC samples from patients. Among benign cells, LOY induced the strongest shift in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with both showing transcriptomic signatures of immunosuppression. Furthermore, the magnitude of LOY in epithelial cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells independently predicts survival, with tumours exhibiting concurrent epithelial and T cell LOY having the worst outcomes. Here we establish a model that links LOY in immune cells to LOY in malignant cells, which may explain in part why LOY in PBMCs is associated with increased cancer mortality.",

Our findings suggest that AED has increased drought severity by an average of 40% globally. Not only are typically dry regions becoming drier but also wet areas are experiencing drying trends. During the past 5 years (2018–2022), the areas in drought have expanded by 74% on average compared with 1981–2017, with AED contributing to 58% of this increase. The year 2022 was record-breaking, with 30% of the global land area affected by moderate and extreme droughts, 42% of which was attributed to increased AED. Our findings indicate that AED has an increasingly important role in driving severe droughts and that this tendency will likely continue under future warming scenarios.",

In Drosophila , visual projection neurons (VPNs) 3,4 perform this visuomotor transformation by converting retinal positional information into synapse number in the brain 5 . The molecular basis of this phenomenon remains unknown. We addressed this issue in LPLC2 (ref. 6 ), a VPN type that detects looming motion and preferentially drives escape behaviour to stimuli approaching from the dorsal visual field with progressively weaker responses ventrally. This correlates with a dorsoventral gradient of synaptic inputs into and outputs from LPLC2. Here we report that LPLC2 neurons sampling different regions of visual space exhibit graded expression of cell recognition molecules matching these synaptic gradients. Dpr13 shapes LPLC2 outputs by binding DIP-ε in premotor descending neurons mediating escape. Beat-VI shapes LPLC2 inputs by binding Side-II in upstream motion-detecting neurons. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments show that these molecular gradients act instructively to determine synapse number. These patterns, in turn, fine-tune the perception of the stimulus and drive the behavioural response. Similar transcriptomic variation within neuronal types is observed in the vertebrate brain 7 and may shape synapse number via gradients of cell recognition molecules acting through both genetically hard-wired programs and experience.",

          "abstract": "Topological insulators were originally discovered for electron waves in condensed-matter systems. Recently, this concept has been transferred to bosonic systems such as photons1 and phonons2, which propagate in materials patterned with artificial lattices that emulate spin-Hall physics. This work has been motivated, in part, by the prospect of topologically protected transport along edge channels in on-chip circuits2,3. In principle, topology protects propagation against backscattering, but not against loss, which has remained limited to the dB cm−1 level for phononic waveguides, whether topological4,5,6,7 or not8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Here we combine advanced dissipation engineering20—in particular, the recently introduced method of soft clamping21—with the concept of valley-Hall topological insulators for phonons22,23,24,25,26. This enables on-chip phononic waveguides with propagation losses due to dissipation of 3 dB km−1 at room temperature, orders of magnitude below any previous chip-scale devices. The low losses also allow us to accurately quantify backscattering protection in topological phononic waveguides, using high-resolution ultrasound spectroscopy. We infer that phonons follow a sharp, 120° bend with a 99.99% probability instead of being scattered back, and less than one phonon in a million is lost. Our work will inspire new research directions on ultralow-loss phononic waveguides and will provide a clean bosonic system for investigating topological protection and non-Hermitian topological physics.",

          "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are thought to create subcellular microenvironments that have different physicochemical properties compared with their surrounding nucleoplasm or cytoplasm 1–5 . However, probing the microenvironments of condensates and their relationship to biological function is a major challenge because tools to selectively manipulate specific condensates in living cells are limited 6–9 . Here, we develop a non-natural micropeptide (that is, the killswitch) and a nanobody-based recruitment system as a universal approach to probe endogenous condensates, and demonstrate direct links between condensate microenvironments and function in cells. The killswitch is a hydrophobic, aromatic-rich sequence with the ability to self-associate, and has no homology to human proteins. When recruited to endogenous and disease-specific condensates in human cells, the killswitch immobilized condensate-forming proteins, leading to both predicted and unexpected effects. Targeting the killswitch to the nucleolar protein NPM1 altered nucleolar composition and reduced the mobility of a ribosomal protein in nucleoli. Targeting the killswitch to fusion oncoprotein condensates altered condensate compositions and inhibited the proliferation of condensate-driven leukaemia cells. In adenoviral nuclear condensates, the killswitch inhibited partitioning of capsid proteins into condensates and suppressed viral particle assembly. The results suggest that the microenvironment within cellular condensates has an essential contribution to non-stoichiometric enrichment and mobility of effector proteins. The killswitch is a widely applicable tool to alter the material properties of endogenous condensates and, as a consequence, to probe functions of condensates linked to diverse physiological and pathological processes.",

          "abstract": "Studies of ancient DNA from cemeteries provide valuable insights into early human societies, and have strongly indicated patrilocality 1–10 . Here, we analysed ancient DNA alongside archaeological contexts and multiple stable isotopic data from 60 individuals in 2 separate cemeteries at the Fujia archaeological site in eastern China, dating between 2750 and 2500 bce . Our findings suggest the existence of an early-described matrilineal community in the Neolithic period, characterized by high endogamy and a population practicing millet agriculture near the coast. Evidence of intermarriage between individuals in the two cemeteries and the presence of both primary and secondary burials, organized strictly according to maternal clans, underscore a strong sense of social cohesion and identity at Fujia. Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates indicates that the two cemeteries were used for approximately 250 years, implying a stable matrilineal lineage spanning at least 10 generations. This study contributes to the ongoing debate in anthropology and archaeology 11 , not only suggesting the existence of a matrilineal society in early human history but also revealing a pair of Neolithic cemeteries organized around two matrilineal clans, furthering our understanding of the early evolution of human societies through kinship systems.",

          "abstract": "Clot-induced blockage in arteries or veins can cause severe medical conditions1. Mechanical thrombectomy is a minimally invasive technique used to treat ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and peripheral vascular disease2,3,4 by removing clots through aspiration5, stent retriever6 or cutting mechanisms7. However, current mechanical thrombectomy methods fail to remove clots in 10–30% of patients8,9,10, especially in the case of large, fibrin-rich clots11. These methods can also rupture and fragment clots12, causing distal emboli and poor outcomes13. To overcome these challenges, we develop the milli-spinner thrombectomy, which uses a simple yet innovative mechanics concept to modify the clot’s microstructure, facilitating its removal. The milli-spinner works by mechanically densifying the clot’s fibrin network and releasing red blood cells through spinning-induced compression and shear forces. It can shrink the clot volume by 95% for easy and fast removal. In vitro tests in pulmonary and cerebral artery flow models and in vivo experiments in swine models demonstrate that the milli-spinner achieves ultrafast clot debulking and high-fidelity revascularization, outperforming aspiration thrombectomy. The milli-spinner thrombectomy directly modifies the clot microstructure to facilitate clot removal, improving mechanical thrombectomy success rates compared with current methods that rely on clot rupture or cutting. This approach offers a promising new direction for mechanical thrombectomy devices, especially for treating ischaemic stroke, pulmonary embolism and peripheral thrombosis.",

Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill (GKP) states1 offer one of the most attractive classes of such qubit encodings, as they enable the implementation of universal gate sets with straightforward, deterministic and room temperature-compatible Gaussian operations2. Existing pioneering demonstrations generating optical GKP states3 and other complex non-Gaussian states4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 have relied on free-space optical components, hindering the scaling eventually required for a utility-scale system. Here we use an ultra-low-loss integrated photonic chip fabricated on a customized multilayer silicon nitride 300-mm wafer platform, coupled over fibre with high-efficiency photon number resolving detectors, to generate GKP qubit states. These states show critical mode-level features necessary for fault tolerance, including at least four resolvable peaks in both p and q quadratures, and a clear lattice structure of negative Wigner function regions, in this case a 3 × 3 grid. We also show that our GKP states show sufficient structure to indicate that the devices used to make them could, after further reduction in optical losses, yield states for the fault-tolerant regime. This experiment validates a key pillar of bosonic architectures for photonic quantum computing2,12, paving the way for arrays of GKP sources that will supply future fault-tolerant machines.",

Here we used fluorescent tracers in Prox1–GFP lymphatic reporter mice to map the pathway of CSF outflow through lymphatics to superficial cervical lymph nodes. CSF entered initial lymphatics in the meninges at the skull base and continued through extracranial periorbital, olfactory, nasopharyngeal and hard palate lymphatics, and then through smooth muscle-covered superficial cervical lymphatics to submandibular lymph nodes. Tracer studies in adult mice revealed that a substantial amount of total CSF outflow to the neck drained to superficial cervical lymph nodes. However, aged mice had fewer lymphatics in the nasal mucosa and hard palate and reduced CSF outflow to cervical lymph nodes. Superficial cervical lymphatics in aged mice had increased endothelial cell expression of Nos3, encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), but had less eNOS protein and impaired nitric oxide signalling. Manipulation of superficial cervical lymphatics through intact skin by a force-regulated mechanical device doubled CSF outflow and corrected drainage impairment in aged mice. This manipulation increased CSF outflow by compressing superficial cervical lymphatics while having little effect on their normal spontaneous contractions. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of superficial cervical lymphatics for CSF outflow and the potential for reversing CSF drainage impairment by non-invasive mechanical stimulation.",

Here we show that acetic acid efficiently depolymerizes both aliphatic and aromatic epoxy-amine thermosets used in CFRPs to recoverable monomers, yielding pristine carbon fibres. Deconstruction of materials from multiple sectors demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, providing clean fibres from 2 h reactions. The optimal conditions were scaled to 80.0 g of post-consumer CFRPs, and demonstrative composites were fabricated from the recycled carbon fibres, which were recycled two more times, maintaining their strength throughout. Process modelling and techno-economic analysis, with feedstock cost informed by wind turbine blade waste generation8, indicates this method is cost effective, with a minimum selling price of US$1.50 per kg for recycled carbon fibres whereas life cycle assessment shows process greenhouse gas emissions around 99% lower than virgin carbon fibre production. Overall, this approach could enable recycling of industrial CFRPs as it provides clean, mechanically viable recycled carbon fibres and recoverable resin monomers from the thermoset.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CAR-NK cell activity remain unclear. Here we identify the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) as a crucial regulator of NK cell function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant induction of CREM in CAR-NK cells during the peak of effector function after adoptive transfer in a tumour mouse model, and this peak coincided with signatures of both activation and dysfunction. We demonstrate that both CAR activation and interleukin-15 signalling rapidly induce CREM upregulation in NK cells. Functionally, CREM deletion enhances CAR-NK cell effector function both in vitro and in vivo and increases resistance to tumour-induced immunosuppression after rechallenge. Mechanistically, we establish that induction of CREM is mediated by the PKA–CREB signalling pathway, which can be activated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signalling downstream of CAR activation or by interleukin-15. Finally, our findings reveal that CREM exerts its regulatory functions through epigenetic reprogramming of CAR-NK cells. Our results provide support for CREM as a therapeutic target to enhance the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells.",

Cryo-electron microscopy structures of SMARCAD1 bound to the nucleosome and hexasome provide mechanistic insights into the substrate selectivity. SMARCAD1 binds to the hexasome through multiple family-specific elements that are essential for the functions in vitro and in cells. The enzyme binds to the canonical nucleosome in an inactive conformation, which accounts for its diminished activity towards the nucleosome. Notably, the histone chaperone FACT complex acts synergistically with H2A–H2B to promote the activity of SMARCAD1 in nucleosome remodelling.

Atrx loss promotes tumour invasion and metastasis, concomitant with a loss of colonic epithelial identity and the emergence of highly plastic mesenchymal and squamous-like cell states. Combined analysis of chromatin accessibility and enhancer mapping identified impairment of activity of the colonic lineage-specifying transcription factor HNF4A as a key mediator of these observed phenotypes.

As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT, from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement, the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, whereas for strong confinement, transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen11,12. We also demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a new set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Credit: MirageC/Getty\n\nA few years ago, I was contacted by someone I had studied with as an undergraduate. He was leading a large team at a marketing and communications agency and invited me to chat. He introduced me to the agency’s chief executive, who was planning an event and wanted me to give a seminar inspired by one of my publications on how stress and anxiety can spread from leaders to their team members. Her tone was enthusiastic and genuine, and the connection felt personal. I agreed to help shape the session.\n\nWe had three meetings. I adjusted the content to fit the audience. I drafted an outline. And although I mentioned a fee during the first two calls, I waited until the final exchange to send an actual quote in writing. It was a symbolic amount, far below market rate — and more of an honorarium, given the personal connection.\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nI followed up.\n\nNot a word.\n\nNo pushback. No negotiation. No ‘thanks but no thanks’. Just silence.\n\nThat silence was the clearest message possible: my time was valuable to the agency only if it was free.\n\nThe greater good\n\nExperiences like this are common in academia. Corporations and public-sector organizations routinely reach out to academics across disciplines, asking for expertise, insights or participation. The offer is framed as an ‘opportunity’. Sometimes the organizations mention visibility; sometimes they dangle the vague possibility of future collaboration, or free or discounted services. What’s almost never on the table?\n\nMoney.\n\nCollection: Time management\n\nLet’s be clear, this is unpaid labour. And, in many cases, the offer is structured that way deliberately. Yes, researchers often conduct unpaid work that serves our academic community: the scholarly ecosystem depends on everyone to pitch in, from serving on committees to peer review (which can raise issues related to, but slightly separate from, the ones I'm highlighting here). Plus, many of us have a romanticized idea that we should share our knowledge freely, as part of some higher mission. That the work is its own reward.\n\nAnd so we overcommit. We publish, teach, mentor, review, advise, engage and serve, all while chasing grant money to justify our existence. Especially for early-career researchers, the pressure to be ‘seen’ can be intense. Saying no feels like self-sabotage. Worse, many researchers worry that asking for payment will make them look difficult or entitled.\n\nBut every time we accept unpaid external work, we reinforce a broken norm. We teach organizations that academic insight is free. We lower the bar for what counts as professional respect. And we participate, whether we realize it or not, in the erosion of our own boundaries. Plus, there’s the opportunity cost of the time we’ve given away — the loss of the chance to do something else with that time.\n\nNot all unpaid work is bad. There are causes worth supporting and people worth helping. But researchers should be selective and support causes that align with their values. Unpaid work should be the exception, not the rule.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to shift the narrative, which have helped me to protect my time and value as a professional.\n\nSet clear fees or ‘rate sheets’\n\nEven if it’s just a short document outlining what you charge for a lecture, workshop or advisory session, having a tangible list of services and fees forces you and any prospective partner to treat your labour as professional work. Adjust rates as needed for non-profit organizations or public-interest endeavours. But don’t let your default be ‘free’.\n\nCollection: Work-life balance",

          "abstract": "After Hurricane Helene hit the United States in September 2024, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) implemented standard disaster-response measures. Many of Florida’s residents are familiar with FEMA, because of their state’s long collaboration with the agency. But many people living in North Carolina and Tennessee were not. False claims that FEMA was confiscating land and diverting funds from affected residents to migrants gained traction on social media. These prompted community members to be suspicious of FEMA workers, triggering violence and delaying aid and recovery in these areas.\n\nThe erosion of trust in public institutions is a pressing problem for governments. It hinders their ability to respond to challenges, such as extreme weather and pandemics, and to coordinate collective action during crises. Misinformation spread during disasters further undermines people’s confidence in official guidance.\n\nScience’s big problem is a loss of influence, not a loss of trust\n\nThe message for public agencies is clear: engage with communities long before a crisis occurs, so that they know what to do. Trust must be built through participatory processes. Collaboration with trusted local sources can help to strengthen both disaster-risk knowledge and preparedness. Local and national authorities, including weather agencies, must proactively develop transparent communication channels, making their services known and accessible, so that people can distinguish official information from disingenuous claims in times of crisis.\n\nToo often, governments assume that there is universal trust in the public establishment — overlooking how experiences of injustice and discrimination have created deep divisions between some communities and the institutions meant to serve them. Black communities in the United States, for instance, have long been facing health inequities.\n\nMisinformation gains traction when people feel their voices are not heard. This means that listening to local populations and addressing their concerns is key to establishing trusting relationships. Yet, as a social scientist working with communities in crisis situations, I’ve seen how often communities’ needs and experiences are overlooked.\n\nMisinformation poses a bigger threat to democracy than you might think",

The main challenge is keeping the lab sterile to make sure that the plant material we culture is not contaminated, which is why I’m wearing disposable clean-room overalls.\n\nIn Asia, ginseng is valued for its restorative properties. Work in recent years has shown that it contains around 200 bioactive compounds. Some of those are known as ginsenosides, which can interact with ion channels and cell receptors. These ginsenosides show anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal activity in humans. There are even studies showing anti-tumour activity (S. Kim et al. Processes 9, 1344; 2021).\n\nMy research, however, focuses less on ginseng’s medical background and more on how to grow a greater amount of it. The plant is not found in Indonesia’s tropical climate — it only grows in the subtropics — and typically takes four to six years to be ready to harvest. We are using plant tissue culture to produce a local source that we can grow in eight weeks. To do this, we use a method known as hairy-root culture, which uses the soil bacterium Rhizobium rhizogenes to infect plant roots, causing them to grow abnormally fast in artificial media without producing stems or leaves. The photo shows cultivation in 18-litre bioreactors that produce 2.5 kilograms of ginseng root, starting from only 150 grams. We are using a similar technology to grow red ginger (Zingiber officinale), one of Indonesia’s native herbal plants.",

          "title": "The polar regions hold crucial scientific secrets — and the time to study them is running out",
          "authors": "Marc Macias-Fauria",
          "abstract": "Ends of the Earth: Journeys to the Polar Regions in Search of Life, the Cosmos, and Our Future Neil Shubin Dutton (2025)\n\nOn his first fossil-hunting expedition to the Arctic regions of Greenland in 1988, evolutionary biologist and science writer Neil Shubin felt utterly disoriented. It was daylight around the clock, with the sun sweeping a great ellipse across the sky. Life’s rhythm was determined not by light, but by sound; glacially fed rivers roared at midday but, by 3 a.m., had faded to quiet trickles.\n\nAs the Arctic and Antarctica grow warmer, the fragile window available to us for understanding these icy outposts and the planetary processes they control is rapidly closing, writes Shubin in Ends of the Earth, an ambitious and far-reaching introduction to the polar regions. He explores polar science through the work of leading researchers and examines broader issues, such as how melting ice is beginning to expose microorganisms previously unknown to science.\n\nClimate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice\n\nHe weaves his own story, and those of his collaborators, into a broader narrative that touches on geopolitical issues and the lives of pioneering explorers. The book is packed with information, such as the fact that the polar ice caps have existed for only about 10% of Earth’s history. The origin and evolution of Homo sapiens, and the species’ migration out of Africa, occurred at a moment when Earth’s physical geography — its coastlines, islands and ocean levels — was defined by “the amount of water locked in polar ice”, Shubin writes.\n\nAnd that is the book’s key insight. The polar regions drive global climate, environmental dynamics and even human evolution — and have done so for millions of years. This helps to explain why the poles are so crucial to policy debates about climate change. The permafrost holds 1,500 billion tonnes of carbon — about twice the amount in the atmosphere.\n\nA second point highlighted by the author is the unique value of the polar regions for scientific discovery, owing to their extreme and unusual physical conditions. For example, Antarctica’s dry, stable air and vast ice sheets make it one of the best places on Earth to collect interstellar dust, which settles and is preserved in the snow.\n\nLayers of history\n\nThe layered structure of polar ice acts as a natural archive of Earth’s climate history, allowing scientists to reconstruct past temperatures. And the polar regions host extraordinary forms of life. Ecosystems in Antarctic subglacial lakes — buried some 3 kilometres beneath the ice — might have evolved in complete isolation for millions of years, and some microbes in the pitch-dark conditions can metabolize minerals to survive. Research into these habitats can offer rare insights into life in extreme environments, Shubin writes.\n\nHowever, by focusing so much on ice sheets, the author unintentionally reinforces the idea that the polar regions are defined by glacial ice. This might apply to Antarctica, a whole continent covered by ice, but is not true of the Arctic, whose landscapes include tundra and, by most reckonings, forests. Much of that region remained unglaciated even in the last ice age.\n\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914–17), led by Ernest Shackleton, aimed to make the first land crossing of Antarctica.Credit: Smith Archive/Alamy\n\nShubin notes how a definition of the Arctic is elusive. It has been framed over the centuries by various markers, including the northern tree line, the Arctic Circle and political or cultural boundaries. Yet, in the book, the Arctic is widely portrayed mainly as Greenland and the heavily glaciated high Arctic archipelagos — regions that most resemble Antarctica.\n\nFrom crevasse falls to polar bears, train fieldwork leaders for emergencies",

          "title": "How do I choose a principal investigator for my next postdoc?",
          "authors": "Nikki Forrester",
          "abstract": "Illustration: David Parkins\nThe problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nI am a postdoc working at an academic institute. I admire my principal investigator (PI) and am working on a project that fits my skill set and interests. However, before this position, I had two difficult experiences in consecutive postdoc jobs that led me to leave both labs. During my interviews, the PIs and I discussed working on projects that I was passionate about, but when I joined each lab, I was assigned to other projects that didn’t align with my interests. The PIs were also unclear about where my funding came from. For instance, after working in my first postdoc position for several months, I found out that my salary was being paid by another PI in the department. At the time, I felt misled. These positions weren’t what I signed up for.\n\nI tried to discuss my concerns with both PIs, but ultimately felt that my only option was to look for new positions. I’m now in my third postdoc role in three years, which doesn’t look great for job applications. My new PI has been transparent about funding, and the projects I’m working on are what I expected, but I’m still having a hard time trusting him. How does someone choose the right PI? — An uncertain computer scientist\n\nThe advice\n\nNature’s careers team reached out to two academics and two career coaches for advice.\n\n“You did exactly the right thing by moving on,” says Emma Williams, founder of the Nerd Coach, an academic coaching business in Cambridge, UK. The relationship between a PI and postdoc “is so key to everything in your career going forwards”.\n\nIn terms of choosing the right PI for a postdoc, all four said the first step is self-reflection. “Start by identifying what you want to get out of your postdoc,” says LaShan Hendrix, a biomedical engineer at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio. “Do you want to get more papers? Do you want to take on a new role? Do you want teaching or grant-writing experience?”\n\nNine books to help shape your science career in 2025\n\nThen, Hendrix suggests, explore what mentoring style you like. Do you prefer a mentor who is hands-on, or someone who is less involved? If you had issues with your PhD adviser, Hendrix recommends looking for a PI for your postdoc who can provide you with a different personality and mentoring style.\n\nNext, consider what laboratory environment you need to thrive. For instance, in a large lab group, you might have the opportunity to take on a leadership role and collaborate with graduate students. In a smaller lab, it might just be you and the PI working closely on a project. “It can feel quite claustrophobic, or the two of you could be a brilliant team,” Williams says.\n\nNavigating interviews\n\nUnderstanding what you want as a researcher isn’t enough on its own, however. The next step is interviewing potential PIs. Keep in mind that this process isn’t just about the PI questioning you — you’re also interviewing them to see whether they will be the right fit. All of the specialists Nature spoke to said that it’s important to discuss ongoing research projects as well as where the funding comes from and what the PI expects of you. Williams suggests asking for written documentation about the project you’ll be working on, and for a copy of the grant that will support your work. If the PI is unwilling to provide those documents, that could be a warning sign, she says.\n\nWilliams also says that the way you phrase your questions can affect the type of information you receive. For instance, instead of asking a hypothetical question about how the PI will support your career, ask how they have supported their postdocs’ careers in the past, which encourages them to provide you with evidence of their previous efforts. Looking into how long researchers have stayed in the lab for can also be helpful. “If people are only staying six months, that would be a big red flag for me,” says Williams.\n\nHendrix says it’s crucial to clarify which intellectual ideas from your postdoc research you will be able to take with you after you move on, and which aspects will stay with the lab. For example, if your PI works on the 3D microenvironment in breast cancer, maybe you can go on to study the 3D microenvironment in lung cancer instead. Another example could be examining different pathways in the same disease.\n\nHow do I tell someone that I can't write them a strong letter of recommendation?\n\n“A red flag would be if they make it clear that they don’t want you to take anything,” she says. “Another thing to look out for is whether your future research interests are exactly what that PI is working on, because then they might see you as competition. You want to have some separation in your research interests.”\n\nIf you want to do independent research, it’s important to ask whether you can work on it during the postdoc. “I usually encourage young fellows or postdocs to look for their own small grants, which can help them to establish themselves,” says Adesola Ogunniyi, a retired neurologist who worked at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria.\n\nTalk to other postdocs\n\nAlong with speaking to the PI, all four experts recommend talking to current and previous postdocs. “It’s important to be professional and respectful, but also to get the information you need,” says Claartje van Sijl, who owns the academic coaching practice Van Sijl Counseling & Training in Utrecht, the Netherlands. As part of your due diligence while exploring the role’s suitability, she recommends framing questions using language such as: ‘I’ve learnt from experience how crucial the working relationship is, so I’d love to hear more about how things unfolded over time in this group. What made it work and what would you advise for someone new?”\n\nThe other specialists recommend asking what day-to-day life looks like in the lab, and how current and previous postdocs would define the lab’s culture. This can help you to determine whether the lab environment will suit you.\n\nThe ‘PhD influencers’ logging lab life on TikTok and Instagram",

          "abstract": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week that the US government would ‘aggressively’ revoke visas for Chinese students.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nGraduate students, postdoctoral researchers and science laboratory leaders are reeling after an announcement last week that the US government will revoke visas for Chinese students — and they are contacting lawyers.\n\nInternational PhD students make emergency plans in fear of US immigration raids\n\nIn a statement on 28 May, US secretary of state Marco Rubio said that the policy will apply to students studying in “critical fields” and those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party. Rubio also said that the government will revise visa criteria to “enhance scrutiny” for all future visa applications submitted by students from China and Hong Kong.\n\nIt is not clear which Chinese students the policy applies to, or what criteria will be used to determine who is subject to the policy. But the order could affect tens of thousands of students. In the 2023–24 academic year, 122,778 graduate students from China held positions at US universities, out of a total of 502,291 international graduate students, according to data from the Institute of International Education (IIE) in New York City. The IIE conducts an annual census of international students with funding from the US government.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Department of State did not respond to Nature’s request for clarification on what counts as a critical field. But in a statement, they wrote that the policy is aimed at averting “theft of U.S. research, intellectual property, and technologies”. They added that visa adjudication is a national-security decision, and prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to national security or public safety is key to protecting US citizens.\n\nLegal action ahead\n\nResearchers and graduate students who spoke to Nature — most of whom did so on the condition of anonymity, out of fear of reprisals — say that Rubio’s order could devastate their research groups and upend the careers of talented young scientists.\n\nScientific conferences are leaving the US amid border fears\n\nKen Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, says that he has colleagues and students who are upset. Referring to Rubio’s announcement, Ono says: “That is a statement that if you’re from a certain country, you’re just not welcome … and that message is devastating.”\n\nIn his department, some research groups are made up mostly of students from China. These groups could be utterly decimated, Ono adds. But he is hopeful it won’t come to that. Ono says that he expects legal injunctions will be filed to stop visas from being revoked — although he doesn’t know who will file these injunctions or at which institutions.\n\nA materials scientist at another university described Rubio’s order as “human-rights abuse”, adding that it would set his research back three or more years and that, overall, it would devastate US science and its standing in the world.\n\nHe has reached out to his students to tell them that their institution will do its best to protect them, he says. “I still hope that law and due process will hold,” he adds.\n\nA Chinese postdoctoral researcher in biological physics who has been in the United States for more than six years told Nature that she feels “troubled and upset” by Rubio’s announcement. She always wanted to stay in the United States and find a job as a full-time researcher, but at the start of this year, around the time that US President Donald Trump took office, she started looking for options in other countries, such as Japan and nations in Europe.\n\nHer academic supervisor says that she is looking for a pro bono lawyer to represent her students in case their visas are revoked. She has five international students in her research group, and they are all nervous — not just those from China — she says. “This policy will discourage everyone, not just Chinese students, because they will think it could be them next,” she adds.",

          "title": "How a mysterious epidemic of kidney disease is killing thousands of young men",
          "authors": "Carrie Arnold",
          "abstract": "For years, Oscar has greeted dawn with the rhythmic swing of his machete as he chops sugar cane in fields near his home in El Salvador. On a typical morning, the 33-year-old begins work long before sunrise in a futile attempt to escape the suffocating heat and humidity. But one morning in December, Oscar clutched his wife’s hand instead of his steel machete. The pair sat in a waiting room of a clinic in the small town of Tierra Blanca. Oscar, a pseudonym being used to protect his privacy, had gone with his wife to find out whether his kidneys were failing.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, a mysterious epidemic of chronic kidney disease began emerging in Bajo Lempa, a region on the Pacific coast of El Salvador where Tierra Blanca is located. The disease, which researchers have dubbed chronic kidney disease of unknown cause (CKDu), often affects people between the ages of 20 and 50. Many are agricultural workers or labourers without other known risk factors for kidney disease. As many as one in four adult men in Bajo Lempa have kidney disease, whether CKDu or another form, compared with an estimated one in ten men globally. Roughly 17% of men in Bajo Lempa live with kidney failure1.\n\nAlthough the epidemic of this perplexing kidney disease was first recognized in this region, more than half a dozen hotspots have since appeared elsewhere in Central America and around the world. Hard data on the number of people with CKDu globally have yet to be tallied. However, occupational-medicine specialist Emmanuel Jarquín says that tens of thousands of people have probably died from the disease, and the number continues to grow.\n\nExtreme heat is a huge killer – these local approaches can keep people safe\n\n“This is the biggest story in the world about kidney disease,” says Jarquín, who is on the front line of the epidemic in El Salvador. In 2007, Jarquín founded the Agency for Development and Agricultural Health (AGDYSA), a scientific research organization based in San Salvador that aims to protect agricultural workers from kidney disease and other work-related conditions. There were so many cases of kidney failure in the district of Bajo Lempa that AGDYSA opened a satellite office in Tierra Blanca in 2023.\n\n“People here are aware of their illness, but when they reach for treatment, they don’t receive anything,” says Jarquín. Not prevention, not dialysis, not anything. As a result, people get sicker, and fast. “It’s a vicious cycle,” he says.\n\nAlthough the cause of the epidemic hasn’t been definitively determined, most scientists agree that, at least among sugar-cane workers, intense labour in extreme heat is one of the major drivers of this condition. Elsewhere, CKDu shows up among other labourers, including rice farmers, construction workers and miners.\n\nMany researchers expect the effects of climate change to increase the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which is already a growing health concern globally. In May, the governing body of the World Health Organization adopted a resolution to recognize kidney disease as a major cause of death and disability and to strengthen disease-prevention efforts.\n\nKidney disease is an example of the damage that prolonged, incessant heat can do to the body, says Ollie Jay, a heat physiologist at the University of Sydney in Australia. For the epidemic of CKDu, the agricultural workers of Bajo Lempa were an early warning sign.\n\nAn emerging epidemic\n\nMore than two decades ago, when otherwise healthy young men in Bajo Lempa began to grow fatigued and anaemic, they chalked it up to long hours of intense and exhausting work. Sugar-cane cutters are “marathon workers”, says Fabiano Amorim, a physiologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Furthermore, “they sometimes don’t have the proper food for the work they are doing. They don’t have water available.”\n\nTaking time off to rest wasn’t an option. The men depended on their work to provide food and shelter for their families. So the workers swallowed ibuprofen and got back to their machetes.\n\nBut for many, the fatigue worsened until they could no longer get out of bed. With local physicians unable to help, some of the men managed to make the two-hour drive to Rosales National Hospital in San Salvador. When they arrived, the men learnt that their kidneys had failed. Their bodies could no longer filter certain types of toxin, such as uric acid, from the blood or eliminate excess water. When this happens, fluid accumulates in the body until the lungs can no longer fill with air and the heart struggles to beat. Without dialysis to clean and filter the blood, death is inevitable.\n\nSugar-cane cutters in Nicaragua wear dust monitors as part of an effort to evaluate labour practices and reduce the effects of heat stress.Credit: Ed Kashi/VII/Redux/eyevine\n\nWhen the men arrived at Rosales National Hospital, nephrologist Ricardo Leiva and his then-trainee Ramón García-Trabanino were puzzled about why these seemingly healthy young men’s kidneys had abruptly crashed. The textbooks that both physicians had pored over in medical school taught them that kidney failure was usually the result of untreated diabetes and high blood pressure or certain rare autoimmune and genetic conditions. The men from Bajo Lempa had none of these.\n\n“They were so young … I had no answers,” says García-Trabanino, who now helps to run a private dialysis clinic in San Salvador. “It was a massacre.”\n\nYet, with the hospital flooded with people from Bajo Lempa, neither had much time to work it out. “I started work at 5 a.m. every day,” Leiva says. “And I didn’t get home until after it was dark.”\n\nEven moderate heat strains the human heart\n\nWhen Leiva, García-Trabanino and a team of researchers published the first account of the mysterious kidney disease in a public-health journal in 20022, the condition seemed like a local kidney anomaly — what biologists call an endemic nephropathy. But then papers began identifying other hotspots of CKDu, including in the sugar-cane-growing region of Nicaragua3.\n\n“Nobody believed us that we were seeing a new form” of chronic kidney disease, says Marvin Gonzalez Quiroz, a physician and epidemiologist from Nicaragua, who is now at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “Nobody believed the prevalence that we were reporting.” Other research documented similar problems in Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, India and Sri Lanka4.\n\nNone of the early studies could pin down a cause, but several leading hypotheses have emerged, including exposure to pesticides and heavy metals, as well as pathogens, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chronic heat stress. Researchers now say that CKDu could have multiple causes that vary between individuals, and across locations and time. Still, epidemiological and animal studies point to heat stress as an important factor.\n\nHow we keep cool\n\nHumans maintain their core body temperature in a narrow range of 36–37 °C, says Daniel Vecellio, a biometeorologist at the University of Nebraska Omaha, and expend a lot of energy to keep it there. When our bodies heat up, blood vessels in the limbs and extremities dilate in a process called vasodilation, shunting blood away from major organs and to the surface of the skin, allowing heat to dissipate. As the core body temperature creeps up, glands in the skin begin pumping out sweat, further cooling the body. A fan or breeze amplifies this cooling; high humidity makes the process less effective, says Vecellio. When vasodilation and sweating are inadequate and the body temperature gets too high, muscles cramp, nausea takes hold and people can become confused and faint. In extreme cases, seizures and death can follow.\n\nThe kidneys are some of the first organs to feel the strain as body temperature rises. Sending more blood to the body’s surface means that the kidneys and other major organs receive less oxygen and nutrients. This often happens while water is lost through sweating, forcing the kidneys to kick into overdrive to preserve the body’s fluid balance. That effort can lead to drops in kidney function, even in healthy adults.\n\nThe entire heat response is a finely tuned physiological symphony that leaves little room for error, says Catharina Giudice, an emergency-medicine physician at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. “The kidneys are more vulnerable than other organs. They have a very intense metabolic demand, so small changes in blood flow tend to be more harmful,” she says.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, exposure to pesticides could be behind an epidemic of chronic kidney disease.Credit: Ed Kashi/VII/Redux/eyevine\n\nPeople working in construction and agriculture don’t just get hot from being outside in the Sun — they also generate heat through physical labour. Sweating a lot can leave them dangerously dehydrated at the end of a workday, even if they drink water as usual, says Giudice.\n\nExcept in the most severe cases, researchers thought that the kidneys could quickly bounce back from heat stress with no long-term damage. The emergence of CKDu instead hints that small, repeated injuries — even those that don’t result in a hospital visit — can build up over time. Compounded and amplified by other exposures, these small insults can lead to end-stage kidney failure, says Giudice.\n\n“You’re having this acute kidney injury day after day,” she says. “Then you progress to a state where the cells can’t recover fully.”\n\nBiopsies from people with CKDu show damage to specific parts of the kidney called the tubules, which reabsorb and return water and other useful substances to the blood. The problem, says Zachary Schlader, a physiologist at Indiana University Bloomington, is working out how to detect this damage before kidney function drops drastically. Typical tests spot a problem only when there are elevated levels of a waste product called creatinine in the blood and protein in the urine.\n\nNearly ten years ago, Schlader decided to look for molecular distress signals that could be early indicators of declines in kidney function. In one study of sugar-cane cutters in Nicaragua, Schlader and his colleagues found that markers of tubule injury changed as blood creatinine increased throughout the harvest season5. Another study by some of the same researchers, looking at workers during harvest, found that increased levels of white blood cells in urine (a marker of inflammation) and a decrease in haemoglobin in red blood cells (the production of which depends on the hormone erythropoietin secreted by the kidneys) could predict declines in kidney function across the harvest season6.\n\n“The hotter people got, the more dehydrated people got, these signals went up,” says Schlader. Importantly, he says, there are biomarkers that can be measured easily, and can be detected before more commonly used markers of kidney injury, such as creatinine.\n\n“And it’s not just the kidney that’s being affected; the whole body is,” says Schlader. “Heat stress causes systemic inflammation, and CKDu is likely some combination of what’s happening within the kidneys and what’s happening systemically.”\n\nResearch by Schlader’s team and others has shown that kidney damage can accumulate much more quickly than anyone thought.\n\n“It affirmed a lot of what we hear anecdotally, which is that people start working when they’re young, they’re healthy. They have good kidney function, and then bang, they have stage-four kidney disease and will need dialysis soon,” says Madeleine Scammell, an environmental-health scientist at Boston University in Massachusetts, who studies CKDu.",

          "authors": "Humberto Basilio",
          "abstract": "Levels of the amino acid taurine did not correlate reliably with strength measures in older humans.Credit: Karen Haibara/AFP/Getty\nResearch suggests that blood levels of the amino acid taurine might not be as closely linked to ageing as previous research had suggested. Led by scientists at the US National Institute on Aging (NIA) in Baltimore, Maryland, the study casts doubt on the use of taurine as anageing biomarker— something that could be measured to help determine a person’s health status — and on its use as a dietary supplement to stave off the effects of ageing1.\n\n“We clearly show that there’s no need for taurine supplementation as long as you have a healthy diet,” says Rafael de Cabo, a gerontologist at the NIA. The results were published today in Science.\n\nScientists not involved in the research highlight the rigour of the analysis, which looked at taurine levels in hundreds of humans over time, as well as in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and mice. “Taurine levels were not decreasing [with age] and are not related to any abnormality that they could see in this very good longitudinal study,” says geneticist Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Nevertheless, the study looked only at natural taurine levels in the body, and not at whether supplements have any benefits. “That’s something that has yet to be tested,” he says.\n\nBullish on taurine\n\nTaurine is sold over-the-counter as a dietary supplement, and it is an ingredient in popular caffeinated energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster Energy. Various health effects have been attributed to taurine, including improving focus and energy levels. But these claims have not been thoroughly evaluated.\n\nTaurine, first isolated from ox bile in 1827, is not considered an essential amino acid.\n\nIn a 2023 study, also published in Science2, researchers found that levels of taurine seemed to decline in mice, monkeys and humans as they aged. Daily supplements of the amino acid seemed to extend the lifespan and improve the health of taurine-deficient mice.\n\nBut something about the research “didn’t click”, de Cabo says. His team had been collecting results that showed taurine levels increasing or remaining stable with age.\n\nWhereas the previous study on taurine was cross-sectional in design, meaning that it collected data from animals of different ages at a single point in time, de Cabo’s team also collected longitudinal data, taking samples from the same individuals over time.\n\nIn humans, they studied three different populations, one of which (the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging) included more than 740 participants aged 26–100. In animals, they followed monkeys until they were up to 32 years old and mice up until 27 months — almost their entire lifespan.\n\nIn nearly all cohorts, except the male mice group, taurine levels increased with age.\n\nThe authors also examined taurine’s relationship with things such as muscle strength and body weight. Although there were some associations — such as higher taurine levels being linked to stronger knee strength in one human cohort — the results were inconsistent across age groups, sexes and species. In some cases, higher taurine levels correlated with strength deficiencies. On the basis of these findings, levels of taurine in the blood “are unlikely to serve as a good biomarker of ageing”, says co-author Maria Emilia Fernandez, a gerontologist at the NIA. Finding simple, reliable biomarkers for ageing has long been a goal for the field, because they might provide a shortcut in evaluating drugs and treatments for the maladies of ageing.\n\nDe Cabo’s study is “more convincing” than the previous one, says geneticist David Sinclair at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. In recent years, there has been an over-reliance on cross-sectional data sets, such as those used in the earlier study, he says — and those are highly variable. That variability, he says, can lead to misinterpretations and false-positive conclusions.\n\n‘Big question marks’",

          "title": "Trump moves to slash NSF: why are the proposed budget cuts so big?",
          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "The US National Science Foundation has, in recent years, funded one-quarter of federally backed basic research at US universities.Credit: Briscoe Savoy for Nature\n\nLess than a month after the US National Science Foundation (NSF) marked its 75th anniversary, President Donald Trump has targeted it for an unprecedented budget cut. Scientists are reeling following the Friday release of the Trump team’s proposal for the agency, which funds 25% of federally backed basic research at US universities, and asking: why?\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\n\nTrump has requested cuts to science funding across the board — the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) would lose roughly 40% of its budget compared with 2024 levels, and NASA would be pruned by about one-quarter — but the NSF would lose a whopping 57%, taking its roughly US$9-billion budget down to $3.9 billion. These top-line numbers aren’t new: the administration released a ‘skinny’ budget with similar figures in early May. But the detailed budget released last week gives a fuller look at the historic cuts intended for the NSF — including the elimination of 99% of funding for clean-energy research and the surprise shuttering of a gravitational-wave observatory.\n\nThe president’s budget request will not necessarily be put into practice: it must be approved by the US Congress. But policy watchers are worried that lawmakers might not stand up to Trump by rejecting many of his cuts, as they did during his first term as president.\n\nIf the NSF budget were to be enacted as is, it “would spell the end of any pretence that the US leads the world in science and technology, handing that position to China”, says Neal Lane, who directed the agency under Democratic former president Bill Clinton. Agency staff members, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press, told Nature that they are unsurprised, but deeply concerned. “The president’s request is a stab in the back of US science,” one staff member says.\n\nA spokesperson for the NSF told Nature that the request “reflects a strategic alignment of resources in a constrained fiscal environment”.\n\nHits across the board\n\nThe vast majority of the $5-billion cut would be to research-grant funding, although certain disciplines would be hit harder than others: the geosciences directorate faces a 44.6% cut; the education directorate would be reduced by 75%; and the maths and physics directorate would decline by 66.8%. These three would account for about $2.6 billion of the cutback.\n\nNSF slashes prestigious PhD fellowship awards by half\n\nThe president’s budget would reduce the number of people who receive support for NSF activities annually from 330,000 to about 90,000, in part by making grants much more competitive: the current 26% success rate for applicants would dwindle to just 7%. On the social-media platform Bluesky, researchers lamented their prospects. “It ain’t worth my time now,” posted Dan Collier, a scientist studying higher education at the University of Memphis in Tennessee. Mike Boylan Kolchin, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote: “One of the worst effects of having success rates this low: review panels & funding agencies will become *extremely* risk-averse.”\n\nEven the Trump administration’s stated priorities, such as artificial intelligence and quantum information science, would take a hit: they would see increases of 3.1% and 0.4%, respectively, but that is not enough to keep pace with inflation.\n\nIn a shock move, the proposed budget would cut funding by about 40% for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The project, which has sites in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana, is one of the NSF’s biggest success stories. In 2016, LIGO directly detected gravitational waves emanating from the merger of two black holes, and its scientists went on to win a share of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nIf Trump’s request comes to fruition, one of LIGO’s two detectors will close. The budget request does not provide a rationale. Losing one of its two detectors would be “devastating”, says astrophysicist David Reitze, executive director of LIGO at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The programme would lose much of its ability to locate gravitational-wave events and would be more susceptible to ‘noise’, such as that produced by earthquakes, so that it might incorrectly classify the events it does detect, Reitze says.",

Credit: SusanneB/Getty\n\nA university-scoring method that highlights research-integrity ‘red flags’ could make it easier to spot institutions that are chasing conventional publishing metrics at the expense of rigorous science, researchers say.\n\nThe Research Integrity Risk Index, described in a preprint on arXiv last month1, categorizes institutions according to how many of their papers are retracted and how many are published in journals delisted from the scholarly databases Scopus and Web of Science. Researchers say that the index could improve university ranking systems that currently reward quantity of research output over quality.\n\nElite university strategies might boost profile and rankings, but at what cost?\n\n“Universities want to be seen as rising stars” but it is not always clear whether they are “rising on solid ground or statistical quicksand”, says Lokman Meho, an information scientist at the American University of Beirut, who says he developed the index as a way to help identify “environments where integrity may be compromised by pressure to maximize metrics” such as publication rates. The measure is not designed to identify research misconduct, he stresses, “but reveal vulnerabilities warranting further review”.\n\nThe index is “a good first step” and “should be used by the ranking agencies”, says Achal Agrawal, a data scientist in Raipur, India, and founder of India Research Watch, an online group of researchers and students who highlight integrity issues. It “offers a strong and timely correction to a system that too often equates research excellence with sheer volume”, says Kiran Sharma, a data scientist at BML Munjal University in Gurugram, India. “It shifts attention from quantity to integrity, helping realign academic incentives with genuine scholarly value”.\n\nRanking rethink\n\nGlobal university rankings often track how many papers an institution publishes and how often its research gets cited. Meho says that such ‘positive data’ can be misleading — and that some institutions exploit them to climb the rankings. “I wanted to go the other way, the research-integrity part,” he says.\n\nMeho’s index ranks universities by the proportion of their papers that are published in delisted journals and how often their papers have been retracted over the past two years. Meho says he chose these two criteria because they were ‘objective’ and based on publically-available data, although he explored other ways to quantify integrity concerns, such as the presence of hyper-prolific authors and whether there had been a decrease in the proportion of papers that listed an institution's researchers as first or corresponding authors. The tool places institutions into one of five categories, ranging from ‘low risk’ to ‘red flag’, which suggests high rates in both measures and indicates a need for urgent scrutiny.\n\nSurge in number of ‘extremely productive’ authors concerns scientists\n\nWhile developing the index, Meho analysed 18 institutions — located in Saudi Arabia, India, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates — which had seen ‘extreme publication growth’ and rapidly climbed international rankings over the past few years.",

          "abstract": "Kári Stefánsson’s genomics firm deCODE became an early leader in conducting genome-wide association studies.Credit: Halldor Kolbeins/AFP via Getty\n\nIt’s been a month since Kári Stefánsson, the founder and former chief executive of the pioneering Icelandic genomics company deCODE genetics, says he was summarily fired by deCODE’s parent company, the biotechnology giant Amgen, and Stefánsson is his usual candid — some have said abrasive — self.\n\n“The possibility certainly exists that I’m simply a dislikable individual that they wanted to get rid of,” he says. “A significant proportion of my old friends would agree with that.”\n\nStefánsson, a neurologist and neuroscientist, left a faculty position at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, to found deCODE in 1996. The company convinced a large proportion of Icelanders to share their genomic data, and a controversial 1998 law enabled deCODE to create a national database containing medical records from Iceland’s healthcare system.\n\nHow a trove of cancer genomes could improve kids’ leukaemia treatment\n\nThe firm was an early leader in conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that linked common single-letter DNA variations to people’s risk of developing complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes1 and schizophrenia2 , as well as other traits (I attended a talk in the 2000s at which Stefánsson said the team had even found a gene variant associated with enjoying crossword puzzles). Thanks mainly to deCODE’s efforts, Icelanders accounted for 11.5% of GWAS participants between 2007 and 2017, one study found3.\n\n“The amazing thing is that in this tiny little country with a population of about 390,000 people, we managed to build up a genetics organization that was second to none,” Stefánsson says.\n\nThe importance of chaos\n\nAfter financial troubles forced deCODE into bankruptcy in 2009 and a subsequent takeover by private investors, Amgen bought the firm in late 2012 for US$415 million. Stefánsson says that deCODE has operated more or less autonomously from Amgen for most of the past 12 years.\n\n“We have had a very free-spirited atmosphere where people have worked on the assumption that chaos is a very important beginning point to all research you do,” Stefánsson says.\n\nStefánsson attributes his downfall to a recent shift in deCODE’s relationship with Amgen, which, he says, sought closer integration between the two. “When you are working in a very goal-oriented work environment to serve drug discovery and development, this is a very noble activity, but you lose some of that freedom.”\n\nWhat went wrong at 23andMe? Why the genetic-data giant risks collapse\n\nStefánsson says he was blindsided when, on 1 May, while he was visiting Amgen’s headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California, the company’s vice-president for research and development, Jay Bradner, told him his services were no longer needed at deCODE.\n\n“I was asked to come to another building, put into a room where Jay Bradner sat in front of me and said, ‘You are fired’, basically. Before I arrived back in Iceland, they had sent out a press release announcing my departure from deCODE,” he says. “I think it is not a graceful way of parting with the founder of the company who had run it for 29 years.”\n\nAmgen declined to comment on Stefánsson’s characterization of his dismissal. But in a statement to Nature, a representative said the decision “reflects a strategic evolution in the way our deCODE and other Amgen scientists work together to advance research in service of patients”.\n\nThe ‘free spirit’ of deCODE",

          "abstract": "Up to one in 50 scientific papers ought to be retracted, according to one estimate.Credit: Brazzo/Getty\n\nThe Center for Scientific Integrity — the non-profit organization that runs Retraction Watch — has launched a project aimed at rounding up flawed and fake medical-research papers and neutralizing their impact on health guidelines. The Medical Evidence Project will be run by James Heathers, a science-integrity consultant and self-described “data thug” based in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nMedicine is plagued by untrustworthy clinical trials. How many studies are faked or flawed?\n\n“I don’t think anything is more of an immediate threat to people than bad medical research,” Heathers says. “We’re going to find the bad medical evidence that is a threat to quality of life and tell everyone.”\n\nThe project, which has a US$900,000 grant from funder Open Philanthropy in San Francisco, California, to run for two years with a team of three to five people, aims specifically to root out flawed papers that have a serious impact on medical guidelines by skewing meta-analyses — reviews that combine the results of multiple similar studies to come to a statistically more powerful conclusion. “It is a great idea to take a very detailed look at such papers,” says Elisabeth Bik, a data sleuth in San Francisco who is not involved with the project. Earlier this year, the Center for Scientific Integrity (CSI) set up a fund for grants under Bik’s name after she donated $200,000 to the organization.\n\nIvan Oransky, executive director of the CSI, says that the centre has “been expanding and embracing the sleuth movement” by helping to fund and support work that is usually done on a volunteer basis.\n\nFlaws and fakery\n\nResearch papers marred by innocent mistakes, misconduct or outright fakery are a serious problem in science. Oransky estimates that one in every 50 papers published by scientific journals should probably be retracted. That amounts to tens of thousands of papers among the roughly three million published each year.\n\nGiant study finds untrustworthy trials pollute gold-standard medical reviews\n\nOther projects have already sought to root out bad data. One trawled through 50 high-profile medical reviews and found serious concerns with about 6% of the papers that fed into them1. The team that ran that project is working on a tool to help check papers for trustworthiness. The historical examples of papers such as these affecting health policy “are terrifying”, Heathers says.\n\nFor example, a 2009 guideline from the European Society of Cardiology2 recommended the use of blood-pressure-lowering medicines called beta-blockers to protect the heart during non-cardiac surgery, based heavily on a series of studies that began in 1999. However, a few years later, concerns were raised about those studies. The guideline was amended in 2013 with an ‘expression of concern’3, but a 2014 investigation was unable to “confirm or dispel doubts” about the work. Other researchers reported their own analysis4 of the literature that year and suggested that adherence to that guideline might have caused up to 10,000 deaths per year in the United Kingdom alone.\n\nThe Medical Evidence Project, which launched on 1 June, wants to provide a secure platform for whistle-blowers who are daunted by the idea of publishing their concerns about influential medical papers on public platforms such as PubPeer, or find that route ineffective. “I would like to be a resource for those people,” Heathers says. The project’s website will provide a mechanism to supply anonymous tips. People can also e-mail the project’s tip line.\n\nThe team plans to develop its own computational methods for finding bad papers — perhaps similar to the Problematic Paper Screener, a tool that looks for red flags such as papers that cite retracted works or that use ‘tortured phrases’, hinting that they have been written by automatic means. But the team will fine-tune its tools for their own purposes.",

          "abstract": "International waters, also known as the high seas, make up 61% of the ocean and cover 43% of Earth’s surface — amounting to two-thirds of the biosphere by volume. They have been exploited since the seventeenth century for whales, and from the mid-twentieth century for fish, sharks and squid, depleting wildlife. Now, climate change is reducing the productivity of the high seas through warming and through depletion of nutrients and oxygen. Proposals to fish for species at greater depths and mine the sea bed threaten to wreak yet more damage, putting the ocean’s crucial role in maintaining the stability of Earth’s biosphere at risk.\n\nLess than 1% of the area of the high seas is protected, however. This is because there has been no globally accepted mechanism to do so beyond Antarctica. The United Nations High Seas Treaty was agreed in 2023 to fill this governance gap and expand the number of marine protected areas in international waters. It is crucial to protect at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, as agreed under the Global Biodiversity Framework in 2022.\n\nTo save the high seas, plan for climate change\n\nBut the High Seas Treaty could take years to come into force. Sixty countries are required to ratify it; as this article was published, only 28 had done so. Processes and mechanisms are yet to be set up. And its implementation is likely to be hampered by a lack of data, disagreements about divisions of responsibilities and the perennial problems associated with multilateralism.\n\nGiven the urgency of addressing the climate and biodiversity crises, the world can’t wait another decade to fix the problems humans have created. Ocean life is too precious and important to lose, and shifts in the chemical and physical environments of the sea, once made, will be irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia.\n\nAs world ocean specialists and policymakers convene this week at the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, we make a case for permanent protection of all international ocean waters from fishing, sea-bed mining, and oil and gas exploitation.\n\nOceans store carbon and nutrients\n\nThe high seas are home to an immense diversity of wildlife, including megafauna, such as cetaceans, turtles, tuna and sharks that migrate over vast distances. They also play a crucial part in Earth’s carbon cycle, which is essential for life and the balance of gases in the atmosphere. Indeed, with an average depth of 4,100 metres, the high seas are the planet’s largest and most secure carbon sink.\n\nThe crucial role of marine life in the high seas influences the global carbon cycle through two mechanisms: the biological pump and the nutrient pump. In the biological pump, fish and invertebrates living in the twilight ‘mesopelagic’ zone (at depths of 200–1,000 metres) comprise billions of tonnes of biomass and undertake daily vertical migrations, feeding by night near the surface and returning by day to the deep, where they deposit carbon-rich faeces. Without this cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could be 200 parts per million higher, and Earth possibly 3 °C warmer, than under pre-industrial conditions1.\n\nThe nutrient pump is important because dead plants, animals and their faeces sink from shallower to deeper layers of the ocean. Much of the high seas experiences limited mixing — warmer surface waters float on top of colder, denser and darker water — so marine life in the sunlit upper 200 metres is limited by low nutrients. Marine megafauna, such as bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), dive deep to feed and return to the surface to breathe, thermoregulate or digest their prey. Faeces and urine produced near the surface transfer nutrients from deep to shallow water, boosting production of biomass, which takes up dissolved CO22.\n\nKrill fishing in the Southern Ocean.Credit: Associated Press/Alamy\n\nThis upward nutrient pump has been slowed by centuries of intensive exploitation, beginning with the whaling industry, which resulted in the collapse of cetacean populations across the entire ocean by the mid-twentieth century. Fishing of the high seas came later, beginning with Japanese long-distance tuna fisheries in the 1930s, expanding to longline fishing for billfish (Istiophoridae) and sharks in the 1950s, deep-sea bottom trawling of seamounts and continental slopes from the 1960s and 1970s, and squid ‘jigging’ (using lights to attract squid) from the 1990s.\n\nFive priorities for a sustainable ocean economy\n\nEncouraged by government subsidies3, fishing in the high seas has intensified — involving an estimated 3,500 boats in 20184. This has depleted many fished species and caused serious collateral damage to wildlife and habitats, driving iconic and vulnerable species, such as some albatrosses (Diomedeidae), oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) and leatherback turtles, to become critically endangered.\n\nPressure is now mounting to fish at greater depths, despite very limited understanding of the structure and function of deep-sea ecosystems. Although mesopelagic species are mostly small and unsuitable for direct human consumption, government- and industry-sponsored researchers are looking for new sources of fishmeal and oil to supply the burgeoning aquaculture industry.\n\nExpansion of fisheries to deeper waters could reduce the amount of carbon that the oceans take up and deplete a key source of food for species such as tuna, sharks and dolphins. For these reasons, conservationists have argued for a moratorium on fishing in the mesopelagic zone5, helping to safeguard the estimated 59% of ocean carbon sequestration that happens in the high seas6.\n\nNo need to fish in the high seas\n\nHigh-seas fisheries occur from the poles (for species such as krill, cod, Antarctic icefish and toothfish) to the tropics (for tuna, billfish, sharks and opah, for example). The devastating and poorly managed impacts of fishing were among the main motivations for the High Seas Treaty (formally known as the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement). Closing the high seas to fishing has been proposed before by academics7,8 and by a high-level panel made up of former heads of state, government ministers and policy experts9. There are compelling reasons to do so (see ‘Fishery gains’).\n\nSource: Ref. 8\n\nHigh-seas catches and profits are constrained by the sparseness of biomass in these remote regions10. This means that little of the global fish catch (less than 6%) comes from the high seas3, and most of this is destined for consumption in the high-income world. Food-security arguments, therefore, do not apply. Few countries have the capital to invest in high-seas fishing. Around 80% of the high-seas catch is landed by only six regions: the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Japan, Indonesia, Spain and South Korea3.\n\nMany of these fisheries are economically viable only because they are propped up by government subsidies. High-seas fishing generated profits of between US$3.8 billion and $5.6 billion in 2014, but with subsidies of $4.2 billion3. Costs are further ‘subsidized’ by low wages, and sometimes by forced or slave labour, with human-rights abuses prevalent.\n\nGuess how much of the ocean floor humans have explored\n\nNot fishing these remote waters would save taxpayer money and prevent publicly funded declines in endangered, threatened and protected species, as well as immense damage to the sea bed and open-water habitats. High-seas species are currently fished using destructive and polluting methods, with limited oversight, little enforcement and weak governance under international law by regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs).\n\nBy-catch, by-kill and pollution problems are often extreme. Each year, pelagic longline fisheries kill hundreds of thousands of seabirds, thousands of turtles and millions of high-seas sharks.\n\nIn the 1990s, in addition to pursuing free-swimming tuna schools, ‘purse seine’ fisheries adopted satellite-tracked drifting fish aggregation devices (dFADs), which are rafts with a net or rope structure hanging beneath. As well as tuna (mostly juveniles), the large wall of netting collects other wildlife, such as turtles, dolphins, whale sharks and manta rays, which are often killed.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2021, upwards of 120,000 dFADs were deployed annually and drifted across 37% of the ocean11. Depending on the fishery, up to 90% of dFADs are lost or abandoned at sea12. Many RFMOs have taken steps to regulate their use, but the regulations are insufficient and poorly enforced12.\n\nFrozen tuna for sale at a fish market in Tokyo.Credit: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP via Getty\n\nThe sustainability of high-seas fishing is being placed at further risk by deoxygenation from warming and stratification. The global ocean has lost around 2% of its oxygen content over the past 50–60 years13. Deep-water deoxygenation is reducing the habitat volume for oxygen-demanding species, such as sharks and tuna, pushing them closer to the surface, where they are more easily caught. Lower levels of dissolved oxygen also lead to slower growth and smaller body size, reducing productivity and reproduction14 — effects that will be amplified by interactions between fisheries, deep-sea mining, climate change and habitat destruction.\n\nClosing the high seas to fishing would support population recoveries of targeted species7. Fishers would have access to healthier, more productive stocks that spill into national waters, where they could be exploited with better governance and oversight — 98.6% of exploited high-seas fish straddle national waters8. Remote regions such as the high seas, when highly protected, generate greater conservation benefits for ocean wildlife relative to areas that are closer to humans15.\n\nFishing in national waters would be more equitable, expanding beneficiaries to include most fishing nations, many of them low- and middle-income countries. Sustainable catch volumes are potentially greater than present high-seas catches8. And population recoveries of ocean-going megafauna would help to compensate for deoxygenation-driven declines in productivity, as well as boosting the upward nutrient pump.\n\nDeep-sea mining is unnecessary",

From our canoes, small-scale fishers like me supply local markets with a steady source of food, in a context in which more than 282 million Africans face severe food insecurity. Globally, small-scale fishing supports about 500 million people.\n\nWe do not seek to dominate the seas. We seek to coexist. Small-scale fishing, with its low ecological impact, selective methods and knowledge passed down through generations, is a model of sustainability. This is a ‘blue economy’ that respects life.\n\nSmall-scale fisheries\n\nIn Senegal, fishers have voluntarily closed certain fisheries to preserve species. Fishers in Nianing stop catching octopuses for part of the year and immerse clay and shell pots in the sea to help the creatures to reproduce. Others are experimenting with community-led tracing systems. Identifying which canoes have fished, where they have fished and the species caught adds value to local products for consumers.\n\nBut our future is under threat. Industrial overfishing scrapes our sea beds; coastal urbanization eats away at our workspaces; plastic pollution invades our nets; climate change alters fish-migration routes, erodes beaches through rising seas and destroys fishing nets in storms.\n\nWomen are the heart of the sector: they process and sell the catch. Without them, there are no fish on the table. Yet, they remain invisible in public policy.\n\nI did not learn about these problems from books. I’ve lived them. I have seen canoes banned from beaches where they have historically been based. I have seen women excluded from their fish-processing sites. I have seen young people leave the trade because it lacked prospects. But I have also seen success stories: villages creating their own community fishing zones, women innovating in fish processing and young people developing mobile applications for tracking catches and fish sales.\n\nSustainable small-scale fisheries can help people and the planet\n\nEvery bit of aquatic space, every fish, every right, matters. That’s why, for more than 30 years, I have worked to defend the rights and improve the living conditions of those who rely on the sea to survive. Today, I am president of the African Confederation of Professional Organizations of Artisanal Fisheries, based in Mbour, Senegal, which links 27 organizations from 29 African countries. I also coordinate a network of small-scale fishing and aquaculture representatives — the Pan African Platform of Non-State Actors in Fisheries and Aquaculture, which is a partner in the African Union.

None of this moderated the fact that I was very surprised to see him.\n\nGrabbing my own drink, I wheeled my case over to his small marble-topped table. Outside, the lights on the station concourse winked on suddenly and cast extra light across his face. I paused, and he looked up from his phone. He smiled, the same slightly asymmetrical smile that I remembered. “John! Great to see you, it must be years!”\n\nOver a decade, probably, I thought as I shook his hand. “Longer than that, I think the Mountain View conference was our last outing …” He laughed, and looked suddenly younger. “That was a good weekend!

Credit: Artur Plawgo/Science Photo Library\n\nThe cancer cells of some men feature a striking mutation: their Y chromosome is missing altogether. Now, tantalizing research suggests that this mutation can spread ‘contagiously’ from tumour cells to immune cells, which lose their cancer-fighting prowess after their Y chromosome disappears.\n\nThe evidence for the contagion mechanism is not definitive. But the work provides strong evidence that losing the Y chromosome makes cancer cells more aggressive — and that immune cells that lack y chromosomes are less effective. These findings could explain the authors’ observation that tumours missing the Y chromosome tend to be deadlier than those retaining it. The results are published on 4 June in Nature1.\n\n“One thing is clear,” says Dan Theodorescu, a co-author of the paper and a cancer biologist at the University of Arizona, Tucson. “If you take cells and you knock out the Y chromosome, bad stuff happens.”\n\nThe question of Y\n\nScientists have known for decades that cancer cells often lose their Y chromosome, but the effects of this loss were unclear. In 2023, Theodorescu’s group showed that the Y-loss mutation raises bladder cancer’s aggressiveness in humans2. The Y chromosome can also disappear from immune cells as men age, raising the risk of death from cancer3.\n\nCancer cells ‘poison’ the immune system with tainted mitochondria\n\nTheodorescu and his team began the latest study by analysing gene-expression data from a massive repository of cancer-cell genomes. They found that men — across multiple types of cancer — died sooner if their tumours had lost their Y chromosome than men whose tumours still had it.\n\nThe group then showed that the Y-loss mutation occurs in both the cancer cells themselves and in the immune cells that invade tumours to defend the body. The mutation’s effects on gene expression indicated that, in cancer cells, it increases the number and severity of other mutations. It also causes changes that probably make the cancers less detectable by the immune system.\n\nBut the lack of a Y chromosome has a different effect on immune cells: it pushes them towards non-active and immune-suppressing states, rendering them less able to fight cancers. “If you put those two together,” says Theodorescu, “that’s really bad”.\n\nA ‘contagious’ mutation\n\nStrikingly, the researchers observed a correlation between the extent of Y loss in malignant cells and the extent of Y loss in immune cells inside the same tumour.\n\nOne possibility, says Theodorescu, is that “some weird chemoattraction” selectively draws Y-less immune cells from the blood into the tumour. The more provocative possibility is that malignant cells with the Y-loss mutation cause the same defect in nearby immune cells.",

          "abstract": "Manual reconstructions, such as this image of the extinct Australian bird Genyornis newtoni, can depict prehistoric creatures with more detail and veracity than artificial intelligence can produce, says illustrator Jacob Blokland.Credit: Jacob C. Blokland\n\nLast year, a figure generated by artificial intelligence (AI) made it past peer review despite featuring gibberish text and a rat with enormous testes1. The scientific community took to social media to pan the paper, leading the journal concerned to retract it2. Yet scientists continue to turn to bots to make cover art and figures, and professional illustrators are expressing concern over the hasty adoption of AI.\n\nJournals have different policies on publishing AI images. Owing to ethical and copyright concerns, Nature and Science do not permit them, barring specific cases, such as articles about AI. Elsevier adopts similar policies for its publications but allows AI images to be used for cover art, as long as all rights have been cleared. The American Chemical Society family of journals allows AI images in publications or cover art so long as the use of AI is explicitly acknowledged.\n\nWhen the American Chemical Society launched this policy late last year, Rita Clare, a scientific illustrator in Boston, Massachusetts, voiced her frustration on the professional-networking platform LinkedIn. Clare argued that AI images don’t succinctly or accurately communicate scientific concepts and could undermine public trust in science. She says that certain inaccuracies wouldn’t fly if they were created by a person, “but for some reason, having this sheen of fake polish that comes with AI kind of erases all of those standards”.\n\nResearchers rushing to meet a deadline might be drawn to inexpensive or free text-to-image tools, such as Midjourney or Stable Diffusion, that can swiftly produce cover art. Clare already feels the impact of AI on her career. “I’ve seen a decline in the number of people who have been reaching out to me,” she says, adding that she’s had to lower her fees to remain competitive. “It’s becoming increasingly more difficult to convince people to pay for art when they can just get it for free.”\n\nAI also affects Ella Maru’s career as a scientific illustrator. Her studio, in Charleston, South Carolina, receives artwork requests from researchers who provide AI mock-ups of what they are looking for. “We treat these the same way we handle hand-drawn sketches — they help us understand the idea, but we always draw everything from scratch,” she says. Maru isn’t nervous that AI will put illustrators out of work, because, she says, AI-generated images still don’t live up to human-made ones. “We often create images to visualize new discoveries — and those are especially hard for generative AI to capture correctly,” she says. This is partly because AI is trained on existing publications and lacks the capacity to generate depictions of new concepts.\n\nClare says that the work of professional illustrators is more likely to meet customer expectations. “I send them sketches, I take all of their ideas into account, and I try to really bring to life what they have in mind,” she says. Clare adds that it is usually obvious when scientific artwork is generated using AI, and that this undermines the value of the study. Telltale signs of an AI image include oversaturated colours, a cinematic feel or hyper-realistic details. Clare’s view is that if researchers are prepared to spend thousands of dollars submitting manuscripts to prestigious journals, they ought to invest in professional cover art, too.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nAlthough illustrators generally recommend against relying on AI for scientific artwork, some argue that it could make be a useful tool. Alexey Chizhik, a freelance scientific illustrator and a physicist at the Georg August University of Göttingen in Germany, says he sometimes cannot work out how to improve an illustration, and AI-generated images help him with brainstorming.\n\nMaru says she might consider adding AI image generators to her toolkit one day. “Right now, we avoid all AI tools in our actual illustrations to fully follow journal guidelines, but if journals create clear rules in the future and allow certain uses, we’d be happy to explore that,” she says.\n\nClare plans to avoid using AI tools altogether. She experimented with Midjourney when it first came out and included an AI-generated background of a forest in a cover image for the journal Joule. Although she liked the result at the time, looking back, “it’s pretty obvious that it’s AI-generated”, she says. “I wish that I had just taken the time to make it myself.”\n\nPrehistory and AI don’t mix\n\nAI-generated imaginings of extinct species show how training data — many of which have no basis in actual science — can lead AI astray. In 2023, science-news website Earth.com reported on the discovery of an extinct animal, Mambachiton fiandohana, and seems to have used bot-made art to depict it. The image, which more closely resembled Godzilla than a real animal, was posted on social-media platform X by the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh.\n\nThe move was widely criticized by researchers, who said the species would have more closely resembled a crocodile, as was depicted by artist and physicist Nobu Tamura in San Francisco, California.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Joel Robine/AFP via Getty\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat was a giant of the mathematical study of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Her theorem establishing the existence of solutions to Einstein’s equations is central to how mathematicians and physicists think about general relativity today, from simulating black holes to interpreting observations of gravitational waves.\n\nChoquet-Bruhat, who was born Yvonne Bruhat in Lille, France, in 1923, passed away aged 101 in Bordeaux. She grew up in an intellectual household, her mother a teacher and her father a theoretical physicist. After the family moved to Paris when she was three years old, she excelled academically and enrolled in 1943 — during German occupation — at the École Normale Supérieure des jeunes filles in the Paris suburb of Sèvres. Her adolescence was scarred by her father’s death in 1945 at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany; he had been imprisoned for refusing to give information about students involved in the resistance to Nazism.\n\nFive new ways to catch gravitational waves — and the secrets they’ll reveal\n\nAfter hesitating over whether to study medicine, physics or mathematics, it was maths that won Yvonne over. She wanted to do research, rather than go into teaching, which was more usual for women at the time. She eschewed trends in mathematics towards abstraction, preferring to stay closer to physics and her desire to understand nature. This drew her to the mathematical study of Einstein’s general relativity.\n\nNewly married (she married twice and used her married names as well as Bruhat), by 1947 she embarked on a PhD supervised by mathematical physicist André Lichnerowicz. She was mentored by Jean Leray, a towering figure in the theory of partial differential equations, who had also spent time in German captivity. Leray suggested that Yvonne attempt the ambitious problem of proving the ‘well-posedness’ of the notoriously difficult equations of Einstein’s theory. That result became the centrepiece of her thesis.\n\nGeneral relativity is governed by a set of complicated equations that were written down by Einstein in 1915 to replace Isaac Newton’s theory of gravity. The equations describe the dynamics of a 4D warped space-time geometry, curving in response to the motion of matter. In Newtonian theory, one can, in principle, completely predict the trajectories of moons, planets or stars, given their initial conditions, using Newton’s laws alone. When Einstein formulated his theory, it wasn’t at all clear that the analogous property would still hold.\n\nDo black holes explode? The 50-year-old puzzle that challenges quantum physics\n\nYvonne’s 1952 landmark paper (Y. Fourès-Bruhat Acta Math. 88, 141–225; 1952) showed precisely this. Corresponding to any initial state of the Universe, a resulting space-time geometry arises and is determined by Einstein’s equations alone. This mathematical predictability of the Universe is the well-posedness of Einstein’s theory.\n\nHer theorem also resolved another long-standing puzzle. In 1917, Einstein had recognized that his theory contained solutions in the form of waves in space-time — gravitational waves. But he wasn’t confident that these waves had any intrinsic physical meaning rather than being mere changes in co-ordinates that could propagate at arbitrary speeds. Yvonne’s theorem gives intrinsic meaning to finite propagation of gravitational waves and shows that the waves propagate at the speed of light, just like electromagnetic waves.",

These devices, developed by research teams and firms including entrepreneur Elon Musk’s Neuralink, can alter the nervous system’s activity to influence functions such as speech, touch and movement. Last month, they were the topic of a meeting in Paris, hosted by the United Nations scientific and cultural agency UNESCO, at which delegates finalized a set of ethical principles to govern neurotechnologies.\n\nThe rise of brain-reading technology: what you need to know\n\nThe recommendations focus on protecting users from technology misuse that could infringe on their human rights, including their autonomy and freedom of thought. The delegates, who included scientists, ethicists and legal specialists, decided on nine principles. These include recommendations that technology developers disclose how neural information is collected and used, and that they ensure the long-term safety of a product on people’s mental states.\n\n“This document clarifies how to protect human rights, especially in relation to the nervous system,” says Pedro Maldonado, a neuroscientist at the University of Chile in Santiago who was one of 24 experts who drafted the recommendations in 2024. The principles are not legally binding, but nations and organizations can use them to develop their own policies. In November, UNESCO’s 194 member states will vote on whether to adopt the standards.\n\nConsumer devices\n\nThe meeting considered a range of neurotechnology applications, including devices designed to be implanted into the body and non-invasive devices, which are being explored in medicine, entertainment and education.\n\nLegislation already exists for implanted brain–computer devices in regions including the United States and the European Union.\n\nThe brain-reading devices helping paralysed people to move, talk and touch\n\nBut non-medical consumer devices, such as wearables, are less regulated. These devices raise ethical concerns owing to their potential to be rapidly scaled up, says Nataliya Kosmyna, a neurotechnologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge who helped to draft the recommendations. “It’s very critical to understand the infrastructure and scalability of these devices,” she says.\n\nEach application raises specific concerns. For example, in educational settings, the delegates recommended prohibiting the use of neurotechnology to evaluate students’ or educators’ performance in ways that might enforce inequalities.\n\nAnother concern about non-invasive devices is that information such as eye movement and tone of voice could be used to infer neural data, including someone’s state of mind or brain activity. One potential application that the delegates want to govern concerns neuromarketing, whereby a person’s neural processes can be manipulated to influence decisions on commercial advertisements or political messaging. The experts were concerned that this activity could occur without proper consent when users are unaware it is happening — when they are asleep, for example.",

          "abstract": "FutureHouse researchers James Braza, Siddharth Narayanan and Andrew White (left to right).Credit: FutureHouse\n\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) tools shake up the scientific workflow, Sam Rodriques dreams of a more systemic transformation. His start-up company, FutureHouse in San Francisco, California, aims to build an ‘AI scientist’ that can command the entire research pipeline, from hypothesis generation to paper production.\n\nToday, his team took a step in that direction, releasing what it calls the first true ‘reasoning model’ specifically designed for scientific tasks. The model, called ether0, is a large language model (LLM) that’s purpose-built for chemistry, which it learnt simply by taking a test of around 500,000 questions. Following instructions in plain English, ether0 can spit out formulae for drug-like molecules that satisfy a range of criteria.\n\nWhat are the best AI tools for research? Nature’s guide\n\nEther0, which is open source and publicly available from today, joins a host of other efforts aimed at automating the scientific process, including at Google and the Japanese company Sakana AI. But unlike previous specialist models, ether0 tracks its ‘train of thought’ in natural language, providing a window into AI’s ‘black box’ and allowing it to answer questions that typically require complex reasoning. Although some general-purpose reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1, have shown improvement on standardized science tests, they have struggled to generate deep insights without targeted training.\n\nResearchers have expressed a mixture of excitement and concern about FutureHouse’s advance. “I think it’s very cool what they pulled off,” says Kevin Jablonka, a digital chemist at the University of Jena in Germany. When playing around with a preview version of ether0, Jablonka found that the model could draw meaningful inferences about chemical properties that it wasn’t trained on. “That’s impressive and [something] models before couldn’t do,” he says.\n\nAI for science\n\nThe model is the latest release from FutureHouse, which was launched in 2023 as a non-profit organization backed by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt with the mission of expediting the scientific process with AI. In the past year, the company has released an advanced scientific literature reviewer and a platform of AI agents — LLM-based tools designed for specific tasks. These agents draw from the scientific literature and deploy molecular design tools to analyse data and answer detailed questions on drug design. In May, the team announced that it had used these models to propose a new treatment1 for dry age-related macular degeneration, a major cause of blindness.\n\n“Agents are going to be really useful for finding all this stuff in literature that’s just kind of staring at us in plain sight,” says Andrew White, a chemical engineer at FutureHouse who is on sabbatical from the University of Rochester in New York. But like most LLMs, the agents are fundamentally limited by the amount of chemistry information available on the Internet. “There’s right now little real-world impact of those models in labs,” says Jablonka, who led a review published2 last month on the chemistry prowess of LLMs.\n\nFutureHouse was launched in 2023 with backing from former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt.Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty\n\nTo achieve something closer to true understanding, computer scientists have turned to ‘reasoning models’, such as the Chinese model DeepSeek-R1. These AIs are prompted to converse with themselves and show the work that led to their answers. Studies suggest that this internal dialogue seems to improve their accuracy on complex questions, leading Rodriques to suspect that they might be useful for generating new research ideas.\n\nPreviously, when leading reasoning models have taken on science problems, they’ve focused mainly on passing standardized exams with basic textbook understanding, Jablonka says. “There hasn’t been one model that’s reasoning in any useful way in chemistry so far.” FutureHouse set out to change that.\n\nThinking time\n\nFutureHouse researchers took a relatively small LLM from the French start-up firm Mistral AI, which is roughly 25 times smaller than DeepSeek-R1 — compact enough to run on a laptop. Rather than train the model on chemistry textbooks and papers, they found that they could let it learn from taking tests. To do this, White compiled lab-generated chemistry results from 45 scholarly papers, tracking properties such as molecular solubility and smell, and converted them into 577,790 verifiable questions.\n\nCan AI review the scientific literature — and figure out what it all means?\n\nThe researchers taught the base model to ‘think aloud’ by asking it to read incorrect solutions and reasoning chains generated by DeepSeek-R1. Seven versions of the model each tried to solve a specific subset of the chemistry questions, receiving reinforcement rewards for correct answers. The researchers then merged the reasoning chains from those specialist models into one generalist model. After running through the question set once more, they were left with ether0.\n\nThe team assessed ether0’s performance using a further set of questions, some of which were unrelated to those in the training set. Almost across the board, ether0 outperformed frontier models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1. For some problem types, the model more than doubled the accuracy of its competitors. And it did so for a bargain: training a similar state-of-the-art non-reasoning model to achieve comparable accuracy on reaction predictions used 50 times more data.\n\nBut because ether0 can generate solutions only in the form of molecular formulae and reactions, it’s hard to cross-check its performance against other models and humans on independent benchmarks, Jablonka says.\n\nNevertheless, Jablonka found that the model could correctly reason about molecular structures that it had not been trained on — for instance, by changing a molecule’s formula to fit a particular nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum. “I didn’t expect this,” he says.\n\nAdvances in AI could pave the way for robotic laboratories that completely automate parts of the scientific process. Credit: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nThe biggest opportunity presented by these reasoning models, Rodriques says, is that “you get to see what they are thinking throughout the entire process”. His team found that if it allowed the models to reason for longer, the responses became more accurate but less legible — mixing in different languages and inventing new words. The team decided to prioritize interpretability over accuracy by limiting the reasoning time.",

          "authors": "Virginia Gewin",
          "abstract": "Plaintiffs (L to R) Nicole Maphis, Brittany Charlton and Katie Edwards. Credit: L-R: Nicole Maphis/Andrew Flamang/Emily Seluta\n\nLawyers representing scientists are pursuing one of several court cases to reinstate US National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants terminated by the administration of US President Donald Trump on topics that it deems “unscientific” or that “no longer effectuate agency priorities”.\n\nThe plaintiffs say the “boilerplate” termination letters did not provide adequate reasoning as to how any specific study failed to meet the agency’s standards for research. The outcome is still uncertain, but a 16 June hearing is set for oral arguments on the legality of the agency’s directives to terminate the grants.\n\nThe plaintiffs include four individual researchers and three organizations with scientific members who conduct research on topics including sexual assault against women and people of colour, vaccine hesitancy, health disparities for people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+) and Alzheimer’s disease. They argue that the cancellations are unlawful for two reasons: they are arbitrary and capricious, and they violate the US Constitution’s separation of powers because they override congressional mandates on the NIH.\n\nLawyers for the researchers argued in court on 22 May for a preliminary injunction against the cancellations. At a 3 June hearing, William Young, a district judge in Massachusetts, decided to merge the researchers’ suit with another that was filed on 4 April by 16 state attorneys-general against the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH, along with its secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the NIH and its director Jay Bhattacharya, for unlawfully terminating existing grants for medical research.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs in the new challenge, epidemiologist Brittany Charlton at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, has lost five grants that supported her research on LGBTQ+ health disparities. The grants totaled US$16 million, of which at least $5 million had yet to be spent. “It had been my dream of the last 20 years, from the moment I stepped onto Harvard’s campus, to launch a centre on LGBTQ+ health, which I did last June,” she says. The vast majority of the centre was funded by her grants. “I don’t have funding to do my research anymore.”\n\nCharlton reached out to civil-rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), headquartered in New York City. Working pro bono, Protect Democracy, a non-profit organization in Washington DC that is representing the researchers, joined the ACLU, the ACLU of Massachusetts and the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit organization in Washington DC, to file the lawsuit on 2 April on the researchers’ behalf. “It was so abundantly clear that people were scared to speak out,” says Charlton. “Many of us [studying LGBTQ+ health] have been targeted our entire careers. We have gotten bomb threats in the past for the work we do. We were ready for this,” she says.\n\nYet the data are clear that LGBTQ+ health disparities exist on many levels. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data show that young LGBTQ+ people are disproportionately affected by poor mental health, suicidal behaviour, violence and sexually transmitted infections. LGBTQ+ individuals also face increased rates of discrimination and unfair treatment in health-care settings. Charlton says her yet-to-be-published research suggests that lesbian women are significantly more likely to have a stillbirth than are their heterosexual counterparts. “That research may never see the light of day because the grant is ended. That is not an efficient use of resources,” she says.\n\nCharlton’s first grant termination arrived roughly ten days after she spoke to the press about cuts to transgender-health funding. “I knew that was potentially the risk I was taking,” she says. A few days later, four more of her grants were terminated.\n\n‘This is so costly’\n\nCo-plaintiff Katie Edwards, a researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who studies violence against minority populations, including young transgender people, has lost six grants from the NIH and one from the National Science Foundation, totaling roughly $13.9 million — of which about half was lost on termination. “My research is helping us understand some of the most vulnerable people. We’re just trying to help kids be healthy and make good decisions to help themselves and others. I don’t know why that’s controversial,” she says.\n\nEdwards found that a curriculum that teaches participants how to recognize sexual-assault risk and gain self-defence knowledge dramatically improved Native American girls’ ability to thwart violence and harassment1. She has also developed an online programme for LGBTQ+ teenagers that reduced alcohol use and dating violence in this group2. “For an administration that wants to save money, this is so costly. Prevention is cost-effective,” she says. According to the CDC, the economic impact of sexual violence is around $122,000 per victim over their lifetime when accounting for lost work, health care and legal fees.\n\nEdwards has also conducted one of the largest studies so far on the public-health impact of sexual assault on men from sexual minorities, currently involving more than 3,000 participants. “We had to stop data collection and cannot analyse the data,” she says. “The whole point of the study was to inform policy.”\n\nEdwards has submitted roughly 30 grants to foundations and philanthropists in a bid to keep the research going and her 50-person staff employed. Working 15-hour days over the past 6 weeks, she’s amassed $10,000 — far short of the several million that she was awarded. \"We’ve already had to reduce a sizable fraction of my staff to part-time status, from full-time positions with benefits, as of 30 May,” she says; the vast majority will soon follow suit without more funding. Edwards is also forgoing her summer salary, which is paid from grants, to keep her team afloat.\n\n“This litigation is the only thing giving me a sense of hope. I feel so powerless,” she says of watching her career, her team and her efforts to serve communities fall apart.\n\n‘Immense bravery’",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "US President Donald Trump last week laid out one of the biggest challenges ever for NASA — to land the first humans on Mars.\n\nBut his detailed budget request for the fiscal year 2026 also proposed cancelling dozens of the space agency’s missions, including projects to study Earth, Mars and Venus. And the next day, on 31 May, Trump withdrew his nomination for NASA chief, the businessman and commercial astronaut Jared Isaacman.\n\nAll of this has left the space agency in turmoil, and the scientists who normally participate in NASA’s missions split over whether they support the push for the red planet.\n\nA budget shortfall\n\nNASA has wanted to put people on Mars for decades, but both technological and budget limitations mean that probably will not happen until the 2040s under current plans. Trump wants to accelerate that timeline. On 30 May, the White House proposed to spend some US$1 billion in 2026 on Mars plans, including research into new spacesuits and an astronaut landing system. “These investments will provide the technologies necessary for future Mars exploration and eventual crewed missions to Mars,” the NASA budget plan said.\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\n\nIf the space agency really does want to focus on sending humans to Mars, space-policy specialists say, it will need to massively ramp up its spending. A human mission to Mars is likely to cost hundreds of billions of dollars spread over a number of years; the agency currently spends $25 billion a year on all of its programmes, and Trump has proposed cutting that to under $19 billion. “Right now, with the budgets that are proposed, we can’t afford to send people to Mars,” says John Grunsfeld, an astrophysicist and former NASA astronaut who led the agency’s science programmes from 2012 to 2016.\n\nTrump’s latest rhetoric on Mars echoes decisions he made during his first term as president, when, in 2017, he announced that NASA would send astronauts back to the Moon. In 2022, the agency tested a mega-rocket that is intended to achieve that objective, but that mission, Artemis I, was uncrewed. Many technical challenges remain before people can be put on the lunar surface — a goal currently slated for 2027.\n\nOne challenge is achieving success with the giant Starship vehicle, built by the aerospace company SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. Once NASA’s mega-rocket has propelled astronauts into lunar orbit, they will rendezvous with Starship, which will fly them to the Moon’s surface. But Starship has yet to orbit Earth successfully, much less demonstrate the frequent launches and in-space refuellings needed for the Moon landing; its most recent test flight ended in an explosion on 27 May.\n\nDays after that blow-up, Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of SpaceX who has advised Trump, said he still hoped to launch the first Starship to Mars next year. Some scientists have been put off the idea of landing humans on Mars by Musk’s involvement. The technology entrepreneur has long talked of colonizing the red planet, but with little consideration of societal ethics or international norms. In recent months, he led the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the US government and slash its science funding, even as SpaceX is likely to compete for billions of dollars’ worth of government contracts on the quest for Mars.\n\nA tough environment\n\nOthers are more excited about the prospect of landing people on the red planet. NASA has overseen missions to Mars many times, sending a series of robotic spacecraft, including the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. Some researchers say that astronauts could explore more quickly and gain better insight into whether Mars has ever hosted extraterrestrial life. “If we definitively want to answer the question of whether Mars had life or has life today, I think we have to send humans,” says Tanya Harrison, a planetary scientist with the Outer Space Institute who is based in Ottawa, Canada.\n\nNASA’s Perseverance rover has drilled numerous rock cores on Mars that are now awaiting collection and delivery back to Earth.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Del-4Ri\n\nBut even those in favour caution that a journey to Mars would not only be costly — taking funding away from numerous other research programmes — but would also pose many physical risks. On the way to Mars, astronauts would face extreme isolation and higher doses of deadly space radiation over longer periods than they have ever been exposed to on the Moon or on space stations. If they were to land successfully on Mars, they would have to get out of their capsule without collapsing after the zero-gravity voyage; begin working in a frigid environment where the soil is full of toxic chemicals and there is almost no air to breathe; and deal with abrasive dust storms1.\n\nThere are solutions, such as living inside an underground lava tube that was created by volcanic activity, which could offer protection against radiation and dust storms. But visiting Mars will be like visiting Antarctica — another hostile, perilous environment — with vastly greater risks, scientists say. “I want to disabuse people of the assumptions that they have that humans are going to be fine,” Erik Antonsen, a researcher in space physiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said at conference on human space exploration on 28 May.\n\nScience at the table",

Compared with standard treatments, the immunotherapy lengthened survival of people with cancer1.\n\nThe phase II clinical trial in China tested chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in people with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer, which are solid tumours. To create CAR-T-cell therapies, T cells are collected from a person with cancer and tweaked to produce proteins that target cancer cells. The T cells are then infused back into the same person. CAR-T-cell therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but has been most successful against blood cancers.\n\n“Solid tumours generally don’t respond well to CAR-T-cell therapy,” says Lisa Mielke, a cancer researcher at the Olivia Newton John Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg, Australia. The trials are among the first in which CAR-T-cell therapy has had promising results against solid tumours. They provide “evidence that there is potential for CAR T cells to be further optimized for future treatment of patients with solid tumours”, adds Mielke.\n\nLast resort\n\nThe treatment, called satricabtagene autoleucel (satri-cel), targets CLDN18.2, a molecule expressed in large quantities in gastrointestinal tumours.\n\nThe trial included 156 participants, aged 18–75, who had received at least two unsuccessful treatments for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer and had tumour-tissue samples that were positive for CLDN18.2. Satri-cel was given to 88 people up to 3 times over the study period, along with a regimen that removed non-specific immune cells to make the treatment more effective. The remaining 52 people formed the control group, receiving standard therapies such as nivolumab, paclitaxel or rivoceranib.\n\nOf the people treated with satri-cel, 35% responded to it, compared with just 4% of people receiving standard care. Those receiving CAR-T-cell therapy also lived an average of 2.4 months longer and were 31% less likely to die than the people in the control group.",

          "abstract": "The Trump administration has issued travel restrictions for 19 countries.Credit: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nScientists have been quick to react to US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a new version of the controversial travel ban introduced during his first presidency.\n\nThe latest policy, issued on 4 June, places an indefinite ban on citizens from a dozen countries entering the United States and comes into effect on 9 June. Affected countries include those targeted by the 2017 travel bans, such as Iran and Libya, along with further countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad and Haiti. Partial restrictions on another seven countries, including Burundi, Cuba and Turkmenistan, will deny entry to all immigrants and some people visiting the United States on specific visas.\n\nKristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, says the travel restrictions will be extremely disruptive to infectious-disease research, response and collaboration. “We have multiple colleagues in the affected countries — including countries that are currently experiencing significant outbreaks and epidemics that may well evolve into larger public-health emergencies,” he says.\n\nThe travel ban will likely affect a relatively small number of students at universities in the United States, but it comes after several announcements restricting immigration for students, says a researcher at a major American university who requested anonymity to protect their institution. Last week, the administration announced it would revoke visas for Chinese students. “This feels like the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” they say. “On top of everything else, it is a question of survival for American research universities and I would not be surprised if you start to see, if this persists, universities taking some very drastic measures.” That could include institutions relocating outside the United States, they say.\n\nDisrupted projects\n\nDavid Levine, a health economist at the University of California, Berkeley, has just started a research project in Chad and is now worried about disruptions to that work. The project is looking at the distribution of oral rehydration salts, a life-saving treatment for diarrhoea. The results of that work would have direct implications for millions of children in the poorest countries around the world, he says. For now, Chad has not reciprocated with a travel ban on US citizens, but that is a risk, says Levine. Doing research in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad and Haiti is already hard, he says. “We don’t need more barriers.”\n\nIn a statement published by the White House, Trump said the travel restrictions were intended to prevent terror attacks, with the restrictions placed on each country determined by “the severity of the threat posed”. Visas already issued won’t be revoked, said the statement, and some travellers will be exempt, including those who belong to a persecuted minority group or have dual citizenship.\n\nThe administration is essentially banning the issuing of visas for workers or visitors from these countries, including scientists, says Sherwin Noorian, a US immigration lawyer at Globalised in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nOn the same day, Trump also suspended visas for all foreign nationals seeking to join Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, essentially preventing them from entering the country. The US administration is also considering revoking visas for current students at the prestigious institution. The decision was made “to safeguard national security”, according to the president’s statement. It came only weeks after the administration attempted to ban Harvard from enrolling foreign students, a move that was temporarily blocked by a judge in Massachusetts after Harvard filed a lawsuit against the government.\n\nChilling effect\n\nPedro Antonio Valdes-Sosa, a neuroscientist at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and Cuban Neuroscience Center in Chengdu, China, and co-chair of the scientific advisory board of the international Organization for Human Brain Mapping, says that given the current environment in the US, he and the organization’s other leaders are considering ceasing to hold meetings in the United States.\n\nAndersen, too, says his team has abandoned plans to host international conferences and workshops in the country.",

          "abstract": "Part of QuEra’s Aquila quantum computer.Credit: QuEra Computing Inc.\n\nSubatomic particles such as quarks can pair up when linked by ‘strings’ of force fields — and release energy when these strings are pulled to the point of breaking. Two teams of physicists have now used quantum computers to mimic this phenomenon and watch it unfold in real time.\n\nThe results, described in two Nature papers on 4 June1,2, are the latest in a series of breakthroughs towards using quantum computers for simulations that are beyond the ability of any ordinary computers.\n\n“String breaking is a very important process that is not yet fully understood from first principles,” says Christian Bauer, a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in California. Physicists can calculate the final results of particle collisions that form or break strings using classical computers, but cannot fully simulate what happens in between. The success of the quantum simulations is “incredibly encouraging”, Bauer says.\n\nString simulations\n\nEach experiment was conducted by an international collaboration involving academic researchers and corporate teams — one at QuEra, a start-up company in Cambridge, Massachusetts1, and the other at the Google Quantum AI laboratories in Santa Barbara, California2.\n\nThe researchers using QuEra’s Aquila machine encoded information in atoms that were arranged in a 2D ‘honeycomb’ pattern, each suspended in place by an individual optical ‘tweezer’. The quantum state of each atom — a ‘qubit’ which could be excited or relaxed — represented the electric field at a point in space, explains co-author Daniel González-Cuadra, a theoretical physicist now at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Madrid. In the other experiment, researchers encoded the 2D quantum field in the states of superconducting loops on Google’s Sycamore chip.\n\nQuantum-computing technology that makes qubits from atoms wins mega investment\n\nThe teams also employed diametrically opposite quantum-simulation philosophies. The atoms in Aquila were arranged so that the electrostatic forces between them mimicked the behaviour of the electric field, and continuously evolved towards their own states of lower energy — an approach called analog quantum simulation. The Google machine was instead used as a ‘digital’ quantum simulator: the superconducting loops were made to follow the evolution of the quantum field ‘by hand’, through a discrete sequence of manipulations.\n\nIn both cases, the teams set up strings in the field that effectively acted like rubber bands connecting two particles. Depending on how the researchers tuned the parameters, the strings could be stiff, wobbly or break up. “In some cases, the whole string just dissolves: the particles become deconfined,” says Frank Pollmann, a physicist at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Garching, Germany who helped to lead the Google experiment.",

          "title": "Exclusive: Inside the thriving wild-animal markets that could start the next pandemic",
          "authors": "Jane Qiu",
          "abstract": "The reporting was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center.\n\nIn the bustling Jatinegara market in Jakarta, cages are stacked three metres high, holding creatures from all corners of Indonesia and beyond. Bats, raccoon dogs, macaques and songbirds — sold as pets or food — are crammed together, their musky odours mingling with the stench of urine and faeces in the damp tropical air.\n\nFor decades, public-health experts have warned about the risks of infectious diseases jumping from animals to humans in markets such as Jatinegara, which are part of a global industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually. These markets remain “the best way of transmitting diseases”, says James Wood, a veterinary epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Jatinegara’s location, in an international travel hub with a population of 11 million people, increases that risk considerably.\n\nWill bird flu spark a human pandemic? Scientists say the risk is rising\n\nThe world is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which many researchers say probably started, or was at least amplified, at a market selling live animals in Wuhan, China1,2. Yet the wildlife trade still thrives in many parts of the globe. China banned the farming and trading of most wildlife species for food in 2020, but these practices have simply gone underground. “We are back to business as usual,” says Vincent Nijman, a conservation biologist at Oxford Brookes University, UK, with “millions and millions of animals being traded on a daily basis”.\n\nThe wildlife trade acts as a vast global network of unregulated natural laboratories, through which potential pathogens freely circulate, evolve and ultimately congregate in urban centres, says Andrew Cunningham, a wildlife epidemiologist at the Institute of Zoology in London. “It’s the scariest thing we are doing,” he says.\n\nBefore the pandemic, there was a strong emphasis on identifying new viruses in the wild. These efforts were driven by the idea that it might be possible to predict which viruses could spark major disease outbreaks. But many researchers now say that this assumption was flawed.\n\nIncreasingly, scientists are looking to human–wildlife interfaces — including markets and the trade networks that supply them — as crucial sites for the study of zoonoses, human diseases caused by pathogens that normally infect other species. A handful of research groups are now working to understand how pathogens jump between species, why some jumps cause outbreaks and others don’t, and what kinds of intervention can reduce the risks. But such work is costly, can be dangerous and demands sustained support, which has become increasingly hard to secure.\n\nWithout investing in such research, “you’re really flying blind”, says Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the emerging diseases and zoonoses unit at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. “You’re making recommendations that may not be the most appropriate.”\n\nPoster child\n\nIn the veterinary room of Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam, Tran Nam Trieu carefully lifts a Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) onto an examination table. The creature is curled into a ball, its scales subtly rising and falling with each breath. Confiscated near the border with China in early 2023, it is now in the care of Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, a non-profit conservation organization that runs a rescue centre at the park. Delicately unrolling it, Trieu, a veterinary surgeon, reveals its soft pink belly and the wound from an amputation; its left hind leg was damaged in a snare.\n\nThe enormous demand in China for pangolin meat and scales — believed, without evidence, to cure a wide range of ailments — has made these creatures the poster child of the illegal wildlife trade. And studies of confiscated pangolins in China have detected several types of coronavirus that share up to 92% of their genome with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-193. Although too distantly related to have given rise to SARS-CoV-2, the viruses sometimes cause COVID-19-like symptoms in these animals and might have the potential to infect humans.\n\nOther coronaviruses found in these pangolins are relatives of those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The virus spike proteins have a feature known as a furin cleavage site4, thought to be crucial for the viruses to replicate efficiently in the respiratory tract. The presence of a similar feature in SARS-CoV-2 has contributed to the suspicion that the virus might have been engineered by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology — although it could also have arisen naturally.\n\nA live pangolin seized by the Malaysian wildlife department was probably on its way to a market in China.Credit: Bazuki Muhammad BM/JS via Reuters\n\nWood recognizes the “small possibility” that research-associated activities could have triggered the pandemic. But that “should not prevent us from focusing on the bigger picture”, he says: the wildlife trade poses a much greater zoonotic risk than do lab accidents.\n\n25 million deaths: what could happen if the US ends global health funding\n\nTo gauge those risks, Nguyen Thi Thanh Nga, a researcher at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Hanoi, and her colleagues are working to identify potential pathogens circulating in trafficked pangolins in Vietnam — a major transit hub for moving wildlife into China — and exploring how these microorganisms relate to those found in source and destination countries. Of 246 pangolins confiscated across Vietnam between 2015 and 2018 — many from the rescue centre in Cuc Phuong — 7 were infected with coronaviruses, although none had signs of respiratory or other systemic illnesses5. Partial sequences of these viruses closely resemble those of viruses found in pangolins seized in China.\n\nPangolins further upstream in the supply chain, however, seemed unaffected: none of the 334 pangolins confiscated from smugglers or rescued from the wild in Malaysia between 2009 and 2019 tested positive for coronaviruses6.\n\nThe increasing detection rate of coronaviruses along the supply chain is consistent with another study by WCS researchers, on rats captured and sold for food in Vietnam7. The team found that the proportion of rats that tested positive for coronaviruses was tenfold higher at the markets and restaurants where they’re sold than in the fields where they’re caught.\n\nTrade routes\n\nSome researchers are working to get a better handle on the human behaviours that help zoonotic viruses to thrive and spread. In 2017, Jusuf Kalengkongan, a behavioural scientist and founder of the Sulawesi Bat Conservation organization in Airmadidi, Indonesia, spent months living among wildlife hunters in villages in the province of Southeast Sulawesi. Capturing and handling bats can be dangerous work, he says, and some hunters develop fevers when wounds from a scratch or bite become infected. Rather than seeking hospital care, they typically take herbs and over-the-counter medications, he says. Village elders recalled a mysterious disease outbreak in which dozens of people died in a few weeks, Kalengkongan says.\n\nHung Nguyen-Viet, an animal-health specialist at the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, is leading a similar project in Vietnam. Researching trade networks, he says, is sensitive work that requires significant trust-building. A key question his team seeks to answer is: what do people do when the wild animals they capture fall ill? Some people choose to eat them, whereas others try to sell them to unsuspecting customers at a market far away, says Nguyen-Viet. Few, he says, would report it to the authorities, for fear of consequences to their livelihoods.\n\nFur farming a ‘viral highway’ that could spark next pandemic, say scientists\n\nMedical anthropologist Hannah Brown at the University of Durham, UK, says that attempts to regulate the wildlife trade need to take these fears seriously, or risk pushing the activity further underground. This happened when the consumption of wild-animal meat was banned in West Africa during the 2014–16 Ebola epidemic, which was suspected — but never proved — to have been caused by the eating of bats. Ten years on, says Brown, people there are still negatively affected by the policy and remain suspicious of the authorities and international researchers.\n\nSome scientists have managed to cultivate the trust of wildlife traders in Indonesia. At the Langowan market in North Sulawesi, which sells both wild-animal meat and live animals, Tiltje Ransaleleh asks vendors about their supplies, the species they’ve sold and their origins. Beneath a canopy of red fabric that wards off the tropical Sun, Ransaleleh, a zoologist at Sam Ratulangi University in Manado, Indonesia, and her colleagues collect swab samples from bats lining the wooden stalls.\n\nHer team has mapped an intricate network of supply chains and identified the intermediaries — who purchase wild animals (including up to one million bats a year) from hunters and transport them to markets — as a potential vehicle for disease transmission8. One insight gleaned, she says, is that festive periods are the riskiest, when sales can surge to 5 times their usual volume, with more than 10,000 bats sold in a single day at Langowan.\n\nSea change\n\nThese in-depth studies of trade networks and human behaviour are essential for tracking the movement of wild animals and the potential pathogens they carry, says Stephen Luby, a disease ecologist at Stanford University in California.",

          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "Some websites have been overwhelmed by the sheer volume of bot traffic. Credit: Marco VDM/Getty\n\nIn February, the online image repository DiscoverLife, which contains nearly three million photographs of different species, started to receive millions of hits to its website every day — a much higher volume than normal. At times, this spike in traffic was so high that it slowed the site down to the point that it became unusable. The culprit? Bots.\n\nThese automated programs, which attempt to ‘scrape’ large amounts of content from websites, are increasingly becoming a headache for scholarly publishers and researchers who run sites hosting journal papers, databases and other resources.\n\nOpen-source AI chatbots are booming — what does this mean for researchers?\n\nMuch of the bot traffic comes from anonymized IP addresses, and the sudden increase has led many website owners to suspect that these web-scrapers are gathering data to train generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as chatbots and image generators.\n\n“It’s the wild west at the moment,” says Andrew Pitts, the chief executive of PSI, a company based in Oxford, UK, that provides a global repository of validated IP addresses for the scholarly communications community. “The biggest issue is the sheer volume of requests” to access a website, “which is causing strain on their systems. It costs money and causes disruption to genuine users.”\n\nThose that run affected sites are working on ways to block the bots and reduce the disruption they cause. But this is no easy task, especially for organizations with limited resources. “These smaller ventures could go extinct if these sorts of issues are not dealt with,” says Michael Orr, a zoologist at the Stuttgart State Museum of Natural History in Germany.\n\nA flood of bots\n\nInternet bots have been around for decades, and some have been useful. For example, Google and other search engines have bots that scan millions of web pages to identify and retrieve content. But the rise of generative AI has led to a deluge of bots, including many ‘bad’ ones that scrape without permission.\n\nThis year, the BMJ, a publisher of medical journals based in London, has seen bot traffic to its websites surpass that of real users. The aggressive behaviour of these bots overloaded the publisher’s servers and led to interruptions in services for legitimate customers, says Ian Mulvany, BMJ’s chief technology officer.\n\nSocial scientists battle bots to glean insights from online chatter\n\nOther publishers report similar issues. “We’ve seen a huge increase in what we call ‘bad bot’ traffic,” says Jes Kainth, a service delivery director based in Brighton, UK, at Highwire Press, an Internet hosting service that specializes in scholarly publications. “It’s a big problem.”\n\nThe Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) reported in April that more than 90% of 66 members it surveyed had experienced AI bots scraping content from their sites — of which roughly two-thirds had experienced service disruptions as a result. “Repositories are open access, so in a sense, we welcome the reuse of the contents,” says Kathleen Shearer, COAR’s executive director. “But some of these bots are super aggressive, and it’s leading to service outages and significant operational problems.”\n\nTraining data\n\nOne factor driving the rise in AI bots was a revelation that came with the release of DeepSeek, a Chinese-built large language model (LLM). Before that, most LLMs required a huge amount of computational power to create, explains Rohit Prajapati, a development and operations manager at Highwire Press. But the developers behind DeepSeek showed that an LLM that rivals popular generative-AI tools could be made with many fewer resources, kick-starting an explosion of bots seeking to scrape the data needed to train this type of model.",

          "abstract": "Religious monuments in China have provided a refuge for ancient trees for thousands of years, including dozens of endangered species and some that are extinct in the wild, a study of nearly 50,000 trees has found.\n\nThe findings, published on 4 June in Current Biology1, highlight how cultural and religious traditions can preserve biodiversity and could help scientists to develop strategies for conserving rare species.\n\nIt is an example of “where ecological and spiritual values converge”, says study co-author Yongchuan Yang, a conservation researcher at the College of Environment and Ecology at Chongqing University in China. Several species, including Ginkgo biloba, are sacred in Buddhism and Taoism, and have been protected from human activities that have led to a decline in tree numbers outside temple walls.\n\nSacred sanctuaries\n\nYang and his colleagues used national inventories to compile a database of 46,966 trees that are more than a century old and are present in human-dominated landscapes, including 5,125 Buddhist and 1,420 Taoist temples. Of the 534 species represented, 61 are classed as threatened — these threatened species accounted for nearly 6,000 trees on the list. Moreover, eight tree species were found only on temple grounds.\n\nBuildings surround a majestic gold-leaved Ginkgo Biloba at the Gu Guanyin Buddhist Temple in China’s Zhongnan Mountains.Credit: Imaginechina Limited/Alamy\n\nThe researchers found that the density of ancient trees inside the temples was more than 7,000 times higher than those outside temples and in the wild. Trees at temple sites are also older than those outside them, with a mean age of 261 years compared with 203 years. Some of the trees growing on temple grounds had been there for 2,000 years. These trees have important ecological roles, the scientists say: they contribute to nutrient recycling, provide habitats for animals and insects and increase biodiversity.",

Such carbon is cycled swiftly into soils as litter and root detritus, broken down by microorganisms into smaller organic fragments and CO2, and ultimately carried by water through the ‘veins’ of the landscape into rivers3–5.

          "title": "A message from island leaders: protect the Pacific Ocean from deep-sea mining",
          "authors": "Moetai Brotherson, Surangel Whipps Jr",
          "abstract": "The Pacific Ocean’s seabed is rich in critical metals such as cobalt and nickel. Yet deep-sea mining of these materials, which are used in many technologies, threatens the region. If mining goes ahead, irreversible environmental harm, risks to ocean health and climate stability, as well as uncertain economic gains and geopolitical tensions, would destabilize this peaceful ‘ocean continent’ — known as the Blue Pacific.\n\nAs leaders of two Pacific island nations, Palau and Mā’ohi Nui–French Polynesia, we bear a profound responsibility to help protect this ocean. Our countries have combined national waters, known as exclusive economic zones (EEZs), spanning more than 5.3 million square kilometres, or 4% of the world’s total EEZ area. Beyond being a resource and crucial part of the planet, the ocean is deeply interwoven with the spiritual identity and cultural heritage of our communities. It is the cradle of life, deserving of respect and protection. This sacred connection, and more, compels us as collective stewards to oppose the intensifying global interest in ocean mining.\n\nWhy we should protect the high seas from all extraction, forever\n\nInternational consortia and state-backed enterprises are exploring deposits of polymetallic nodules, cobalt-rich crusts and sea-floor sulfides. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) in Kingston, Jamaica, has already issued more than 30 exploration contracts to 22 bodies, with almost two-thirds (61%) of these contracts linked to high-income countries. For Pacific nations hosting some of Earth’s richest metal deposits, valued in the trillions of dollars, the issue is urgent. Although several Pacific states are considering deep-sea mining in their EEZs, hoping for economic benefits, many Pacific communities remain strongly opposed.\n\nHere, we argue that ocean health and climate protection must outweigh risky short-term extraction. Pacific deep-sea mining must not advance without clear evidence of no irreversible harm1. Economic volatility, limited local benefits, devastating ecological impacts and climate risks represent unacceptable threats. Instead, we urge Pacific nations and the international scientific community to support sustainable ocean economies, innovation, cultural integrity and responsible global stewardship for future generations.\n\nQuestionable economic benefits\n\nProponents often portray deep-sea mining as an engine for economic development in the Pacific, promising revenues, jobs and infrastructure. But that won’t necessarily be the case. Economic considerations alone provide sufficient grounds for extreme caution.\n\nThe metals mined in deep seas — particularly cobalt, nickel, copper and manganese — are often subject to drastic and unpredictable price swings. And increased metal supply from deep-sea mining could depress global prices of these minerals, as happened in the 1970s2. Future demand also remains uncertain owing to rapid advancements in recycling and alternative materials.\n\nI’ve witnessed the wonders of the deep sea. Mining could destroy them\n\nDeep-sea mining’s capital-intensive nature requires small, specialized crews, limiting local employment opportunities because of the scarcity of relevant expertise in Pacific island nations. Training programmes, such as those proposed by the Cook Islands, might prove less effective at job creation than would investments in other sectors, such as coastal tourism or fisheries, which rely more heavily on local skills and employ more people per dollar invested.\n\nDeep-sea mining might yield minimal fiscal returns for Pacific nations. In international waters (the high seas), mining royalties must be shared among all ISA member states, drastically reducing any single country’s benefit. In national jurisdictions, anticipated taxes and royalties are likely to be modest, and are often weakened by inadequate fiscal regimes and investor-friendly agreements — some of which even waive corporate income taxes entirely for operators3.\n\nHurdles include adequate governance and sufficient institutional capacity, as highlighted in the 2024 Columbia University Capstone Report that assessed deep-sea mining around Mā’ohi Nui4. And governments would face costs as well as risks. Oversight and environmental monitoring require substantial public expenditure on regulatory capacity, scientific assessments and enforcement5. In the case of an environmental disaster or the mining company going bankrupt, the country might have to shoulder liabilities or clean-up costs.\n\nFor example, in 2019, Papua New Guinea’s government lost its entire investment of US$120 million to secure a 15% stake in a deep-sea mining project, Solwara 1, when the Canadian company behind it, Nautilus Minerals, went bankrupt. The resulting debt amounted to around 10% of the country’s 2019 budget deficit.\n\nNature collection: The ocean in humanity’s future\n\nEconomic risks would persist even if deep-sea mining took off. For instance, a sudden increase in resource production might prompt an appreciation in the value of the local currency and domestic inflation, which would undermine other export industries. A mining boom would draw labour, capital, attention and investments away from other industries that are crucial to many Pacific economies, such as tourism, fisheries and agriculture.\n\nSimilarly to oil-production operations that are dependent on volatile prices, deep-sea mining could quickly become economically unfeasible amid falling prices or rising environmental costs. Expanded mining operations could trigger intensified international competition, leading to a damaging race to the bottom. Declining global commodity prices would destabilize economies that are overly reliant on mining revenues. Governments might feel forced to deregulate environmental and labour standards to remain economically viable.\n\nIrreversible environmental harms\n\nThe deep sea, a vast wilderness of unique biodiversity, performs crucial planetary functions that are not fully understood. The case of the island of Nauru highlights the dangers of resource depletion and mismanagement: decades of intensive phosphate mining in its interior brought temporary wealth, but ultimately led to environmental degradation, economic hardship and public-health crises that affect Nauruans to this day.\n\nThe impacts of deep-sea mining extend far beyond the seabed, spreading through the water column and currents, potentially affecting fisheries, marine mammals and neighbouring jurisdictions. Whether extracting polymetallic nodules from sea-floor sediments or mining hydrothermal vents, operations risk extensive and irreversible habitat destruction.\n\nA rare species of Pacific octopus (left); a mushroom coral amid cobalt-rich deposits (centre) and an Iridogorgia spiral coral.Credit: Left and right, ROV SuBastian/Schmidt Ocean Institute; centre, Christopher Kelley/NOAA\n\nHydrothermal vent fields in regions such as the Manus Basin (off Papua New Guinea) and the Lau Basin (near Tonga) host unique, endemic species, including specialized shrimp, snails and tubeworms. Although commercial mining has not yet begun in these regions, alteration of these isolated habitats will inevitably lead to biodiversity loss. This could disrupt marine food webs and ecosystem functions that are crucial to fisheries and Pacific communities. Studies show that even experimental disturbances result in incomplete ecological recovery after decades6.\n\nSediment plumes from mining operations are a big concern, because they can drift across hundreds of kilometres for decades, smothering organisms and degrading water quality7. These plumes can cross national jurisdictions and diminish catch rates or contaminate seafood, potentially affecting fishing grounds that are crucial for coastal communities and threatening food security. Pelagic ecosystems, which are essential for migratory species such as tuna and whales, plankton and those in the broader marine food web, would also be at risk8.\n\nNoise and artificial light from mining machinery can disorient marine life and disrupt crucial processes, such as bioluminescence and vertical migrations, that are essential for nutrient cycling. These disturbances threaten commercially valuable fish populations, particularly tuna, through impaired respiration, bioaccumulation of metals and disruptions to reproduction and to feeding (including hunting difficulties caused by plumes)9.\n\nGeopolitical risks\n\nThe widespread impacts of deep-sea mining will create legal and geopolitical challenges. Neither the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea nor the ISA has a robust international mechanism by which to assign liability effectively and provide compensation for damage arising from mining activities10.\n\nTo save the high seas, plan for climate change\n\nIf pollution from high-seas mining affects fisheries or reefs in another nation’s territory, there is no clear recourse. A case in point is the 2009 Montara oil spill. Originating from a rig in Australian waters, the spill reached Indonesian waters, leading to claims of damage to fisheries and coastal livelihoods there. This underscores the urgent need for pre-emptive legal clarity before deep-sea mining operations commence.\n\nLarge-scale mining also introduces security and monitoring challenges across vast maritime areas. Addressing these pressures demands unwavering regional unity and a cautious approach that prioritizes long-term Pacific well-being. Pacific nations have strengthened their collaboration through the Blue Pacific approach, which has reimagined our maritime territories as an interconnected ‘ocean continent’ to foster collective identity and unified action.\n\nPractically, this translates into stronger joint advocacy in global forums on climate action, fisheries management and marine conservation. It also enables shared strategies for resource management and maritime security, aiding cooperation while respecting diverse national approaches in this common regional vision.\n\nClimate regulation disruption\n\nAn alarming, poorly understood risk is the potential of deep-sea mining to disrupt the ocean’s role in climate regulation as the largest carbon sink. Disturbing the sea bed can release carbon or methane that have been stored in sediments for millennia11, potentially exacerbating climate change and ocean acidification.\n\nAt experimental mining sites, more than two decades after simulated disturbance, sea-floor fauna remained depleted12, microbial communities were impaired and both groups showed a reduced capacity for carbon processing.\n\nA coastal village in Papua New Guinea. The country lost US$120 million on a failed deep-sea mining project.Credit: Joerg Boethling/Alamy\n\nFor low-lying Pacific islands, these risks are existential. Communities are already confronting the severe realities of climate change. In Palau, for instance, rising sea levels are not an abstract threat but a present danger, forcing coastal communities to watch as their homes are inundated, crucial freshwater sources are contaminated by saltwater intrusion and ancestral burial grounds become vulnerable. Intensified storms such as Typhoon Haiyan, which brought widespread devastation to Palau, increasingly threaten homes, infrastructure such as hospitals and schools, and the safety of our people.\n\nFurthermore, extensive coral bleaching events, driven by warming seas, decimate the reefs that are fundamental to Palauan livelihoods, leading to declining fish catches that underpin our food security and local economies. Bleaching also weakens the natural coastal defences that protect our islands. Any activity, such as deep-sea mining, that further destabilizes the climate system is therefore unacceptable11,12.",

          "authors": "Farhan M. Asrar",
          "abstract": "Space exploration is entering a new era. NASA’s Artemis programme, and related Artemis Accords (an international cooperation involving more than 50 nations), aims to take humans to the Moon as soon as 2026 and, eventually, to Mars. China plans to send its own crewed missions to the Moon by 2030 and to build a lunar base.\n\nMissions involving public–private partnerships are also transforming the space sector1. For example, in 2024, Polaris Dawn, a private mission by space-technology firm SpaceX, saw US entrepreneur Jared Isaacman — who is nominated for the role of NASA administrator — and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis become the first civilians to perform a spacewalk. But there are many challenges ahead. Assuring astronauts’ health is one.\n\nEthics in outer space: can we make interplanetary exploration just?\n\nHumans are building a future in space. But we are not built for space. Even the most fit and healthy person can find space disabling2.\n\nOutside Earth’s protective atmosphere, the human body is subjected to high levels of radiation. According to the European Space Agency, an astronaut travelling to Mars would receive the equivalent of one year’s exposure to radiation on Earth for each day of their months-long journey. This would be likely to increase astronauts’ risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, for instance3.\n\nMoreover, the combination of radiation and time spent in microgravity can cause a range of health conditions. Weight-bearing bones lose, on average, around 1% of their mineral density per month during space flight4, increasing the risk of fractures. Fluid shifts in the eyes can increase pressure and affect vision5. There’s even an increased risk of kidney-related illnesses6.\n\nOn top of the physical hurdles is the possibility that the isolation will affect astronauts’ mood and productivity, taking a toll on their mental health.\n\nAs humanity sets its eyes on the Moon and Mars, these and other challenges must be addressed using innovative technology and research2,7,8. Such innovations should also benefit people on Earth. Here are four key strands of space medicine and health research that, in my view, are both crucial for mission success and likely to improve human health more broadly.\n\nRemote health care\n\nTelemedicine is integral to human space flight, allowing physicians to remotely monitor and support the mental and physical well-being of astronauts through telecommunications technologies7,8.\n\nHowever, because deep-space missions focus on travelling huge distances, telecommunication delays can introduce potentially life-threatening waits — for instance, it can take 20 minutes each way for astronauts on Mars to receive medical advice from Earth. That’s a long time if, say, someone has a heart attack and the crew needs support to treat them.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) applications are being developed to help astronauts to get medical support quickly — similar to how AI-driven medical diagnosis and advice technologies can aid physicians and patients on Earth. This would help to make health care in space autonomous. But using AI in space brings operational challenges. Who will fix the system if it breaks, for instance, and how can a device be updated during a mission to keep pace with emerging medical knowledge and guidelines and the crew’s changing needs.\n\nResearchers test the solar array of NASA’s BioSentinel spacecraft.Credit: Dominic Hart/ARC/NASA\n\nEnsuring that adequate medications are available is another big challenge, especially for long missions. One study found that, on the International Space Station (ISS), each crew member studied had taken an average of four routine drugs a week9 — such as analgesics for pain relief and headaches, sleeping aids10 and decongestants. Essential medicines, including antibiotics and drugs to treat cardiac emergencies, are also stocked on board.\n\nHowever, according to one estimate11, more than half of the medications on the ISS have a shelf life of less than three years, and some expire in less than two. That’s too short for a crewed mission to Mars, which would last at least three years. Between 60% and 98% of the medications could expire before a Mars mission’s end11. Resupplying drugs across such huge distances is unfeasible.\n\nIs there life on Mars? What a cave on Earth can teach us\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has demonstrated that — on Earth — medications can be effective for years after their expiry dates12. However, taking drugs past their expiry date can be risky and their effectiveness can diminish. Their strength can decrease, their chemical composition might change and there’s a risk of bacterial growth (see go.nature.com/4mkqbeb). Moreover, many pharmaceutical ingredients degrade under extreme conditions, such as radiation13.\n\nSome evidence suggests that storing medicines at their optimal temperature and preventing exposure to light and heat can extend the period during which they are effective12. But with this research having been conducted on Earth, it’s not clear whether the same applies to space.\n\nEven recommended doses might change in space. One study exploring the use of sleep medications on the ISS and in space shuttles, for instance, noted that in 17–19% of cases in which an astronaut took a sleep drug, a second dose was taken on the same night10. Whether this was attributable to the small number of astronauts studied, a difference in the way the medicines degraded over time or something else remains unclear.\n\nResearchers thus need to establish what the optimal dose and storage conditions of drugs are and ascertain medicines’ rates of degradation in space — findings that could also help to improve medications on Earth. Similarly, medical technologies developed for space or using space know-how can be adapted for use on Earth. Cardiovascular surgeon Michael DeBakey’s left ventricular assist device — a titanium pump used to keep blood flowing in people with heart conditions awaiting transplants — is one such space-technology spin-off. The design was honed in collaboration with NASA engineers using simulations of fluid flow similar to those moving through rocket engines.\n\nMental health\n\nEnsuring the crew’s mental health is a concern for any space mission, from a stint on the ISS to a long-term trip to Mars, with crew confined to limited quarters, few companions and communication delays that restrict conversations with loved ones. Fatigue and disturbed sleep — brought about by stress, noise, being away from home and sleeping in an unusual environment — are common in space and could exacerbate mental-health problems. In any extreme environment, the whole crew might be affected, as illustrated by reports in March that a researcher stationed at a remote base in Antarctica threatened to kill colleagues.\n\nThe crew members of the Polaris Dawn were the first civilians to perform a spacewalk.Credit: UPI/Alamy\n\nOver decades of supporting astronauts, NASA and other space agencies have accumulated expertise around mental health in extreme environments involving isolation and confinement — knowledge that has proved invaluable to resolve crises on Earth. For example, the Chilean government reached out to NASA for guidance and support in 2010 during the efforts to rescue 33 Chilean miners trapped and isolated underground8.\n\nEarth-based analogue missions — which simulate the challenges of being in space — can help researchers to anticipate the issues that might arise from isolation and confinement. Other lessons can be learnt once astronauts have established themselves on the lunar surface and in orbit around the Moon, offering further opportunities to prepare for going to Mars.\n\nResearch is needed to find ways to improve mental health in space. For example, the European Space Agency is testing initiatives such as a lighting system to maintain more-conventional circadian rhythms, exploring how daily circadian rhythms change during long space missions and using virtual-reality headsets to provide astronauts with mental relaxation.\n\nFood production\n\nSystems for producing food sustainably are needed for deep-space missions. Travel to Mars could take between seven and ten months, making it impractical to rely solely on food shipped from Earth.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Credit: Life on white/Alamy\n\nMale mouse fetuses can develop female organs in utero if their mother is iron deficient during pregnancy, a study in Nature reports1.\n\nThis is the first-known example of a dietary mineral affecting sex determination, says Vincent Harley, a molecular geneticist at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia. This “presents an exciting new area of study”, he adds.\n\nIn mammals, biological sex is initially determined primarily by chromosomes — females typically have XX chromosomes whereas males typically have XY ones — and a primary gene then usually triggers formation of the corresponding sexual organs. For instance, mice with XY chromosomes usually develop testes if a gene called Sry is activated and ovaries if it is not.\n\nThe researchers behind this latest study had previously shown that Sry is activated by an enzyme called histone demethylase2, which needs iron to function, says co-author Makoto Tachibana, an epigeneticist at Osaka University in Japan. The team speculated that altering how iron is metabolized by cells could affect histone demethylase activity, which would in turn alter Sry expression.\n\nIron-deficient diet\n\nTachibana and his colleagues conducted a series of experiments to test the theory. First, they gave mice an iron-deficient diet for a month before pregnancy, and for two weeks during pregnancy, and compared them with mice that were fed a control diet. The levels of haemoglobin and red blood cells were lower among iron-deficient mice than in the control-diet mice. The embryos also showed signs of anaemia, but had the sexual characteristics expected from the genes.\n\nWhen the team repeated the experiment with embryos that had a genetic susceptibility to compromised histone demethylation, 2 of 43 XY offspring carried by iron-deficient mothers developed female-typical sex organs. All the control mice grew sex organs typical of their chromosomes.\n\nTo test the effect of iron deficiency that isn’t caused by diet, the researchers gave pregnant mice an oral iron chelator — molecules that bind to iron and reduce its levels in the body — between days six and ten of embryonic development, when sexual determination typically occurs. The 72 embryos from these mice, which all had XY chromosomes, showed signs of anaemia. Four were born with two ovaries and one with one ovary and one testis.",

          "title": "Skyrocketing mpox outbreak in Sierra Leone raises fears of wider spread",
          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "A surge of mpox infections in the small African nation of Sierra Leone has pummelled the country’s health-care system, raising the possibility that the virus will spread to neighbouring countries and spark a larger outbreak throughout the densely populated region of West Africa.\n\nSierra Leone has confirmed 15 deaths and more than 3,000 mpox infections — more than half of all new infections for Africa — over the past month. According to an analysis of 76 viral genomes posted on the discussion forum Virological.org on 28 May, the outbreak began in November. The work also suggests that there have been at least four times more infections than officials have reported, says Edyth Parker, a genomic epidemiologist at the Institute of Genomics and Global Health in Ede, Nigeria, who is a co-author.\n\n“The situation is so dire — the number of cases keeps increasing rapidly,” says Jia Kangbai, an infectious-diseases epidemiologist at Njala University in Freetown, Sierra Leone. “Things are getting very challenging now.”\n\nA surge in cases\n\nThe virus that causes mpox can lead to painful, fluid-filled lesions on the skin, and produce fever and, in severe cases, death. The virus, which is thought to persist in some wild rodent species, is endemic in several African countries, including Sierra Leone, and occasionally spills into people.\n\nHealth officials have been on high alert for surges of the virus that causes mpox ever since it spread to regions that it had never reached before, causing a global outbreak of the disease in 2022. That outbreak, which continues today at a slower pace, has infected more than 100,000 people, mainly men who have sex with men.\n\nThe virus that causes mpox (pink) is shown infecting a cell (green) in this colourized electron microscope image.\n\nBut the boom in infections in Sierra Leone has virologists worried once again: the country has reported a near-exponential growth in mpox cases that seem to be spreading from person to person, mainly among young people, both men and women. Epidemiological data suggest that sexual contact is a driver of the outbreak, because several sex workers have been infected and many people have reported genital lesions, according to a 27 May study posted on the preprint server medRxiv ahead of peer review1.\n\nThe surge in cases, which has been concentrated in Sierra Leone’s capital city of Freetown, is fuelled by the same strain, clade IIb, that caused the global outbreak, according to the Virological.org analysis. This shows that when mpox is “put into a densely populated area where you have these dense sexual networks, it can take off very easily”, says Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who co-authored the medRxiv preprint.\n\nThe number of reported infections is likely to continue increasing sharply, because Sierra Leone’s health-care system lacks the capacity to curb the outbreak, Kangbai says. He adds that the country is entering its rainy season, meaning that more people will congregate indoors, creating more opportunities for the virus to spread.\n\nA lack of aid\n\nThis outbreak comes as several African countries continue to battle their own mpox outbreaks, putting pressure on resources across the continent. A concerning strain of the virus, called clade Ib, has gained the ability to spread through sexual contact, causing a boom in infections across Central Africa, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), since 2024.\n\nMonkeypox virus: dangerous strain gains ability to spread through sex, new data suggest",

          "abstract": "The ExoMars mission’s Rosalind Franklin rover (artist’s impression) will carry a drill to search for signs of ancient life on Mars.Credit: Adrian Mann/Stocktrek Images via Alamy\n\nEurope’s beleaguered ExoMars rover is one of several international collaborations whose future looks bleak owing to unprecedented cuts to US science funding proposed by US President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nLast year, NASA agreed to provide both launch and landing gear for ExoMars’s Rosalind Franklin rover after the European Space Agency (ESA) cut ties with its former partner, the Russian space agency Roscosmos, over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The rover is designed to hunt for ancient life on the red planet.\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\n\nBut Trump’s proposed budget for NASA for fiscal year 2026 — published on 30 May — would slash to zero the US contributions to ExoMars, as part of a cut of almost 50% to NASA’s science division, compared with 2024 levels.\n\nOther ESA missions that could lose US contributions include ARIEL, a space telescope scheduled to launch in 2029 that is designed to study the atmosphere of exoplanets; LISA, a space-based gravitational-wave detector set to fly in 2035; and Envision, a spacecraft planned to head to Venus in the 2030s. The proposal would also cut all US funding to Euclid, an ESA probe already in space monitoring dark energy.\n\nIn a statement to Nature, ESA said that the agency is “in discussions with NASA” and “analysing the potential implications” of the budget proposals with its member states, which will discuss potential action and alternative scenarios at an ESA Council meeting on 11 and 12 June.\n\n“We can only hope that these proposed budget cuts never come to pass,” says Leigh Fletcher, a planetary scientist at the University of Leicester, UK. “But either way, it may take time to recover from the erosion of trust between agencies after these proposals.”\n\nLarge cuts likely\n\nTrump’s budget proposal is just a starting point for negotiations in the US Congress, which will ultimately decide how to allocate the federal budget.\n\nIn the past, a call to slash funding for science would have been robustly rejected, but “that is not true at the moment”, says Michael Lubell, a physicist who tracks science policy at the City University of New York. Although Congress might soften the cuts, they are still likely to be large, he says. The president’s strategy to put “America first” could play against international projects, Lubell adds.\n\nTrump moves to slash NSF: why are the proposed budget cuts so big?\n\nThe budget also includes large cuts to the US National Science Foundation (NSF), including a 40% reduction for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which has sites in Louisiana and Washington state. NSF contributions to the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope in Chile would be cut by 20%, and funds for the Large Hadron Collider, based at CERN, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, would fall by around 40%.",

          "abstract": "A Japanese spacecraft has probably crashed on the Moon, the second failed landing attempt for Tokyo-based private firm ispace.\n\nThe HAKUTO-R Mission 2 (M2) lander — also called Resilience — began its landing sequence from a 100-kilometre-altitude orbit at 3.13am local time on 5 June. The craft was due to land near the centre of Mare Frigoris (Sea of Cold) at 4.17am.\n\nThe ispace team said at a press conference that it lost contact with M2 when the craft was 192 metres above the Moon’s surface and descending faster than expected. An attempt to reboot M2 was also unsuccessful.\n\nM2 didn't receive measurements of the distance between itself and the lunar surface in time to slow down and reach its correct landing speed, the team said.\n\n“It eventually slowed down, but not softly enough,” says Clive Neal, who studies the Moon at the University of Notre Dame in Indianapolis, US. He speculates that the failure was probably caused by a systems issue that wasn’t identified and addressed during the M1 landing attempt. “It’s something that I believe will definitely be fixable, because getting that close means there’s a few tweaks that are going to be needed for the next one,” he adds.\n\nIf M2 had successfully landed on the lunar surface, the mission would have been the second time a commercial company had achieved the feat and a first for a non-US company. ispace's Mission 1 (M1) probably crashed during a landing attempt in April 2023.\n\nSecond chance\n\nLunar landings are challenging. When M1 crashed, Ryo Ujiie, ispace’s chief technology officer said the telemetry — which collects data on the craft’s altitude and speed — estimated that M1 was on the surface when it wasn’t, causing the lander to free fall.\n\nSpeaking to Nature last week, Ujiie said the company had addressed the telemetry issue with M2 and modified its software. “We also carefully selected how to approach the landing site,” he added.\n\nHad M2 landed successfully, the craft would have supplied electricity for its cargo, including water electrolyzing equipment and a module for food production experiments — developed by Japan-based Takasago Thermal Engineering and biotechnology firm Euglena. A deep space radiation probe made by Taiwan’s National Central University, and the 54-centimetre Tenacious rover were also be on board. The rover, created by ispace’s European subsidiary in Luxemburg, was going to be released from the lander to collect imagery, location data and lunar sand known as regolith.

Longo\n\nScientists have discovered an ancient protein that has the rare property of being ‘ambidextrous’ — it can function in mirror-image forms. The molecule could be a relic of a time when life based on mirror-image molecules existed on Earth.\n\nMany chemicals have a handedness, or chirality, and can exist in two mirror-image forms. But the building blocks of life tend to stick to one or the other. Sugars in nucleic acids such as DNA are right-handed — causing the DNA double helix to twist to the right, if you were looking down its axis — whereas the amino acids that build proteins are left-handed.\n\nI told AI to make me a protein. Here’s what it came up with\n\nScientists think that a preference for right-handed DNA and left-handed proteins could have helped to maintain the stability and function of biomolecules early in life’s evolution.\n\nLiam Longo, a protein historian at the Tokyo Earth-Life Science Institute, was examining a protein fragment, or peptide, that recognizes nucleic acids and is commonly found in DNA-repair enzymes. He noticed that the structure was symmetrical around a central axis, and suspected that both left- and right-handed versions of the protein could bind DNA.\n\nThe symmetrical segment — called a helix–hairpin–helix motif — is common in proteins that can manipulate and bind DNA and RNA and is found across the tree of life, suggesting that it existed in an early ancestor of all cells, says Longo.\n\nForwards, backwards, this way, that way\n\nTo test his hunch about the molecule’s ambidexterity, Longo and his colleagues created ‘right-handed’ versions of the peptide, including an ‘ancestral’ form potentially similar to the one found in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of today’s cells.\n\nThe mirror-image peptides bound to DNA nearly as well as their twins, and the normal, left-handed versions were able to bind mirror-image DNA. Further experiments showed that both left- and right-handed versions grabbed DNA molecules in similar ways. A study describing the phenomenon is published1 in Angewandte Chemie.",

Here we call for psychology to become a historical and geographical science, a transformation we term the chronospatial revolution. We list four barriers to this shift in psychology: problems in scope, data, synergy and theory. We discuss the need for psychology to adopt a more holistic lens and propose a research agenda that integrates historical processes, cultural dynamics and ecological variations into psychological inquiry. Such an integrated approach not only enriches our microscopic understanding of Homo sapiens but also draws a more telescopic map of human psychology that encapsulates the human journey. By embedding psychology within time and space, we can better account for cross-cultural psychological diversity, historical change and evolved psychological mechanisms, ultimately fostering a more globally representative, historically enriched and theoretically robust discipline.",

The process of habit formation in humans is commonly studied in the context of learning an arbitrary association between stimuli and responses. Assessing whether or not this association becomes habitual usually involves testing either whether participants can withhold certain responses or whether participants can generate different responses to certain stimuli. However, studies using these two methods have yielded conflicting findings. Here we propose that this discrepancy arises because these approaches target distinct forms of habit associated with different components of action control: response initiation and response preparation, respectively. Through a series of experiments (total n = 215), along with computational models, we show that these two approaches indeed measure dissociable forms of habit. Our results illustrate that a given behaviour can become habitual in multiple, qualitatively different ways, with important implications for how habits can best be promoted or eliminated.",

Basic oculomotor biases towards the image centre and along the horizontal meridian develop until adolescence, matching developmental changes in visual sensitivity and cortex. Finally, while the tendency for visual exploration continuously increases, fixation patterns become less idiosyncratic and more canonical throughout adolescence. These findings show that fundamental aspects of adult gaze take up to two decades of continuous development and push individuals towards more canonical viewing patterns. We suggest that development is key to understanding the general mechanisms of active vision.",

A model encapsulating beliefs and their interrelationships is crucial for understanding their influence on our actions. However, research on belief interplay has often been limited to beliefs related to specific issues and has relied heavily on surveys. Here we propose a method to study the nuanced interplay between thousands of beliefs by leveraging online user debate data and mapping beliefs onto a neural embedding space constructed using a fine-tuned large language model. This belief space captures the interconnectedness and polarization of diverse beliefs across social issues. Our findings show that positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals and estimate cognitive dissonance on the basis of the distance between existing and new beliefs. This study demonstrates how large language models, combined with collective online records of human beliefs, can offer insights into the fundamental principles that govern human belief formation.",

We created an online quiz game, Tango (letstango.org), where Republicans and Democrats partner and communicate in real time. Across five experiments (N = 4,493, four preregistered), we find that an hour of gameplay with an outparty partner can reduce negative partisanship, with increased self-reported warmth, more equitable economic allocations and more favourable outparty meta-perceptions persisting for up to four months.

Feature neurons encode groups of faces regardless of their identity, broad semantic categories or familiarity; and the coding regions (that is, receptive fields) predict feature neurons’ response to new face stimuli.

Nature Human Behaviour https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-023-01659-w (2025)\n\nIn a recent study, Webb, Holyoak and Lu1 (henceforth WHL) demonstrated that a large language model (GPT-3, text-davinci-003) could match or even exceed human performance across several analogical reasoning tasks. This result led to the compelling conclusion that LLMs such as GPT-3 possess an emergent ability to reason by analogy. However, the findings were based on a single, proprietary model for which the releasing company provided limited public details and progressively restricted access to the internal probability distributions. Furthermore, text-davinci-003 was deprecated on 4 January 2024, and is no longer available through the OpenAI API. This poses a challenge to replicability in two ways. First, the lack of open access to the model and its recent deprecation make it difficult—if not impossible—for other researchers to verify or build upon the findings. Second, relying on a single model leaves open the question of whether the results can be extended to LLMs as a broader class of objects of scientific investigation. Without testing a diverse range of models, it is unclear whether the observed behaviours are specific to GPT-3 or represent a general property of comparable contemporary LLMs. Replicating experimental results based on proprietary models with public alternatives is thus crucial to ensure that the findings can be reproduced in the future2, generalized to new model instances, and, more generally, to adhere to transparency principles that are of paramount importance in scientific research3.",

Human participants (N = 182) learned visuomotor mappings with (or without) an imposed latent structure that linked visual stimulus features (for example, colour or shape) to intuitive motor distinctions, such as hands and pairs of fingers. In participants who learned structured visuomotor mappings, transitional response times indicated that retrieving the correct response from memory invoked the ‘traversal’ of a structured mental graph. Forced-response experiments revealed similar computations within individual trials. Moreover, graph-like representations persisted even after multiple days of practice with the visuomotor mappings. Our results point to direct links between internal computations over structured memory representations and the preparation of movements.",

For understanding its origins, its computational role and its behavioural implications, computational models are of central importance. Yet, vision is commonly modelled using convolutional neural networks, which are hard-wired to learn identical features across space and thus lack topography. Here we overcome this limitation by introducing all-topographic neural networks (All-TNNs). All-TNNs develop several features reminiscent of primate topography, including smooth orientation and category selectivity maps, and enhanced processing of regions with task-relevant information. In addition, All-TNNs operate on a low energy budget, suggesting a metabolic benefit of smooth topographic organization. To test our model against behaviour, we collected a dataset of human spatial biases in object recognition and found that All-TNNs significantly outperform control models. All-TNNs thereby offer a promising candidate for modelling primate visual topography and its role in downstream behaviour.",

Understanding where and how agricultural frontiers emerge is thus important. Yet, existing monitoring approaches typically focus on mapping deforestation and do not capture the shifts in land access and ownership that lay the ground for agricultural expansion, thereby missing early stages of frontier development. We develop an approach that captures these early dynamics and apply it to the entire 1,1 million km 2 of the Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot. Through the detection of linear features indicative of land claims and the analysis of their spatial–temporal dynamics, we reveal that the footprint of agricultural frontiers in the region extends far beyond that of deforestation. Most of the Chaco shows signs of land claiming, and although claiming activity is especially concentrated close to active deforestation, emergent claiming in remote parts of the Bolivian and Paraguayan Chaco indicates rapidly growing interest in land in these regions. Finally, the strong spatial correlation between land claiming and the disappearance of smallholder homesteads points to the social repercussions of early agricultural frontier expansion in the Chaco. By offering a transferable template to map land-control indicators at scale, our approach enables a better understanding of frontier processes and more accurate targeting of policy interventions in emerging agricultural frontiers globally.",

          "abstract": "Several cross-country examinations have found larger gender differences in Western countries. More recently, it has been argued, from an evolutionary standpoint, that equality may paradoxically increase gender differences, because it provides more freedom for men and women to pursue innate preferences. However, this paradox has primarily been examined with this cross-country methodology, opening up for other cultural differences to drive the results. For instance, measures developed in Protestant and Germanic-speaking countries, may not work the same in other cultural clusters of countries, and may not have the same statistical qualities there (e.g., in terms of reliability). Here, we reanalyze the results from multiple studies on the gender-equality paradox with country-level data available. We find that gender differences covary more strongly with cultural regions and data quality than gender equality, and that any variable higher in the West appears to achieve similar correlations as gender equality. Also, controlling for cultural regions consistently and strongly attenuates the association with gender equality, including to become statistically nonsignificant, or to switch direction. In other words, the baseline associations differ between and within cultural clusters (a Simpson’s paradox), suggesting there is no simple causal relation between gender equality and expressed gender differences. Similarly, controlling for data quality indicators strongly attenuates the paradox. Finally, we show that, with and without controls, there is no consistent paradoxical association across many of the largest cross-cultural studies on gender differences, including newly analyzed data. The same is true for other country development variables considered in the gender-equality paradox literature.",

A common approach toward differentiating between these origins in longitudinal data is to attribute systematic differences between units—differences in means or differences proportional to a time-varying group average—to unobserved heterogeneity. We show that any longitudinal data with systematic differences can also be produced by a reinforcement-driven data generating process. This result reconciles findings in three distinct research areas—science of science, personal culture, and sexual networks—where reinforcement is a strong theoretical prior, yet longitudinal data analyses advance an explanation of interpersonal differences based on heterogeneity. Future studies may bound the role of heterogeneity and reinforcement from below by measuring fixed traits that systematically vary with the outcome and isolating random events that trigger emergent differences.",

The most common limitations were in upper body strength and torso range of motion, and with respect to the ambient environment. The study also found that mental illness, arthritis, and substance use disorder are associated with the greatest number of functional limitations in working adults. The findings have implications for economic performance, workforce planning, and social policies to support displaced and vulnerable workers with significant functional limitations. Identifying the occupations and industries with large numbers of workers with functional limitations is critical to addressing short-term labor supply disruptions (e.g., public health crises) and preparing for longer-term workforce needs (e.g., long-term care workers for an aging population).",

          "abstract": "Despite living in an era where the mere concept of truth is increasingly contested, the cognitive processes underlying the processing of information we believe or disbelieve remain largely unexplored. In this fMRI study, we investigated how belief modulates narrative processing through belief context—the initial information indicating the speaker’s credibility—and actual belief—the truth value ultimately assigned by the listener. Across two experiments, participants listened to narratives preceded by contexts explicitly stating whether the speaker was lying or telling the truth. Then, after listening to the narratives, they were asked to rate their actual belief. To investigate the effects of (dis)belief on narrative processing, we analyzed neural synchronization using inter-subject-correlation analysis and inter-subject representational similarity analysis. In both experiments, we successfully differentiated (dis)belief contexts by modeling neural synchronization patterns, despite an actual “belief-bias” at the behavioral level. This indicates a unique neural pattern related to each belief context. Furthermore, our results revealed a dissociation between belief and disbelief in both contextual and actual (dis)belief. Per each narrative, belief and disbelief were associated with increased synchrony within the default mode network, but in distinguishable parcels. These findings highlight the influence of (dis)belief on narrative processing at both behavioral and neural levels. Behaviorally, the observed belief-bias supports the notion of belief as a cognitive default. Neurally, we suggest that belief and disbelief can be understood as fostering qualitatively distinct processing or interpretation of the same narrative, which are then reflected in shared neural responses among individuals who hold similar belief states.",

Therefore, many metrics have been devised to extract network features like motifs, centrality, and modularity measures. It has previously been proposed that network symmetries are of particular importance since they are expected to underlie the synchronization of a system’s units, which is ubiquitously observed in nervous system activity patterns. However, perfectly symmetrical structures are difficult to assess in noisy measurements of biological systems, like neuronal connectomes. Here, we devise a principled method to infer network symmetries from combined connectome and neuronal activity data. Using nervous system-wide population activity recordings of the Caenorhabditis elegans backward locomotor system, we infer structures in the connectome called fibration symmetries, which can explain which group of neurons synchronize their activity. Our analysis suggests functional building blocks in the animal’s motor periphery, providing testable hypotheses on how descending interneuron circuits communicate with the motor periphery to control behavior. Our approach opens a door to exploring the structure–function relations in other complex systems, like the nervous systems of larger animals.",

Here, we identified the tumor suppressor Ras association domain-containing protein 8 (RASSF8) as a WAVE interactor required for border cell migration. RASSF8 colocalizes with F-actin and cell adhesion molecules at border cell– border cell contacts. Loss of RASSF8 function results in border cell cohesion defects, a phenotype associated with changes in the localization of the Echinoid (Ed) and Coracle (Cora). Cell-type-specific RNA interference (RNAi) experiments suggest that cohesion defects are caused by changes in localization of Ed rather than E-cadherin. Gain-of-function experiments further revealed reciprocal functional interactions between RASSF8 and WAVE controlling collective border cell movement. Thus, we propose a dual function of RASSF8 in coordinating border cell cluster behavior. RASSF8 is thought to regulate the collective movement of border cells by restricting WAVE function, while it controls the epithelial cluster integrity by regulating cell–cell adhesion and septate junction molecules such as Ed and Cora.",

Direct respiratory measurements, as key biomarkers, are missing in traditional wrist- or finger-worn wearables, which thus limit their precision in detection of sleep stages and sleep disorders. By contrast, this work introduces a simple, multimodal, skin-integrated, energy-efficient mechanoacoustic sensor capable of synchronized cardiac and respiratory measurements. The mechanical design enhances sensitivity and durability, enabling continuous, wireless monitoring of essential vital signs (respiration rate, heart rate and corresponding variability, temperature) and various physical activities. Systematic physiology-based analytics involving explainable machine learning allows both precise sleep characterization and transparent tracking of each factor’s contribution, demonstrating the dominance of respiration, as validated through a diverse range of human subjects, both healthy and with sleep disorders. This methodology enables cost-effective, clinical-quality sleep tracking with minimal user effort, suitable for home and clinical use.",

          "abstract": "The influence of seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation on subsurface biogeochemical processes remains poorly understood. In the Lavey-les-Bains thermal system in the Swiss Alps, annual variations in electrical conductivity are observed to depths of 500 m, suggesting a potential link to surface environmental changes. Here we show, through year-round analyses of stable water isotopes, noble gases, and conductivity, that seasonally varying contributions of shallow groundwater from the Rhône alluvial aquifer mix with deep groundwater. Despite vertically similar fluid geochemical compositions suggesting high hydrological connectivity, microbial communities exhibit significant depth-dependent variation with minimal seasonal change. This decoupling of dynamic water source partitioning and stable microbial community structure has not been previously observed and fills a critical gap in our understanding of geothermal systems and microbial life in the deep subsurface. At 200 m, the communities are dominated by sulfur-disproportionating Bacteria ( Dissulfurispira ) and Micrarchaeota, while at 500 m the major groups include sulfate- and iron-reducers and/or hydrogen-oxidizers (Thermales, Thermodesulfobacteriota, and Bathyarchaeota). Our study highlights the resilience of terrestrial subsurface microbial communities to temporal variations in water sources and fluid composition. We propose that intrinsic environmental properties—such as temperature—are more critical drivers of microbial community structure in hydrologically connected deep aquifers than seasonal hydrological changes.",

          "abstract": "While symmetry breaking in 2D ferroelectrics is obviously linked to the single-layer structure, layered (van der Waals) ferroelectrics can have a multitude of underlying mechanisms, making their identification nontrivial and often controversial. This complexity is exemplified by tin chalcogenides whose equilibrium structure, the orthorhombic α-phase with space group Pnma , includes an inversion center and which therefore should not be ferroelectric. Yet, recent work demonstrated polarization switching and ferroelectric domains in few-layer SnS and SnSe. Here, we use in situ electron microscopy and diffraction to determine the mechanism and characteristics of ferroelectricity across the SnSe 1-x S x system. We identify two distinct phases of synthetic SnSe 1-x S x : nonpolar (centrosymmetric) equilibrium (α-phase) crystals and metastable crystals adopting a distorted monoclinic structure, which are in-plane ferroelectrics with Curie temperatures of 320 to 420 °C. A surprising structural plasticity of the ferroelectric crystals during heating/cooling indicates a shallow energy landscape. This in turn suggests absence of a pronounced driving force for conversion to the α-phase that can explain the formation of the nonequilibrium crystals and their stability even after transfer to other supports. Our results highlight opportunities for the discovery of novel ferroelectrics among nonequilibrium van der Waals crystals.",

The mechanisms underlying the vastly different activities of PCs in the rodent hippocampal CA1 area are unknown. Here, we measured the in vivo activity of CA1 PCs using two-photon [Ca 2+ ] imaging in head-restrained mice during navigation in a virtual corridor and then performed in vitro patch-clamp recording to probe their intrinsic electrical properties and anatomical investigation to characterize their input synapses. The active and passive electrical properties of PCs were similar between PCs with different prior in vivo activities. Perisomatic inhibitory synapse density was also comparable among PCs. The average dendritic spine density and spine head area did not correlate with the mean in vivo activity of PCs, but the size of the spines of place cells was significantly larger compared to that of silent cells. Our results are consistent with excitatory synaptic plasticity as a major mechanism underlying spatially tuned activity of place cells in hippocampal networks.",

          "abstract": "tRNA introns are a universally conserved feature of eukaryotic genomes, but the reason for their conservation has remained obscure. We have previously shown that a defect in the essential tRNA splicing endonuclease of yeast results in transcriptome remodeling, resembling that of the integrated stress response (ISR). In this study, we show that ISR activation in this mutant requires the canonical ISR components, including the collided ribosome sensor Gcn1. We further show that splicing of tyrosine tRNA, but not splicing of any of the other intron-containing tRNAs, controls the ISR. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we show that the intron of tyrosine tRNA affects m1 A58 modification in the T arm loop of the mature tRNA. In support of these results, we show that deletion of either subunit of the enzyme that adds the m1 A58 modification also controls the ISR. Unlike the few intron-dependent modifications previously described, the intron-dependent m1 A58 modification site is distal from the intron and has a clear physiological impact. Finally, we survey the occurrence of tRNA introns in eukaryotic genomes and show that the tyrosine tRNA intron is more prevalent than any other tRNA intron. These data suggest that tRNA splicing is conserved in eukaryotes because hypomodified tyrosine tRNAs lead to collided ribosomes, resulting in stress to cell physiology.",

Electroencephalography (EEG), which records electrical brain activity with a high temporal resolution, is well suited to quantify tDCS-induced neuromodulation in humans. However, most studies relying on scalp EEG recordings or event-related potentials showed low reliability and only indirect correlations. Here, we combined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings with a sham-controlled tDCS experiment during fast periodic visual stimulation. Anodal (+2 mA) tDCS was applied over the right occipito-temporal cortex for 20 min using two small ring high-definition electrodes. Through the analysis of iEEG signals of 947 intracerebral contacts in 11 drug-resistant epileptic patients, we quantified the neuromodulation of iEEG cognitive evoked responses during (P2 phase) and after (P3 phase) tDCS by comparison to a control phase before tDCS (P1 phase). Significant neuromodulations of face-selective iEEG activity in anterior &amp; posterior temporal lobe and in the occipital lobe were found, with amplitude increases of 3% and 4%, 16% and 13%, and 36% and 33%, during and after tDCS, respectively. Interestingly, despite a unique tDCS session, the face-selective neuromodulation in the right visual occipito-temporal cortex remained significant ( P = 0.015) after tDCS (P3 vs. P1). This iEEG study demonstrates that using low intensity tDCS and small ring electrodes can induce significant electrophysiological effects on a selective cognitive function in humans.",

          "abstract": "Metabolism fuels cell growth and functions. While it is well established that cellular growth rate scales with cell size, how cells alter their metabolism as they change size remains largely unexplored. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of cell size–dependent metabolism across the NCI60 cancer cell line panel comprising a diverse range of cell sizes. We demonstrate that cellular metabolism and growth rate display 2/3 allometric scaling due to differential scaling of overall nutrient uptake and waste metabolite release with respect to cell size, with waste elimination decreasing less rapidly than nutrient uptake rate as cells grow larger. This results in cell size–dependent growth rate and predicts a maximum cell size where net nutrient uptake equals zero and cell enlargement ceases despite active metabolism. We experimentally confirm this prediction and identify that electron acceptor demand constrains cell enlargement as evidenced by depletion of intracellular aspartate and scaling of aspartate uptake, which is more than proportional to cell volume. Overall, these findings may have implications for understanding cell size homeostasis, developmental biology, and the design principles of living organisms.",

The physical model explains the dynamics of slow and fast ruptures on transparent materials, as well as the amount of light transmitted across the interface during laboratory ruptures. The constitutive framework elucidates the origin of empirical friction laws, and the simulated ruptures can be described by linear elastic fracture mechanics. Continuous measurements of the physical state variable or its proxies during seismic cycles emerge as a novel tool for probing natural faults and advancing our understanding of the earthquake phenomenon.",

The method is based on replacing the promoters of the target genes with native Y. lipolytica promoters of varying strengths or removing the promoters entirely. To demonstrate the method’s capabilities, we created a plasmid library that targets 56 transcription factors (TFs) and changes the expression of each TF to seven different levels.

The genetic markup of the yeast clones with the desired phenotypic changes was determined by sequencing the inserted plasmids. We identified multiple TFs whose regulatory changes increased thermotolerance, two TFs that eliminated pseudohyphal growth, and several TFs that increased betanin production. Analogous libraries can be designed to target any chosen group of genes and even all the genes. The libraries can be shared and reused, accelerating applied strain development projects and fundamental functional genomics research (TUNE YALI -TF kit and TUNE YALI -TF library are available via AddGene under catalog numbers #1000000255 and #217744).",

Here, we report the finding and characterization of M606, a selective small molecule inhibitor of MYCN, which was identified by screening a diverse chemical library. M606 reduced MYCN protein levels in neuroblastoma cell lines and upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A). Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYCN , c-Myc , or HIF1A in HepG2 and BE(2)-C cells followed by M606 treatment, we demonstrated that Myc downregulation and HIF1A upregulation were two independent effects of M606 treatment. M606 selectively targeted neuroblastoma cell lines expressing higher levels of MYCN protein and delayed neuroblastoma development in the TH-MYCN transgenic mouse model. Metabolomic analysis showed that M606 modulated glucose metabolism, consistent with a hypoxic response and iron deprivation. Biochemical characterization of M606 not only confirmed its iron-chelating properties but also revealed its ability to downregulate MYCN promoter activity, which could be rescued by the addition of iron. Luciferase assays identified the minimal MYCN promoter region required for the M606 response, which contained overlapping E2F transcription factor binding sites. Further evaluation defined a key role for E2F3 in the M606-mediated response. The finding of a potent cell-permeable iron chelator that can chelate iron to directly downregulate MYCN transcription via an E2F3-mediated response represents a potentially valuable therapeutic approach in the treatment of cancers overexpressing Myc oncoproteins.",

          "abstract": "A universal response of plants to environmental stresses is the activation of plasma membrane (PM) phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes phosphoinositides to produce soluble inositol phosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG). Because of their conical shape, DAG amounts have to be tightly regulated or they can destabilize membranes. We previously showed that upon stress, Synaptotagmin1 (SYT1) transports DAG from the PM to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at ER–PM Contact Sites (CS). Here, we addressed the fate of the incoming DAG in the ER. We show that diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) DGK1 and DGK2 form a module with SYT1 functionally coupling DAG transport and phosphorylation at ER–PM CS. Although SYT1 and DGK1/DGK2 do not show exclusive ER–PM CS localization, their interaction occurs specifically at ER–PM CS and the removal of ER–PM CS abolishes the interaction. Lipidomic analysis of a dgk1dgk2 double mutant supports that DGK1 and DGK2 phosphorylate DAG at the ER and transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses indicate that SYT1 and DGK1/DGK2 are functionally related. Taken together, our results highlight a mechanism at ER–PM CS that coordinates the transfer of DAG from the PM to the ER by SYT1 upon stress and the concomitant phosphorylation of DAG by DGK1 and DGK2 at the ER. These findings underscore the critical role of spatial coordination in lipid metabolism during stress-induced membrane remodeling.",

However, observational and experimental studies in additional natural systems are needed to further our understanding of repeated evolution and convergence. In Texas, a radiation of groundwater salamanders (genus Eurycea ), with independent invasions of subterranean karstic environments, offers an opportunity to investigate phenotypic convergence, parallel evolution, and the enhancement and regression of sensory systems. Adaptations to a troglobitic life in this clade include morphological, behavioral, and physiological changes within and among species. Intraspecific and interspecific variation in morphology in response to the selective pressures of life underground allows for detailed examination of physical, behavioral, and physiological changes associated with subterranean adaptation within a comparative phylogenetic framework. We find a correlated change between two sensory systems repeated across multiple subterranean Eurycea lineages: the degeneration of the eye and the expansion of the mechanosensory lateral line. The increase in anterior neuromast organs in subterranean lineages was positively correlated with the expression of pax6 (Paired-box 6), a conserved transcription factor important for vertebrate neurogenesis. Our results show a decreasing trend of PAX6 labeling in the neuromasts of adult surface salamanders ( Eurycea nana ) relative to the maintained labeling in subterranean species ( Eurycea rathbuni ). These lateral line enhancements are correlated with reductions in the development of optic systems in subterranean salamander lineages. Altogether, our findings provide a starting point for future evolutionary developmental investigations examining the genetic underpinnings of adaptive, repeated evolution in a novel system.",

Inhibition of macropinocytosis suppressed HIV-1 internalization into and subsequent fusion with primary CD4 + T cells regardless of the viral coreceptor usage.

          "abstract": "The sensitivity of coral reefs to climate change is well established. As the oceans warm and acidify, the calcification of coral reefs declines with net calcium carbonate dissolution projected under even moderate emissions trajectories. The impact of this on the global carbon cycle is however yet to be accounted for. Here, we use a synthesis of the sensitivity of coral reef calcification to climate change, alongside reef distribution products to estimate alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon fluxes resulting from reductions in reef calcification. Using a global ocean biogeochemical model, we simulate the impact on ocean carbon uptake under different emissions scenarios, accounting for uncertainty in present-day calcification rates. Reductions in net coral reef carbonate production can enhance the ocean carbon sink by up to 1.25 GtCO 2 y −1 by midcentury (0.48 GtCO 2 y −1 median estimate) with cumulative ocean carbon uptake up to 13% greater by 2300 (7% median estimate). Our findings indicate that accounting for the coral reef feedback in projections will increase estimates of the remaining carbon budget associated with global warming thresholds, as well as the likelihood that net zero emissions can be achieved without negative emissions.",

          "abstract": "The quantum acoustic framework has recently emerged as a nonperturbative, coherent approach to electron–lattice interactions, uncovering rich physics often obscured by perturbative methods with incoherent scattering events. Here, we model the strongly coupled dynamics of electrons and acoustic lattice vibrations within this framework, representing lattice vibrations as coherent states and electrons as quantum wave packets, in a manner distinctively different from tight-binding or discrete hopping-based approaches. We derive and numerically implement electron backaction on the lattice, providing both visual and quantitative insights into electron wave packet evolution and the formation of acoustic polarons. We investigate polaron binding energies across varying material parameters and compute key observables—including mean square displacement, kinetic energy, potential energy, and vibrational energy—over time. Our findings reveal the conditions that favor polaron formation, which is enhanced by low temperatures, high deformation potential constants, slow sound velocities, and high effective masses. Additionally, we explore the impact of external electric and magnetic fields, showing that while polaron formation remains robust under moderate fields, it is weakly suppressed at higher field strengths. These results deepen our understanding of polaron dynamics and pave the way for future studies into nontrivial transport behavior in quantum materials.",

However, the conditions under which this material formed and its subsequent incorporation into growing planetesimals remains a subject of vigorous debate. Here, we show that C isotope variations among these organics in most carbonaceous chondrites are strongly correlated with mass-independent O isotope anomalies exhibited by their host meteorites. As the latter signature has been argued to track abundances of nebular water generated from photochemical processing of CO gas, the C isotope variability of refractory organic solids may relate to this same process. We propose a framework in which CO photolysis simultaneously produces H 2 O and generates a pool of C + ions that serve as precursors for C-rich organic solids, with their C isotope compositions suggesting formation over a relatively narrow and warm range of temperatures in the protoplanetary disk (~200 to 400 K). Two populations of organic precursors with different C isotope compositions became associated with distinct dust reservoirs prior to their delivery to the carbonaceous-chondrite-forming region, which likely resided at lower temperatures (&lt;170 K). This finding places detailed constraints on the location and distribution of chemical reactions that generated both water and organic-rich reservoirs in the early Solar System.",

In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) to investigate the effects of five BPA substitutes [bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol B, bisphenol F (BPF), tetramethyl BPF, and 4,4′-(Perfluoropropane-2,2-diyl)diphenol] at pathophysiologically relevant exposure levels during aging and examined the underlying mechanisms using a mouse model. Our results indicated that, among the five BPA substitutes, exposure to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of BPS (300, 450, and 600 nM) accelerated aging in C. elegans . In mice, exposure to a pathophysiologically relevant concentration of BPS (125 μg/kg/day, from 4 to 20 mo of age) similarly reduces the life and health span and accelerates aging phenotypes in multiple tissues. Further investigations demonstrated that long-term BPS exposure resulted in a significantly higher accumulation of BPS in brown adipose tissue (BAT) than in other organs. RNA sequencing analysis of BAT revealed that BPS accelerates BAT aging through multiple pathways. Importantly, transplantation of BAT from BPS-exposed mice into BPS-naive mice accelerated aging in recipients. Conversely, transplantation of BAT from unexposed mice into BPS-exposed mice significantly improved their metabolic status and delayed aging. These findings elucidate the impact of pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of BPS on the aging process and suggest that these effects are likely mediated through the disruption of BAT function.",

Here, we characterize regional variation in structure–function coupling, capturing the degree to which a cortical region’s structural connections relate to patterns of coordinated neural activity in healthy, term-born neonates ( n = 239). Regional structure–function coupling is heterogeneously patterned across the cortex, with higher coupling in the auditory, lateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal cortices. Average structure–function coupling is negatively associated with age during the first month of life, with age-associated decreases seen in primary sensory systems, specifically in auditory and somatomotor regions. Age-associated “decoupling” of structure and function reflects increasingly segregated patterns of functional connectivity and increasingly integrated patterns of white matter connectivity with age. Notably, higher structure–function coupling after accounting for age in the dorsal attention, cingulo-opercular, and visual systems at birth is associated with faster visuospatial attention to faces at one year of age. These results yield valuable insight into the development of structural and functional connectivity across the cortex, including how interregional variation in structure–function coupling during the first month of life might shape later attention.",

Removal of the senescent cells (SNCs) delays OA pathologies, but little is known about the heterogeneity of SNCs and their roles in OA pathogenesis. Here, we identify a subpopulation of senescent synovial cells and proposed a molecular mechanism governing pathogenic synovium-cartilage crosstalk in OA progression. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and synovial organoids, we demonstrate that RCAN1 + IL1α + senescent synovial fibroblasts, predominantly located in the lining layer of human OA synovium, exhibit proinflammatory phenotype, mitochondrial dysfunction, and promote cartilage degeneration. Mechanistically, RCAN1 stabilizes ATF4 mRNA and mediates saturated fatty acids (SFA) secretion from synovial fibroblasts, which could promote chondrocyte senescence and cartilage matrix degradation. Synovium-targeted delivery of anti-RCAN1 siRNA significantly ameliorated posttraumatic OA development in mice, reducing of SNC accumulation in synovium and increasing cartilage regeneration. Coculture experiments with human OA cartilage explants and synovial organoids confirm that RCAN1 silencing in synovial fibroblasts suppressess chondrocyte senescence and cartilage degradation. Our findings reveal a prodegenerative interaction between RCAN1 + IL1α + senescent synovial fibroblasts and chondrocytes mediated by secreted lipid in OA progression. Targeted RCAN1 knockdown in senescent synovium could be a new treatment strategy for restoring the joint homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "Seismic low-velocity layers (LVLs), frequently attributed to hydrous-silicate melts, are detected globally but exhibit lateral discontinuities. Geophysical and laboratory studies of water content in the mantle transition zone (MTZ) and upper mantle solubility limits suggest these layers likely form through global dehydration melting near the 410 km discontinuity (D410). A key hypothesis posits that melts form globally but are preserved only where melt stability permits retention. However, challenges in quenching melts into glass or fine-grained crystals at mantle pressures have precluded precise determination of melt composition, fueling debates over the mechanisms governing LVLs’ sporadic distribution. Here, we developed a fast-quenching high-pressure cell assembly to synthesize hydrous glasses or fine-grained quench crystals at pressures &gt;10 GPa, enabling high-precision analysis of incipient melt composition. Experiments at 13 GPa reveal that the 410 melt contains 43 mol% H 2 O, 9.2 mol% CaO, 30.5 mol% (Mg, Fe)O, 0.2 mol% Al 2 O 3 , and 17 mol% SiO 2 . The melt’s high water content necessitates Fe enrichment to achieve neutral buoyancy, which can only be sourced from Fe-rich heterogeneities (Fe # = 100Fe/(Mg+Fe) in mole; Fe # &gt;18) within the MTZ. In contrast, melts derived from normal MTZ material (Fe # &lt;18) remain buoyant and migrate upward, precluding stable layer formation. We conclude that global dehydration melting generates hydrous melts, but only Fe-rich heterogeneities enable melt retention, reconciling the coexistence of widespread LVL detections and their lateral discontinuities.",

A single-point “off-board” measurement of Var(Δ Q 0.2C-1C (V) ) indicates whether a particular cell is experiencing self-limiting or accelerating degradation and is thus near a knee point in its cycle life.

          "abstract": "Due to increasing anthropogenic impacts, many species survive only in small and isolated populations. Active conservation management to reduce extinction risk includes increasing habitat connectivity, translocations from captive populations, or intensive surveillance of highly protected closed populations. Advances in sequencing technology mean that it is now possible to consider the genomic impacts of such strategies, as a proxy for variation in individual fitness. Using whole genome sequences from critically endangered eastern black rhinoceros ( Diceros bicornis michaeli ), we compare the consequences of different types of conservation efforts, based on cohorts of offspring resulting from parents from different sources. Based on the fraction of the genome in runs of homozygosity (ROH) of different lengths, we found lower inbreeding in offspring of individuals that had either been translocated from ex-situ populations (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.047) or dispersed between proximate native populations (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.065) compared to the intensively managed closed population from which the migrant moved (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.112). However, the benefit of such movement was removed after only a few generations of closed breeding (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.149). Although sample size restricted power to detect significance of differences, the relative abundance of highly deleterious mutations was higher for offspring resulting from translocation compared to the other cohorts and this load was sheltered by higher heterozygosity, which could increase risks of inbreeding depression if inbreeding subsequently occurs. In contrast, native dispersers reduced the negative effects of inbreeding without compromising the benefits of past purging of deleterious mutations. Our study highlights the importance of natural dispersal and reiterates the importance of maintaining habitat corridors between populations.",

          "abstract": "Plasma membrane-localized autoinhibited Ca 2+ pumps are essential for maintaining basal cytosolic Ca 2+ levels for regulating growth processes and environmental responses. These pumps are known to be activated by calmodulins to maintain Ca 2+ homeostasis in plants and animals. Here, we demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved copine protein BON1 is critical for maintaining low cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations by directly regulating two plasma membrane-localized Ca 2+ pumps ACA8 and ACA10 in Arabidopsis . BON1 interacts with a region within the N-terminal domain of ACA8 and ACA10, preceding the calmodulin binding sites, and stimulates ACA8 activity. This activation can occur without calmodulin binding, indicating that BON1 and calmodulin independently regulate the Ca 2+ pump. Loss of BON1 function results in elevated basal cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations, which can be partially rescued by overexpressing hyperactive ACA8 or ACA10. Furthermore, we show that BON1 has one high-affinity Ca 2+ binding site in the VWA domain that is critical for activation of ACA8 as well as for BON1 function, suggesting a feedback mechanism for Ca 2+ homeostasis at resting concentrations. Our findings suggest that this Ca 2+ responsive regulatory mechanism extends beyond Arabidopsis , as we show interactions between ACA and BON proteins from algae to flowering plants, pointing to an ancient regulatory mechanism for maintaining low basal cytosolic Ca 2+ . Notably, a human plasma membrane-localized autoinhibited Ca 2+ pump can also be activated by a human BON protein in a yeast functional assay system, suggesting evolutionary conservation in Ca 2+ regulation across species.",

          "abstract": "Characterizing the conformational ensemble of biomolecular systems is key to understand their functions. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) captures two-dimensional snapshots of biomolecular ensembles, giving in principle access to thermodynamics. However, these images are very noisy and show projections of the molecule in unknown orientations, making it very difficult to identify the biomolecule’s conformation in each individual image. Here, we introduce cryo-EM simulation-based inference (cryoSBI) to infer the conformations of biomolecules and the uncertainties associated with the inference from individual cryo-EM images. CryoSBI builds on simulation-based inference, a merger of physics-based simulations and probabilistic deep learning, allowing us to use Bayesian inference even when likelihoods are too expensive to calculate. We begin with an ensemble of conformations, templates from experiments, and molecular modeling, serving as structural hypotheses. We train a neural network approximating the Bayesian posterior using simulated images from these templates and then use it to accurately infer the conformation of the biomolecule from each experimental image. Training is only done once on simulations, and after that, it takes just a few milliseconds to make inference on an image, making cryoSBI suitable for arbitrarily large datasets and direct analysis on micrographs. CryoSBI eliminates the need to estimate particle pose and imaging parameters, significantly enhancing the computational speed compared to explicit likelihood methods. Importantly, we obtain interpretable machine learning models by integrating physics-based approaches with deep neural networks, ensuring that our results are transparent and reliable. We illustrate and benchmark cryoSBI on synthetic data and showcase its promise on experimental single-particle cryo-EM data.",

          "abstract": "Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (“wormhole”) connecting the two sides of an anti-de Sitter “eternal” black hole. Here, we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides an alternative perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length—an important problem in cryptography—as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with “gases of gates.” This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide, a statement that implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy of computational complexity theory to its first level.",

We used an early-night LAN paradigm that was established in mice to examine behavioral and physiological consequences in adult male tree shrews. We found that 3-wk LAN exposure significantly impaired the mood and long-term memory of tree shrews without affecting the general activity pattern. We identified retinal projections to the perihabenular nucleus (pHb), a crucial area in LAN-induced negative mood, and demonstrated that the pHb continues to innervate the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in tree shrews. Moreover, the pHb was required for the LAN effect on mood but not long-term memory. Transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues containing the NAc area revealed drastic changes of several depression-related genes in NAc neurons post-LAN treatment, suggesting that long-term exposure to nighttime light could result in lasting changes in tree shrews. Collectively, we present behavioral and neural structural evidence that LAN exerts depression-inducing effects in diurnal animals via a pHb-related visual pathway, which may facilitate the translation from laboratory findings of excessive LAN exposure to clinical applications in humans.",

Regnase-1 was identified as one of the frequently mutated genes in the inflamed colorectal epithelium of patients with ulcerative colitis; however, its significance in intestinal epithelial cells during the tumorigenic process remains unknown. Therefore, we developed an Apc Min/+ mouse model lacking Regnase-1 in intestinal epithelia. Regnase-1 deletion significantly enhanced colon tumor growth accompanied by elevated levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in tumor tissues. Transcriptome analysis of the tumor tissues revealed that Nfkbiz , a mediator of the interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, was the primary degradative target of Regnase-1 in enterocytes and that Regnase-1 deficiency enhanced IL-17 signaling. The treatment with antibiotics or IL-17-neutralizing antibody canceled the proliferative effect of colon tumors due to Regnase-1 deletion, suggesting the protective role of Regnase-1 against colon tumor growth was dependent on IL-17 signaling triggered by gut microbes. Analysis of the Nfkbiz knockout mouse model demonstrated that the tumor-suppressive effect of Regnase-1 depended on Nfkbiz expression. Remarkably, oral treatment of dimethyl fumarate, a potential inhibitor of Regnase-1 protein inactivation, suppressed tumor growth, downregulated Nfkbiz , and suppressed ERK activation. Furthermore, TCGA data analysis revealed that low Regnase-1 expression in colorectal cancer tissue was related to poor prognosis. Therefore, Regnase-1 represses colon tumor growth by regulating IL-17 signaling via Nfkbiz mRNA degradation. Regnase-1 could be a potential therapeutic target in colon tumors.",

A notable aspect of such membraneless organelles is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here, we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation of highly charged disordered proteins and polypeptides that span about two orders of magnitude in bulk viscosity. We find that their viscosity is highly correlated with protein translational diffusion and nano- to microsecond chain dynamics. Remarkably, analytical relations from polymer physics can predict condensate viscosity from diffusivity and chain dynamics, and vice versa, even for more hydrophobic disordered proteins and for synthetic polyelectrolytes, indicating a mechanistic link across several decades of length- and timescales. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction—a key quantity underlying these relations—reflect differences in interresidue contact lifetimes as a function of arginine content and salt concentration, leading to the vastly different dynamics among condensates. The rapid exchange of interresidue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.",

DMS is biologically produced in seawater and emitted into the atmosphere, where its oxidation products contribute to aerosol formation with consequences for cloud albedo and the Earth’s radiative budget and climate. Climate model projections of how DMS emissions change with global warming are largely uncertain, even contradictory. Here, we use machine-learning models trained with biome-resolved global observations to simulate seawater DMS concentrations (1850 to 2100) using physico-chemical and biological predictors from eight CMIP6 models. The scatter in current projections is largely reduced, and globally averaged seawater DMS concentrations are predicted to decrease in the coming decades. However, global DMS emissions will increase due to rising surface wind speeds and sea surface temperatures which contradicts the current AR6 assessment that the DMS flux will reduce in the future. Concurrence of increasing DMS emissions and declining anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions suggests an increase in the relative importance of DMS to sulfate aerosol formation and its climate cooling impact.",

Patients exhibit short stature, dysmorphic bones, and severe growth plate abnormalities, as well as hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hypophosphatemia, and reduced plasma PTH levels. Humanized PTH1R (hPTH1R) mice expressing the H223R-hPTH1R JMC mutation die early without breeding. We therefore generated and characterized a stable mouse line expressing the T410R-hPTH1R allele, which confers a milder disease phenotype in patients. Mutant mice show near-normal longevity and reproductive capacity yet exhibit a profound skeletal phenotype characteristic of the disease. The long bones of T410R mice are markedly misshapen and have expanded metaphyses with disarrayed chondrocyte zones in growth plates and reduced primary spongiosa. PET/CT scanning revealed diminished uptake of [ 18 F]-sodium fluoride in the growth plate area, consistent with reduced mineralization and vascularization. Genetic ablation of Hdac4 rescued the growth plate abnormalities in T410R mice, thereby establishing the PTH1R-Gαs-cAMP-PKA-SIK3-HDAC4/5 pathway as the main mediator of growth plate abnormalities in JMC. Serum calcium was elevated and endogenous PTH was suppressed in T410R mice, and both parameters could be normalized by acute injection of an optimized PTH inverse agonist peptide. The T410R mouse thus represents a stable animal model of JMC that recapitulates the abnormalities in skeletal development and mineral ion homeostasis which characterize this disease. The mice should help efforts to further define the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the JMC phenotype and to develop a potential mode of therapy.",

The physical and biological mechanisms of lumen expansion have been explored. However, how cells communicate and coordinate with the surrounding lumen, leading to continuous tube expansion to a defined geometry, is crucial but remains elusive. In this study, we utilized the ascidian notochord tube as a model to address the underlying mechanisms. We first quantitatively measured and calculated the geometric parameters and found that tube expansion experienced three distinct phases. During the growth processes, we identified and experimentally demonstrated that both Rho GTPase Cdc42 signaling-mediated cell cortex distribution and the stability of tight junctions (TJs) were essential for lumen opening and tube expansion. Based on these experimental data, a conservation-laws-based tube expansion theory was developed, considering critical cell communication pathways, including secretory activity through vesicles, asymmetric cortex tension driven anisotropic lumen geometry, as well as the TJs gate barrier function. Moreover, by estimating the critical tube expansion parameters from experimental observation, we successfully predicted tube growth kinetics under different conditions through the combination of computational and experimental approaches, highlighting the coupling between actomyosin-based active mechanics and hydraulic processes. Taken together, our findings identify the critical cellular regulatory factors that drive the biological tube expansion and maintain its stability.",

How the geographic breadth of a sample impacts observations of rare, deleterious variants is unclear, even though such variants are of particular interest for biomedical and evolutionary applications. Here, in order to gain insight into the effects of sample design on ascertained genetic variants, we formulate a stochastic model of dispersal, genetic drift, selection, mutation, and geographically concentrated sampling. We use this model to understand the effects of the geographic breadth of sampling effort on the discovery of negatively selected variants. We find that samples which are more geographically broad will discover a greater number of variants as compared to geographically narrow samples (an effect we label “discovery”); though the variants will be detected at lower average frequency than in narrow samples (e.g., as singletons, an effect we label “dilution”). Importantly, these effects are amplified for larger sample sizes and fitness effects. We validate these results using both population genetic simulations and empirical analyses in the UK Biobank. Our results are particularly important in two contexts: the association of large-effect rare variants with particular phenotypes and the inference of negative selection from allele frequency data. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of considering geographic breadth when designing and carrying out genetic studies, especially at biobank scale.",

          "abstract": "Since our first steps in life, we are forming incidental associations between diverse stimuli across various sensory modalities that influence our future choices and facilitate adaptation to environmental fluctuations. Daily behavior is usually governed by indirect incidental associations among sensory cues that have never been explicitly paired with a reinforcer. This phenomenon, known as higher-order conditioning, can be systematically investigated in laboratory animals through specific behavioral paradigms such as sensory preconditioning protocols. In this study, using “Targeted Recombination in Active Populations” (TRAP2) transgenic mice, we have interrogated which are the brain areas orchestrating the encoding of associations between olfactory and gustatory stimuli and the expression of an aversive odor–taste sensory preconditioning paradigm. We identified neuronal ensembles within the basolateral amygdala specifically activated during odor–taste associations. To demonstrate the causal involvement of this brain region in our sensory preconditioning task, we inhibited it during the preconditioning phase (i.e., incidental associations) using a chemogenetic approach, which caused a clear impairment of the mediated responses. In addition, using retrograde tracers in the basolateral amygdala of TRAP2 mice, we observed that the projections from the lateral entorhinal cortex to the basolateral amygdala are particularly activated during odor–taste associations. Notably, the chemogenetic inhibition of this brain circuit impaired the mediated aversion performance in our sensory preconditioning task. Overall, these findings highlight the amygdala as a pivotal modulator of incidental associations during an aversive sensory preconditioning task and point toward a brain circuit crucially involved in these complex cognitive processes.",

Understanding population-level diversity is also essential for tracking sources and revealing detailed pathways of transmission and spread. For bacteria, culturing, isolating, and sequencing the large number of individual colonies required to adequately sample diversity can be prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. While sequencing directly from a mixed population will show variants among reads, they cannot be linked to reveal allele combinations associated with phylogenetic inheritance patterns. Here, we describe the theory and method for using population sequencing directly from a mixed sample, along with a minimal number of individually sequenced colonies, to describe the phylogenetic diversity of a population without haplotype reconstruction. To demonstrate the utility of population sequencing in capturing phylogenetic diversity, we compared isogenic clones to population sequences of Burkholderia pseudomallei from sputum of a single patient. Our results point to the pathogen population being highly structured, suggesting that for some pathogens, sputum sampling may preserve structuring in the lungs and thus present a noninvasive alternative to understanding colonization, movement, and pathogen/host interactions. We also analyzed population sequences of Staphylococcus aureus derived from different people and different body sites to reveal directionality of transmission between hosts and across body sites, demonstrating the power and utility for characterizing the spread of disease and identification of reservoirs at the finest levels. We anticipate that population sequencing and analysis can be broadly applied to accelerate research in a wide range of fields reliant on a foundational understanding of population phylogenetic diversity.",

While substantial progress has been made, current magnetic programming techniques are inherently tied to template-based and sequential fabrication processes. These processes limit scalability, precision, and programmability. Here, we present a template-free, integrative strategy that leverages interlayer stress-induced 3D shape morphing in xerogel-PDMS bilayer materials triggered by temperature variations. This process induces preprogrammed deformation and fixes the 3D structure via interlayer stress and solid–liquid phase transition. It is akin to an insect encased in amber, resulting in a soft machine with precisely tailored magnetic domains upon saturated magnetization. The approach eliminates the need for predesigned molds, which offers scalable, template-free programmable magnetization, reducing time and labor costs. The versatility of this method is demonstrated through reconfigurable mechanical behavior in kirigami metamaterial structures, information encryption, and multilegged millirobots. Moreover, by incorporating a nonmagnetic PDMS layer, laser-based engraving and ablation allow simultaneous control of interlayer stress and material properties. This facilitates precise regulation of stress-induced deformation and magnetically responsive regions with 20 μm resolution and over 1.8 T magnetization strength. This template-free 3D magnetization strategy significantly enhances design flexibility, machining precision, and mass production. It paves the way for advanced multiscale and programmable soft magnetic devices.",

By creating a marine bacteria–mediated RNA interference approach, we show that myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), a critical immune adaptor for Toll-like receptor and interleukin pathways, is necessary for the stimulation of metamorphosis in response to bacteria. In addition to a developmental role, we show that MyD88 is necessary for survival during exposure to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , showing that Hydroides utilizes MyD88 during both development and an immune response.

          "abstract": "Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are a class of plant hormones that regulate various aspects of plant growth and development, and several key GA deactivation enzymes have been identified. In rice, non-13-hydroxylated GAs have been shown to be deactivated via 16α,17-epoxidation by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE (EUI/CYP714D1). Although 16,17-dihydro-16α,17-epoxyGA 4 (16α,17-epoxyGA 4 ), the product of EUI from bioactive GA 4 , has shown weak bioactivity on rice seedlings, how 16α,17-epoxyGAs are further deactivated remains elusive. Here, we identify the EUI2 gene, which regulates internode elongation in rice, using a map-based cloning strategy. EUI2 encodes an epoxide hydrolase that hydrolyzes 16α,17-epoxyGAs to 16,17-dihydro-16α,17-dihydroxyGAs. The eui2 mutants are taller than wild-type plants but are shorter than the eui mutants. However, the levels of known bioactive GAs in the uppermost internodes are not significantly increased in the eui2 mutants. Instead, we show that the eui2 mutants accumulate 16α,17-epoxyGA 4 to high levels. We also show that exogenously applied 16α,17-epoxyGA 4 is significantly active in elongating the uppermost internode, although not as potent as GA 4 . Furthermore, we demonstrate that 16α,17-epoxyGA 4 can directly interact with the rice GA receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1, in vitro. Taken together, the sequential action of EUI and EUI2 results in the stepwise deactivation of GAs during internode elongation in rice. Our data also suggest that the accumulation of a weakly active GA contributes to the mildly tall phenotype of the eui2 mutants.",

The very end of the Heinrich stadial (HS) characterizing Termination IV (T-IV, ca. 343 to 333 ka ago) shows a 250-y-long jump in greenhouse gas concentrations, followed by a 1.3 ka gradual decline back to the initial concentration. During this so-called overshoot, CO 2 and CH 4 reach their highest levels (about 303 ppm and 800 ppb, respectively) over the past 800 ka prior to industrialization. The jump in CO 2 is not accompanied by a change in δ 13 C–CO 2, suggesting that multiple mechanisms contributed to the exceptionally elevated CO 2 values. Following the jump, a slow 0.2‰ enrichment in δ 13 C–CO 2 occurs. We propose that during the jump, the sudden resumption of deepwater formation in the North Atlantic (NA) triggered an amplified release of CO 2 from the Southern Ocean (SO) by a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the SO westerlies, potentially in combination with a rapid land carbon release. The latter is expected from temporally enhanced wildfire activity related to higher fuel load and regionally changing weather conditions in connection to the ITCZ shift. A combination of marine proxy records and box model simulation suggests that the δ 13 C–CO 2 decrease expected from these processes is compensated by a net temperature increase in global sea surface temperature (SST) at the time of the AMOC resumption.",

The hydrogel is easy to prepare, has self-healing properties and excellent biocompatibility. Upon administration, the hydrogel first releases pirfenidone to inhibit collagen production, weakening the ECM, followed by the release of paclitaxel, which improves tumor penetration. The effectiveness of this sequential drug delivery system was validated in both oral squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer models, a classic example of a tumor with abundant ECM. In vitro experiments showed controlled sequential release profiles, whereas in vivo experiments using cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models revealed that the hydrogel was more effective at tumor suppression compared to traditional methods. Single administration of the hydrogel led to long-term localized drug release, maintaining higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents in the tumor tissue and effectively reducing the tumor volume.

However, the environmental cues that activate EnvZ/OmpR to trigger pathogenicity have remained unclear, limiting our understanding of host–pathogen interactions. Here, we demonstrate that in Vibrio parahaemolyticus , a major etiological agent of seafood-associated gastroenteritis, EnvZ functions as a direct ferric iron (Fe 3+ ) sensor governing virulence programs. Fe 3+ -EnvZ interaction triggers kinase phosphorylation and activation, enabling transcriptional control of biofilm formation, swarming motility, and type 3/6 secretion systems.

The variants in CACNA1D lead to altered channel dynamics in vitro. A mouse model of the E427K variant has a normal circadian period under constant darkness but displays altered phase shifts in response to light in the subjective night at circadian time (CT) 16 and CT22. Overall, these experiments establish CACNA1D as an FASP gene with altered entrainment, highlighting the ability of human genetics to uncover novel aspects of human circadian regulation.",

Despite significant efforts to develop biomarkers of aging, few studies have focused on biomarkers of healthspan. We developed a proteomics-based signature of healthspan [healthspan proteomic score (HPS)] using proteomic data from the Olink Explore 3072 assay in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (53,018 individuals and 2,920 proteins). A lower HPS was associated with higher mortality risk and several age-related conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart failure, cancer, myocardial infarction, dementia, and stroke. HPS showed superior predictive accuracy for these outcomes compared to other biological age measures. Proteins associated with HPS were enriched in hallmark pathways such as immune response, inflammation, cellular signaling, and metabolic regulation. The external validity was evaluated using the Essential Hypertension Epigenetics study with proteomic data also from the Olink Explore 3072 and complementary epigenetic data, making it a valuable tool for assessing healthspan and as a potential surrogate marker to complement existing proteomic and epigenetic biological age measures in geroscience-guided studies.",

Through comprehensive transcriptome deep sequencing (RNA-seq) and polysome profiling analyses, we elucidated the dynamic interplay of regulation at the transcriptional and translational levels during germination. We show that delayed germination in some ribosome-defective mutants is partially regulated by the gene ABSCISIC ACID DEFICIENT2 ( ABA2 ), with an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5′ untranslated region that represses translation of the downstream ORF encoding ABA2. In addition, disrupting rice OsABA2 uORF inhibited preharvest sprouting (PHS). Furthermore, we found two main haplotypes for the uORF among rice cultivars that result in different OsABA2 expression levels, thus contributing to diverse PHS phenotypes.

          "abstract": "Prior studies have indicated that the transcription factor Creb5 is expressed in the joint interzone, which contains the progenitors for all synovial joint tissues in both mouse and human embryos. In the absence of Creb5 function, most synovial joint interzones fail to form and the cartilage templates in the long bones remain fused. This earlier work did not clarify whether Creb5 initiates a cascade of signaling molecules, such as growth and differentiation factor 5 (Gdf5) and Wnt-family members, that in turn induce the formation of the joint interzone, or instead directly activates the expression of joint interzone markers. In the present study, an integrative analysis of the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and Creb5-occupancy in joint progenitors revealed that Creb5 directly binds to both its own two promoters and to the regulatory regions of Gdf5 and Sfrp2 , each of whose expression in the joint interzone is Creb5-dependent. Functional enhancer analysis indicated that Creb5 binding sites in either the two Creb5 promoters, or in Gdf5 and Sfrp2 regulatory elements are necessary for these sequences to drive transgene expression in the developing synovial joints. While Creb5 directly drives Gdf5 and Sfrp2 expression in the inner joint interzone, Creb5 activates Barx1 expression specifically in the outer joint interzone. Our findings indicate that Creb5 initiates a regulatory network that both promotes the formation of synovial joints, and subsequently activates distinct transcriptional targets in the inner versus the outer regions of the joint interzone, thus regionalizing gene expression in the developing joint.",

          "abstract": "Recent approvals of polymeric adenosine diphosphate ribose (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for BRCA-mutant metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer necessitate an understanding of the factors that shape sensitivity and resistance. Reversion mutations that restore homologous recombination (HR) repair are detected in ~50 to 80% of BRCA-mutant patients who respond but subsequently relapse, but there is currently little insight into why only ~50% of BRCA-mutant patients display upfront resistance. To address this question, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genomic determinants of PARPi resistance in murine Brca2 Δ/Δ prostate organoids genetically engineered in a manner that precludes the development of reversion mutations. Remarkably, we recovered multiple independent single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting three different members ( Cdt1, Cdc6, and Dbf4 ) of the DNA prereplication complex (pre-RC), each of which independently conferred resistance to olaparib and the next-generation PARP-1 selective inhibitor AZD5305. Moreover, sensitivity to PARP inhibition was restored in Brca2 Δ/Δ , Cdc6-depleted prostate cells by knockdown of geminin, a negative regulator of Cdt1, further implicating the critical role of a functional pre-RC complex in PARPi sensitivity. Furthermore, ~50% of CRPC tumors have copy number loss of pre-RC complex genes, particularly CDT1 . Mechanistically, prostate cells with impaired pre-RC activity displayed rapid resolution of olaparib-induced DNA damage as well as protection from replication fork degradation caused by Brca2 loss, providing insight into how Brca2-mutant cancer cells can escape cell death from replication stress induced by PARP inhibition in the absence of HR repair. Of note, a pharmacologic inhibitor that targets the CDT1/geminin complex (AF615) restored sensitivity to AZD5305, providing a potential translational avenue to enhance sensitivity to PARP inhibition.",

Here, we show that pallidocortical neurons project to diverse motor and nonmotor cortical regions, are organized topographically in the GPe, and segregate into at least two distinct electrophysiological and molecular phenotypes. In addition, we find that the GPe receives direct synaptic input from deep layers of diverse motor and nonmotor cortical regions, some of which form reciprocal connections onto pallidocortical neurons.

Its analgesic effect is mainly attributed to its metabolite, AM404, acting on cannabinoid receptors or TRPV1 channels in central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Here, we show that AM404 is produced by primary sensory neurons. It inhibits sodium current in nociceptor neurons, blocking action potential (AP) generation and reducing nocifensive behavior in naïve and inflamed rats. We demonstrated that this analgesic effect of AM404 is mediated by its direct inhibition of nociceptive voltage-gated sodium channels (Na V ) 1.8 and 1.7 via the local anesthetic binding site. The Na V 1.8 and 1.7 inhibition was specific for AM404 and not observed with other metabolites of paracetamol. Our findings suggest that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is mediated mainly by direct AM404-induced inhibition of nociceptive sodium channels at the peripheral nociceptor neurons.

We demonstrate a general broadband ellipsometric approach to measure d -parameters at a gold–air interface across the visible–ultraviolet regimes. Gold is found to spill-in and spill-out at different frequencies. We also observe gold’s Bennett mode, a surface-dipole resonance associated with a pole of the d -parameter, around 2.5 eV.

Understanding and controlling factors affecting DNA–RNA strand displacement reactions is necessary to enable control of processes such as CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. By combining multiscale modeling with strand displacement experiments, we show that the distribution of bases within the displacement domain has a very strong effect on reaction kinetics, a feature unique to DNA–RNA hybrid strand displacement. Merely by redistributing bases within a displacement domain of fixed base composition, we are able to design sequences whose reaction rates span more than four orders of magnitude. We extensively characterize this effect in reactions involving the invasion of dsDNA by an RNA strand, as well as the invasion of a hybrid duplex by a DNA strand. In all-DNA strand displacement reactions, we find a predictable but relatively weak sequence dependence, confirming that DNA–RNA strand displacement permits far more thermodynamic and kinetic control than its all-DNA counterpart. We show that oxNA, a recently introduced coarse-grained model of DNA–RNA hybrids, can reproduce trends in experimentally observed reaction rates. We also develop a simple kinetic model for predicting strand displacement rates. On the basis of these results, we argue that base distribution effects may play an important role in natural R-loop formation and in the function of the guide RNAs that direct CRISPR-Cas systems.",

Across four expeditions to the North Pacific transition zone, we document a repeated supply of isotopically light iron from an atmospheric source in spring, reflecting an estimated 39 ± 9 % anthropogenic contribution to the surface ocean iron budget. Expression of iron-stress genes in metatranscriptomes, and evidence for colimitation of ecosystem productivity by iron and nitrogen, indicates that enhanced iron supply should spur spring phytoplankton blooms, accelerating the seasonal drawdown of nitrate delivered by winter mixing. This effect is consistent with regional trends in satellite ocean color, which show a shorter, more intense spring bloom period, followed by an earlier arrival of oligotrophic conditions in summer. Continued iron emissions may contribute to poleward shifts in transitional marine ecosystems, compounding the anticipated impacts from ocean warming and stratification.",

In this study, we characterized the dynamics of CRE activation and TF occupancy during zebrafish EHT, and found that the enhancer–promoter collaboration forms the basis for EHT. Moreover, a ubiquitously expressed TF AP-1 collaborates with diverse lineage-specific TFs to remodel enhancer landscape. Deletion of AP-1 family member Jund impaired hematopoietic specification, resulting from the enhanced endothelial identity in the HEC.

Biomass burning emissions (BBEs) over the boreal region have strongly increased during the last decade and are expected to continue increasing as the climate warms. Climate models simulate aerosol processes, yet historical and future Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) simulations have no active fire component, and BBEs are prescribed as external forcings. Here, we show that CMIP6 used future boreal BBEs scenarios with unrealistic near-zero trends that have a large impact on climate trends. By running sensitivity experiments with ramped up boreal emissions based on observed trends, we find that increasing boreal BBEs reduces global warming by 12% and Arctic warming by 38%, reducing the loss of sea ice. Tropical precipitation shifts southward as a result of the hemispheric difference in boreal aerosol forcing and subsequent temperature response. These changes stem from the impact of aerosols on clouds, increasing cloud droplet number concentration, cloud optical depth, and low cloud cover, ultimately reducing surface shortwave flux over northern latitudes. Our results highlight the importance of realistic boreal BBEs in climate model simulations and the need for improved understanding of boreal emission trends and aerosol–climate interactions.",

Recently however, single-cell technologies have uncovered heterogeneity within these populations, indicating that individual cells may operate as independently regulated units. Using high-resolution tools such as single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (sm-FISH) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we investigated the contributions of individual and the collective of fetal Leydig cells to androgen production over time during mouse testis development. Temporal profiles of intratesticular androgens alongside the expression of steroidogenic pathway genes ( Star, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and Hsd3b1 ) from prenatal to perinatal testes demonstrated that the peak in gene expression preceded the peak in androgen production. Spatially, steroidogenic cells were initially observed to be concentrated toward the anterior–posterior poles along the center of the dorsal–ventral axis of the fetal testis at embryonic day (E) 13 and then expanded to a uniform distribution by E16. Next, sm-FISH using probes for individual steroidogenic pathway genes exposed the following findings: gene transcription and processing of individual and combinations of steroidogenic pathway genes are not synchronized among fetal Leydig cells; and some fetal Leydig cells express incomplete sets of genes. Further, sm-FISH and scRNA-seq data corroborated the presence of fetal Leydig and other interstitial cell types harboring incomplete sets of steroidogenic pathway genes throughout developmental stages. Taken together, these findings highlight that fetal steroidogenic gene expression is tightly regulated and that transcript presence among interstitial cell types promotes the possibility that optimal androgen biosynthesis results from a cooperative effort among neighboring steroidogenic cells.",

Here, we explore the self-assembly of neural circuits in Hydra , an organism with a simple nervous system but no centralized information processing, to enhance the understanding of nervous system evolution. We define self-assembly as spontaneous organization of neurons into functional circuits without requiring a prespecified structural template. In this context, the N4 neuronal circuit, which we have previously found to be particularly important in the feeding of the animal, develops in embryos through activity-driven self-assembly, a process in which intrinsic calcium activity drives connectivity and synchronization among spatially distributed neurons over time. Gap junctions and vesicle-mediated communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells drive rapid assembly, with the embryo’s prospective oral region exhibiting the highest neuronal density. An artificial electrical circuit–based model as a biophysically inspired simulation demonstrates dynamic increases in synchronization over time, along with predictions for selective dynamic adaptions of connections. Environmental factors, like temperature and an absent microbiome, modify neural architecture, suggesting the existence of a certain adaptability during neural development. We propose that these fundamental features originated in the last common bilaterian ancestor, supporting the hypothesis that the basic architecture of the nervous system is universal. Since in the natural habitat of Hydra both temperature fluctuations and changes in the microbiome can occur, our work not only illuminates a fundamental developmental process but also may guide environmental and evolutionary studies by explaining how organisms adapt to environmental variations.",

          "abstract": "Shape-shifting structures can transform and recover their shapes in response to external stimuli, but they often lack programmable, clock-like control over spatiotemporal deformation and motion, especially after stimuli are removed. Achieving autonomous, time-regulated spatiotemporal motion remains a grand challenge. Here, we present an autonomous delayed-jumping metashell that integrates viscoelastic materials with monostable architected structures to address this limitation. The metashell with tunable prestored elastic energy features an internal time clock enabling programmable autonomous delayed snapping and jumping after actuation removal. The delay spans from seconds to 2.4 d, with jumping heights decreasing from over 9 to 0.5 body heights. We demonstrate its utility in autonomous explosive seed dispersal devices, achieving wide-area omnidirectional distribution with high survival rates. This strategy paves the way for creating autonomous spatiotemporal shape-shifting structures with broad applications in robotics, morphing matter, ecology, and intelligent systems.",

          "abstract": "The protein α-syn adopts a wide variety of conformations including an intrinsically disordered monomeric form and an α-helical-rich membrane-associated form that is thought to play an important role in cellular membrane processes. However, despite the high affinity of α-syn for membranes, evidence that the α-helical form is adopted inside cells has been indirect. DNP-assisted solid-state NMR on frozen cellular samples can report directly on the entire conformational ensemble. By controlling the distribution of the DNP agent throughout the cellular biomass, such experiments can provide quantitative information upon the entire structural ensemble or provide information about spatially resolved subpopulations. When the polarization agent is dispersed homogeneously throughout the cell, a minority of the α-syn inside HEK293 cells adopts a highly α-helical-rich conformation. When the polarization agent is peripherally localized, the α-helical-rich conformation predominates, indicating that it is preferentially adopted near the cellular periphery. This demonstrates how selectively altering the spatial distribution of the DNP agent can be a powerful tool to observe spatially distinct structural ensembles. This approach paves the way for more nuanced investigations into the conformations that proteins adopt in different areas of the cell.",

          "abstract": "The Earth system model CLIMBER-2 has been used in past work to successfully reproduce the glacial/interglacial cycles of the Plio–Pleistocene and the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) from predominantly 40 to 100 ky timescale oscillatory behavior as a function of declining volcanic outgassing and regolith removal. In this study, we further examine the sensitivity of this previous work to varying prescribed levels of volcanic outgassing and regolith extent and the long-term dynamics of the global carbon cycle, affecting the exchange and partitioning of carbon between different Earth system reservoirs and therefore global atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. As volcanic outgassing decreases, CO 2 and land carbon storage decrease, while ocean carbon storage, including CaCO 3 sediment, increases. At volcanic outgassing levels below a threshold value of roughly 5.7 Tmol C yr −1 , sea level decreases due to land ice formation, leading to increased carbon accumulation in the ocean and decreased carbon in the CaCO 3 sediment reservoir. Our previous finding of strong hysteresis and path dependence in the glacial/interglacial alternation history [J. Carrillo et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2322926121 (2024)] appears to be a tenuous climate feature, dependent on the precise representation of carbon cycle processes and, specifically, the numerical precision used in the calculation of certain key state variables in the model’s carbon cycle.",

          "abstract": "What is the neural substrate that enables the cerebral cortex to control a single mystacial vibrissa and orchestrate its movement? To answer this question, we injected rabies virus into the intrinsic muscle that protracts the rat C3 vibrissa and used retrograde transneuronal transport to identify the cortical neurons that influence the muscle. A surprisingly diverse set of cortical areas is the origin of disynaptic control over the motoneurons that influence the C3 protractor. More than two thirds of these layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) are dispersed in frontal and parietal areas outside the primary motor cortex (vM1). This observation emphasizes the importance of descending motor commands from non-primary motor areas. More than a third of the L5PNs originate from somatosensory areas, such as the barrel field (vS1). The barrel field has been long considered a prototypic model system for studying sensory processing at the level of the cerebral cortex. Even so, we find that the number of L5PNs in vS1, and even their peak density, rivals the number and peak density of L5PNs in vM1. Thus, our results emphasize the importance of the barrel field in processing motor output. The distribution of L5PNs in vM1 and vS1 leads us to propose a model of vibrissa protraction in which vM1 output results in protraction, and vS1 output results in reciprocal inhibition (suppression) of protraction. This paired initiation and suppression of complementary movements may be a general feature of the descending output from the rodent M1 and S1.",

          "abstract": "Many remarkable phenotypes have repeatedly occurred across vast evolutionary distances. When convergent traits emerge on the tree of life, they are sometimes driven by the same underlying gene families, while other times, many different gene families are involved. Conversely, a gene family may be repeatedly recruited for a single trait or many different traits. To understand the general rules governing convergence at both genomic and phenotypic levels, we systematically tested associations between 56 binary metabolic traits and gene count in 14,785 gene families from 993 Saccharomycotina yeasts. Using a recently developed phylogenetic approach that reduces spurious correlations, we found that gene family expansion and contraction were significantly linked to trait gain and loss in 45/56 (80%) traits. While 595/739 (81%) significant gene families were associated with only one trait, we also identified several “keystone” gene families that were significantly associated with up to 13/56 (23%) of all traits. Strikingly, most of these families are known to encode metabolic enzymes and transporters, including all members of the industrially relevant MAL tose fermentation loci in the baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These results indicate that convergent evolution on the gene family level may be more widespread across deeper timescales than previously believed.",

          "abstract": "To fertilize an oocyte, mammalian spermatozoa must undergo a maturation step known as capacitation that takes place after ejaculation. Protein kinase A (PKA) plays a fundamental role in capacitation in all mammalian species. Before capacitation, PKA is maintained in an inactive state where the catalytic subunits are bound to a dimer of inhibitory regulatory subunits. A key element in the regulation of PKA lies in its intracellular compartmentalization achieved by docking at A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP). Despite the crucial role of the modulation of local PKA activity in fertilization, its localization and mechanism of compartmentalization are not well understood. Here, we approach this problem using quantitative laser scanning microscopy and superresolution imaging to dissect the interactions and relocalization of PKA subunits during capacitation. We find that in the resting state, both catalytic and regulatory subunits colocalize close to the axoneme. Upon capacitation, the PKA regulatory subunits, but not the catalytic subunits, relocate to a quadrilateral structure along the flagellum principal piece, in the vicinity of AKAP4 and the CatSper channel signaling complex. Furthermore, this quadrilateral localization of PKA regulatory subunits disappears in sperm from CatSper1 knockout mice. The sharp difference between the localization of PKA regulatory subunits in capacitated vs. noncapacitated sperm cells demonstrates its suitability as a biomarker for identifying capacitation, an enduring problem in the study of sperm physiology.",

Our results demonstrate a rich anthropogenic landscape created by small-scale ancestral Menominee communities, located near the northern limits of maize agriculture.

          "abstract": "The recent Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) sets ambitious goals but no clear pathway for how zero loss of important biodiversity areas and halting human-induced extinction of threatened species will be achieved. We assembled a multi-taxa tracking dataset (11 million geopositions from 15,845 tracked individuals across 121 species) to provide a global assessment of space use of highly mobile marine megafauna, showing that 63% of the area that they cover is used 80% of the time as important migratory corridors or residence areas. The GBF 30% threshold (Target 3) will be insufficient for marine megafauna’s effective conservation, leaving important areas exposed to major anthropogenic threats. Coupling area protection with mitigation strategies (e.g., fishing regulation, wildlife-traffic separation) will be essential to reach international goals and conserve biodiversity.",

          "abstract": "The complex morphological evolution of lithium metal at the solid-state electrolyte interface limits performance of solid-state batteries, leading to inhomogeneous reactions and contact loss. Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we developed an interfacial self-regulation concept in which a deformable secondary phase dynamically aggregates at the interface in response to local electro-chemo-mechanical stimuli, enhancing contact. The stripping of a lithium electrode that contains 5 to 20 mole % electrochemically inactive sodium domains causes spontaneous sodium accumulation across the interface, with the sodium deforming to attain intimate electrical contact without blocking lithium transport. This process, characterized with operando x-ray tomography and electron microscopy, mitigates voiding and improves cycling at low stack pressures. The counterintuitive strategy of adding electrochemically inactive alkali metal to improve performance demonstrates the utility of interfacial self-regulation for solid-state batteries.",

Individual organisms, such as insects, have the potential to serve as natural reaction platforms in which high densities of multiple enzymes can perform new and complex reactions. We report an “in-insect” unnatural product synthesis that takes advantage of their xenobiotic metabolism. We selectively transform belt- and ring-shaped molecular nanocarbons into otherwise difficult-to-prepare derivatives in which oxygen atoms are inserted into aromatic rings. Cytochrome P450 variants are most likely the enzymes responsible for this reaction. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations indicated a possible mode of substrate incorporation into the enzyme and an unconventional mechanism of direct oxygen insertion into carbon–carbon bonds.",

          "abstract": "Anaerobic metabolisms are thought to dominate nitrogen cycling in anoxic marine zones (AMZs). However, thriving populations of aerobic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in AMZs challenge this assumption and remain unexplained. Using theory and modeling, we show how periodic oxygen intrusions sustain aerobic NOB in AMZs alongside more competitive aerobic heterotrophs. Ecological theory, supported by numerical simulations and genomics, frames NOB as opportunists exploiting a fleeting supply of oxygen. Consistent with in situ observations, simulated NOB contribute substantially to total oxygen consumption at AMZ boundaries, which implies that NOB may provide a major stabilizing feedback to AMZs. Fine-scale ocean currents increase the metabolic diversity in AMZs, which could stabilize AMZ volume under climate change.",

Most investment focused on reactive law enforcement—rangers, tracking dogs, access controls, and detection cameras—which helped achieve &gt;700 poacher arrests. Yet we found no statistical evidence that these interventions reduced poaching (horn demand, wealth inequality, embedded criminal syndicates, and corruption likely combine to drive even high-risk poaching). By contrast, reducing poacher reward through dehorning (2284 rhinos across eight reserves) achieved large (~78%) and abrupt reductions in poaching using 1.2% of the budget. Some poaching of dehorned rhinos continued because poachers targeted horn stumps and regrowth, signaling the need for regular dehorning alongside judicious use of law enforcement.",

Integrated carbon and nitrogen management holds the potential for a 74% reduction in nitrogen losses to air and water and a 91% decrease in carbon emissions to the atmosphere by 2060. Compared with separate control of carbon or nitrogen, integrated management delivers an additional reduction of 1.8 million tons of nitrogen and 26.5 million tons of carbon by 2060, bringing out a 37% decrease in unit abatement cost and a net societal benefit of 1384 billion USD.",

Mutations in MC4R and ADCY3 as well as ciliary dysfunction lead to obesity, but how melanocortin signaling works in cilia remains unclear. Using mouse random germline mutagenesis, we identified two missense mutations in G protein–coupled receptor 45 (Gpr45) that lead to obesity through hyperphagia. GPR45 was expressed in paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), where it localized to cilia and recruited Gα s to increase ciliary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) via ADCY3. GPR45 colocalized with MC4R in PVH cilia and promoted ciliary MC4R activation. Loss of GPR45 in the PVH or MC4R + neurons caused obesity. These findings establish GPR45 as a key regulator of the ciliary melanocortin system, bridging MC4R and ADCY3.",

Moreover, considerable variability was observed in associations between taurine and age-related changes in health outcomes pertaining to gross motor function and energy homeostasis. Our results suggest that changes in circulating taurine are not a universal feature of aging and that its pleiotropic effects may be dependent on the temporal and physiological context of each individual.",

We identify a combination of vascular-inducing factors that give rise to cardiac vascularized organoids with a spatially organized and branched vascular network. To show the broader utility of our vascularization strategy, we use the same vascular-inducing factors to produce hepatic vascularized organoids.

In this work, we report structures of imitation switch (ISWI) bound to the nucleosome during active ATP hydrolysis and remodeling, revealing conformational transitions of the remodeling motor across the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) cycle. The DNA strands were distorted accordingly, showing one full base-pair bulge and a loss of histone contact at the site of motor binding in the adenosine diphosphate* (ADP*) and apo* (unbound) states. We also identified several important elements for regulation of the remodeling activity. Notably, an enzyme conformation exiting the remodeling cycle reveals a linker DNA–sensing brake mechanism. Together, our findings elucidate a multistate model of ISWI action, providing a comprehensive mechanism of DNA translocation and regulation underpinning chromatin remodeling.",

However, such liquid-like membraneless bodies can undergo aberrant liquid-to-solid transitions into amyloid-like pathological species, which necessitates their efficient clearance by the cellular protein quality control machinery comprising molecular chaperones. We present a unique case to demonstrate that a heat shock protein 40 (Ydj1) promotes the heterotypic phase separation of intrinsically disordered tau via a multitude of interactions. Using multicolor imaging, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, vibrational Raman spectroscopy, and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, we unmask the crucial molecular events associated with heterotypic phase separation of tau. We show that the presence of Ydj1 within condensates abolishes phase transitions into amyloids, unlike tau-only droplets that spontaneously mature into amyloid fibrils. We identify the amyloidogenic hexapeptide motifs located in the hydrophobic microtubule-binding region of tau that interacts with the peptide-binding regions of Ydj1 promoting tau-Ydj1 condensate formation. Our results provide mechanistic underpinnings of condensate-mediated protein homeostasis.",

Mitochondrial activity, biomass, and efficiency are critical to this balance. While activity and biomass are well characterized in PD pathology, mitochondrial metabolic efficiency remains insufficiently explored. Our previous studies showed that the protein product of PD-associated gene DJ-1 modulates metabolic efficiency through its interaction with the F1Fo-ATP-synthase β subunit (β-sub). Here, using proximity ligation assay (PLA), we compared mitochondrial DJ-1-β-sub association in distinct mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neuronal subpopulations and their intracellular compartments of PD and control postmortem brains. In PD brains, DJ-1-β-sub-PLA was lower than control in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) somata and neurites but unchanged in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. In PD and control cases, the PLA signal was reduced in distal neurites of SNpc compared to VTA neurons. These intracellular and region-specific differences suggest that impaired mitochondrial efficiency may contribute to the differential vulnerability of mesDA neurons in PD.",

Optogenetic inactivation of Zelda during regeneration disrupted patterning, induced cell fate errors, and caused morphological defects yet had no effect on normal wing development. Using Cleavage Under Targets &amp; Release Using Nuclease, we identified targets of Zelda important for the end of regeneration, including genes that control wing margin and vein specification, compartment identity, and cell adhesion. We also found that GAGA factor and Fork head similarly coordinate patterning after regeneration and that chromatin regions bound by Zelda increase in accessibility during regeneration. Thus, Zelda orchestrates the transition from regeneration to normal gene expression, highlighting a fundamental difference between developmental and regeneration patterning in the wing disc.",

In this context, 25% of the area (formerly blue hue) is turning light blue or green, while the remaining 11% becomes bluer, mainly concentrating in the low-latitude oceans. This study further identifies a “direct” notable impact of both sea surface temperature (SST) and climate on ocean colorimetry tendency and anomaly, especially in the low-latitude oceans. Extreme SST events cause “distinct” ocean colorimetry anomalies, although 94% of cases involve relatively small SST fluctuations. Causal analysis reveals important impacts of climate change on equatorial ocean dynamics, particularly ENSO events. Our findings prove the low-latitude oceans as one of the core changing regions that respond to climate change in the early 21st century.",

Heterologous expression of wild-type SH and variants in Xenopus laevis oocytes reveals the viroporin as a chloride channel, with transport facilitated by conserved hydroxyl-carrying residues lining the pore.

Using lymphoid progenitor–tracking systems, we report tissue segregation, a unique differentiation pathway, and the functions of L-cDCs. Notably, L-cDC2s are predominantly distributed in barrier tissues such as the lungs and skin. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the enrichment of lymphocyte signature genes in L-cDCs. We identified lymphocyte-primed cDC precursors, which are distinct from pDC-like cells, as sources of L-cDCs. Compared with M-cDC2s, L-cDC2s weakly primed T cells under low-dose antigen stimulation and preferentially promoted T helper 2 (T H 2) differentiation under sufficient antigenic stimulation. These results suggest the diverse developmental pathways of L-cDCs and imply the contribution of L-cDCs to tolerance and hyperresponses to T H 2-related antigens in barrier tissues.",

Here, we reported a unique Pt–C/TiO 2 photocatalyst with Pt quantum dots (Pt QD ) and C-coordinated Pt single atoms (Pt SA ). Under the given experimental conditions, the hydrogen production rate reaches 43.2 mmol hour −1 with 70 mg of the photocatalyst.

Profiles and samples collected directly beneath Bud’s wake revealed rapid OMZ shoaling of 29 to 50 meters, reaching depths as shallow as 41 meters. Untargeted mass spectrometry–based characterization of organic matter, along with elevated particulate organic carbon and chlorophyll concentrations, demonstrated production and accumulation of distinct organic compounds—including phytoplankton biomarkers—within a hurricane-generated phytoplankton bloom. 16 S rRNA transcripts from active microbes were dominated by degraders of phytoplankton-derived organic matter near the surface and by anaerobic bacteria (including sulfate-reducing bacteria) within the shoaled OMZ—indicating rapid microbial responses.

After defining a classical nuclear limit that is consistent with the quantum-classical equilibrium, we include nuclear quantum effects through a variational polaron transformation of the high-frequency vibrational modes. This approach is validated by comparison with fully quantum-mechanical benchmark calculations and applied to three prototypical light-harvesting complexes. For light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria, the inter-ring transfer is 1.5 times slower in the quantum treatment than in the classical treatment. For the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, the transfer rate is the same in both cases, whereas for light-harvesting complex II of spinach, the transfer is 1.7 times slower in the quantum treatment. The effect is most pronounced for systems with large excitonic energy gaps and strong vibronic coupling to high-frequency modes. In all cases, nuclear quantum effects are found to be unimportant for the directionality of energy transfer.",

          "abstract": "High-entropy oxides (HEOs) have attracted attention due to their unique elemental synergistic effect and lattice distortion. However, mixing elements’ vastly different radii and valences leads to substantial element segregation during the reaction. In addition, the requirement for a harsh temperature (1100°C) to achieve entropy stabilization results in the volatilization of low–melting point components. Here, we propose a strategy for synthesizing functionalized Ga-based HEOs (GHEOs) at a low temperature (400°C) by the Ga integration mechanism. The negative mixing enthalpy between Ga and other metals reduces the Gibbs free energy, enabling the creation of homogeneous GHEOs through a hydrothermal process at a lower temperature. The Ga integration mechanism is supported by thermodynamic and density functional theory analyses. In particular, the perovskite, spinel, and rock salt crystal can be precisely tuned by choosing metal ions, enabling tailored applications in electrocatalysis, energy-saving materials, and methane sensors. Hence, this GHEOs strategy can be extended to realize many ideal GHEOs adjusted for specific applications.",

Advances in deep learning–based protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold2-multimer (AF2M) and ESMFold, provide opportunities for studying these challenging proteins. Here, we introduce RBPseg, a method that combines monomeric ESMFold predictions with a structural-based domain identification approach, to divide tail fiber sequences into manageable fractions for high-confidence modeling with AF2M. Using this approach, we generated complete tail fiber models, validated by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy of five fibers from three phages. A structural classification of 67 fibers identified 16 distinct classes and 89 domains, revealing patterns of modularity, convergence, divergence, and domain swapping. Our findings suggest that these structural classes represent at least 24% of the known tail fiber universe, providing key insights into their evolution and functionality.",

We show that only chemokines able to bind these two phospholipids kill bacteria and that they exert rapid bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects with a higher potency than the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin 3. Both biochemical and genetic interference with the chemokine-cardiolipin interaction impaired microbial growth arrest, bacterial killing, and membrane disruption by chemokines. Moreover, unlike conventional antibiotics, Escherichia coli failed to develop resistance when placed under increasing antimicrobial chemokine pressure in vitro.

To explore receptor trafficking, genetically encoded approaches (e.g., the fusion of fluorescent proteins to receptors) are often used. However, concerns remain that genetic approaches cannot fully reproduce the receptor functions that are inherent to neurons. Herein, we report on PFQX1(AF488), a fluorescent probe for the visualization of cell-surface AMPARs without any genetic manipulation to neurons. The rapid and reversible staining features of this probe enabled snapshot imaging, which showed the accumulation of native AMPARs in dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity.

Here, we summarize and discuss mechanisms whereby the CoREST complex coopts tissue-specific transcription factors to elicit pathogenic activity in cancer and neurodegenerative disease. We also identify tumor types with selective dependencies on the scaffolding properties of the CoREST complex. We argue that these tumor types may benefit from a KBTBD4-activating/CoREST complex degrader therapy, which could also enhance antitumor immunity and sensitize resistant tumors to immunotherapy. Overall, understanding how the CoREST complex operates abnormally and differences between its targeting through catalytic inhibitors or protein degraders will help discern all possible applications for targeting therapies now in clinical development.",

We find that Syx17 loss induces the formation of autophagosome-lysosome clusters in a HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting)–dependent manner, entrapping this tether, autophagosomes, and lysosomes. While locked in clusters, these organelles cannot participate in other vesicle fusions, impeding endosomal progression and autophagosome secretion. Therefore, the absence of Syx17 not only inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion but also prevents HOPS release from autophagosome-lysosome tethering sites causing a “tethering lock.” Preventing autophagosome formation or removing the HOPS adaptor Plekhm1 (pleckstrin homology domain–containing family M member 1) leads to release of HOPS and lysosomes from these clusters, thus rescuing secondary effects of Syx17 loss. Our findings show that a tethering lock can disrupt multiple vesicle trafficking routes.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is decimating habitat-forming species in ecosystems around the world. Yet, the impacts of habitat loss on the energetics of the wider food web remain uncertain for many iconic ecosystems, including cold-water kelp forests. Here, we assessed how the loss of kelp forests and the subsequent proliferation of low-lying turf algae in the Gulf of Maine have altered the trophic niches of, and energy acquired by, predatory reef fishes. Bulk tissue δ 13 C and δ 15 N analysis showed that fishes in kelp forests had larger trophic niches and greater interspecific niche separation than fishes on turf reefs. Moreover, δ 13 C analysis of essential amino acids revealed that kelp-derived energy accounted for most of the energy used by kelp forest fishes (&gt; 50% on average), whereas fishes on turf reefs compensated for kelp decline via greater reliance on a phytoplankton-based energy channel. Therefore, ecosystem state shifts to turf algae—now a global phenomenon—may have far-reaching impacts on food web energetics and resilience.",

We explore this possibility for corals globally, using a dynamic metacommunity model incorporating temperature, photosynthetically available radiation, pH, and four distinct, interacting coral assemblages. This model reasonably reproduces the observed distribution and recent decline of corals across the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean. Our simulations suggest that there is a mismatch between the timescales of coral reef decline and range expansion under future predicted climate change. Whereas the most severe declines in coral cover will likely occur within 40 to 80 years, large-scale coral reef expansion requires centuries. The absence of large-scale coral refugia in the face of rapid anthropogenic climate change emphasizes the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate nonthermal stressors for corals, both in the tropics and in higher latitudes.",

Critical bacterial and mammalian cell factors involved are PltC R109 residue and carbohydrate sulfotransferases CHST2/4. One notable effect associated with the hepatobiliary tropism of PltC typhoid toxin is a reduction in bile acids, consequently promoting S. Typhi pathogenicity in infected mice. Similarly, bile acids serve as anti– S. Typhi infectivity agents at the cellular level, as bile acids inhibit invasion of mammalian cells. These findings highlight a distinct mechanism used by a bacterial exotoxin promoting the pathogenicity of the cognate bacteria and offer insights into the development of antivirulence agents against PltC typhoid toxin and/or S.

          "abstract": "Bacterial sepsis, a life-threatening systemic inflammatory response to infection affecting over 30 million people annually, is exacerbated by antibiotic resistance and immune suppression. Here, we report a small luminescent molecule, TPA2PyPh, as a potent antibacterial agent and its potential for lipid droplet–engineered macrophage transfer strategy in treating bacterial sepsis. Engineered macrophages, created by directly incubating TPA2PyPh with macrophages, enabled the luminogen to precisely bind to intracellular lipid droplets. Upon engulfment of bacteria, these TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages use natural lipid uptake mechanisms to deliver the luminogen to intracellular bacteria, disrupting their membranes and inserting into the bacterial DNA, thereby inducing bacterial elimination. Our findings show that the adoptive transfer of TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages substantially diminishes bacterial burden in septic mice and substantially reduces mortality rates. This study demonstrates the potential of TPA2PyPh as an effective antibacterial agent and supports the use of adoptive lipid droplet–engineered macrophage transfer as an effective approach for treating sepsis and managing severe infectious diseases.",

To date, no treatment strategies have leveraged cellular sex differences to determine drug combinations that target VIC myofibroblast activation. Here, we harnessed IDentif.AI, an artificial intelligence (AI)–derived platform, to optimize sex-biased synergistic drug combinations that may prevent and reverse VIC myofibroblast activation on hydrogel biomaterials. The results reveal that sex-specific drug response models can be used to predict sex biases in drug efficacy and combinatorial interactions. This study provides a framework for developing AVS treatments through the integration of high-throughput hydrogel cell culture platforms and AI-driven drug optimization.

Cd24a + cells gave rise to the dentin-pulp complex, while Pax9 + ones mainly generated periodontal tissues. During development, guided by alveolar bone–derived PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor, B polypeptide), Cd24a + / Pax9 + cells gradually concentrated on the apical region during the crown-to-root transition, collectively migrated and formed dental root. Cell ablation and conditional Wnt knockout notably compromised tooth establishment. Single-cell RNA sequencing, CUT&amp;Tag, and spatial mapping further revealed distinct features of Cd24a + / Pax9 + cells and their cellular organization. Last, the CD24 + / PAX9 + core was also present in human teeth, suggesting it as a conserved developmental program.

Anthracene and phenanthrene were detected isomer-selectively using photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves and mass-selected threshold photoelectron (ms-TPE) spectra. While phenanthrene is produced through a radical-radical recombination of the carbon-centered radicals, anthracene may plausibly be formed through an unconventional radical addition to a low spin-density fluorenyl carbon.

To this end, adult human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) present one of the most relevant cell sources. However, iNs generated from adult hDFs using two-dimensional cultures are difficult to maintain in vitro and face challenges in survival upon transplantation into the adult brain, thus imposing constraints on biomedical applications of iN technology. Here, we present a platform for direct in vitro reprogramming of adult hDFs inside three-dimensional suspension microcultures (3D-iNs). We show that the 3D environment favors neuronal over fibroblast cellular identity to yield more robust conversion into functional neurons with extended culturing span. The 3D reprogramming approach also provides a platform for fusion into induced assembloids. 3D-iNs can be gently harvested and transplanted into the adult rodent brain to reproducibly generate neuron-rich grafts, thus eliminating a major bottleneck in the direct reprogramming field.",

Similar changes in vimentin levels and truncation were observed in postmortem putamen tissue from patients with sporadic PD.

Using ultracold gases, here, we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon- and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation.

Here, we investigated the phase transition and thermal transport properties of a recently reported amorphous carbon phase, amorphous diaphite (a-DG). The continuous transformation pathway of a-DG is characterized by distinctive heterogeneous microstructural evolutions across a wide density range. We observed anomalous thermal conductivities in a-DG, which initially decrease and then increase with the density and sp 3 /sp 2 ratio, deviating markedly from previously reported trends. This anomaly originates from changes in phonon mean free path and phonon lifetime at the medium-frequency range (7 to 30 terahertz), dictated by the unique two-stage microtopological transition. These findings challenge conventional views of thermal conductivity in amorphous carbons, and, in a wider context, our mechanistic understanding provides fundamental insights into phase transitions and thermodynamic mechanisms of other amorphous materials.",
