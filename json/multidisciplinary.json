          "abstract": "Many children from low-income backgrounds worldwide fail to master school mathematics1; however, some children extensively use mental arithmetic outside school2,3. Here we surveyed children in Kolkata and Delhi, India, who work in markets (n = 1,436), to investigate whether maths skills acquired in real-world settings transfer to the classroom and vice versa. Nearly all these children used complex arithmetic calculations effectively at work. They were also proficient in solving hypothetical market maths problems and verbal maths problems that were anchored to concrete contexts. However, they were unable to solve arithmetic problems of equal or lesser complexity when presented in the abstract format typically used in school. The children’s performance in market maths problems was not explained by memorization, access to help, reduced stress with more familiar formats or high incentives for correct performance. By contrast, children with no market-selling experience (n = 471), enrolled in nearby schools, showed the opposite pattern. These children performed more accurately on simple abstract problems, but only 1% could correctly answer an applied market maths problem that more than one third of working children solved (β = 0.35, s.e.m. = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = 0.30–0.40, P < 0.001). School children used highly inefficient written calculations, could not combine different operations and arrived at answers too slowly to be useful in real-life or in higher maths. These findings highlight the importance of educational curricula that bridge the gap between intuitive and formal maths.",

          "abstract": "The integration of Indigenous perspectives and knowledge with biomedical approaches in neurosciences can significantly broaden the understanding of the human brain and mind. Drawing upon the writings of Elders in Canada, we refer to this integration as Two-Eyed Seeing or Etuaptmumk. We discuss how Two-Eyed Seeing and other dual perspectives can bring both breadth of knowledge and humility to the development of research and clinical practices for brain health. In this forward-looking discussion, we include both traditional academic and non-academic traditions and the work of Indigenous scholars on methodologies, life, health, culture, language and history. To describe challenges and consider solutions, we offer broad strategies for allyship, humility and universalism and situate them in four specific examples pertaining to disability, suicide, migration and the environment. We further advance the power of Two-Eyed Seeing in the context of new considerations for communication and public engagement. Two-Eyed Seeing, per se, is only one approach, but as neuroscience becomes ever more global, inclusive and ethically proactive, it must universally see the world of brain and mental health through the eyes of both reductionism and holism.",

          "abstract": "Fossils representing Cretaceous lineages of crown clade birds (Aves) are exceptionally rare but are crucial to elucidating major ecological shifts across early avian divergences. Among the earliest known putative crown birds is Vegavis iaai1,2,3,4,5, a foot-propelled diver from the latest Cretaceous (69.2–68.4 million years ago)6 of Antarctica with controversial phylogenetic affinities2,7,8,9,10. Initially recovered by phylogenetic analyses as a stem anatid (ducks and closely related species)1,2,11, Vegavis has since been recovered as a stem member of Anseriformes (waterfowl)7,8,9, or outside Aves altogether10. Here we report a new, nearly complete skull of Vegavis that provides new insight into its feeding ecology and exhibits morphologies that support placement among waterfowl within crown-group birds. Vegavis has an avian beak (absence of teeth and reduced maxilla) and brain shape (hyperinflated cerebrum and ventrally shifted optic lobes). The temporal fossa is well excavated and expansive, indicating that this bird had hypertrophied jaw musculature. The beak is narrow and pointed, and the mandible lacks retroarticular processes. Together, these features comprise a feeding apparatus unlike that of any other known anseriform but like that of other extant birds that capture prey underwater (for example, grebes and loons). The Cretaceous occurrence of Vegavis, with a feeding ecology unique among known Galloanserae (waterfowl and landfowl), is further indication that the earliest anseriform divergences were marked by evolutionary experiments unrepresented in the extant diversity3,11,12,13.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark of pulmonary fibrosis is the aberrant activation of lung fibroblasts into pathological fibroblasts that produce excessive extracellular matrix1,2,3. Thus, the identification of key regulators that promote the generation of pathological fibroblasts can inform the development of effective countermeasures against disease progression. Here we use two mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis to show that LEPR+ fibroblasts that arise during alveologenesis include SCUBE2+ alveolar fibroblasts as a major constituent. These alveolar fibroblasts in turn contribute substantially to CTHRC1+POSTN+ pathological fibroblasts. Genetic ablation of POSTN+ pathological fibroblasts attenuates fibrosis. Comprehensive analyses of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data reveal that RUNX2 is a key regulator of the expression of fibrotic genes. Consistently, conditional deletion of Runx2 with LeprcreERT2 or Scube2creERT2 reduces the generation of pathological fibroblasts, extracellular matrix deposition and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, LEPR+ cells that include SCUBE2+ alveolar fibroblasts are a key source of pathological fibroblasts, and targeting Runx2 provides a potential treatment option for pulmonary fibrosis.",

          "abstract": "Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, ideally enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity 1,2 . Photonic networks are well suited as a versatile and reconfigurable interconnect layer for DQC; remote entanglement shared between matter qubits across the network enables all-to-all logical connectivity through quantum gate teleportation (QGT) 3,4 . For a scalable DQC architecture, the QGT implementation must be deterministic and repeatable; until now, no demonstration has satisfied these requirements. Here we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of quantum computations between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules. The modules, separated by about two metres, each contain dedicated network and circuit qubits. By using heralded remote entanglement between the network qubits, we deterministically teleport a controlled-Z (CZ) gate between two circuit qubits in separate modules, achieving 86% fidelity. We then execute Grover’s search algorithm 5 —to our knowledge, the first implementation of a distributed quantum algorithm comprising several non-local two-qubit gates—and measure a 71% success rate. Furthermore, we implement distributed iSWAP and SWAP circuits, compiled with two and three instances of QGT, respectively, demonstrating the ability to distribute arbitrary two-qubit operations 6 . As photons can be interfaced with a variety of systems, the versatile DQC architecture demonstrated here provides a viable pathway towards large-scale quantum computing for a range of physical platforms.",

          "authors": "Claire Kokontis, Timothy A. Klein, Sukrit Silas, Joseph Bondy-Denomy",
          "abstract": "Bacteriophages use diverse mechanisms to evade antiphage defence systems. ΦKZ-like jumbo phages assemble a proteinaceous, nucleus-like compartment that excludes antagonistic host nucleases and also internalizes DNA replication and transcription machinery1,2,3,4. The phage factors required for protein import and the mechanisms of selectivity remain unknown, however. Here we uncover an import system comprising proteins highly conserved across nucleus-forming phages, together with additional cargo-specific contributors. Using a genetic selection that forces the phage to decrease or abolish the import of specific proteins, we determine that the importation of five different phage nuclear-localized proteins requires distinct interfaces of the same factor, Imp1 (gp69). Imp1 localizes early to the nascent phage nucleus and forms discrete puncta in the mature phage nuclear periphery, probably in complex with direct interactor Imp6 (gp67), a conserved protein encoded in the same locus. The import of certain proteins, including a host topoisomerase, additionally requires Imp3 (gp59), a conserved factor necessary for proper Imp1 function. Three additional non-conserved phage proteins (Imp2 and Imp4/Imp5) are required for the import of two queried nuclear cargos (nuclear-localized protein 1 and host topoisomerase, respectively), perhaps acting as specific adaptors. We therefore propose a core import system that includes Imp1, Imp3 and Imp6, with multiple interfaces of Imp1 licensing transport through a protein lattice.",

          "abstract": "Linear conducting polymers show ballistic transport, imposed by mobile carriers moving along the polymer chains1,2, whereas conductance in the extended dimension, that is, between polymer strands or layers, remains weak due to the lack of intermolecular ordering and electronic coupling3,4,5. Here we report a multilayer-stacked two-dimensional polyaniline (2DPANI) crystal, which shows metallic out-of-plane charge transport with high electrical conductivity. The material comprises columnar π arrays with an interlayer distance of 3.59 Å and periodic rhombohedral lattices formed by interwoven polyaniline chains. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals significant electron delocalization in the 2DPANI lattices. First-principles calculations indicate the in-plane 2D conjugation and strong interlayer electronic coupling in 2DPANI facilitated by the Cl-bridged layer stacking. To assess the local optical conductivity, we used terahertz and infrared nanospectroscopy to unravel a Drude-type conductivity with an infrared plasma frequency and an extrapolated local d.c. conductivity of around 200 S cm−1. Conductive scanning probe microscopy showed an unusually high out-of-plane conductivity of roughly 15 S cm−1. Transport measurements through vertical and lateral micro-devices revealed comparable high out-of-plane (roughly 7 S cm−1) and in-plane conductivity (roughly 16 S cm−1). The vertical micro-devices further showed increasing conductivity with decreasing temperature, demonstrating unique out-of-plane metallic transport behaviour. By using this multilayer-stacked 2D conducting polymer design, we predict the achievement of strong electronic coupling beyond in-plane interactions, potentially reaching three-dimensional metallic conductivity6,7.",

          "abstract": "The genetic code is conserved across all domains of life, yet exceptions have revealed variations in codon assignments and associated translation factors1,2,3. Inspired by this natural malleability, synthetic approaches have demonstrated whole-genome replacement of synonymous codons to construct genomically recoded organisms (GROs)4,5 with alternative genetic codes. However, no efforts have fully leveraged translation factor plasticity and codon degeneracy to compress translation function to a single codon and assess the possibility of a non-degenerate code. Here we describe construction and characterization of Ochre, a GRO that fully compresses a translational function into a single codon. We replaced 1,195 TGA stop codons with the synonymous TAA in ∆TAG Escherichia coli C321.∆A4. We then engineered release factor 2 (RF2) and tRNATrp to mitigate native UGA recognition, translationally isolating four codons for non-degenerate functions. Ochre thus utilizes UAA as the sole stop codon, with UGG encoding tryptophan and UAG and UGA reassigned for multi-site incorporation of two distinct non-standard amino acids into single proteins with more than 99% accuracy. Ochre fully compresses degenerate stop codons into a single codon and represents an important step toward a 64-codon non-degenerate code that will enable precise production of multi-functional synthetic proteins with unnatural encoded chemistries and broad utility in biotechnology and biotherapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Cancer genome alterations often lead to vulnerabilities that can be used to selectively target cancer cells. Various inhibitors of such synthetic lethal targets have been approved by the FDA or are in clinical trials, highlighting the potential of this approach 1–3 . Here we analysed large-scale CRISPR knockout screening data from the Cancer Dependency Map and identified a new synthetic lethal target, PELO , for two independent molecular subtypes of cancer: biallelic deletion of chromosomal region 9p21.3 or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). In 9p21.3-deleted cancers, PELO dependency emerges from biallelic deletion of the 9p21.3 gene FOCAD , a stabilizer of the superkiller complex (SKIc). In MSI-H cancers, PELO is required owing to MSI-H-associated mutations in TTC37  (also known as  SKIC3 ), a critical component of the SKIc. We show that both cancer subtypes converge to destabilize the SKIc, which extracts mRNA from stalled ribosomes. In SKIc-deficient cells, PELO depletion induces the unfolded protein response, a stress response to accumulation of misfolded or unfolded nascent polypeptides. Together, our findings indicate PELO as a promising therapeutic target for a large patient population with cancers characterized as MSI-H with deleterious TTC37 mutations or with biallelic 9p21.3 deletions involving FOCAD .",

          "abstract": "The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moiré systems research, and it may provide an insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-critical-temperature superconductors. Here we use d.c. transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics to directly measure the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG through its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory. Rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions1 and recent experimental indications2 of quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power law, which contraindicates an isotropic Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) model. Instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted in the Fermi liquid framework or by considering the quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both d.c. and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with the Ginzburg–Landau theory. Taken together, our findings show that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined d.c.–microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.",

Human-directed applications of fungi extend from leavened bread, alcoholic beverages and biofuels to pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and psychoactive compounds. Conversely, fungal infections pose risks to ecosystems ranging from crops to wildlife to humans; these risks are driven, in part, by human and animal movement, and might be accelerating with climate change. Genomic surveys are expanding our knowledge of the true biodiversity of the fungal kingdom, and genome-editing tools make it possible to imagine harnessing these organisms to fuel the bioeconomy.

Specifically, there are significant disparities in the identity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and in the expression levels of G-protein-coupled receptors between the two species that carry direct implications for currently approved obesity treatments. Out of the 452 hypothalamic cell types, we find that 291 neuronal clusters are significantly enriched for expression of body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study genes. This enrichment is driven by 426 ‘effector’ genes. Rare deleterious variants in six of these ( MC4R , PCSK1 , POMC , CALCR , BSN and CORO1A ) associate with BMI at population level, and CORO1A has not been linked previously to BMI. Thus, HYPOMAP provides a detailed atlas of the human hypothalamus in a spatial context and serves as an important resource to identify new druggable targets for treating a wide range of conditions, including reproductive, circadian and metabolic disorders.",

          "abstract": "Recent discoveries from time-domain surveys are defying our expectations for how matter accretes onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The increased rate of short-timescale, repetitive events around SMBHs, including the recently discovered quasi-periodic eruptions1,2,3,4,5, are garnering further interest in stellar-mass companions around SMBHs and the progenitors to millihertz-frequency gravitational-wave events. Here we report the discovery of a highly significant millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in an actively accreting SMBH, 1ES 1927+654, which underwent a major optical, ultraviolet and X-ray outburst beginning in 20186,7. The QPO was detected in 2022 with a roughly 18-minute period, corresponding to coherent motion on a scale of less than 10 gravitational radii, much closer to the SMBH than typical quasi-periodic eruptions. The period decreased to 7.1 minutes over 2 years with a decelerating period evolution (\\(\\ddot{P}\\) greater than zero). To our knowledge, this evolution has never been seen in SMBH QPOs or high-frequency QPOs in stellar-mass black holes. Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion struggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset angular-momentum losses, and the lack of a direct analogue to stellar-mass black-hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the observed properties of the QPO in 1ES 1927+654. Future X-ray monitoring will test these models, and if it is a stellar-mass orbiter, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should detect its low-frequency gravitational-wave emission.",

          "abstract": "Personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) can generate circulating immune responses against predicted neoantigens1,2,3,4,5,6. However, whether such responses can target cancer driver mutations, lead to immune recognition of a patient’s tumour and result in clinical activity are largely unknown. These questions are of particular interest for patients who have tumours with a low mutational burden. Here we conducted a phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02950766) to test a neoantigen-targeting PCV in patients with high-risk, fully resected clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC; stage III or IV) with or without ipilimumab administered adjacent to the vaccine. At a median follow-up of 40.2 months after surgery, none of the 9 participants enrolled in the study had a recurrence of RCC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All patients generated T cell immune responses against the PCV antigens, including to RCC driver mutations in VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, KDM5C and PIK3CA. Following vaccination, there was a durable expansion of peripheral T cell clones. Moreover, T cell reactivity against autologous tumours was detected in seven out of nine patients. Our results demonstrate that neoantigen-targeting PCVs in high-risk RCC are highly immunogenic, capable of targeting key driver mutations and can induce antitumour immunity. These observations, in conjunction with the absence of recurrence in all nine vaccinated patients, highlights the promise of PCVs as effective adjuvant therapy in RCC.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators 1,2 . Unlocking the full potential of such systems towards this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution and extensive probes for final state characterization. Here we present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits that supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analogue evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. This hybrid platform features more versatile measurement capabilities compared with analogue-only simulators, which we leverage here to reveal a coarsening-induced breakdown of Kibble–Zurek scaling predictions 3 in the XY model, as well as signatures of the classical Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition 4 . Moreover, the digital gates enable precise energy control, allowing us to study the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis 5–7 in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. We also demonstrate digital preparation of pairwise-entangled dimer states, and image the transport of energy and vorticity during subsequent thermalization in analogue evolution. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analogue–digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics.",

Cytokines that sustain CTL activity are attractive for cancer immunotherapy, but avoiding inflammatory toxicity remains a challenge for their clinical use2. Here we show that expression of a CTL signature is strongly associated with IL27 expression in human and mouse tumours. In mice, IL-27 acts directly on tumour-specific CTLs to promote their persistence and effector function in the tumour microenvironment. Moreover, treatment with inducible IL-27 overexpression or a half-life-extended IL-27 protein in vivo is well tolerated, induces regression of established tumours, drives an enhanced cytotoxic program in anti-tumour CTLs and synergizes with PD-L1 blockade. In patients with cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, high expression of IL-27 correlates with a favourable clinical response, and IL-27 supports human CTL function during chronic antigen stimulation ex vivo. Our data demonstrate that endogenous IL-27 is essential for anti-tumour immunity and that IL-27 receptor agonism can safely improve anti-tumour T cell responses alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade.",

Over the past 15 years, synthetic lethal cancer target discovery approaches have led to clinical successes of PARP inhibitors2 and ushered several next-generation therapeutic targets such as WRN3, USP14, PKMYT15, POLQ6 and PRMT57 into the clinic. Here we identify, in human cancer, a novel synthetic lethal interaction between the PELO–HBS1L and SKI complexes of the mRNA quality control pathway. In distinct genetic contexts, including 9p21.3-deleted and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) tumours, we found that phenotypically destabilized SKI complex leads to dependence on the PELO–HBS1L ribosomal rescue complex. PELO–HBS1L and SKI complex synthetic lethality alters the normal cell cycle and drives the unfolded protein response through the activation of IRE1, as well as robust tumour growth inhibition. Our results indicate that PELO and HBS1L represent novel therapeutic targets whose dependence converges upon SKI complex destabilization, a common phenotypic biomarker in diverse genetic contexts representing a significant population of patients with cancer.",

North Pontic foragers had ancestry from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 as well as European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. During the Eneolithic period, a wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga area7 bypassed local foragers to mix in equal parts with Trypillian farmers, forming the people of the Usatove culture around 4500 bce. A temporally overlapping wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga blended with foragers instead of farmers to form Serednii Stih people7. The third wave was the Yamna—descendants of the Serednii Stih who formed by mixture around 4000 bce and expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 bce). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka, Ukraine (3635–3383 bce), a site of archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic–Bronze Age transition and a likely epicentre of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves of migration propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders, a flexible strategy that may explain the success of the peoples of the North Pontic in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3,4,5,8,9,10.",

Dangers arise from uncontrolled collective motions, leading to compression against walls, suffocation and fatalities2,3,4. Our current understanding of crowd dynamics primarily relies on heuristic collision models, which effectively capture the behaviour observed in small groups of people5,6. However, the emergent dynamics of dense crowds, composed of thousands of individuals, remains a formidable many-body problem lacking quantitative experimental characterization and explanations rooted in first principles. Here we analyse the dynamics of thousands of densely packed individuals at the San Fermín festival (Spain) and infer a physical theory of dense crowds in confinement. Our measurements reveal that dense crowds can self-organize into macroscopic chiral oscillators, coordinating the orbital motion of hundreds of individuals without external guidance. Guided by these measurements and symmetry principles, we construct a mechanical model of dense-crowd motion. Our model demonstrates that emergent odd frictional forces drive a non-reciprocal phase transition7 towards collective chiral oscillations, capturing all our experimental observations. To test the robustness of our findings, we show that similar chiral dynamics emerged at the onset of the 2010 Love Parade disaster and propose a protocol that could help anticipate these previously unpredictable dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The robustness of the macroscopic quantum nature of a superconductor can be characterized by the superfluid stiffness, ρs, a quantity that describes the energy required to vary the phase of the macroscopic quantum wavefunction. In unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, the low-temperature behaviour of ρs markedly differs from that of conventional superconductors owing to quasiparticle excitations from gapless points (nodes) in momentum space. Intensive research on the recently discovered magic-angle twisted graphene family has revealed, in addition to superconducting states, strongly correlated electronic states associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, inviting the study of ρs to uncover the potentially unconventional nature of its superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of ρs in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG), revealing unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity. Utilizing radio-frequency reflectometry techniques to measure the kinetic inductive response of superconducting TTG coupled to a microwave resonator, we find a linear temperature dependence of ρs at low temperatures and nonlinear Meissner effects in the current-bias dependence, both indicating nodal structures in the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, the doping dependence shows a linear correlation between the zero-temperature ρs and the superconducting transition temperature Tc, reminiscent of Uemura’s relation in cuprates, suggesting phase-coherence-limited superconductivity. Our results provide strong evidence for nodal superconductivity in TTG and put strong constraints on the mechanisms of these graphene-based superconductors.",

If widely adopted on farmlands, it could help achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 2–4 .

Geochemical assessment of rivers and oceans suggests effective transport of dissolved products from EW from soils, offering CDR on intergenerational timescales. Our analysis further indicates that EW may temporarily help lower ground-level ozone and concentrations of secondary aerosols in agricultural regions. Geospatially mapped CDR costs show heterogeneity across the USA, reflecting a combination of cropland distance from basalt source regions, timing of EW deployment and evolving CDR rates. CDR costs are highest in the first two decades before declining to about US$100–150 tCO 2 −1 by 2050, including for states that contribute most to total national CDR. Although EW cannot be a substitute for emission reductions, our assessment strengthens the case for EW as an overlooked practical innovation for helping the USA meet net-zero 2050 goals 5,6 . Public awareness of EW and equity impacts of EW deployment across the USA require further exploration 7,8 and we note that mobilizing an EW industry at the necessary scale could take decades.",

Serial SIV challenge of monkeys given partially and fully neutralizing bNAbs revealed that ‘viral blips’—low and transient plasma viremia—often occur while serum bNAb concentrations are well above currently accepted protective levels. To understand the precise timing of the infections resulting in such blips, we performed plasma viral sequencing on monkeys that were serially challenged with genetically barcoded SIV after bNAb administration. These analyses showed that subclinical infections occurred in most animals that were given potent bNAb prophylaxis. These subclinical infections occurred while antibody concentrations were 2- to 400-fold higher than the levels required to prevent fully viremic breakthrough infection. This study demonstrates that immunoprophylaxis can mask subclinical infections, which may affect the interpretation of prophylactic HIV-1 bNAb clinical trials.",

          "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved over short timescales, leading to the emergence of more transmissible variants such as Alpha and Delta 1–3 . The arrival of the Omicron variant marked a major shift, introducing numerous extra mutations in the spike gene compared with earlier variants 1,2 . These evolutionary changes have raised concerns regarding their potential impact on immune evasion, disease severity and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments 1,3 . In this epidemiological study, we identified two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron versus pre-Omicron eras. Before Omicron, natural infection provided strong and durable protection against reinfection, with minimal waning over time. However, during the Omicron era, protection was robust only for those recently infected, declining rapidly over time and diminishing within a year. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by a dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution, leading to contrasting reinfection patterns before and after Omicron’s first wave. This shift in patterns suggests a change in evolutionary pressures, with intrinsic transmissibility driving adaptation pre-Omicron and immune escape becoming dominant post-Omicron, underscoring the need for periodic vaccine updates to sustain immunity.",

          "abstract": "Expanding the performance of field-effect devices is a key challenge of the ever-growing chip industry at the core of current technologies1. Non-volatile multiferroic transistors that control atomic movements rather than purely electronic distribution are highly desired2. Recently, a field-effect control over structural transitions was achieved in commensurate stacking configurations of honeycomb van der Waals (vdW) polytypes by sliding boundary strips between oppositely polarized domains3,4,5,6. This ferroelectric hysteretic response, however, relied on pre-existing dislocation strips between relatively large micron-scale domains, severely limiting practical implementations3,7,8. Here we report the robust electric switching of single-domain polytypes in nanometre-scale islands embedded in super-lubricant vdW arrays. We etch cavities into a thin layered spacer and then encapsulate it with functional flakes. The flakes above/under the lattice-mismatched spacer sag and touch at each cavity to form islands of commensurate and metastable polytype configurations. By imaging the polarization of the polytypes, we observe nucleation and annihilation of boundary strips and geometry-adaptable ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Using mechanical stress, we further control the position of boundary strips, modify marginal twist angles and nucleate patterns of polar domain. This super-lubricant arrays of polytype (SLAP) concept suggests ‘slidetronics’ device applications such as elastic-coupled neuromorphic memory cells and non-volatile multiferroic tunnelling transistors and programmable response by designing the size, shape and symmetry of the islands and of the arrays9.",

Furthermore, both optical and acoustic structured waves are crucial in the manipulation of small particles22,23,24,25, from atoms to macroscopic biological objects.

However, topological water-wave forms, especially their ability to manipulate particles, have not yet been demonstrated. Here we describe the controllable generation of topological structures, namely wave vortices, skyrmions and polarization Möbius strips, in gravity water waves. Most importantly, we demonstrate the efficient manipulation of subwavelength and wavelength-order floating particles with topologically structured water waves. This includes trapping the particles in the high-intensity field zones and controlling their orbital and spinning motion due to the orbital and spin angular momenta of the water waves. Our results reveal the water-wave counterpart of optical and acoustic manipulation, which paves the way for applications in hydrodynamics and microfluidics.",

          "abstract": "In the centres of many galaxy clusters, the hot (approximately 107 kelvin) intracluster medium can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales1,2. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies3,4,5,6 and the absence of soft X-ray lines from the cooling gas7,8,9 suggest that most of this gas never cools. This is known as the cooling flow problem. The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures10,11,12,13,14,15,16. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all the gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here we present observations of the Phoenix cluster17 using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne vi] λ 7.652-μm emission line, enabling us to probe the gas at 105.5 kelvin on large scales. These data show extended [Ne vi] emission that is cospatial with the cooling peak in the intracluster medium, the coolest gas phases and the sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate, which we estimate to be 5,000–23,000 solar masses per year. These data provide a large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 105 kelvin and 106 kelvin in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback has in not only regulating cooling but also promoting it18.",

Conventional semiconductor superlattices with designable potential modulation in one dimension has enabled high-electron-mobility transistors and quantum-cascade lasers. More recently, a diverse set of superlattices has been constructed through self-assembly or guided assembly of multiscale building units, including zero-dimensional nanoclusters and nanoparticles6,7, one-dimensional nanorods and nanowires8,9, two-dimensional nanolayers and nanosheets10,11,12,13, and hybrid two-dimensional molecular assemblies14,15,16,17. These self-assembled superlattices feature periodic structural modulation in two or three dimensions, but often lack atomic precision owing to the inevitable structural disorder at the interfaces between the constituent units. Here we report a one-pot synthesis of multi-dimensional single-crystalline superlattices consisting of periodic arrangement of zero-, one- and two-dimensional building units. By exploiting zirconium (IV) metal–organic frameworks as host templates for directed nucleation and precise growth of metal-halide sublattices through a coordination-assisted assembly strategy, we synthesize a family of single-crystalline porous superlattices. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy clearly resolve the high-order superlattice structure with deterministic atomic coordinates. Further treatment with selected amine molecules produces perovskite-like superlattices with highly tunable photoluminescence and chiroptical properties. Our study creates a platform of high-order single-crystalline porous superlattices, opening opportunities to tailor the electronic, optical and quantum properties beyond the reach of conventional crystalline solids.",

However, a theory-guided mechanoresponsive materials system with well-defined ultrasound activation has yet to be explored5,6. Here we present the concept of using porous hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) as toolkits for focused ultrasound (FUS) programmably triggered drug activation to control specific cellular events in the deep brain, through on-demand scission of the supramolecular interactions. A theoretical model is developed to potentially visualize the mechanochemical scission and ultrasound mechanics, providing valuable guidelines for the rational design of mechanoresponsive materials to achieve programmable control. To demonstrate the practicality of this approach, we encapsulate the designer drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO) into the optimal HOF nanocrystals for FUS-gated release to activate engineered G-protein-coupled receptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of mice and rats and hence achieve targeted neural circuit modulation even at depth 9 mm with a latency of seconds. This work demonstrates the capability of ultrasound to precisely control molecular interactions and develops ultrasound-programmable HOFs to non-invasively and spatiotemporally control cellular events, thereby facilitating the establishment of precise molecular therapeutic possibilities.",

          "abstract": "Antimicrobial compounds are essential for controlling bacterial infections. Stress-induced bacterial tolerance and persisters can undermine antimicrobial activities under laboratory conditions, but their quantitative effects under physiological conditions remain unclear 1,2 . Here we determined constraints on clearance of Salmonella by antimicrobials in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats. The antibiotics enrofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited poor anti- Salmonella activity under both conditions, primarily owing to severe nutrient starvation, which restricted Salmonella replication 3–5 . Other infection-associated conditions, such as acidic pH, glucose, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, antimicrobial peptides, osmolarity, oxygen limitation, carbon dioxide and carbonate, as well as drug efflux, toxin–antitoxin modules and cell size had limited effects. A subset of resilient Salmonella appeared as a key obstacle for clearance by enrofloxacin, based on the biphasic decline of Salmonella colony-forming units. However, these data were misleading, because colony formation was confounded by extensive post-exposure killing. More accurate single-cell, real-time assays showed uniformly slow damage, indicating high resilience across the entire Salmonella population. The resulting extensive survival of bulk bacteria minimized the effect of hyper-resilient persisters. Thus, starvation-induced general resilience of Salmonella was the main cause of poor antibiotic clearance. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying antibiotic activity with real-time, single-cell assays under physiological conditions.",

          "abstract": "The Yamnaya archaeological complex appeared around 3300 bc across the steppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and by 3000 bc it reached its maximal extent, ranging from Hungary in the west to Kazakhstan in the east. To localize Yamnaya origins among the preceding Eneolithic people, we assembled ancient DNA from 435 individuals, demonstrating three genetic clines. A Caucasus–lower Volga (CLV) cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer1 ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end and a northern end at Berezhnovka along the lower Volga river. Bidirectional gene flow created intermediate populations, such as the north Caucasus Maikop people, and those at Remontnoye on the steppe. The Volga cline was formed as CLV people mixed with upriver populations of Eastern hunter-gatherer2 ancestry, creating hypervariable groups, including one at Khvalynsk. The Dnipro cline was formed when CLV people moved west, mixing with people with Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry3 along the Dnipro and Don rivers to establish Serednii Stih groups, from whom Yamnaya ancestors formed around 4000 bc and grew rapidly after 3750–3350 bc. The CLV people contributed around four-fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya and, entering Anatolia, probably from the east, at least one-tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age central Anatolians, who spoke Hittite4,5. We therefore propose that the final unity of the speakers of ‘proto-Indo-Anatolian’, the language ancestral to both Anatolian and Indo-European people, occurred in CLV people some time between 4400 bc and 4000 bc.",

          "abstract": "Place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are elements of a neural map of self position 1–5 . For these cells to benefit navigation, their representation must be dynamically related to the surrounding locations 2 . A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal’s path has been described for place cells, in which the sequence of spikes in each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal’s current location towards upcoming locations 6–8 . In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms when the animal approaches the choice point 9,10 , raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials 10 . However, to bridge the animal’s path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats that in individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal’s location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps are accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells that have putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive grid × direction cells. Sweeps extend into never-visited locations that are inaccessible to the animal. Sweeps persist during REM sleep. The sweep directions can be explained by an algorithm that maximizes the cumulative coverage of the surrounding manifold space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left–right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal–hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient ‘look around’ mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path.",

Here we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)-dimensional Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains6. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (‘Higgs’) mode7. These observations offer a viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and non-equilibrium quantum processes.",

          "abstract": "Granzymes are a family of serine proteases mainly expressed by CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and innate-like lymphocytes1. Although their primary function is thought to be the induction of cell death in virally infected and tumor cells, accumulating evidence indicates certain granzymes can elicit inflammation by acting on extracellular substrates1. Recently, we found that the majority of tissue CD8+ T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium and in inflamed organs across other diseases express granzyme K (GZMK)2, a tryptase-like protease with poorly defined function. Here, we show that GZMK can activate the complement cascade by cleaving C2 and C4. The nascent C4b and C2b fragments form a C3 convertase that cleaves C3, enabling assembly of a C5 convertase that cleaves C5. The resulting convertases generate all the effector molecules of the complement cascade: the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, the opsonins C4b and C3b, and the membrane attack complex. In RA synovium, GZMK is enriched in regions with abundant complement activation, and fibroblasts are the major producers of complement proteins that serve as substrates for GZMK-mediated complement activation. Further, Gzmk-deficient mice have less severe arthritis and dermatitis with concomitant decreases in complement activation. Our findings describe the discovery of a previously unidentified mechanism of complement activation that is entirely driven by lymphocyte-derived GZMK. Given the widespread abundance of GZMK-expressing T cells in tissues in chronic inflammatory diseases, GZMK-mediated complement activation is likely to be an important contributor to tissue inflammation in multiple disease contexts.",

Credit: Mark Garlick/Science Photo Library\n\nAstronomers have traced the origin of a fast radio burst (FRB) to the edge of an ancient galaxy — suggesting that these mysterious, millisecond-long flashes of energy are even weirder than previously thought.\n\nFRBs were discovered nearly two decades ago, and most are thought to come from magnetars. These dense, dead stars, which host powerful magnetic fields, typically form in young galaxies, when a massive star collapses during a supernova.\n\nAstrophysicists turn fast radio bursts into cosmic probes\n\nNow, an FRB has been found at the edge of a galaxy in which stellar activity has slowed, strengthening evidence that at least some FRBs must have another provenance. “The FRB origin story is far from boring, and certainly far from solved,” says Wen-fai Fong, an astronomer at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nFong and her colleagues spotted the signal using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), a radio telescope in southern British Columbia. CHIME has already spotted more than 1,000 FRBs. But this is the first repeating FRB to be pinpointed using the telescope’s Outriggers, a trio of observatories that help CHIME to detect not just an FRB but also its source. Once CHIME can routinely locate FRBs, “it will be the next big game changer in the field”, says Laura Spitler, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany.\n\nGlobular clusters",

          "authors": "Dean Falk",
          "abstract": "In November 1924 — on the day they were hosting a wedding at their Johannesburg home in South Africa — Australian anatomist and physician Raymond Dart and his wife Dora noticed two men staggering up the drive with two large boxes. According to Dart’s memoirs, written decades later1, Dora had bemoaned the fact that the fossils Dart had been expecting had arrived on this day “of all days”. She had begged him not to “go delving in all that rubble until the wedding [was] over and everybody [had] left”.\n\nThe boxes contained what would become one of the world’s most famous fossils, the Taung Child.\n\n100 years of Australopithecus\n\nIn just a few weeks — astonishingly — Dart was able to use this one individual to surmise the broad course of human evolution as we understand it today. Previous evidence for human ancestry made use of fossils that bore a closer resemblance to modern humans. Dart’s description was astounding because it was of a species that was more apelike than humanlike, a revelation that in turn suggested that humanity’s evolutionary path had originated in Africa.\n\nDart’s report of the fossilized skull and matching endocast — an internal cast of the braincase formed from sediments that had accumulated in it — was published2 in Nature on 7 February 1925. Both the discovery and Dart’s insights deserve to be celebrated. There were, however, things that Dart could not have known and details that he misconstrued. Today — a century on — the fossil is still prompting questions about human evolution.\n\nFresh finds\n\nIn his Nature paper, Dart argued that the Taung Child belonged to a previously unknown group of bipedal human ancestors that he called ‘man-apes’ or more formally, Australopithecus africanus, meaning southern ape from Africa.\n\nDart’s find was described in newspapers all over the world, and he became famous overnight. But it took decades and the discovery of more australopithecine fossils in South Africa before scientists began to accept his controversial ideas about human evolution. At the time, several fellows of the Royal Society of London thought that a specimen found in the village of Piltdown in East Sussex, UK, known as Piltdown Man (which was later exposed as a hoax), belonged to the oldest ancestor leading to modern humans.\n\nBut Dart’s ideas were eventually accepted. In fact, his announcement in 1925 nailed the big picture of hominin evolution as it is understood today. His claim that Taung belonged to a previously unrecognized group of early hominins that shared features of both humans and other living apes still holds. So does his inference that Taung was bipedal because of where the spinal cord entered the bottom of the skull. He also speculated correctly that the genus Homo arose from Australopithecus and that, as Charles Darwin had predicted3, the cradle of humanity was in Africa rather than in England or Asia.\n\nDart judged Taung to be a six-year-old child with a cranial capacity (a proxy for brain size) of 520 cubic centimetres4. He also estimated the fossil’s age to be about one million years. However, in the mid-1920s, few comparisons had been made of the development of humans and other apes after birth and during infancy and other life-history stages. Moreover, Dart did not have access to imaging technologies available today, which enable scientists to ‘see’ inside fossilized bones5, or to the techniques now used to date fossils.\n\nPalaeoanthropologist Phillip Tobias (right) points out a feature on Taung’s endocast to Ramond Dart (left) and the author (D.F.) in 1984.Credit: Dean Falk\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Taung’s age at death has been revised by researchers who study the evolution of growth and development in part by evaluating dental development and brain growth in an expanding record of fossil hominin juveniles6. We now know that Taung was around 3.8 years old when it died, with a brain of near-adult size and developmental maturity beyond that of a human of the same age6. (Some scientists think Taung was female because the best current estimate for its adult cranial capacity, around 405 cubic centimetres, is low for australopithecines, and female australopithecines had smaller braincases than males did7.) Another study indicates that Taung dates to about 2.58 million years ago, which is well within the range of 3.6 million to 2 million years ago for all of the Australopithecus specimens found in South Africa8.\n\nOut of Africa: celebrating 100 years of human-origins research\n\nThese are not trivial revisions. On the contrary, they raise important questions about when, why and how an unusual life-history stage — namely childhood — evolved and what other changes (such as in brain size) accompanied its emergence.\n\nMost ape infants can cling onto their mothers’ bodies actively by a few months after their birth, whereas human babies are slower to mature and remain dependent on their parents or carers for much longer. Indeed, most apes do not have a childhood — a period during which individuals who are weaned continue to be nurtured, mainly by their elders.\n\nIn her assessment of Taung’s baby teeth and first permanent molars, biological anthropologist B. Holly Smith concluded that Taung was maturing at the rate of a non-human ape and was well accustomed to solid foods, although it might still have received a low level of nursing. According to Smith, “Taung died at, or did not long survive, the transition to independent feeding, as a ‘weanling’.” It was not a “‘child’ in any scientific sense”6.\n\nHumans evolved for distance running — but ancestor ‘Lucy’ didn’t go far or fast\n\nThe revised estimates, suggesting an ape-like rate of development, indicate that — ironically — the Taung Child never had, and would never have had (even had it survived), a childhood6.\n\nChildhood is probably a crucial innovation in human evolution because it creates the opportunity for offspring to learn much more from their nurturing elders than would otherwise be possible. In fact, the emergence of a prolonged period of dependency or ‘helplessness’ in human ancestors is widely thought to have produced conditions conducive to cognitive evolution.\n\nAt first blush, it might seem puzzling that australopithecines matured at an apelike pace even though they were bipedal. But unlike later hominins, australopithecines spent much of their time in trees and, like other apes, probably slept there. They would have needed the faster-developing apelike anatomy to climb and move through trees. The apelike development of Taung and other australopithecines suggests that delayed growth and childhood emerged only after the descendants of australopithecines had begun to live fully on the ground and had lost numerous arboreal adaptations. As terrestrial bipedalism became more habitual, evolutionary tweaks that slowed down and elaborated the development of nervous, skeletal and muscular systems probably repurposed much of the anatomy that had been needed for arboreal locomotion.\n\nInto the unknown\n\nSmith and others have suggested that, rather than emerging in australopithecines, childhood probably evolved in Homo erectus — possibly along with increased body size, brain size and cognitive capacities. Meanwhile, some researchers have found that the rate of dental growth in an approximately 1.77-million-year-old Homo fossil from Dmanisi, Georgia, was relatively high9 — similar to the rate of dental growth found in Taung and living great apes6. In this specimen, however, the formation of the posterior teeth was delayed, as it is in modern humans. Because Dmanisi individuals had brains that were not much bigger than those of great apes or australopithecines, some have suggested that this delay might have been associated with the emergence of childhood before a large brain evolved9.",

          "abstract": "Languages including Farsi are members of the globe-spanning Indo-European language family.Credit: Tina Manley/Alamy\n\nAncient-genomics researchers have pinpointed the homelands of a nomadic tribe that transformed the culture and genetics of Europe and Asia, revealing a potential source for the Indo–European language family, spoken by much of the world.\n\nGenomes from more than 400 individuals suggest that the Yamnaya — Bronze Age herders from the steppes of present-day Russia and Ukraine — emerged along the northern shores of the Black Sea. The findings are published on 5 February in Nature1,2.\n\n“I think they are truly groundbreaking,” says Kristian Kristiansen, an archaeologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. “This really solves two big unresolved questions.” The first is the origin of the Yamnaya.\n\nThe second was posed in the eighteenth century, when scholars noticed similarities between classical Greek and Latin and Sanskrit, an ancient language from South Asia, and suggested a common origin.\n\nNearly half the world’s population speaks at least one of the roughly 400 Indo–European languages. These include nearly all European and Central Asian languages, as well as those from South Asia and Iran.\n\n“This Indo–European story has been mystery for 200 years, and now step by step, we are coming closer to the solution,” says Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Helsinki.\n\n‘Tracer dye’\n\nFor decades, the leading theory for the ubiquity of Indo–European languages was that early farmers, living in a region known as Anatolia, which includes present-day Turkey, exported languages in the family as the agricultural revolution spread starting around 9,000 years ago.\n\nThe ‘Anatolian hypothesis’ took a blow in 2015, when two blockbuster ancient-genomics papers identified a migration of Yamnaya herders across Eurasia beginning 5,500 years ago3,4. This and subsequent work showing the arrival of ‘steppe’ ancestry in most places that Indo–European languages are spoken was ammunition for the ‘steppe hypothesis’ that Yamnaya were responsible for seeding Indo-European languages far and wide.\n\n“Yamnaya ancestry is like a tracer dye whose spread you can connect with Indo–European language spread,” says David Reich, a population geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who co-led the latest studies.\n\nThe region around the Caucasus mountains, between Europe and Asia, was home to people who spoke the earliest Indo-European languages.Credit: Yuriy Pozdnikov/Alamy\n\nBut even with the genetic evidence, the steppe hypothesis had a major problem: how to explain the Anatolian branch of Indo–European — some scholars use the term Indo–Anatolian — which includes Hittite, a language used by a civilization that flourished in modern-day Turkey in the second millennium bc. Geneticists have failed to find Yamnaya ancestry in ancient Anatolian speakers.\n\nIn search of that connection, Reich and his colleagues hoped to identify the genetic origins of the Yamnaya. This has been a challenge because of the group’s rapid expansion of a nearly identical genetic signature. “It looks like a kind of cancer tumour, and you can’t say where the origin of the tumour is because it expanded so fast,” says Reich.\n\nTo overcome this, Reich and his colleagues, including scientists in Russia and Ukraine, generated genome data from 428 ancient individuals, including hundreds of Yamnaya people and individuals who predated them living across the steppe and further southeast along the Caucasus mountains.\n\nRoute to Anatolia\n\nThe approach identified a genetic signature in people living in a region between the Caucasus mountains and the lower Volga River to the north that connects the earliest Yamnaya and ancient Anatolians. Reich’s team found that the Yamnaya emerged when people with Caucasus-Lower Volga ancestry moved west around 6,000 years ago and mixed with a diverse group of hunter-gatherers living along the Black Sea. The same Caucasus-Lower Volga ancestry also appeared in ancient Anatolia around this time.\n\nBased on this evidence, the researchers think that the earliest Indo-European languages were spoken by people living in the Caucasus–Lower Volga, who then carried them to Anatolia and to the Black Sea steppe, where the Yamnaya and their descendants spread them still further.\n\nThe geneticists stress that migrations aren’t the only way languages transmit, and that their work provides a hypothesis for others to test. “This is a very good case for the solution to the Indo-European problem,” says Iosif Lazaridis, a Harvard population geneticist who co-led the studies. “But we can’t prove these people spoke Anatolian language because they’re not buried with tablets saying I’m an Anatolian speaker.”",

          "abstract": "Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which put a spotlight on US health disparities, led to increased domestic helicopter research in the country.Credit: Scott Hurd/Alamy\n\n‘Helicopter research’ doesn’t happen just when researchers from rich countries swoop in and exploit the resources of low-income ones — rich universities are increasingly taking advantage of poorer institutions in the same country, and often in the same neighbourhood.\n\nMarylin Fraser, the head of the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, a non-profit organization in New York City that focuses on community health and education, has experienced this at first hand. Several times a year, she says, researchers at prestigious US institutions come to her asking to recruit study participants from her community.\n\nFraser turns many away for neglecting to consider the community’s input or failing to recognize and compensate the work that the institution would contribute by facilitating collaboration. She now accepts only the proposals that share funding and project leadership with researchers at Arthur Ashe. It’s exhausting, says Fraser. “You feel as though you are always in a constant fight.”\n\nThis experience is not unique. Around the world, many resource-poor institutions that support marginalized communities, such as Indigenous peoples or Black and Latine groups, are courted by staff and researchers at nearby well-off institutions who lack the understanding to create equitable partnerships. “The issue is that a privileged person is taking advantage of a less-privileged one. It can be very patronizing,” says Adriana Romero-Olivares, a microbial ecologist at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.\n\nDescribed as ‘domestic helicopter research’ in Cell last year1, the term refers to a well-documented scenario in which scientists from wealthy countries conduct research in low- or middle-income countries with little to no involvement of local communities and researchers. The “helicopter” or “parachute” collaborators leave, taking data and expertise from local people instead of working to ensure that they are engaged with and benefit from the research.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nDomestic helicopter research — often focused on race, ethnicity or genetic ancestry — occurs when unequal partnerships form between researchers in the same country. It results in the “erosion of trust between researchers and the communities they aim to serve”, wrote Marcus Lambert, a public-health epidemiologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in New York City, and his co-authors in the Cell commentary. A major concern, he says, is that the practice seems to be on the rise in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nHarmful effects\n\nOne damaging aspect of domestic helicopter research is that it “saps funding” from poorer institutions, Lambert and his co-authors say. In the past three years, less than one-third of funding from the US National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities — a department that aims to address health challenges faced by minority racial and ethnic groups, rural populations and those with low socio-economic status — has gone to the poorer institutions that serve these communities.\n\nResearchers are also concerned that such work often doesn’t serve the people who were asked to participate, and can sometimes harm them.\n\nA 2020 paper led by Brandon Brown, a public-health researcher at the University of California, Riverside, describes a case study in which a community leader had agreed to work with a researcher from a US university on a survey about HIV and ageing2. The local leader was expected to recruit participants and pay for a space to conduct the survey. He then had to fight to get access to the resulting survey material, which he discovered contained stigmatizing and outdated terminology. He also found out that there were no plans to disseminate the data or results in a way that might help the participants or their wider community.\n\nWhen Brown presented the paper at a conference, he received criticism from some attendees for naming the researchers involved. “I responded that this is why it keeps happening — because it’s invisible,” he says.\n\nLambert and his colleagues say that the COVID-19 pandemic — which brought US health disparities into sharp focus — has led to an increase in domestic helicopter research across the country. Health-equity studies gained more funding as a result of the pandemic, and the recipients sought out more researchers and participants from poorer communities. This has led to surging cases of domestic helicopter research, the Cell commentary states.\n\nThere are no data on the incidence of domestic helicopter research worldwide, but Fernanda Adame, an environmental scientist at Griffith University in Nathan, Australia, says that it’s likely to be more common in countries that have large wealth disparities. “If you don’t address it, your research is not going to be as good, as you will have limited information and limited impact,” she adds. “If you didn’t speak to the people involved [in the research], they are less likely to use that information.”\n\nPositive changes",

          "abstract": "The 42-day ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, which took effect on 19 January, provides a vital opportunity to begin to address the devastation from the 15-month war, scientists there have told Nature. The ceasefire might yet prove temporary, and whether or not it holds, the long-term future for the territory and its citizens remains highly uncertain.\n\nWhile daily bombing is suspended, international organizations can complete a detailed assessment of Gaza’s water, food, health and infrastructure needs, the researchers say.\n\n“There’s a need to document what has been happening here in Gaza and to publish [the results] with other researchers worldwide,” says neuroscientist Khamis Elessi, head of the Evidence-Based Medicine Unit at the Islamic University of Gaza, who now spends most of his time treating injured people at the Ahli Arab hospital.\n\nThis knowledge is needed to guide those undertaking recovery and rebuilding in Gaza, during the ceasefire and when the war is over. “Research is critical [at this stage]” adds Samer Abuzerr, who studies water-borne diseases at the University College of Science and Technology in Gaza.\n\nElessi and Abuzerr are among more than ten scientists who spoke to Nature for this article. These scholars managed to continue their research, and some even published their results, despite facing homelessness, recurrent displacement and a dearth of food and basic necessities.\n\nNeuroscientist Khamis Elessi (left) receiving an award in 2022 from Liz Grant, director of the Global Health Academy, University of Edinburgh and (right) during the current war.Credit: Khamis Elessi\n\n“The Palestinian academic community’s efforts to continue their work under such difficult circumstances are a testament to their unwavering commitment to education and knowledge,” says Aya ElMashharawi, an online-learning researcher at the University College of Applied Sciences in Gaza.\n\nOn 7 October 2023, some 1,200 people were killed when Hamas attacked Israel. Some 47,500 people have been killed as a result of Israel's retaliation. These figures are according to data reported to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nResearchers and specialists in humanitarian assistance estimate that 90% of Gaza’s 2.2-million population is homeless. Systems ensuring food, supplies, water, sanitation, education, health care, energy and the broader economy have been destroyed or are critically endangered, requiring rebuilding.\n\nAnother urgent need, the researchers say, is removal of debris from bomb damage. According to a preliminary assessment by the UN Environment Programme published in June, for every square metre of the Gaza Strip, there is an estimated 100 kilogrammes of debris, such as concrete, iron and steel, as well as residue from exploded and unexploded bombs, asbestos and human remains.\n\n“More than 97% of Gaza’s water comes from a groundwater aquifer,” says Ahmed Hilles, head of the National Institute for Environment and Development in Gaza. “The porosity [of the aquifer’s layers] is very high, so the potential of [groundwater] contamination is also very high,” he adds.\n\nUniversities, too, will need to be rebuilt. Fifteen out of Gaza’s 21 universities, university-colleges and community-colleges have been either severely damaged or destroyed, according to September data from the UN science and cultural agency UNESCO.\n\nIn a written response sent to Nature, an Israel Defense Forces representative explained that, as part of its efforts to dismantle Hamas's military capabilities, “there has been an operational need, among other things, to strike or raid buildings” where Hamas “placed some of its terror infrastructure”. The representative added: “Hamas systematically uses public buildings that are supposed to be used for civilian purposes only, including educational institutions and universities.”\n\nSewage in the streets\n\nEven before the war, just 10% of Gazans had access to safe water. That is now 4%. Thirty per cent have access to a sewage network, compared with 70% pre-war, according to a November report of Gaza's reconstruction needs1 authored by Hilles who also lectured at Al-Azhar University in Gaza. “There is sewage water collected in the streets. Repairing the sewage system is urgent, so people will not get water-borne diseases,” Elessi adds.\n\nAround half of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are not functioning, and the rest are only partially operational, according to the World Health Organization. Gazans are experiencing high rates of diarrhoea, respiratory infections, skin rash, scabies and viral hepatitis, according to a study co-authored by Abuzerr, published last November2.\n\n“We have 350,000 patients with chronic diseases who have not been followed for the last 16 months. We have 11,000 cancer patients,” says Elessi. “They are all in pain and deteriorating because there is no therapy nor referral abroad. These patients should be dealt with urgently.”\n\n‘Expedite reconstruction’\n\nElMashharawi studied the impact of displacement on almost 200 staff members at her university. “Establishing temporary shelters and expediting the reconstruction of houses is a top priority,” she says.\n\nAya ElMashharawi: \"I remain committed to my academic journey.\"Credit: Aya ElMashharawi- UCAS\n\n“Four floors above us were bombed, killing 30 people,” says El Mashharawi, who is now in the Nuseirat refugee camp. “It was an incredibly terrifying experience that I can’t even describe, but by the grace of God, we survived,” she recalls.",

          "abstract": "The headquarters of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.Credit: Getty\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has mandated that all scientific manuscripts produced by its researchers that are under review at a journal be withdrawn so that certain language relating to gender can be stripped from them.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nThe directive, sent by the agency’s chief science officer to some staff members on 31 January, is meant to bring the CDC into compliance with an executive order issued that month by US President Donald Trump seeking to restore “biological truth” to the federal government by recognizing only two sexes: male and female. Executive orders can direct agencies inside the federal government but cannot change existing laws.\n\nAccording to a copy of the e-mail, shared in the newsletter Inside Medicine, manuscripts must not include any mention of terms including ‘gender’, ‘transgender’, ‘pregnant person’, ‘transsexual’ or ‘non-binary’. CDC scientists who co-author papers originating from outside the agency that include these terms are also expected to rescind their authorship.\n\nIt’s unclear how many scientific reports will be affected by the mandate, which applies to all manuscripts written or co-authored by CDC researchers and includes papers that are being prepared for submission, in revisions with journal editors or have been accepted for publication but not yet posted online. It is also uncertain whether journals, which have their own rules for discussing gender and sex, will comply with the directive. Fields such as public health, which have embraced gender identity as an aspect of research in topics including health disparities, are likely to be affected the most by the rules.\n\n“This announcement is mind-boggling in its implications,” says Thomas Babor, an emeritus professor of public health at UConn Health in Farmington, Connecticut. “Because of the enormous impact the CDC has in the United States and globally, the instruction to remove mentions of ‘forbidden terms’ could stifle the usefulness of scientific research for years to come.”\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services, which is the parent agency to the CDC, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe importance of language\n\nGendered terms such as ‘man’, ‘woman’ and ‘non-binary’ have been widely embraced across scientific disciplines because, unlike terms related to biological sex (for example, male and female), they provide cultural, social and psychological context for a person’s lived experience.\n\n‘Never seen anything like this’: Trump’s team halts NIH meetings and travel\n\nThe CDC mandate, however, will erase mention of queer, intersex and transgender individuals from future literature and seems to legitimize “scientific sexism”, says James Mungin, a biomedical scientist at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, who identifies as transgender. Under the new rules, CDC researchers would be unable to share basic demographic data, such as gender identity or sexual orientation, about study participants — omissions that could lead to inaccuracies or ethical breaches if scientists are barred from disclosing why certain participants were removed from a study, Mungin says. Furthermore, gender identity and sexual orientation are nearly impossible to exclude when it comes to the study and treatment of conditions such as HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n“If you’re working in basic science, you might get away with just references to sex, but gender is everywhere in public health,” says Ayden Scheim, a social epidemiologist at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who identifies as trans and studies the health care of marginalized communities. “Unfortunately, I see two things happening: a lot of these withdrawn papers will never be published” because collaborators outside the CDC aren’t going to agree to omit data, Scheim says, “and in the long term, a lot of research that focuses on health inequities for women or LGBTQ+ people will disappear”.",

          "abstract": "USAID programmes fund global efforts to tackle diseases such as HIV and malaria.Credit: Kevin Dietsch/Getty\n\nFranklin Wanyama’s world was thrown into turmoil last month, when US President Donald Trump abruptly announced a freeze on foreign aid. Wanyama, a 29-year-old in Nairobi who was born HIV-positive, is one of millions of people worldwide whose life-saving treatment is funded by a US foreign aid programme.\n\nThe HIV clinic Wanyama visits has managed to continue delivering medications to its patients — although many clinics aren’t, say researchers. But drug supplies are being rationed.\n\nExclusive: how NSF is scouring research grants for violations of Trump’s orders\n\n“We patients who are HIV positive, we are really panicked,” says Wanyama, whose two children do not carry the virus. He’s lost his job mentoring other HIV-positive people at a US-funded facility and is worried about continued access to medication. “The way things are going, I feel like I have worked so much for nothing.”\n\nAs the Trump administration announces drastic policy changes, nowhere is the shock more palpable than in the field of global health. Scientists, medics and health officials say the outsize US influence on battling disease globally will be difficult to quickly replace.\n\nUS actions such as the foreign-aid freeze and its pull-out from the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, will affect billions of dollars in annual funding to battle HIV, malaria and other areas in global health. That will cost lives and threaten global security, say researchers. “It will make the world a less safe place,” says Peter Horby, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of Oxford, UK.\n\n‘High anxiety moment’: Biden’s NIH chief talks Trump 2.0 and the future of US science\n\nFunding freeze\n\nAfter the Trump administration announced a three-month freeze on foreign aid last month, effects have rippled through the global-health community. Programmes supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) — where many employees have been furloughed, according to news reports — fund research, prevention and care for diseases such as HIV and malaria, and work on other global health priorities.\n\n“People haven’t had a chance to get alternative funding because of the abrupt nature of this,” says Salim Abdool Karim, director of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, in Durban. The centre was due this week to enrol the first patient in a USAID-funded trial of HIV vaccines, which is now on hold. It is using its reserve funds to continue a trial testing whether a vaginal insertion can prevent HIV transmission.\n\nHIV clinics in Kenya and elsewhere have been affected by the freezes on US aid money.Credit: Pedro Ugarte/AFP via Getty\n\n“It is chaos,” says an HIV researcher in Africa, who runs a clinic that treats thousands of patients and is supported by a US programme called the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and asked not to be named because of fears of reprisal. More than 20 million people mostly in Africa, including more than a million children and pregnant people, receive antiretroviral drugs through the US$6.5-billion programme.\n\nThe clinic has had to suspend staff, which were funded by PEPFAR, and its patients are continuing to receive drugs only because of volunteer efforts. Last night, the clinic received a waiver from the US government that appears to allow them to resume HIV treatment, but uncertainty abounds.\n\nHIV treatments threatened\n\nIn South Africa, where the government provides the bulk of HIV care using some PEPFAR funding, the impact of the aid freeze will be minimal, says Abdool Karim. But in many other African countries, “if PEPFAR services stop, the effect will be catastrophic. The governments can’t just step in to meet the shortfall”.\n\nStopping antiretroviral treatment causes virus levels to rebound, making it possible for a person to transmit HIV — including through pregnancy to unborn children — and facilitating the evolution of drug resistance. “I’m hoping that someone somewhere sees sense and does not continue this abrupt ending of AIDS treatment programmes,” says Abdool Karim.",

          "abstract": "Elizabeth Holmes (second from left) was convicted of conspiracy and defrauding investors in her company, Theranos, after overhyping the science behind her work.Credit: Nic Coury/AP/Alamy\n\nSharing scientific discoveries requires as much care as uncovering them, a fact I didn’t fully appreciate until I moved from academia to public relations. Missteps in communication — whether intentional or not — can undermine trust and even harm the reputation of entire fields.\n\nI started working in science communication as a postdoctoral fellow at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), and I spent time in the policy and communications office at the NIH’s National Institute of Nursing Research. When the COVID-19 pandemic shut down non-urgent research on the NIH campus, I decided to start exploring careers in communication. I took a position supporting medical and scientific communications for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, which funds US biomedical research. In 2021, I transitioned into public relations through an account role at an agency called LifeSci Communications, in New York City; a year later, I shifted to specialize in scientific storytelling at Syneos Health Communications, also in New York.\n\nIn public relations, we shape how people perceive a company or a product, working across many communication platforms: websites, press releases, social media and more. In my role, I focus on creating a compelling narrative to help biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies communicate their scientific approach to investors, the media and consumers. For me, distilling complex topics into messages that resonate is a welcome challenge.\n\nWhether helping a client to explain why the science behind their treatment is unique, or combating vaccine misinformation, I’ve found that the temptation to misrepresent, inflate or otherwise hype data is ever present, as are the dangers that come with doing so.\n\nConsider Theranos, the biotech start-up in Palo Alto, California. The company’s bold claims about revolutionizing blood testing captured public and investor interest, but its refusal to acknowledge technical limitations or share transparent data led to one of the most notorious scandals in science and technology. Ultimately, the company was shut down in 2018, and founder Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of fraud in 2022.\n\n‘Blood, sweat and tears’: Building a network for Black scientists\n\nThe fallout left scientists questioning whether the benefits of other scientific innovations had been over-inflated, and many called for more rigorous peer-reviewed evidence before funding new ventures. This ripple effect shows the stakes of miscommunication – it can undermine public trust in legitimate breakthroughs, spinning fact into fiction.\n\nThe temptation to ‘sell out’ is present across the science-communications industry, in which the pressure to stand out might overshadow the responsibility to communicate with integrity. Overselling findings, cherry-picking data or making claims that the evidence does not yet support can seem like a quick route to funding or to recognition. But these shortcuts come at a cost: eroded trust, scepticism about future work and, in some cases, damage to a field’s reputation.\n\nKisha Greer works in public relations, helping companies to honestly and ethically communicate their scientific approach.Credit: Julia Johnson Photography\n\nThe lessons from Theranos are clear: hype and secrecy are a dangerous combination. But how can scientists avoid these pitfalls and communicate their work responsibly? Here are some strategies for selling science without crossing the line into spin.\n\nSet realistic expectations\n\nScience is inherently exciting; it offers new possibilities and solutions to pressing challenges. But that excitement should never come at the expense of honesty. Research is rarely foolproof, and overselling it by exaggerating its impact or downplaying its limitations can backfire, leading to disappointment and scepticism when the full picture emerges.\n\nOne way to set realistic expectations is to ask yourself, “If this statement was taken out of context in a headline, would it still accurately represent the research?” This exercise helps to identify overly broad or optimistic phrases, which should be replaced with precise, contextual language such as ‘early-stage research’ or ‘preclinical findings’.\n\nAnother approach is to emphasize the scientific journey rather than just the destination. Instead of saying, “On the basis of the early clinical data, this treatment could cure cancer,” highlight the next step forwards: “Early clinical data suggest this treatment has the potential to improve outcomes for people with cancer. To explore this further, we’ve initiated a phase II study to better understand its effects and expect to see initial results by the end of the next year.” This statement highlights progress while acknowledging that the research is ongoing.\n\nClear communication ensures that audiences understand the iterative nature of science. Research evolves. Setting realistic expectations from the start fosters trust and enthusiasm that will last beyond the initial headlines.\n\nKnow your audience’s needs\n\nA message that resonates with one group might fall flat with another. Tailoring communication to your audience is critical.\n\nFor instance, if you’re writing a grant application for research on stem-cell responses to traumatic brain injury (TBI), focus on feasibility, potential impact and measurable goals to show how the work could fill a gap in TBI treatments. When presenting your findings at a scientific conference, highlight the methodologies and technical details that underpin your results. Discuss, for example, which imaging techniques were used to track the integration of stem cells and the strategies for quantifying stem-cell responses.\n\nIf, instead, you are communicating to the general public, focus on why your research matters to society and what people can expect as a result. Avoid boring them with too many technical details. This might require simplifying your message, so that more people can understand it: “My research explores how the brain can heal itself by using its own cells to repair damage.”\n\nBy aligning your message with your audience’s needs, you can prevent misunderstandings and ensure that the most relevant information comes through. Clear, targeted messaging builds credibility, creating a foundation for long-term engagement.\n\nUse data transparently to build trust\n\nTransparency is more than an ethical responsibility; it’s the foundation of trust. People respect honesty, especially when it includes uncertainties and setbacks.\n\nData are at the core of science and should be used thoughtfully and generously to support your points. Highlighting only favourable results can give a skewed picture of the research, leading audiences to overestimate its impact. Instead, aim for a balanced view, showing both supportive and contrasting data and acknowledging any limitations.\n\nWhen preparing to present data, I often start by asking, “What’s the most important takeaway, and what context does the audience need to fully understand it?” For example, if a study on Parkinson’s disease showed positive results in a small subgroup of participants with mild neurocognitive decline but mixed outcomes in the overall study group, craft your messaging to reflect that variability.\n\nEmphasize how the findings added to the scientific understanding of the disease. Rather than focusing solely on the positive results found in the subgroup, this approach provides the context needed to position the study as an important step forwards without overstating its immediate implications for people with Parkinson’s.\n\nSuch transparency builds trust with your audience and amplifies the impact of your science.",

          "title": "Microbes in space: how bacteria could help sustain long-distance space travel",
          "authors": "Amber Dance",
          "abstract": "The microorganisms lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 25 July 2019, headed for the International Space Station, some 400 kilometres above. Their mission: to boldly mine basalt, in low Earth orbit, where no living organisms had mined before.\n\nFive days after take off, astronaut Luca Parmitano unpacked microbe-laden cartridges and installed them in an incubator. The bacteria were given liquid growth media plus Icelandic basalt, from which, Earth-based experimenters hoped, they would extract valuable rare-earth elements1.\n\nWhen Parmitano, a European Space Agency astronaut based in Houston, Texas, thinks about microbes, he mainly worries about how they might harm him, and how to prevent them from contaminating lifeless environments such as the Moon. But as space agencies look beyond the space station’s low Earth orbit, scientists say that microbes are poised to take on new and beneficial roles, including mining useful elements, making foodstuffs and medicines, and creating the building blocks for habitats.\n\nMicrobial miners take on rare-earth metals\n\n“Microorganisms can do a lot of different tasks for us,” says space microbiologist Rosa Santomartino, co-director of the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh and co-organizer of the study that sent the microbes up in 2019. “Particularly, microorganisms are going to be important in the long-term and long-distance space experiments,” she adds.\n\nThat’s because the farther spacefarers travel, the harder and more expensive it will become to ship all the supplies that they’ll need. The International Space Station will close down in 2030, but the space station Lunar Gateway, which will orbit the Moon, will open in 2028 or so; Mars, and perhaps asteroids, are also on the horizon. Planners are therefore looking for ways to make what they need from what’s already available at their destination, and to recycle waste.\n\nMicrobes, which have evolved on Earth to perform all manner of chemical transformations, could be big assets in such work. But much is still unknown about how microbes will react to conditions in space, and even basic experiments can be tough to carry out.\n\n“We just have so much to do to understand what microbes are going to do up there, what they’re not going to do up there, and how can we make them do what we want them to do?” says Cheryl Nickerson, a microbiologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.\n\nMultifunctional microbes\n\nResearchers predict myriad mission tasks for space-bound microbes, including producing breathable oxygen, purifying water for drinking and supplying nutrients to crop plants. At NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, synthetic biologist Lynn Rothschild works with the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. A hardy microbe capable of forming long-lasting spores, B. subtilis has already proved it can survive the extremes of space travel. Rothschild hopes to engineer it to remediate toxic compounds called perchlorates that are naturally present in Martian water sources and to produce medicines.\n\nAstronauts might require any number of medications during a Mars mission, which could take nearly three years including 18 months in transit and time on the planet’s surface working and waiting for the planets to align for the return journey. Drugs that would counter damage to their bones from solar radiation, for instance, could come in handy. “You can’t take an entire pharmacy,” Rothschild says. “And even if you could, they go bad.” She and others hope to engineer bacteria to produce any medicines needed, to order and en route.\n\nSpirulina cyanobacteria have been engineered to produce painkillers.Credit: Sinclair Stammers/Science Photo Library\n\nWhile Rothschild predicts a library of dried-up B. subtilis spores, ready to re-animate and pump out medication, scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, are considering another group of microbes, called cyanobacteria. These organisms are photosynthetic, so they would use sunlight and the carbon dioxide already present in the Martian atmosphere. As a bonus, photosynthesis produces something else astronauts will need — oxygen.\n\nBerkeley bioengineer Adam Arkin and his colleagues have engineered the cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis, commonly known as spirulina, to synthesize the painkiller paracetamol (acetaminophen)2. It takes just two added genes, one from a bacterium and one from a mushroom, to get spirulina to convert the amino acid tyrosine into the drug. Arkin speculates that if they could get the microbes to make enough of it, astronauts could skip chemical purification and ingest the microbes directly — in a smoothie, he suggests — to quell a headache. But, he admits, there’s one significant gastronomic hurdle: “You’d be eating a lot of spirulina. And I promise you, nobody wants to eat a lot of spirulina. It tastes like armpits.”\n\nLunar cement\n\nMicrobes can also produce building materials, and even habitats. For housing, Rothschild is pursuing fungi, or what her team calls myco-architecture3. Fungi could transform feedstocks, such as wood chips or perhaps some sort of nutritious hydrogel, into long strands called hyphae. Such a material would have many advantages, including blocking radiation and sound and being relatively fire resistant. Rothschild says it even looks ‘cosy’, like chipboard — more home-like than, say, steel walls. She and her colleagues imagine sending up inflatable habitat moulds that are pre-seeded with fungi and their food; just add water and oxygen, and the fungi should do the rest.\n\nAt the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, mechanical engineer Aloke Kumar is thinking about a more conventional building material: bricks. Regolith, the loose rock and dust that tops the bedrock of Mars and the Moon, is more sand than clay — no clay at all on the Moon — so it needs help to stick together. Kumar proposes the assistance of Sporosarcina pasteurii. Found in sewage and soils, S. pasteurii convert soil urea into carbonate ions. Engineers on Earth have used the organism to remediate soils, and to produce limestone for biocement by combining the carbonate with calcium ions.\n\nToward sustainable space exploration: a roadmap for harnessing the power of microorganisms\n\nKumar’s team tried mixing the microbes and a calcium salt with simulated versions of lunar or Martian regolith4, which are available from government space agencies and commercial suppliers. After five days, the microbes had made bricks, although not particularly good ones. “I could crush these bricks with my own hands,” says Kumar.\n\nPerhaps, he mused, a natural additive would help. The team landed on guar gum, a binding and thickening agent used in applications such as textiles and cosmetics. Adding 1% guar gum resulted in tougher ‘space bricks’ as the team calls them; Kumar thinks that it makes the sandy regolith more habitable for the microbes, and that they probably eat it.\n\nBeyond structural applications, Santomartino and her colleagues hope to mine regolith, too. Microbes are already used on Earth to leach metals such as copper and gold from ore, and researchers are assessing their potential to collect the rare-earth metals that are essential for modern technologies such as mobile phones and wind turbines. A key question in their 2019 International Space Station experiment, known as BioRock, was whether microgravity would influence the ability of the soil microbe Sphingomonas desiccabilis to leach rare-earth elements and vanadium out of the rock. They compared the low-gravity space station cultures to controls on Earth. Parmitano also used centrifuges to simulate Earth gravity and Mars gravity, which is about three-eighths that of Earth.\n\nOver three weeks in culture, the microbes extracted small amounts of rare-earth elements from the rock — enough to prove the principle. But to the researchers’ surprise, gravity was largely irrelevant to S. desiccabilis1. They’d anticipated that in microgravity, there would be less mixing of the microbes with their media, leaving the bacteria undernourished, but the microbes’ needs seem to have been met. However, the researchers caution that they used just five millilitres of culture; the situation might be different if the experiment were scaled up.\n\nMicrobes could even produce the raw materials for making tools. Benjamin Lehner, director of the Dutch Marine Energy Centre in the Hague, the Netherlands, used microbes to extract iron from simulated regolith during his doctoral studies at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. His workhorse was Shewanella oneidensis, a soil- and deep-sea-dwelling microbe with no need for oxygen and a natural ability to reduce metal ions to create pure metal. Once the microbes processed the iron in the regolith, Lehner collected the metal using magnets. He then fed it into a 3D printer to produce cylinders, which were four times stronger than versions made without microbial help5, he says — probably because the microbe-mined material contained higher amounts of iron and lower levels of silicon.\n\nA lot to learn\n\nArkin and other astro-microbial engineers propose linking bioreactors to create ‘closed loop’ systems, in which the waste of one bioreactor feeds into the next, to grow food, produce breathable air and perform other tasks in an all-in-one solution.\n\nBut first, scientists have a lot to learn about microbial growth and activity beyond Earth. Although the International Space Station is slated to be de-commissioned, commercial companies such as Voyager Space, Airbus and Axiom Space will offer opportunities in low Earth orbit, the satellite-filled region about 160–1,600 kilometres above Earth’s surface. Even that close to home, researchers face many challenges. “Doing microbiology in space is 100% nothing like what you’ve done in your lab,” says Nickerson. “It’s not even close.”\n\nThe main challenge in low Earth orbit is the lack of gravity, so researchers typically pair their space experiments with Earth-based controls. Microgravity can affect microbes in unexpected ways. For example, in Nickerson’s early experiments, Salmonella typhimurium that had been to the space station made mice sicker than did cultures that stayed on Earth6. Microbes probably don’t sense the lack of gravity itself, Nickerson says, but they do experience less mixing in the liquid media. Nickerson has found that the fluid force surrounding space-faring microbes seems to mimic conditions inside animal intestines, in which Salmonella species would naturally activate their infectious abilities.\n\nBricks produced using mycelium, garden waste and wood chips as a part of a myco-architecture project.Credit: NASA\n\nThe launch itself is also a huge stressor, notes Nicol Caplin, a deep-space exploration scientist at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. She recommends shipping cultures desiccated and in stasis so that they won’t react to the launch; alternatively, scientists can use centrifuges or vibration plates to mimic the launch effects on terrestrial controls.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Tasker",
          "abstract": "Hidden in the Heavens: How the Kepler Mission’s Quest for New Planets Changed How We View Our Own Jason Steffen Princeton Univ. Press (2024)\n\nIn the mid-1980s, NASA engineer William Borucki faced a panel of in-house specialists. They told him to either justify an idea that many were calling crazy, or quit. His concept was for a space telescope dedicated to detecting extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, which orbit stars other than the Sun. It was an audacious idea, a decade before any such planets had been found.\n\nBorucki had been developing the concept since the 1970s and was under pressure to stop wasting NASA resources. Yet he managed to convince the panel to let him carry on, and even persuaded several members to join him. Still, it would take until 2001 for the mission to be signed off, and another eight years before Borucki’s crazy idea sat on the launchpad.\n\nWhy did Earth’s first radio message to alien civilizations leave out half of humanity?\n\nThat spacecraft, the Kepler Space Telescope, remains humanity’s most prolific planet hunter so far, having spied thousands of distant planets and many more candidate ones. In Hidden in the Heavens, astrophysicist Jason Steffen — who joined the mission a year before it launched in 2009 — relates the story of Kepler and its surprising discoveries.\n\nKepler detected planets by identifying the dimming of light from a star as a planet moved across its face. Doing this is extremely hard — Steffen compares the process to looking down at Las Vegas from space and searching for a fly buzzing around a street light. The Kepler team had to prove that the telescope’s instruments were up to the task this before the project was given the green light. So deputy principal investigator David Koch designed a simple but clever experiment to do so.\n\nKoch punched holes in a sheet of metal and illuminated it from behind to make an artificial field of stars. Wire was stretched across the holes, and an electric current was passed through it. The current warmed the wire, causing it to expand a little — just enough to simulate an Earth-sized planet crossing a distant star similar to the Sun. This test proved that, technically at least, the concept could work.\n\nOn the hunt\n\nNext, real target stars had to be selected. In practice, more than one light dip would need to be detected to prove that a planet was orbiting the star and to measure the period. To find a planet on an orbit similar to our own, Kepler would have to monitor the star for several years to confirm that the dips repeated.\n\nScaled up, that meant that Kepler needed to watch one patch of sky, which ideally contained as many stars as possible. That raised engineering problems — it needed to distinguish light from individual stars in a dense crowd, avoid bright stars that would saturate the detectors and handle limitations to the bandwidth needed to send the data back to Earth. The final choice was a region with plenty of stars for Kepler to explore, but not so many that the telescope would be overwhelmed.\n\nNASA engineer William Borucki drove development of the Kepler Space Telescope.Credit: Paul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle via AP/Alamy\n\nOnce Kepler’s hunt began, decisions also needed to be made around how the science team worked together. And Steffen describes how practices held over from the lengthy developmental phases — such as being overly protective about who had access to data — led to uneven workloads. Some members “were swamped and just trying to keep their heads above water“; others “felt stuck twiddling [their] thumbs with nothing to do”. Steffen sought a solution, which in the end was simply ensuring that the whole scientific team could access the regular teleconferences. “‘The participating scientists went rogue’ and changed everything,” Steffen recalls a colleague joking.\n\nDespite stringent planning, however, nothing involving space ever goes smoothly. And the team faced yet more decisions. One question was whether to sharpen the telescope’s focus after the first images seemed slightly blurry. It was designed to be adjusted, but moving any of the parts came with a risk. If the team did nothing, Kepler would still detect relatively large planets but would miss the smallest ones. If the scientists went ahead with adjusting it, results might improve — or there could be irreparable damage, and the entire mission could be jeopardized.\n\nWhether to intervene with a spacecraft far from Earth is a dilemma faced by most mission leaders. For example, in April 2023 the radar antenna on board the Juice mission, led by the European Space Agency, failed to fully deploy after a pin jammed. Mission control delivered a mechanical shock that helped the antenna to unfold. In January 2024, researchers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and NASA made a different decision for the XRISM X-ray telescope, when a protective aperture door failed to open. The telescope is otherwise performing well, so the team has decided not to attempt to free the door for the moment.\n\nIt all came down to a simple question, Steffen recalls: “Do we risk it all for that twenty percent?” In the case of Kepler, the team did. The mirror was moved by a mere 40 micrometres and the images sharpened.",

          "authors": "Linda Nordling",
          "abstract": "Illustration: David Parkins\nThe problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nI joined my current laboratory at a large Western institution as a PhD student seven years ago. I’m now two years into a postdoc there, taking on more responsibilities in the growing lab. However, my former PhD supervisor has accused me of bullying one of her new students.\n\nShe was never much of a mentor for me. Early on in my PhD, we realized that my project wasn’t going as planned. Instead of discussing a new direction, she asked me to lie and fake data for internal reports to save her reputation with our boss and clinic head. She blamed the failed project on me. After that, our relationship deteriorated as I lost trust in her.\n\nThree years ago, she hired a new PhD student who has caused a lot of problems. He’s lazy, lies, is not willing to memorize anything and is highly insubordinate. I’ve tried to help by answering his constant questions and by providing standard protocols, but my tone has occasionally been harsher when he’s been about to mess things up.\n\nRecently, my former supervisor accused me of not behaving appropriately. She went directly to our boss instead of discussing it with me or my current group leader. I feel frustrated by the lack of open communication and have a sense of betrayal. My colleagues tell me they don’t see an issue with my behaviour. Now I fear this accusation could jeopardize the job I love, and there seems to be nothing I can do about it. I would greatly appreciate any advice that the community can give me. — A frustrated neuroscientist\n\nThe advice\n\nNature’s careers team spoke about your situation to a professional mediator, a researcher who studies bullying in academic settings and an academic coach. They agreed that you describe a complex situation that has evolved from early career difficulties into current workplace tensions.\n\nThe three proposed different routes out of your impasse. However, they also suggested that you reflect on how your past experiences influence how you act and react in the present.\n\nFanny Zabloz, a mediator based in Valais, Switzerland, suggests asking your institution’s human-resources team for mediation, if you and your former supervisor are willing to take part. “Mediation could be particularly helpful here, as it provides a structured, neutral space to rebuild a more constructive working relationship, which is often essential, especially when both parties need to continue working together,” she says.\n\nHow to thank your lab mates: eight ways to show gratitude at the end of year\n\nThe mediation process can be either direct, with both parties in the same room, or ‘shuttle’, in which the parties remain separate, she says. In both cases, the mediator will probably meet each party individually first, to clarify the process, define confidentiality terms and allow the two sides to express their perspectives.\n\nZabloz emphasizes that mediation is future-focused rather than fault-finding. If a formal complaint of bullying has been made to your human-resources representative, you will probably instead enter a more investigative process, through which you can present your side. Zabloz notes that any disciplinary action typically requires substantial proof of misconduct, with multiple corroborating witnesses.\n\nAnother approach, which can be complementary to mediation, is to reflect more broadly about how you navigate relationships at work. The aim here is to develop new strategies for managing frustrations and conflicts. This could be done by reaching out to a trusted mentor, a counsellor or a coach.\n\nSimon Kay is an immunologist who worked in international development and for the biomedical funding charity Wellcome before becoming a full-time coach in Haywards Heath, UK, specializing in helping early-career academics.\n\nKay says he detects “a lot of anger and frustration” in your letter — and that such feelings, however understandable, can get in the way of a solution.\n\nShould I climb the career ladder as a manager, or will I regret leaving the lab bench behind?\n\nIf he were your coach, he says, although you would need to offload your frustration with the environment and people around you, he would want to work on your behaviours and how you can positively influence your situation, your relationships and your career direction. “Assuming [the correspondent] is open to coaching, our starting point would be to explore how they handle relationships, to explore patterns of behaviour and try to bring them to a level of awareness about their impact on and relationships with others,” he says.",

          "authors": "Gretchen T. Goldman",
          "abstract": "When asked in 1787 whether the fledgling United States would be a monarchy or a republic, founding father Benjamin Franklin replied, “a republic, if you can keep it”. Today, the republic is composed of US federal agencies filled with scientists tasked with advancing the nation’s health, safety, security and competitiveness — through forecasting storms, preventing the spread of food-borne illnesses and making roads safer.\n\nUntil last month, when Donald Trump became US president, I was one of those scientists. I know what it means to take the oath of federal service and to take pride in being a public servant. And I know that there are several steps that the scientific community — both inside and outside the US government — should be prepared to take in the light of the second Trump presidency.\n\nTrump will weaken climate action — the rest of the US must not follow suit\n\nI’ve spent much of my career tracking the use and misuse of science in policy decisions. In 2021, I was called up to the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, and in 2023, I became the climate-change research and technology director at the US Department of Transportation. The passing of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (2021), the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) and the CHIPS and Science Act (2022) represented an opportunity for the nation to meet its greatest challenges, from clean energy to industrial innovation and artificial intelligence. I wanted to be a part of it.\n\nI wasn’t alone. Hundreds of technical specialists also said yes to government work, driving our nation’s responses to climate change, societal inequities and more. In the past few years, the United States has made remarkable progress, investing billions of dollars in projects across all the states.\n\nNow, the Trump administration has moved to undo that progress. Week-one executive orders have led to the furlough and firing of government staff who work in environmental justice and equity. Many people in these jobs will watch their hard-won work get dismantled before their eyes. An unlucky few will be tasked with dismantling it themselves. Others might choose to leave federal service.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nBut despair is not an option. It is important to remember that notable gains have been made in federal scientific-integrity protections in the past two decades. And, as recent years attest, many researchers are willing and able to engage in policy conversations through advocacy, public commentary and demonstrations (A. D. Ross et al. Sci. Commun. 40, 228–245; 2018).\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists and others have developed policies to strengthen scientific integrity, which have since been implemented by federal agencies and Congress. More than 20 agencies have executed or bolstered their scientific-integrity policies and hired specialists, covering hundreds of thousands of people across the federal workforce.\n\nAs a result, federal scientists now have more rights and protection from political interference than ever. For example, many can speak to the media about their science without approval from their supervisors, and can publicly note a differing scientific opinion for their work. Procedures for adjudicating allegations are being implemented.\n\nThese protections provide a solid foundation for the defence of science. Combined with a more scientific-integrity-savvy workforce, these put federal scientists on higher ground than was the case under earlier administrations.",

          "title": "Why even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on",
          "authors": "Sean Carroll",
          "abstract": "Everyone has their favourite example of a trick that reliably gets a certain job done, even if they don’t really understand why. Back in the day, it might have been slapping the top of your television set when the picture went fuzzy. Today, it might be turning your computer off and on again.\n\nQuantum mechanics — the most successful and important theory in modern physics — is like that. It works wonderfully, explaining things from lasers and chemistry to the Higgs boson and the stability of matter. But physicists don’t know why. Or at least, if some of us think we know why, most others don’t agree.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nThe singular feature of quantum theory is that the way we describe physical systems is distinct from what we see when we observe them. The textbook rules of quantum mechanics therefore need to invoke special processes to describe ‘measurement’ or ‘observation’, unlike every previous framework for physics. As a field, physics does not have any consensus on why that is the case, or what it even means.\n\nThe first hints of quantum behaviour in nature came in works by physicists Max Planck in 1900 and Albert Einstein in 1905. They showed that certain properties of light could best be explained by imagining that it came in discrete, particle-like chunks, rather than as the smooth waves that classical electromagnetism depicts. But their ideas fell short of describing a complete theory. It was the German physicist Werner Heisenberg who, in 1925, first put forward a comprehensive version of quantum mechanics. Later that year, Max Born and Pascual Jordan followed up on that with Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger soon produced an independent formulation of the theory1.\n\nSo it is fair to celebrate 2025 as the true centenary of quantum theory. Although such a commemoration can rightly point to a wide variety of breathtaking experimental successes, it must leave room to acknowledge the foundational questions that remain unanswered. Quantum mechanics is a beautiful castle, and it would be nice to be reassured that it is not built on sand.\n\nBreak from the past\n\nEver since Isaac Newton formulated classical mechanics in the seventeenth century, theories of physics have followed a definite pattern. You have a system under consideration: perhaps a planet orbiting a star, or an electric field or a box of gas. At any one moment in time, the system is described by its ‘state’, which includes both the system’s current configuration and its rate of change; for a featureless single particle, this amounts to its position and velocity (or, equivalently, momentum). Then, you have equations of motion, which tell us how the system will evolve, given its present state. This basic recipe worked for everything from Newtonian gravity right up to Einstein’s theories of relativity, which, like quantum theory, are a product of the early twentieth century. But with the advent of quantum mechanics, the recipe suddenly failed.\n\nThe failure of the classical paradigm can be traced to a single, provocative concept: measurement. The importance of the idea and practice of measurement has been acknowledged by working scientists as long as there have been working scientists. But in pre-quantum theories, the basic concept was taken for granted. Whatever physically real quantities a theory postulated were assumed to have some specific values in any particular situation. If you wanted to, you could go and measure them. If you were a sloppy experimentalist, you might have significant measurement errors, or disturb the system while measuring it, but these weren’t ineluctable features of physics itself. By trying harder, you could measure things as delicately and precisely as you wished, at least as far as the laws of physics were concerned.\n\nLaser experiments have probed the reality of quantum entanglement, a concept alien to intuitive conceptions of how physics should work.Credit: Pascal Goetgheluck/SPL\n\nQuantum mechanics tells a very different story. Whereas in classical physics, a particle such as an electron has a real, objective position and momentum at any given moment, in quantum mechanics, those quantities don’t, in general, ‘exist’ in any objective way before that measurement. Position and momentum are things that can be observed, but they are not pre-existing facts. That is quite a distinction. The most vivid implication of this situation is Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, introduced in 1927, which says that there is no state an electron can be in for which we can perfectly predict both its position and its momentum ahead of time2.\n\nInstead, quantum theory describes the state of a system in terms of a wavefunction, a concept introduced3 by Schrödinger in 1926, together with his eponymous equation that describes how the system changes over time. For our single electron, the wavefunction is a number assigned to every position we might observe the electron to be in — a wave, in other words, that might be mostly localized near an atomic nucleus or spread widely throughout space.\n\nWhere things get tricky is in the relationship between the wavefunction and observable quantities, such as position and momentum, that we might want to measure. The answer was suggested4 by Born soon after Schrödinger’s original paper. According to Born’s interpretation, we can never precisely predict the outcome of a quantum measurement. Instead, we can determine the probability of getting any particular outcome for an electron’s position, say, by calculating the square of the wavefunction at that position. This recipe completely overturned the ideal of a deterministic, clockwork universe that had held sway since Newton’s time.\n\nIn retrospect, it is impressive how quickly some physicists were able to accept this shift. Some, not all. Luminaries such as Einstein and Schrödinger were unsatisfied with the new quantum consensus. It’s not that they didn’t understand it, but that they thought the new rules must be stepping stones to an even more comprehensive theory.\n\nThe appearance of indeterminism is often depicted as their major objection to quantum theory — “God doesn’t play dice with the Universe”, in Einstein’s memorable phrase. But the real worries ran deeper. Einstein in particular cared about locality, the idea that the world consists of things existing at specific locations in space-time, interacting directly with nearby things. He was also concerned about realism, the idea that the concepts in physics map onto truly existing features of the world, rather than being mere calculational conveniences.\n\n‘Shut up and calculate’: how Einstein lost the battle to explain quantum reality\n\nEinstein’s sharpest critique appeared in the famous EPR paper5 of 1935 — named after him and his co-authors Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen — with the title ‘can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?’. The authors answered this question in the negative, on the basis of a crucial quantum phenomenon they highlighted that became known as entanglement.\n\nIf we have a single particle, the wavefunction assigns a number to every possible position it might have. According to Born’s rule, the probability of observing that position is the square of the number. But if we have two particles, we don’t have two wavefunctions; quantum mechanics gives a single number to every possible simultaneous configuration of the two-particle system. As we consider larger and larger systems, they continue to be described by a single wavefunction, all the way up to the wavefunction of the entire Universe.\n\nAs a result, the probability of observing one particle to be somewhere can depend on where we observe another particle to be, and this remains true no matter how far apart they are. The EPR analysis shows that we could have one particle here on Earth and another on a planet light years away, and our prediction for what we would measure about the faraway particle could be ‘immediately’ affected by what we measure about the nearby particle.\n\nThe scare quotes serve to remind us that, according to the special theory of relativity, even the concept of ‘at the same time’ isn’t well defined for points far apart in space, as Einstein knew better than anyone. Entanglement seems to go against the precepts of special relativity by implying that information travels faster than light — how else can the distant particle ‘know’ that we have just performed a measurement?\n\nWe can’t actually use entanglement to communicate across great distances. Measuring our quantum particle here, we now know something about what will be observed far away, but anyone who is actually far away doesn’t have access to the knowledge we have, so no communication has occurred. But there is at least a certain tension between how quantum theory describes the world and how we think space-time works in Einsteinian relativity.\n\nReclaiming reality\n\nAttempts to resolve this tension have proliferated, with no clear consensus in sight. Indeed, significant disagreement lingers around the most central question we can think of: is the quantum wavefunction supposed to represent reality, or is it just a tool we use to calculate the probability of experimental outcomes? This issue fundamentally divided Einstein and the Danish physicist Niels Bohr in famous debates they had over decades about the meaning of quantum mechanics. Einstein, like Schrödinger, was a thoroughgoing realist: he wanted his theories to describe something we might recognize as physical reality. Bohr, along with Heisenberg, was willing to forgo any talk about what was ‘really happening’, focusing instead on making predictions for what will happen when something is measured.\n\nThe bizarre logic of the many-worlds theory\n\nThe latter perspective gave rise to ‘epistemic’ interpretations of quantum theory. The views of Bohr and Heisenberg came to be known as the Copenhagen interpretation, which is very close to what physicists teach in textbooks today. Modern versions include QBism6, short for ‘quantum Bayesianism’, and relational quantum mechanics7. Both of these interpretations emphasize how quantum states shouldn’t be considered in their own right, but only relative to an observer, the process of measuring and the changing states of knowledge during that process.",

Credit: Martin Dohrn/Science Photo Library\n\nA variety of mosquito once thought to have evolved in the tunnels of the London Underground seems to have originated alongside humans thousands of years ago in the Middle East, a genetic analysis reveals1.\n\nCulex pipiens f. molestus were notorious during the Second World War for biting Londoners sheltering from German air raids in the Underground’s tunnels and stations. The mosquito looks like the common house mosquito, Culex pipiens, but behaves very differently. For example, C. pipiens lives and breeds above ground, mates in swarms, bites birds and requires a blood meal before laying eggs. The molestus form breeds underground, can mate in confined spaces, bites mammals and can lay eggs without having dined on blood.\n\nMosquito blood meals reveal history of human infections\n\nIn the 1990s, scientists suggested that molestus could have evolved in the London Underground tunnels themselves2, but populations of the same form have since been found underground in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia, making this hypothesis unlikely.\n\nTo trace where the insects might have originated, evolutionary biologist Yuki Haba, now at Columbia University in New York City, evolutionary genomicist Lindy McBride at Princeton University, New Jersey, and their colleagues extracted DNA from 357 C. pipiens mosquitoes of both forms collected from across Europe, North Africa and western Asia, including 22 historical specimens from the National History Museum in London. They then analysed variations between the mosquitoes’ genomes to identify the evolutionary relationships between populations.\n\nGradual evolution\n\nThe team’s results, posted on the bioRxiv preprint server, suggest that molestus mosquitoes first adapted to human environments above ground in what is now Egypt, over the course of more than 1,000 years, potentially in conjunction with the rise of agricultural civilizations. The fastest rate of genetic divergence between pipiens and molestus seems to have been about 2,000 years ago, says McBride.",

          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "Researchers have long sought potent, but non-addictive, painkillers as alternatives to opioids.Credit: Getty\n\nWhen Terp Vairin awoke from a 2023 surgery that straightened a bend in her nasal passage, she felt like she’d taken a hard punch to the nose. As the anaesthesia wore off, she called out for something to ease the pain, and was pleasantly surprised. The drug she received — a new kind of analgesic being tested in a clinical trial — eased her discomfort, without the grogginess or nausea of opioids.\n\n“I felt very lucid,” says Vairin, an artist from Decatur, Georgia.\n\nChronic pain can be treated — so why are millions still suffering?\n\nNow, millions more people will soon have access to this painkiller — suzetrigine. It works by selectively blocking sodium channels on pain-sensing nerve cells, providing opioid-level pain suppression without the risks of addiction, sedation or overdose. On Thursday, the US Food and Drug Administration approved suzetrigine for short-term pain management, making it the first pain drug given a regulatory nod in more than 20 years that works through a brand-new mechanism.\n\nPain-medicine specialists hailed the arrival of a potent but safer alternative to opioids, which have fuelled a wave of overdoses and deaths in the United States and beyond. For drug developers, meanwhile, suzetrigine proves that targeting sodium channels — a strategy that has long stymied the pharmaceutical industry — can succeed.\n\n“This is a big step forward,” says Stephen Waxman, a neuroscientist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n“Anything we can add to the toolbox that will allow us to reduce opioid dependency is a significant positive,” says Paul White, an anaesthesiologist at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, who was involved in suzetrigine’s development.\n\nThe hunt for selectivity\n\nSuzetrigine, now marketed as Journavx, is not the first sodium-channel-targeting drug for pain management. Compounds such as procaine (Novocain) have provided reliable anaesthesia for more than a century. However, sodium channels come in nine flavours, or subtypes, and older drugs block all of them indiscriminately, so they must be administered locally — through injections or skin creams and gels — to avoid widespread side effects.\n\nHow do placebos ease pain? Mouse brain study offers clues\n\nThe hunt for more-selective drugs began in the 1990s, following the discovery that three of the channel subtypes are found mainly on pain-sensing neurons — meaning that they have little activity in the heart and brain, minimizing the risk of toxicity or addiction.\n\nSodium channels operate like gates, opening and closing in response to electrical signals flowing through nerve cells to let sodium ions pass through. This initiates a cascade of nerve impulses that transmit pain signals to the brain.\n\nEarly efforts to design drugs targeting these channels focused mainly on one subtype, called NaV1.7. Waxman likens it to the fuse in a firecracker, which amplifies the initial spark of a pain signal. This in turn ignites NaV1.8, another channel subtype that acts like a propellant, intensifying the signal further and relaying it, in the form of repetitive impulses, down nerves to the spinal cord and ultimately to the brain. A third subtype, NaV1.9, further modulates the signal’s intensity and duration.\n\nGenetic studies in the mid-2000s, first in people with a chronic-pain condition called ‘man on fire’ syndrome1 and later in those with complete insensitivity to pain2, had implicated NaV1.7 as a master regulator of pain perception. These “knock your socks off” findings led “the majority of the money and attention” to pour into targeting this channel subtype, says Waxman. Yet, the drug industry’s initial efforts to inhibit NaV1.7 yielded disappointing clinical results.\n\nNaV1.9 proved challenging to study and target in the laboratory, so attention shifted to NaV1.8, with Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston, Massachusetts, leading the way. After first trialling two other selective NaV1.8 inhibitors, the company leaned into suzetrigine (previously known as VX-548) — finding that it blocks its target more than 30,000 times more potently than other sodium channels3.\n\n“VX-548 didn’t come out of nowhere,” says Marc Rogers, a drug-discovery consultant in Cambridge, UK. “It’s a story of long, hard work. ”\n\nA smoother way to soothe",

          "abstract": "OpenAI’s chief executive Sam Altman announced the release of its ‘deep research’ tool.Credit: Franck Robichon/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nTech giant OpenAI has unveiled a pay-for-access tool called ‘deep research’, which synthesizes information from dozens or hundreds of websites into a cited report several pages long. The tool follows a similar one from Google released in December and acts as a personal assistant, doing the equivalent of hours of work in tens of minutes.\n\nMany scientists who have tried it are impressed with its ability to write literature reviews or full review papers and even identify gaps in knowledge. Others are less enthusiastic. “If a human did this I would be like: this needs a lot of work,” says Kyle Kabasares, a data scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute in Moffett Field, California, in an online video review.\n\nScientists flock to DeepSeek: how they’re using the blockbuster AI model\n\nThe firms are presenting the tools as a step towards AI ‘agents’ that can handle complex tasks. Observers say that OpenAI’s deep research tool, released on 2 February, is notable because it combines the improved reasoning skills of the o3 large language model (LLM) with the ability to search the Internet. Google says its Deep Research tool is, for now, based on Gemini 1.5 Pro, rather than on its leading reasoning model 2.0 Flash Thinking.\n\nReview writing\n\nMany users are impressed with both tools. Andrew White, a chemist and AI expert FutureHouse, a start-up in the San Francisco, California, says that Google’s product is “really leveraging Google’s advantages in search and compute” to get users up to speed on a topic quickly, while o3’s reasoning skills add sophistication to OpenAI’s reports.\n\nDerya Unutmaz, an immunologist at the Jackson Laboratory in Farmington, Connecticut, who has free access to ChatGPT Pro granted by OpenAI for medical research, says the OpenAI deep research reports are “extremely impressive”, “trustworthy” and as good or better than published review papers. “I think writing reviews is becoming obsolete.”\n\nWhite anticipates that AI systems like these could be used to update human-authored reviews. “Authoritative reviews cannot feasibly be updated [by humans] every 6 months.”.\n\nBut many caution that all LLM-based tools are sometimes inaccurate or misleading. OpenAI’s website admits that its tool “is still early and has limitations”: it can get citations wrong, hallucinate facts, fail to distinguish authoritative information from rumors and fail to convey its uncertainty accurately. The company expects the issues to improve with more usage and time. Google’s Deep Research has a disclaimer that simply reads “Gemini can make mistakes, so double-check it”.\n\nHow China created AI model DeepSeek and shocked the world",

          "abstract": "Many universities once admitted only male students — and traditions and values from that era still prevail, says Nicole Bedera.Credit: Bettmann/Getty\n\nNicole Bedera spent the 2018–19 academic year investigating how a US university handled allegations of sexual harassment and violence. Her resulting book, On the Wrong Side: How Universities Protect Perpetrators and Betray Survivors of Sexual Violence, was published last year.\n\nBedera’s investigation was based on interviews with 24 administrators and 45 perpetrators and survivors at the university, which she does not name. She also reviewed more than 700 documents, including media reports and Instagram posts.\n\nFreedom and safety in science\n\nHer research painted a picture of an institution that felt threatened by complaints about gender-based violence, says Bedera. Male perpetrators’ education was routinely prioritized over that of female victims, leaving the impression that sexual-violence complaints were not taken seriously, she adds.\n\nMany higher-education institutions in the United States continue to rely on traditions and values that pre-date the admission of female students. Women continue to feel excluded.\n\nA sociologist and sexual-violence researcher based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bedera co-founded Beyond Compliance Consulting in 2023. The company’s work includes helping organizations to develop anti-violence strategic plans.\n\nNicole Bedera is a sociologist who studies sexual violence and responses to it.\nHow did you become interested in researching sexual violence on campus?\n\nIt dates back to 2010, when I started my bachelor’s degree in sociology at a US liberal-arts college. I thought feminism had been won. That was what I’d been taught growing up in Nevada at the height of the 1990s ‘girl power’ era.\n\nOn our very first day, we were told that there had not been a rape on my campus in ten years.\n\nBut some of my friends were later sexually assaulted, and were left with the impression that their continued presence in campus accommodation would somehow disturb their roommates. I felt that was a horrible message.\n\nI began volunteering for a rape crisis centre, and this led to me working as a victim advocate in hospitals. In that role, I got a lot of questions from survivors that there just weren’t really very clear answers to. One of these was why everything got worse, instead of better, after they reported their assault.\n\nFor example, in the United States, if you’re sexually assaulted, the place where you start the criminal-justice process is a hospital, for an examination. That is the exact opposite of what a sexual-assault survivor would want — being stripped naked and examined from head to toe.\n\nWe had things that we said as advocates, but I wanted to give a scientific answer to their questions.\n\nThe conventional approach and that of a lot of the academic literature at the time was to say that they’d done something risky, that they’d done something wrong, that they’d put themselves in that situation. But that was hard for me to believe, and it wasn’t something I wanted to repeat.\n\nAnd so that’s how I came into my research interest and my PhD at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, which focused on how organizations shape the experience of college sexual assault.\n\nHow did your advocacy experience inform your work as a social scientist?\n\nWhat I learnt as an advocate that was most useful as a scientist was to make space for the full expression of emotion. A lot of the time, whether it’s in the hospitals or in a research interview, victims will act differently than you’ve been taught to expect.\n\nIn the cultural stereotypes, people think interviews will be very sad, and people will cry through all of them. That’s not true. A lot of them are very funny — some people cope through humour. People also cope through anger, as well as sadness.\n\nWhen you make room for that full expression in each interview, you often see all those emotions, and you get a much more nuanced account of what the person has experienced and a more honest story. It means people don’t feel like they have to be ‘the perfect victim’.\n\nHow did you maintain scientific rigour when you were interviewing survivors?\n\nYour role as an advocate is to be there, be compassionate, be empathetic, hear what they’re saying, really listen, but also keep some distance because they might handle things differently than you.\n\nThose skills are really useful when working as a scientist, too. When you are interviewing people, you don’t want to have a big emotional reaction. You don’t want them to know your opinion about what they’ve experienced, or how they decided to handle it. Those things are really not relevant to the research.\n\nWhat struck you most during the research for your book?\n\nVictims of sexual assault shouldn’t be made to feel it’s their fault, and that’s motivated my work.\n\nOne of the most upsetting parts of my research was the way administrators talked about handling sexual-violence complaints. There were a lot of cases of sexual harassment, for instance, where the perpetrator would confess to what they had done. And even in those cases, administrators would say, “We don’t want to have to deal with this, we don’t think it’s that big a deal.”\n\nBedera’s book On the Wrong Side explores responses to complaints of sexual violence at a US university.\n\nOne of them said something that immediately stuck in my head: “I just feel like we are regulating student dating, and we’re not interested in doing that.”\n\nThey were saying they didn’t enjoy making people accountable for violating the university’s own code of conduct, and that as much as they could, they tried to look for loopholes and ways to avoid investigating or making a meaningful sanction.\n\nOne of the consistent themes was that schools prioritized “neutrality”, which meant treating victims and perpetrators exactly the same. For example, the university was sending no-contact directives to perpetrators, but also to the victims, treating them equally, literally as Party 1 and Party 2. Neither were allowed to contact each other or ask others to contact the other person on their behalf. They weren’t permitted to talk about each other to anyone else or share space with each other. But enforcement was fuzzy — for example, they were allowed to take classes together or be in the library at the same time.",

Across from him, a man in a loose-fitting tunic set a metallic cube about the size of an eyeball on the table.\n\n“Where am I?” Hayden asked.\n\n“You’re in New Tigard,” the man explained.\n\nHayden’s pulse accelerated. He remembered being diagnosed with an inoperable glioblastoma, and Peggy agreeing without hesitation to the his-n-hers cryogenics package — Find Your Future in the Future!\n\n“My wife’s cryopod —”\n\n“Yours was processed first. When you woke up, we had to suspend operations …”\n\nHayden lost track of what the man was saying because the movement of his lips didn’t match the words he heard, as if they were trapped in a poorly dubbed foreign film.\n\nSensing his confusion, the man motioned towards the cube on the table. “A language translator. It took us time to reconstruct a grammar for twenty-first-century English. We apologize for the incontinence.”\n\nHayden smirked, but the man continued.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“We missed a failsafe while down-powering your cryopod. An emergency revival subroutine clicked in and viola!”\n\nHayden’s eyebrows pinched together, creating a vertical fissure in his forehead.\n\nThe man cleared his throat. “Your revival was an unfortunate antecedent.”\n\n“You mean, an accident?”\n\n“Our first mistake in more than a century — an impressive record, considering the thousands of cryogenic eunuchs we’ve down-powered.” A friendly smile showed shockingly white teeth.\n\nHayden’s forehead crease deepened.\n\nThe man’s smile collapsed. “What did you expect?”\n\n“That you’d revive us?”\n\n“That’s awfully presumptuous. You freezer-boomers throw yourselves into cryopods because you’re riddled with cancer, degenerative heart failure and inflated self-importance, and then expect us to thaw you out and cure what ails you?”\n\n“Well …”\n\n“A suitable analogy: you buy a house in the suburbans. A year later the previous owner appears from the basement and expects to sleep in your bed and eat your tasty snacks.”\n\nThat didn’t seem a fair comparison to Hayden.\n\n“It’s taken 300 years to fix your generation’s mess. Only in the past decayed have we been able to go outside without respirators or prospective suits.”\n\nHayden didn’t like the man’s tone. As a simple small-claims lawyer, he didn’t have any influence or power over things like that.\n\n“Right, right. You were just an innocent sick man who was hoping to wake up in a brighter future after a cure for your cancer had been found.”\n\n“Has it?”\n\n“Have you been hearing? You have been charged with a serious crime —”\n\n“Crime?” Hayden sat up straight.\n\n“Yes. I’m your barista.”\n\n“My what?”\n\nThe man frowned as he reconsidered his words. “Your advocate in legal proceedings — your barista.”\n\n“You mean my barrister? My lawyer?”\n\n“That is what I said. You are charged with temporal trespass. As a society of laws, we held administrative proceedings, found all you freezer-boomers guilty, and were carrying out the down-powering sentence. When you awakened, the judge threw out the convictions and required new travails for everyone. You face the termination penalty, but we hope you will consider — how do you put it — ‘policing an entreaty’.”\n\nStuck on the prospects of a ‘termination penalty’, Hayden struggled to keep up. “Are you offering a plea bargain?”\n\nWith a flourish, the man tapped the cube. The tabletop lit up, displaying a digital document. “The court is willing to accept a plea to disorderly conduct. That does not carry a termination penalty.”\n\n“Alive is good,” Hayden conceded.\n\n“The sentence is solitary incarceration for not fewer than 100 years and not to exceed your natural life. If you’ll just notate …” The man pointed to the bottom of the form.",

          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "Adrian Ward had been driving confidently around Austin, Texas, for nine years — until last November, when he started getting lost. Ward’s phone had been acting up, and Apple maps had stopped working. Suddenly, Ward couldn’t even find his way to the home of a good friend, making him realize how much he’d relied on the technology in the past. “I just instinctively put on the map and do what it says,” he says.\n\nWard’s experience echoes a common complaint: that the Internet is undermining our memory. This fear has shown up in several surveys over the past few years, and even led one software firm to coin the term ‘digital amnesia’ for the experience of forgetting information because you know a digital device has stored it instead. Last year, Oxford University Press announced that its word of the year was ‘brain rot’ — the deterioration of someone’s mental state caused by consuming trivial online content.\n\n“What you’ll see out there is all kinds of dire predictions about digital amnesia, and ‘we’re gonna lose our memory because we don’t use it anymore’,” says Daniel Schacter, who studies memory at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nAI hallucinations can’t be stopped — but these techniques can limit their damage\n\nIn fact, various studies paint a more complicated picture. Some do suggest that the Internet and digital technologies impair or otherwise alter performance on specific learning and memory tasks: people who use GPS devices to navigate seem worse at recalling routes, for instance. Ward, who is a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin, has found that Googling information gives people an inflated sense of their own knowledge1. But there is no convincing evidence that the technology is having a broader detrimental effect on memory, researchers say. Claims, such as ‘Google is making us stupid’, are “overstatements”, says Elizabeth Marsh, a memory researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nThe revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) is raising a host of questions. Large language models (LLMs) that power tools such as ChatGPT are rapidly being incorporated into search engines and other software, which means they are becoming part of everyday experiences for most people. And they could affect learning and memory in more profound ways than conventional Internet searching. “This whole ChatGPT thing is another level of technology that’s really different from just typing into a Google browser, ‘What’s the capital of Madagascar?’” says Marsh.\n\nResearchers have suggested, for example, that chatbots and other AI tools could make people cognitively lazy and even seed their minds with realistic false memories. Already, generative AI is being used to create ‘deadbots’ — digital avatars of dead people, who can say things that the living person never said. “It’s kind of reassembling a past that we never experienced,” says Andrew Hoskins, who studies AI and memory at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nThe Google effect\n\nPeople have been using technology to aid their memories for centuries — from the printing press to photographs and video cameras. But the idea that the Internet is eroding human memory gained ground after a 2011 study2 by psychologist Betsy Sparrow, who was then at Columbia University in New York City, and others. In the first of a series of experiments, they reported that people presented with difficult questions instinctively thought about the Internet and computers, as if they were itching to search for answers.\n\nIn other tests, participants seemed to be worse at remembering trivia statements they’d typed into a computer if they’d been told that the machine would save, rather than erase, their notes. They often remembered the folder they’d saved facts in better than the information itself. The study popularized the idea of a ‘Google effect’ — that people are using the Internet as an external memory bank and therefore weakening their own.\n\nBut some researchers later questioned the reliability of these results. A study3 in 2018 failed to replicate the first experiment in Sparrow’s 2011 study — differences that Sparrow argued could be explained4. Then, a second attempt to replicate the same experiment also failed to mirror the original results5. “‘Google effects’ are plausible and have garnered significant attention,” says Guido Hesselmann, a psychologist at the Berlin Psychological University who did the second replication attempt. But he adds that “a higher standard should be applied when researching these ideas”.\n\nStudies have shown that people remember a route less well after using GPS to navigate it.Credit: Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty\n\nWard was a PhD student with one of Sparrow’s co-authors, Daniel Wegner at Harvard University, and remains convinced by the 2011 study. The results fit with a widely accepted concept6 called transactive memory that Wegner proposed in the 1980s. This says that people lessen the burden of remembering information by sharing it with others — a spouse or colleague, for example.\n\nWhen the other party in the transaction is the Internet, however, we’re potentially relieved of having to know much at all. “Why put it in my head, when I have a smartphone in my pocket and sometimes searching Google is faster than searching your own mind?” Ward says. This is a form of ‘cognitive offloading’, in which people use anything from lists to calendars to phones to lessen the demands on their brains.\n\nSome of the strongest data to support cognitive offloading, says Carey Morewedge, who studies decision-making at Boston University, Massachusetts, are from a 2010 study of GPS navigation7. Participants in a driving simulator travelled a route either with or without the assistance of GPS. Then they were asked to drive the same route from memory. Those who had used GPS were as bad at navigating as people who’d never travelled the route at all.\n\nA later study8 of virtual navigation skills suggested that the spatial memory of people who used GPS extensively deteriorated faster than that of those who used it less. In a similar vein, a few studies have suggested that taking photos can reduce memories of the photographed objects — at least in certain situations.\n\nWhat’s so special about the human brain? A graphical guide\n\nCognitive offloading makes adaptive sense, researchers say, because it frees up limited brain bandwidth to attend to other business. A study by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, demonstrated this effect. They asked students to study a document of words, and then randomly assigned some to save it. Those who saved the first file were better able to memorize words in a second file9.\n\nOther studies support the idea that people rely on the Internet as a surrogate memory — so much so, that they confuse it with their own. In Ward’s study1, he asked people to answer a series of trivia questions using Google or on their own. Those who used Google later rated themselves as having more confidence in their own memory, on average, than those who didn’t use the search engine. Searching for answers, it seemed, didn’t remind them of their ignorance; it made them think that the online knowledge had been theirs all along.\n\n“I think less of our knowledge is internal and more of it is stored externally — and we’re accessing it and feeling like it’s our own,” Ward says.\n\nMarsh says this false confidence inspired by searching “might be one reason that you’re so surprised if you later can’t remember something”. Her experiments10 suggest the phenomenon might stem from search results that are displayed as a list of web links with a snippet of information about the page. Glimpsing these previews and then selecting a page creates a feeling of familiarity with the page’s content — a form of what psychologists call ‘priming’ — even before reading it. This effect might lead people to overestimate their own knowledge. Researchers don’t yet know whether these types of misconception could worsen now that search engines provide AI-generated summaries at the top of search results.\n\nInformation overload\n\nSchacter, who reviewed11 studies on technology use and memory in 2022, says that, taken together, there is convincing research from studies so far that the Internet and technology can affect memory performance for specific tasks, such as remembering a route or a photographed item.",

The discovery, published on 5 February in Nature1, contrasts with previous studies that have found crowds to move in more-chaotic ways.\n\n“I was like, what is this? Why 18 seconds?” says study co-author François Gu, referring to how often the circular motion repeated itself. The finding, which was the outcome of a computer analysis of video footage, was so puzzling that he spent more than a month double-checking the methods, says Gu, a physicist at the École Normale Supérieure in Lyon, France. He then realized that the swirling was clearly visible in videos of the event, once the footage was sped up.\n\nTracking of individual heads in this footage of the crowd reveals gradual circular movements.Credit: Bartolo lab, ENS de Lyon\nNo bull here\n\nThe Feast of San Fermín in Pamplona, Spain, is famous for its running of the bulls, in which participants put themselves in harm’s way as the angry animals are released into the city’s streets. But Gu and his collaborators focused instead on the opening of the festival, in which thousands of people gather in the Plaza Consistorial.\n\nGu and his colleagues set up cameras on balconies overlooking the plaza, and used computer models to analyse the videos. To understand the crowd’s behaviour, they modelled it as a dense continuum, akin to a fluid made up of particles (most previous studies have instead modelled crowds as made up of discrete, individual agents). They found that, as the area filled up in the morning, the crowd reached a critical density of around four people per square metre, beyond which it started — initially very slowly and almost imperceptibly — to form rotating vortices that pushed against one another, each involving hundreds of people.\n\nCrowd crush: Could fluid dynamics save lives?",

And papers with higher co-authorship numbers were more likely to be retracted than were those with fewer co-authors.\n\nIoannidis and his colleagues used the world’s most comprehensive database on retractions, compiled by media organization Retraction Watch, which contains more than 55,000 retractions. They linked these records to citation data from Scopus, a literature and citation database maintained by publisher Elsevier. They filtered out retractions not attributed to author error, those that couldn’t be linked on Scopus and cases in which retractions led to republication. This left them with almost 39,500 retractions, which they compared with a list of highly cited authors. (Ioannidis has been compiling a list of highly cited researchers, known as the Stanford list, since 2016.)\n\nRetraction breakdown\n\nIn the study, the authors split the most-cited scientists into two groups. The first featured the 217,097 authors who were among the top 2% most-cited in their fields over their careers. The second group comprised the 223,152 scientists who made up the top 2% for citation impact in 2023, the most recent year for which there were data. The authors found that 8,747 (4%) of the most highly cited researchers in 2023 had at least one retraction during their career, as did 7,083 (3.3%) of the researchers who were most-cited over their careers.\n\nRetraction rates among top-cited researchers varied by country. In the 20 countries or regions where most top-cited authors are working, the database shows retractions are highest among top-cited scientists in India and on the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, whereas the lowest rates appear in Finland, Belgium and Israel.\n\nOverall, a high absolute number of papers published was associated with more retractions.

          "abstract": "Surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston transplanted a modified pig kidney into a living person for the first time in 2024.Credit: Massachusetts General Hospital\n\nThe first clinical trial testing whether pig kidneys can be safely transplanted into living people has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As part of the trial, which will begin later this year, kidneys from genetically modified pigs will be transplanted into people with chronic kidney disease whose organs no longer function independently.\n\nWill pigs solve the organ crisis? The future of animal-to-human transplants\n\nThe FDA’s green light will bring the experimental procedure a step closer to one day supplying organs to the thousands of people who are waiting for a donor organ. “The start of formal clinical trials is very exciting,” says Jay Fishman, a specialist in transplant infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\nAbout half a dozen people in the United States and China have received organs from genome-edited pigs — kidneys, hearts, liver and a thymus — but the surgeries were approved on compassionate grounds, meaning the patients were very sick and had no other options. Most recipients did not survive beyond a few months after the transplants for various reasons, including that they were too sick to cope with major surgery.\n\n“The humans who have received xenotransplants have made a tremendous contribution to our field,” Fishman says. But formal clinical trials are standardized, and can therefore produce important information, including crucial safety and efficacy data, to move the field forwards, he says.\n\nFirst trial\n\nSix individuals will initially be enrolled in the trial, according to United Therapeutics, the biotechnology firm, based in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, that is running the trial. The trial will include people with end-stage kidney disease, aged 55–70 years old, who are not eligible for conventional kidney transplantation for medical reasons or are not likely to get one in the next five years and will possibly die waiting. Patients will be closely monitored for about six months for serious adverse events, infectious diseases and signs of kidney damage, and then followed up with for the rest of their lives.\n\nFirst pig kidney transplant in a person: what it means for the future\n\nThe trial will assess efficacy by tracking how many participants — and transplanted kidneys — survive the procedure, and for how long. It will also measure how well the kidneys filter blood and will track changes in the participants’ quality of life.\n\nThe FDA has mandated pauses between patients to make sure there are no surprises, Fishman says. A monitoring committee will review safety and efficacy data for the first six participants, before deciding whether the trial should be expanded to up to 50 individuals.\n\nTrials will enable researchers to select people who are in better health than those first compassionate-use recipients to assess the transplant’s safety and efficacy, says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a surgeon and researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.\n\nThe success of this trial will pave the way for longer-term, larger clinical trials, says Wayne Hawthorne, a transplant surgeon at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nMohiuddin, who in 2022 led the first pig-heart transplant into a living person, says he is in the process of submitting a request to the FDA to start clinical trials, but adds that the heart is a more difficult organ to get approval for.\n\nAnother company, eGenesis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has also submitted a request to the FDA to launch a xenotransplant trial, says Fishman, who has advised both United Therapeutics and eGenesis on microbiology safety, and would be involved in an eGenesis trial should it be approved. In an e-mailed statement, eGenesis said that in December, it had received FDA approval to conduct three pig-kidney transplants under compassionate use. The company did not comment on the status of its clinical-trial application.\n\nModified pigs",

But the study of romance, dating and relationships is not as romantic as it might sound. People are complicated; couples even more so. Funding is scarce, statistics are tricky and media reports tend to oversimplify findings with the unrealistic goal of providing clear advice for people who want to find a love match.\n\n“We’re doing research that we know touches the hearts of so many people from so many walks of life,” says evolutionary biologist Justin Garcia, executive director of Indiana University’s Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, which was established in 1947 to research issues around sexuality, gender and reproduction. “Whether that’s marriage, infidelity or romantic, sexual and relationship satisfaction, we can be talking about some of the most exciting and rewarding aspects of someone’s life and some of the most challenging and difficult ones. The power of romantic bonds across time and place is a great human unifier,” he says. Garcia’s latest research straddles the oddly separate worlds of relationship research and sex research, and includes work on consensual non-monogamy and distinctions between social and sexual monogamy.\n\nNature spoke to four scientists who study relationships, including Garcia. They shared what they love about studying love, what obstacles they face in the process — and how they navigate their own romantic lives.\n\nKENNETH TAN: Studying love across cultures\n\nPsychologist at Singapore Management University.\n\nI started becoming interested in thinking about relationships when I was doing my military service in Singapore. I enlisted at the age of 19, completed my service and started university at 21. It was a time when many young guys had relationship issues; their partners left them for other folks in university while we were away in the army. I gave a lot of advice and shared a lot of similar stories with my friends. We spent many late nights just talking.\n\nA decade of love: mapping the landscape of romantic love research through bibliometric analysi\n\nEarly in my career, I went abroad to the United States to do a three-month training programme, which exposed me to the scientific study of close relationships. I had a partner at the time, and was thinking, ‘How do people navigate long-distance relationships?’ In Singapore, it’s something that you never think about because it’s a small country, so there is no travelling for three hours to see someone. It was a new experience for me and made me wonder how people maintain relationships. A big focus of my work has been understanding commitment.\n\nI get questions from students and the public seeking personal advice about red flags, and how to get into — and out of — relationships and what to look for in a potential partner. They ask, ‘How many dates should I go on? Do I give this person a chance?’ It’s empowering to be asked, but it’s also challenging because you don’t want to give people the wrong answers. I try to tell students, ‘On average, this is what the work has shown, but everyone is different.’\n\nWhen we’re trying to publish our work in US and international journals, we get pushback if we only have a sample from Singapore. We’re often asked to show similarities and differences with other cultures, regardless of whether we have any hypothesis on whether they’re different. On the one hand, it makes you think, ‘They’re not requesting that for US samples, so why do they want it for an Asian sample?’ But on the other hand, I think that ultimately, having that diversity and collecting data from multiple places enriches the science.\n\nCome mate with me\n\nThe cross-cultural work is still fresh, and there’s a lot more discovery waiting to happen. These are exciting times to be researching relationships and singlehood. Currently, I’m just one of two researchers studying the psychology of relationships in Singapore. I think that there are two or three others in southeast Asia. I spent six years in the United States, and I definitely miss the huge research network there. One of my goals is to build up the field in Singapore. As the work grows, hopefully the media will include an empirical angle in stories as well.\n\nOne thing about commitment is that you start to think of your own relationship as special. A lot of times, when I tell my wife during an argument, ‘Oh, this is what the science says about relationships, and this might be happening to us,’ she’ll say things such as, ‘We’re beyond the science. We’re not your science.’\n\nJUSTIN GARCIA: People tell me things\n\nEvolutionary biologist and executive director of the Kinsey Institute, Bloomington, at Indiana University and scientific adviser to Match.com.\n\nMy interests have always been in the evolution of monogamy. I’m part sex researcher, part relationship researcher. I go back and forth between these two worlds, and people are often surprised to hear that they’re separate fields. In the human sciences, you’ll hear people talking about social monogamy, also called pair bonding, as a relationship structure. It’s different from sexual monogamy, which is fidelity or sexual exclusivity. My colleagues and I had a whole section in a recent paper about distinctions between social and sexual monogamy.\n\nIt can be hard to get funding to study people’s romantic and sexual lives. The federal agencies are often worried about the word ‘sex’ in the title or the abstract of a paper. A lot of relationship scientists also don’t use the word ‘love’ in their studies. In the 1970s, a US senator criticized relationship and sex research as absurd government spending. That is very much a part of the history of these fields.\n\nI came to the Kinsey Institute as a postdoc in 2011, and I have been scientific adviser to Match.com, the online dating service based in Dallas, Texas, since 2010. The late anthropologist Helen Fisher and I started a project with the company, called Singles in America. It’s an annual scientific study of more than 5,000 single people. We use a demographically representative sample to understand the attitudes and behaviours of more than 100 million single people — about one-third of the adult population in the United States. These are people who are moving in and out of romantic and sexual relationships at all stages of life. We’ve published a lot from that project over the years. The company doesn’t control what we publish, and its funding means that we avoid the challenge of getting federal grants. It has been a really rewarding collaboration.\n\nJustin Garcia at an event with American-German sex therapist ‘Dr Ruth’, Ruth Westheimer.Credit: Kinsey Institute Library & Special Collections.\n\nI’ll never forget the time that one of my senior colleagues on campus invited me for a coffee. She was a distinguished faculty member, and I thought, ‘Oh this is great, maybe it’s some kind of collaboration.’ I got there, and within two minutes, she took out her phone, turned it to face me and said, “Can you help me with my dating profile?”\n\nOne of the mistakes that she was making, and this happens a lot, was just thinking about what she was searching for. But courtship is about both searching and being found. You need a profile that someone can ask questions about, that they can engage with, that gives potential dates an opportunity to get to know you. So, they can say, ‘Oh, is that a picture of you hiking at Machu Picchu? I’ve always wanted to go there.’\n\nPeople have told me about challenges in their relationships. I often remind them that I’m not a sex or couples therapist. I’ve been asked, ‘Don’t you get exhausted? You’re at a cocktail party and you’ve heard about everyone’s marital issues.’ But I take it as an honour that someone is willing to share an intimate piece of their life with me. And I think — what can we learn from it?\n\nThe fun of the work is that it’s interdisciplinary. It’s about the body, our brains, how we communicate, where we live, our development. I think that knowing more about ourselves makes us appreciate our relationships and the power of love even more. The challenge is that everyone has opinions about what you’re asking and concluding. They want to know, ‘How could you say that, because that’s not what happened to my cousin Billy and his divorce?’\n\nSARAH STANTON: Steer clear of the love languages\n\nSocial psychologist and relationship researcher at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nI study romantic relationships and how to make them better. I also investigate how to improve relationship experiences for people who struggle with them, either because they’re uncomfortable with intimacy or because their worries get in the way of them enjoying those connections. And I explore how relationships affect short- and long-term health and well-being.\n\nLove: Neuroscience reveals all\n\nSometimes, the gap between the science and what’s written about it for the public is wide; findings often get misrepresented or overly simplified. People want to mention the five love languages as if they’re the solution to all relationship issues. The 5 Love Languages is a book first published in 1992 that assumes that each person has a preferred love language and that couples are more satisfied when partners speak one another’s preferred language. It’s such a bugbear of mine, because love languages are not formally based in science. They’re just some guy’s opinions. I am constantly being asked about them. Now I don’t even wait for it to be a question in my undergraduate classes. In lecture one, I say: “Disabuse yourself of this notion.”",

Biological ageing is measured at a molecular level; people of the same chronological age can have faster or slower age-related decline depending on their health.\n\nThree to four months’ slowing of biological ageing sounds small, but this can translate to important public-health benefits such as a reduction in the prevalence of some age-related health conditions, says Bischoff-Ferrari at the University of Basel in Switzerland.\n\nThe study analysed data from the DO-HEALTH trial on the effects of supplements and exercise in older people, that took place across five European countries from 2012 to 2014. The researchers reviewed data on more than 700 people aged 70 or over who were given either a placebo or omega-3, vitamin D and exercise alone or in combination. All the participants were from Switzerland and around half were healthy, with no major chronic illnesses or disabilities.\n\nBlood samples taken from participants at the start and end of the study were analysed using four biological clocks. These measure the extent of biological ageing on the basis of additions and deletions of methyl groups to the DNA.\n\n“The use of multiple DNA methylation clocks is a strength, as different clocks capture distinct aspects of biological ageing,” says Luigi Fontana, a biogerontologist at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nStronger together\n\nOne of those clocks, called PhenoAge, showed that older people avoided several months of biological ageing over 3 years by taking 1 gram of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, derived from algae, with additive benefits from taking vitamin D (2,000 international units per day) and engaging in 30 minutes of exercise 3 times a week.

          "authors": "Dan Garisto, Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "The National Science Foundation, headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, funds about 25% of basic US academic research.Credit: JHVEPhoto/Alamy\n\nThe US National Science Foundation (NSF), a major funder of basic academic research, announced yesterday that it has reopened a website that distributes money from research grants to scientists. The move comes after a week of confusion and frustration for NSF-funded researchers in which the agency froze their funding — including for postdoctoral fellowships — and said it was reviewing grants worth billions of dollars to comply with President Donald Trump’s directives to terminate funding for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and to scrub all federal resources of these terms.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nAlthough the funds are unfrozen after a federal judge issued an order blocking the US government from freezing grant money, the NSF has said it will continue its review.\n\nThis whiplash shows that the “United States is not a stable place to be a scientist”, says Julia Barnes, an NSF-funded cultural anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. “Scientists funded by the NSF aren’t paid a lot, but we care a lot about the research we do.”\n\nTo better understand what is happening inside the NSF and what the future might hold, Nature spoke to six NSF staff members, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the press. All expressed strong concerns about recent agency decisions, especially to freeze funds.\n\n“People are trying to understand what’s going on,” says one NSF employee. “The freeze in funding was, and continues to be, completely confusing to everyone.”\n\nAn NSF spokesperson declined to comment about the agency’s actions and instead pointed Nature to information on the NSF website about its implementation of Trump’s executive orders.\n\nA week of whiplash\n\nIn the first hours of his presidency, Trump signed a barrage of executive orders, which are decrees that direct the US government’s actions but that cannot change existing laws. The orders aimed to reshape US policy on climate science, public health, the federal workforce and more. A week later, the Trump administration issued a memo freezing all federal grants. That 28 January memo was temporarily blocked by a federal judge minutes before it would have taken effect, and the White House then rescinded it. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on the social-media platform X that Trump’s executive orders on federal funding would “remain in full force”. In response, the NSF froze its funds and cancelled a week's worth of grant reviews, which are used to determine which projects are funded.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nTo more permanently halt the funding freeze, 22 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government and its agencies. Two federal judges have since temporarily blocked the funding freeze, hinting that it might be an overreach that lacks proper authority.\n\nThere is no clear timeline for how long the judges’ temporary holds will last, but even if they are lifted in an appeal, the NSF could have a hard time legally terminating grants, because their funds are appropriated by the US Congress, meaning they are protected by law, says Deborah Pearlstein, a specialist in law and public policy at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nThere is another area where the NSF’s actions might butt up against the law. Since 1980, Congress has mandated that the agency seek to broaden participation of underrepresented groups, including women and other minorities, within science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). “The orders are illegal,” says an NSF employee. “The statutory framework of NSF is being violated.”\n\nThe NSF spokesperson did not respond to a query about concerns that Trump’s executive orders are at odds with the agency’s responsibilities, as codified in law.\n\nInside grant review\n\nThe NSF has not publicly shared details of how it is continuing to examine research grants and flag those in violation of Trump’s orders, but NSF employees shared documents with Nature clarifying the process.\n\nWhat Trump 2.0 means for science: the likely winners and losers\n\nAround 10,000 research grants have been flagged for review and distributed to various programme directors. Grants in one area of science are being distributed to directors in a separate area of science. For instance, the geosciences division is examining grants from the division of social, behavioural and economic sciences. The grants are being reviewed independently by two staff members instructed to indicate any potential violations of Trump’s orders. They will submit their reviews in a spreadsheet by 5 p.m. today.\n\nNature has seen the criteria for flagging grants, which call for programme officers to look for “broadening participation” language, foreign assistance, climate science, domestic energy, and “discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI”.\n\n“To see ‘women’ and ‘woman’ and ‘people of colour’ showing up on a spreadsheet over and over and over and over — that was a gut punch,” says one NSF employee.",

          "title": "Can this revolutionary plastics-recycling plant help solve the pollution crisis?",
          "authors": "Mark Peplow",
          "abstract": "The world is miserable at recycling plastics. Currently, just 10–15% of the plastic waste we generate annually is recycled — with the rest incinerated, buried in landfill or dumped as litter1,2.\n\nA big part of the problem is that much of the waste is a dirty jumble of different plastics contaminated with food, inks and labels. It’s expensive to clean and sort this mess into streams of single-polymer, uncontaminated plastic — the kind that is generally needed for conventional ‘mechanical’ recycling, in which plastic is shredded, melted and re-formed into pellets, ready for new products.\n\nThat explains the excitement around a chemical plant that will start commercial operations this year in northeast England. In principle, it can take any kind of plastic waste, including mixed plastics deemed ‘unrecyclable’, and break it down into chemicals that are similar to those extracted from crude oil. With further processing, these chemicals can be turned back into fresh plastic. If successful, it could be a powerful example of a circular manufacturing process — in which plastic is used and reprocessed over and over again — potentially curbing the world’s dependence on fossil resources to make virgin plastics.\n\nHow to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work\n\nThe facility, near Redcar, uses a variation on a concept called chemical recycling, which breaks plastics apart into smaller chemical building blocks. Its main rival in this approach is pyrolysis: heating plastics to temperatures above 450 °C in a reactor without oxygen. But pyrolysis is energy-intensive and inefficient, with much of the plastic being turned into useless sooty char.\n\nBy contrast, the new plant uses water at high temperatures and pressures to break down plastic waste more gently and cleanly. Mura Technology, the London-based company behind the facility, says it is the first commercial-scale plant in the world to recycle plastic in this way. There’s a lot riding on its success — if it all works and runs profitably, it could trigger the launch of many more of these plants around the world.\n\nMura has declared the technology to be “revolutionary” because it “has the potential to help eliminate plastic waste, recycling all types of plastic to create a true circular economy”. Mura says that its process has lower carbon dioxide emissions and a higher tolerance for contaminated waste than does pyrolysis. It also emits roughly 80% less CO2 than burning the plastic in an incinerator to generate energy — a common way of dealing with waste.\n\nIf that makes it sound like a panacea for plastics recycling, think again. In practice, as Mura explains, the plant is currently picky about its diet of plastic waste, which must be shredded and sorted in ways similar to those used for mechanical recycling. And because, as with pyrolysis plants, not all of the facility’s products will be reborn as plastic, some critics say that the process shouldn’t count as recycling — an accusation that Mura rejects.\n\nThese practicalities raise questions about the future of plastics pollution and whether chemical recycling can live up to its promised potential. The idea is not a dud — but the real-life complications around the process make it less revolutionary than claimed.\n\nPlastic world\n\nPlastics pollution is a serious and growing problem. Recycling technologies already struggle to cope with today’s waste, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects1 plastic-waste production to balloon to more than one billion tonnes per year by 2060 (see ‘Where plastic waste goes’).\n\nSource: OECD\n\nMechanical recycling is the most common recycling route. Although the process often yields a material that is a little weaker than virgin plastic, it works well enough for pure streams of some plastics, such as the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in drinks bottles.\n\nBut other forms of plastic waste are much more challenging. Take flexible packaging and films, for example, a category that includes detritus such as grocery bags, bubble wrap and snack wrappers. These are typically made from various forms of polyethylene and polypropylene, part of a broad class of polymers called polyolefins, which make up two-thirds of all post-consumer plastic waste (see ‘Types of plastic’).\n\nSource: Plastics Europe\n\nThese materials might be combinations of several plastics — a pain to recycle. It can be extremely difficult to tease apart mixed plastics. If they are recycled, they often result in low-quality materials that might be suitable only for making rubbish bags, offering recyclers little financial incentive to accept such waste streams.\n\nThis is just one reason why about 40% of plastic waste is put in landfill instead, with another 25% incinerated for energy recovery. About 15% is abandoned as litter2.\n\nIt also helps to explain the surging enthusiasm for chemical recycling. Many researchers, companies and policymakers think that this approach could extract more value from tricky plastic waste and thus provide an incentive for recycling3.\n\nThe current most-used chemical recycling methods, according to data from market-intelligence company IDTechEx in Cambridge, UK, involve unpicking a plastic’s polymer chains to recover the constituent chemical building blocks, or monomers. This can be done with solvents or enzymes; IDTechEx terms the general approach ‘depolymerization’. However, these are expensive processes that have been commercialized for only a handful of plastics that have already been separated from other plastic waste.\n\nBy the end of this year, IDTechEx expects depolymerization to be overtaken by pyrolysis, a blunter method. Pyrolysis does not break plastic down into its monomers — instead, it produces a soup of hydrocarbons called pyrolysis oil, similar to crude oil. Some components of this oil then go through more petrochemical processing to generate specific plastic-feedstock chemicals such as ethene and propene, the most common monomers of polyolefins.\n\nThere are roughly 50 pyrolysis plants around the world, most in the European Union and the United States, with a combined processing capacity of about 266,000 tonnes per year, according to IDTechEx. That’s a tiny fraction of the plastic waste generated in these regions. However, many more pyrolysis plants are expected to come online by the end of this year.\n\nA plastics treaty is urgently needed, but getting it right will take time\n\nBut pyrolysis has a number of problems. First, some of the oil it produces is turned into fuel or other chemicals, rather than going to make new plastic, so that portion doesn’t help to reduce the amount of new plastic produced. Critics such as the Brussels-based campaign group Zero Waste Europe (ZWE) say that the approach should therefore be termed ‘chemical recovery’, rather than true chemical recycling of plastic (see go.nature.com/4hjfk7z).\n\nSecond, it’s an inefficient process. Up to 20% of the carbon from the input plastic becomes an unwanted sooty by-product called char, some is lost as CO2, and the pyrolysis oil can contain contaminants that must be removed before further use4.\n\nThird, despite their reputation for being able to feed on many kinds of mixed plastic, in practice, pyrolysis plants take in polyolefin plastic waste — and relatively clean waste at that. The reason is that this kind of waste yields a more commercially saleable pyrolysis oil that is relatively simple to drop into existing petrochemical processes, says James Kennedy, a technology analyst at IDTechEx. Different plastics, such as PET, could be pyrolysed — but they’d introduce oxygen atoms that would carry through to the pyrolysis-oil product and would have to be removed later. Meanwhile, dirtier waste tends to produce dirtier pyrolysis oil, which also has to be cleaned. To avoid that expense, pyrolysis plants still sort and clean plastics beforehand, often with the same pre-treatment steps used at mechanical recycling facilities, says Corinne Scown, a sustainability researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. Consequently, manufacturing plastic in this way costs more than mechanical recycling, and more than making virgin plastic from fossil oil.\n\nChemical recycling, but better?\n\nThat’s where Mura’s technology comes in. The method is known as hydrothermal liquefaction, but the secret sauce inside Mura’s stainless-steel reactor is not merely hot water. The process operates at more than 400 °C and 220 atmospheres of pressure, which means that the water is in a supercritical state — it can behave like both a liquid and a gas, dissolving oily polymer molecules and chopping them into pieces. “On the face of it, it’s quite promising. I think that there’s a lot of excitement. I’ve been to quite a few conferences where everyone’s talking about it,” says Kennedy.\n\nJust like pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction uses heat to break the strong carbon–carbon bonds that hold polymer chains together. This produces molecular fragments with an unpaired electron on each of the sundered carbons, called carbon radicals. During pyrolysis, these reactive radicals zoom around like a frenzied swarm of cannibalistic piranhas, tearing each other into smaller pieces. But in Mura’s hydrothermal process, the molten polymer is dispersed more evenly through supercritical water. This makes heat transfer more efficient, and ensures that the carbon radicals tend to sate their hunger for other atoms by plucking hydrogen from surrounding water molecules, forming more-stable hydrocarbons and avoiding char formation5.\n\nA new plastics recycling plant near Redcar, UK, which owners Mura say will start operating in 2025.Credit: Kim Walker/Mura Technology\n\nSupercritical fluids are already used in a wide variety of industrial processes, from purifying pharmaceuticals to decaffeinating coffee. Other companies are using hydrothermal liquefaction to convert biomass into fuels and to recycle cotton–polyester textiles.\n\nBut Mura says that this is the first time supercritical water has been applied to commercial-scale processing of waste plastic. For now, it doesn’t have much competition, although plenty of researchers are studying supercritical liquids to break down various polymers6.\n\nMura says that its process generates an output that is similar to pyrolysis oil, but with lower CO2 emissions, higher efficiency and a somewhat greater tolerance for contamination. Overall, Mura predicts that this will give its process an edge over pyrolysis, and thus boost recycling of mixed waste. “If this process is more tolerant to contamination, then that could put it at an advantage,” says Scown.\n\nBlack gold\n\nMura’s technology has been brewing for a long time. It originated with Thomas Maschmeyer, a chemist now at the University of Sydney in Australia. In the 1990s, when he was at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands, a company sought his advice about using supercritical liquids to process municipal waste. Although the process didn’t thrive, the concept stuck in his mind.\n\nYears later, in Australia, he and fellow chemist Len Humphreys designed a reactor that used supercritical water to transform waste biomass such as wood chippings and agricultural residues. The pair set up a company called Licella to develop that process, called catalytic hydrothermal reactor or Cat-HTR. Along with supercritical water, Cat-HTR can use catalysts to help remove oxygen atoms from woody polymers such as cellulose, producing an oily output7. In collaboration with Canadian forestry company Canfor, Licella has just finished building a facility in Prince George, Canada, that will turn forest waste into aviation fuel.\n\nIn 2016, an investor in Licella, Steve Mahon, suggested that researchers try feeding the reactor with waste plastic. The process worked — even without catalysts — and Mahon and Licella formed Mura to commercialize it as hydrothermal plastic recycling technology (Hydro-PRT). Mahon, now Mura’s chief executive, says that the process has evolved a lot since those early trials; much of the funding for development has come from petrochemical giants such as the multinational Dow, and the US technology and engineering company KBR. “Turning something that was a lab curiosity into an industrial process has been what we’ve spent the best part of US$200 million and seven or eight years doing,” he says.\n\nIt takes about 30 minutes for Mura’s reactor to turn a batch of plastic into the desired blend of hydrocarbon products, unlike pyrolysis, which can take many hours. After depressurization, these hydrocarbons are separated from the water and then distilled into four products: naphtha, two kinds of ‘gas oil’ and a ‘heavy residual oil’ (see ‘How to recycle plastics with superheated water’). Most of the contaminants from the plastic remain in the water — unlike in pyrolysis — which means that the reactor can tackle dirtier waste without defiling its products.\n\nSource: Mura Technology\n\nThe heavy residual oil can be used as an additive for asphalt. Naphtha and distillate gas oil are sent to Dow, which uses huge chemical reactors called steam crackers to convert the material into various products, including ethene and propene, the building blocks of new polymers. And the remainder goes to a Finnish plant, operated by oil-refining company Neste, where it goes through further refining to make various chemicals.\n\nJust as with pyrolysis, critics such as ZWE complain that some of the plant’s output won’t be reborn as recycled plastic. And even the naphtha that goes into Dow’s steam crackers is mixed with fossil-fuel-derived naphtha before its products go to make fresh plastic. Scown points out that the supply of recycled naphtha is tiny compared with the amount of fossil naphtha processed by petrochemical plants, so that kind of mixing is inevitable to use the recycled material in existing refineries.\n\n“From the outside, it looks like we are working towards more circularity. In reality, we are locking ourselves into keeping on using virgin plastic,” says Lauriane Veillard, a chemical-recycling policy officer at ZWE. Mura rejects ZWE’s argument that its process should be termed ‘chemical recovery’. It says that ‘chemical recycling’ refers to processes that break down waste into raw materials, which might then be used to make not only new plastics, but also other products.\n\nAlthough Hydro-PRT can chew up pretty much any kind of plastic, in practice, its diet will be restricted to waste that yields the hydrocarbon products that its customers want. “We’ve concentrated on polyolefins, because we get the best-quality product for a steam cracker,” says Mahon. This also means that Mura will use many of the same shredding and sorting steps used by pyrolysis plants and mechanical recyclers to tidy up its plastic feedstock.\n\nStill, the company insists that it will only reprocess plastic waste that has already been rejected during mechanical recycling, and would otherwise be destined for incineration or landfill. There’ll be plenty of that waste available for the facility, because a UK law requires all local authorities to collect plastic films and flexible packaging from households for recycling from April 2027.\n\nEnvironmental questions\n\nIs all this good for the environment? Stuart Coles, a sustainability researcher in the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) at the University of Warwick, UK, has carried out an independent life-cycle analysis (LCA) of Mura’s process, in a study funded by the government body Innovate UK8.\n\nIt found that Hydro-PRT emitted a little under half a tonne of CO2 per tonne of waste plastic. Much of that comes from the electricity used for separating and sorting the plastic waste, along with some electrical heating, so the emissions should decline as the UK electricity grid gets greener.\n\nThe emissions are much lower than incineration for energy recovery, which belches about 2.3 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of plastic, and they are less than half of the emissions associated with refining fossil oil to create virgin naphtha. But Hydro-PRT’s CO2 output is only slightly lower than the emissions from pyrolysis plants calculated by other studies, and actually a little higher than for mechanical recycling .\n\n“The overriding takeaway is that if you can mechanically recycle your material, then do that. If you can’t mechanically recycle it, then chemically recycle it in the way that is most appropriate for that material,” says Coles.",

          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "Researchers think that for some tasks, generative AI tools can already do a better job than humans. Credit: Getty\n\nUsing artificial intelligence (AI) tools for processes such as preparing manuscripts, writing grant applications and peer review will become widely accepted within the next two years, suggests a survey of nearly 5,000 researchers in more than 70 countries by the publishing company Wiley.\n\nThe survey asked researchers how they are currently using generative AI tools — which include chatbots such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek — as well as how they feel about various potential applications of the technology. The results suggest that the majority of researchers see AI becoming central for scientific research and publishing (see ‘Acceptable use’). More than half of the respondents think that AI currently outperforms humans at more than 20 of the tasks given as example use cases, including reviewing large sets of papers, summarizing research findings, detecting errors in writing, checking for plagiarism and organizing citations. More half of the survey participants expect AI to become mainstream in 34 out of 43 use cases in the next two years.\n\nSource: ExplanAItions report, Wiley\n\n“What really stands out is the imminence of this,” says Sebastian Porsdam Mann at the University of Copenhagen, who studies the practicalities and ethics of using generative AI in research. “People that are in positions that will be affected by this — which is everyone, but to varying degrees — need to start” addressing this now, he adds.\n\nWiley, headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey, posted the survey findings online on 4 February. Josh Jarrett, senior vice-president and general manager of the publisher’s AI growth team, says he hopes they will serve as a road map for innovators and start-ups looking for opportunities to develop AI tools. “There's broad acceptance that AI is going to reshape the research field.”\n\nLimited uses\n\nThe survey polled 4,946 researchers worldwide, 27% of whom are early-career researchers. Perhaps surprisingly, says Jarrett, the results show that “people aren't really using these tools much in their day-to-day work”. Only 45% of the first wave of respondents (1,043 researchers) said that they had actually used AI to help with their research, and the most common uses they cited were translation, proofreading and editing manuscripts (see ‘Uses of AI’).\n\nAlthough 81% of these 1,043 respondents said they had used OpenAI’s ChatGPT for personal or professional purposes, only one-third had heard of other generative-AI tools such as Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s Copilot. However, there are clear differences across countries and disciplines, with researchers in China and Germany, as well as computer scientists, being the most likely to use AI in their work.\n\nSource: ExplanAItions report, Wiley\n\nThe majority of survey participants expressed interest in expanding their AI use. About 72% want to use AI for preparing manuscripts in the next two years — for tasks such as detecting errors in writing, plagiarism checks and organizing citations. Sixty-two per cent think that AI already outperforms humans in these tasks (see ‘Who does it better: humans or AI?’).\n\nAround 67% of respondents also expressed interest in using AI to handle large amounts of information, for example helping to review the literature, summarizing papers and processing data. Early-career researchers showed greater interest than did more senior colleagues in using AI for writing grant applications and finding potential collaborators. “These are both things that come easier with experience and seniority,” says Porsdam Mann. “Using AI will help even those things out a little bit.”\n\nHowever, researchers are less convinced about AI’s capabilities in more-complex tasks such as identifying gaps in the literature, choosing a journal to submit manuscripts to, recommending peer reviewers or suggesting relevant citations. Although 64% of respondents are open to using AI for these tasks in the next two years, the majority thinks that humans still outperform AI in these areas.\n\nWho does it better: humans or AI?\n\nResearchers think AI can already perform some tasks better than people.\n\nUse caseExamplesQ: Who currently does it better: humans or AI?Manuscript preparation Detecting errors/bias in own writingChecking for unintended plagiarismWriting assistance (e.g. copyediting, translation)FormattingPopulating citationsAI (62% of respondents)Handling informationReviewing a large number of studiesAI agent to monitor key new publicationsAutomated processing of unstructured data (e.g. cataloguing events in hours of video footage)Data visualizationAI (60%)Sharing findings‘Plain language’ summaries of article findingsKnowledge-management agent to help make information accessibleAI (58%)Increasing impactGenerating educational content based on a paperGenerating multimediaVideo abstract or “explainer” generatorHumans (51%)Enhancing research methods and enhancing collaborationWriting up documentationOptimizing experimental designIdentifying potential collaboratorsTools to optimize allocation of shared resourcesAdvanced simulationsHumans (58%)Peer reviewPeer reviewer recommendation tool based on article comparisonsAdapting reviewer feedback into standardized formatAutomated feedback to reviewersHumans (59%)\n\nSource: ExplanAItions report, Wiley\n\nObstacles and opportunities",

          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "Restrictions on offshore oil drilling in the United States are under threat.Credit: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nHigher greenhouse-gas emissions, fewer jobs, more expensive energy and dirtier air that kills more people: researchers have begun plugging US President Donald Trump’s energy and climate policies into their models, and the early results suggest far-reaching environmental, health and economic consequences.\n\nTrump, a Republican, began his second term on a promise to “drill, baby, drill”, vowing to make the United States rich again by promoting the development of oil and gas. To that end, Trump plans to roll back climate regulations, end clean-energy incentives and promote fossil fuels. It’s not clear that Trump will be able to accomplish his goals. But if he does, researchers’ models show that these policies are likely to have negative effects for many US residents. They also project that Trump’s policies will undermine efforts to rein in global warming, affecting people around the world.\n\n“Trump is going to make the job of meeting our climate goals a lot harder,” says Bill Hare, a physicist who heads Climate Analytics, a non-profit consultancy in Berlin.\n\nBumping up greenhouse gases\n\nTrump has vowed to roll back regulations put in place by his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from sources such as automobiles and power plants. Trump has also called for fossil-fuel development to be expedited, and for a halt to climate investments that Congress approved in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As things stand, those investments are set to pump more than US$1 trillion into programmes to cut emissions and develop green energy by 2032.\n\nAn initial analysis by Climate Analytics and the non-profit consortium Climate Action Tracker suggests that, by 2030, the Trump administration’s policies could raise cumulative US emissions by the equivalent of 2 billion to 4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide over what they would otherwise be; the size of the increase will depend mainly on the extent of cuts made to IRA spending. The upper end of that range is equivalent to four years of carbon emissions from Japan.\n\nHow five crucial elections in 2024 could shape climate action for decades\n\nOther groups have come up with similar numbers for 2030, and even higher emissions figures for subsequent years. For instance, modelling by the Rhodium Group, a research consultancy based in New York City, suggests that rolling back Biden’s regulations and repealing the IRA would raise annual US emissions in 2035 by the equivalent of around 1 billion tonnes of CO2.\n\nResearchers say it’s not yet clear how these changes will affect Earth’s climate. Climate actions and policies formulated so far by nations around the world are projected to result in 2.7 °C of warming by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker. The organization projects that the estimated 2 billion to 4 billion tonnes of emissions resulting from Trump’s policies could raise the global temperature by less than a tenth of a degree Celsius. But if these policies were continued into the future and the United States abandoned its climate goals, the increase could be a few tenths of a degree, which would be enough to push the world past the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C.\n\nRipple effects\n\nTrump’s policies would slow the shift from coal to cleaner fuels for generating electricity and would also slow sales of electric vehicles. The burning of more coal and petrol would mean more air pollution, which contributes to a host of diseases. As a result, a Trump administration rollback of current environmental and energy policies could lead to several thousand premature deaths a year by 2030, says Robbie Orvis, a senior director at Energy Innovation Policy and Technology, a think tank based in San Francisco, California, that modelled the effects of such policies.\n\nSuperfast Microsoft AI is first to predict air pollution for the whole world\n\nMoreover, researchers say that any gains in employment in the energy sector as a result of Trump’s policies would be more than offset by job losses and reduced economic growth across the rest of the economy. A broad repeal of current energy and climate policies could result in a net loss of nearly four million jobs by 2030, according to work by Orvis’s group.",

          "title": "How the brain suppresses fear: mouse study offers path to anxiety treatments",
          "authors": "Felicity Nelson",
          "abstract": "Mice immediately bolt for shelter when they see the looming shadow of a bird, just as humans jump when they see a spider. But these instinctive reactions, which are controlled by the brainstem, can be suppressed if animals learn that a scary stimulus is harmless.\n\nIn Science today, neuroscientists reveal the precise regions of the brain that suppress fear responses in mice1 — a finding that might help scientists to develop strategies for treating post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety in people.\n\nThe study showed that two parts of the brain work together to learn to suppress fear. But, surprisingly, only one of these regions is involved in later recalling the learnt behaviour. “This is the first evidence of that mechanism,” says neuroscientist Pascal Carrive at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.\n\nIn the study, an expanding dark circle was used to imitate a swooping bird, and caused naive mice to run to a shelter. To teach the mice that this looming stimulus was not dangerous, a barrier was added to prevent the animals from hiding.\n\n“I like their behavioural model,” says Christina Perry, a behavioural neuroscientist at Macquarie University in Sydney. “It’s very simple,” she adds. The mice “don’t get eaten, so they learn that this fake predator is not, in fact, a threat”.\n\nAs the mice were learning to be bolder, the researchers switched specific types of neurons on or off using optogenetics — a well-established technique that allows neurons to be controlled with light.\n\nWhen researchers silenced the parts of the cerebral cortex that analyse visual stimuli (called the posterolateral higher visual areas), the mice did not learn to suppress fear and continued to try to escape from the fake bird — suggesting that this area of the brain is necessary for learning to suppress this fear reaction.\n\n‘Unexpected’ result\n\nHowever, mice already trained to overcome their fear could still enact the new, courageous behaviour when the posterolateral higher visual areas were switched off. This is because the memory was stored in a region near the centre of the brain called the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus, “an area of the brain that can inhibit others; it’s quite a strong control region”, says co-author Sonja Hofer, a systems neuroscientist at University College London (UCL).",

          "abstract": "Researchers in the social sciences are interested in the consequences of institutions, increasingly on a global scale. Institutions that may be negotiated between states can have consequences at a microlevel, as local populations adjust their expectations and ultimately even their behavior to take institutional rules into account. However, large-scale fine-grained analyses that test for the complex evidence of such institutions locally are rare. This article focuses on a key institution: International borders. Using computer vision techniques, we show that it is possible to produce a geographically specific, validated, and replicable way to characterize border legibility , by which we mean the ability to visually detect the presence of an international border in physical space. We develop and compare computer vision techniques to automatically estimate legibility scores for 627,656 imagery tiles from virtually every border in the world. We evaluate statistical and data-driven computer vision methods, finding that fine-tuning pretrained visual recognition models on a small set of human judgments allows us to produce local legibility scores globally that align well with human notions of legibility. Finally, we interpret these scores as useful approximations of states’ border orientations, a concept that prior literature has used to capture the visible investments states make in border areas to maintain jurisdictional authority territorially. We validate our measurement strategy using both human judgments and five nomological validation indicators.",

          "abstract": "Experiencing negative content through art has a unique power to transform our perceptions and foster engagement. While this idea has been widely discussed, empirical evidence is scarce, since experimental testing of art experiences poses significant challenges. Here, we aimed to fill this gap by quantifying and comparing individuals’ preference for engaging with art and nonart depicting matched negative content via two behavioral measures: the choice to engage vs. avoid and the duration of engagement. Across five studies (total N = 1,063), results revealed a preference for engaging with negative content through art as compared to nonart. Specifically, people more frequently chose to view negative art images, and looked at them for longer, as compared to photographs of similar content. To understand what underlies this preference for art, we examined the psychological impact of engaging with negative content through art and nonart depictions. Results showed that art experiences evoked higher aesthetic appreciation, while nonart gave the viewer a more realistic perspective and was emotionally more costly to engage with. Further, our analysis of engagement motives revealed that individuals were driven by expectations of aesthetic appreciation, thought-provocativeness, and an original perspective, both in art and nonart, while they were discouraged by emotional costs, even more strongly when engaging with nonart. These findings align with the idea of aesthetic distance, where art, as an abstraction of reality, facilitates exploration of negative content with less emotional costs and the prospect of aesthetic rewards.",

          "abstract": "Numerous uniquely human phenomena, from teaching to our most complex forms of cooperation, depend on our ability to tailor our communication to the knowledge and ignorance states of our social partners. Despite four decades of research into the “theory of mind” capacities of nonhuman primates, there remains no evidence that primates can communicate on the basis of their mental state attributions, to enable feats of coordination. Moreover, recent reevaluation of the experimental literature has questioned whether primates can represent others’ ignorance at all. The present preregistered study investigated whether bonobos are capable of attributing knowledge or ignorance about the location of a hidden food reward to a cooperative human partner, and utilizing this attribution to modify their communicative behavior in the service of coordination. Bonobos could receive a reward that they had watched being hidden under one of several cups, if their human partner could locate the reward. If bonobos can represent a partner’s ignorance and are motivated to communicate based on this mental state attribution, they should point more frequently, and more quickly, to the hidden food’s location when their partner is ignorant about that location than when he is knowledgeable. Bonobos indeed flexibly adapted the frequency and speed of their communication to their partner’s mental state. These findings suggest that apes can represent (and act on) others’ ignorance in some form, strategically and appropriately communicating to effectively coordinate with an ignorant partner and change his behavior.",

After testing, we reject the hypothesis that the 1150 CE peak and decline is a result of 14 C sampling issues. We then examine the 14 C record of the past 2000 y in each of 18 watersheds where we find peaks ranging from ~800 to 770 CE to after European contact, with the majority, in the interior of the continent, declining ~1080 to 1300 CE. Although all Indigenous populations declined after European contact, that of a large portion of the country (the Great Lakes, New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the Central Plains, the Northwest, and California) did not decline until after contact.",

A large dataset of U.S. siblings shows a positive correlation of their beauty. The appropriate weighted average from the three samples shows that a one SD increase in ratings of both parents’ looks is associated with a 0.25 SD increase in their child’s. Coupling these estimates with those from large literatures measuring the impact of beauty on earnings and the intergenerational elasticity of income suggests that a one SD difference in parents’ looks is correlated with a 0.074 SD difference in their adult child’s earnings, about U.S. $2,170 annually.",

          "abstract": "The large labor markets of big cities offer greater possibilities for workers to gain skills and experience through successively better employment opportunities. This “experience effect” contributes to the higher average wages that are found in big cities compared to the economy as a whole. Racial wage inequality is also higher in bigger cities than in the economy on average. We offer an explanation for this pattern, demonstrating that there is substantial racial inequality in the economic returns to work experience acquired in big cities. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 we find that each year of work experience in a big city increases Black and Latinx workers’ wages by about one quarter to half as much as White workers’ wages. A substantial amount of this inequality can be explained by further racial disparities in the benefits of high-skill work experience. This research identifies a heretofore unknown source of inequality that is distinctly urban in nature, and expands our knowledge of the challenges to reaching interracial wage equality.",

          "abstract": "Spatial patterns of cells and other biological elements drive physiologic and pathologic processes within tissues. While many imaging and transcriptomic methods document tissue organization, discerning these patterns is challenging, especially when they involve multiple elements in complex arrangements. To address this challenge, we present Spatial Patterning Analysis of Cellular Ensembles (SPACE), an R package for analysis of high-plex spatial data. SPACE is compatible with any data collection modality that records values (i.e., categorical cell/structure types or quantitative expression levels) at fixed spatial coordinates (i.e., 2d pixels or 3d voxels). SPACE detects not only broad patterns of co-occurrence but also context-dependent associations, quantitative gradients and orientations, and other organizational complexities. Via a robust information theoretic framework, SPACE explores all possible ensembles of tissue elements—single elements, pairs, triplets, and so on—and ranks the most strongly patterned ensembles. For single images, rankings reflect differences from random assortment. For sets of images, rankings reflect differences across sample groups (e.g., genotypes, treatments, timepoints, etc.). Further tools then characterize the nature of each pattern for intuitive interpretation. We validate SPACE and demonstrate its advantages using murine lymph node images for which ground truth has been defined. We then detect new patterns across varied datasets, including tumors and tuberculosis granulomas.",

          "abstract": "Misregulation of the activity of GCN2, the kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates translation initiation factor eIF2α, has been implicated in several health disorders, underscoring the need to determine the mechanisms controlling GCN2 activation. During nutrient starvation, increased uncharged tRNA levels trigger GCN1 and GCN20 proteins to mediate the binding of uncharged tRNA to GCN2 to activate the kinase to phosphorylate eIF2α. Under constant conditions, activation of the Neurospora crassa homolog of GCN2, CPC-3, is controlled by the circadian clock. However, how the circadian clock controls the rhythmic activity of CPC-3 was not known. We found that the clock regulates CPC-3 and GCN1 interaction with ribosomes and show that these interactions are necessary for clock regulation of CPC-3 activity. CPC-3 activity rhythms, and the rhythmic interaction of CPC-3 and GCN1 with ribosomes, are abolished in a temperature-sensitive valyl-tRNA synthetase mutant ( un-3 ts ) that has high levels of uncharged tRNA Val at all times of the day. Disrupting the interaction between GCN1 and uncharged tRNA in the absence of GCN20 altered rhythmic CPC-3 activity, indicating that the clock controls the interaction between uncharged tRNA and GCN1. Together, these data support that circadian rhythms in mRNA translation through CPC-3 activity require rhythms in uncharged tRNA levels that drive the rhythmic interaction between CPC-3 and GCN1 with ribosomes. This regulation uncovers a fundamental mechanism to ensure temporal coordination between peak cellular energy levels and the energetically demanding process of mRNA translation.",

          "abstract": "Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are unconventional T cells that mediate rapid antimicrobial immune responses to antigens derived from microbial riboflavin pathway metabolites presented by the evolutionarily conserved MR1 molecules. MAIT cells represent a large pre-expanded T cell subset in humans and are involved in both protective immunity and inflammatory immunopathology. However, what controls the functional heterogeneity of human MAIT cell responses is still largely unclear. Here, combining functional and transcriptomic analyses, we investigate how MAIT cell response programs are influenced by the cytokine milieu at the time of antigen recognition. Activation by MR1-presented antigen together with IL-12 induces intermediate levels of IFNγ and TNF, as well as a regulatory profile with substantial IL-10 production and elevated expression of TIM-3, LAG-3, and PD-1. Activation by the combination of antigen and IL-12 induces a c-MAF-dependent program required for IL-10 production. The MAIT cell-derived IL-10 mediates both autocrine and paracrine immune regulation. In contrast, coactivation of MAIT cells with IL-18 induces IL-17, GM-CSF, IFNγ, and TNF, without IL-10. Notably, IL-18 dominantly counteracts IL-10 expression. The activation states biased toward IL-10 or IL-17 production are reversible and do not represent stable subsets. Finally, MR1-restricted TCR-mediated activation without cytokine coactivation drives primarily granzyme B cytolytic arming. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that human MAIT cells adapt their functional effector response during antigen recognition to cytokine cues in the microenvironment, and identify programs biased toward either regulatory c-MAF-dependent IL-10 expression, or an inflammatory IL-17 and GM-CSF profile.",

          "abstract": "Lipid peroxidation is a complex biochemical process associated with oxidative stress, and its products play crucial roles in cellular signaling and the pathophysiology of many diseases. Among the diverse array of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products, epoxyketooctadecenoic acids (EKODEs) have emerged as intriguing molecules with potential impacts on inflammatory diseases. EKODEs arise from linoleic acid reacting with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species present during inflammation. A hallmark of many LPO products is an electrophilic chemical functionality that can react with different biological nucleophiles to form adducts that impact a broad swath of physiologic processes. Here, we present the identification of reactivity patterns exhibited by the EKODE class of LPO products that arise due to the unique chemistry of the EKODE electrophiles, namely α, β-unsaturated epoxyketones of variable regiochemistry. Our initial investigations with models of the EKODE reactive core showed that surrogates of lysine did not react, and histidine nucleophiles formed reversible Michael adducts. However, when models of cysteine nucleophiles were tested, a unique reactivity profile emerged where rapid Michael addition was followed by slow rearrangement and epoxide opening at an unpredicted electrophilic site, affording what we postulated to be an advanced lipoxidation end product (ALE). After confirming the EKODE reactivity in model systems, we produced polyclonal antibodies of a stable epitope of the EKODE-based ALE and used these antibodies to investigate an approach for in vivo monitoring of inflammatory disease progression.",

          "abstract": "Air pollution from coal electricity generation is a major driver of poor air quality in India and its effects on human health have been extensively studied. Despite considerable evidence that the same pollution also reduces crop productivity, we lack similar quantitative assessments of coal electricity’s crop damages. Here, we estimate rice and wheat crop losses from coal generation’s nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions using a regression model that combines station-level electricity generation and wind direction, satellite-measured NO 2 , and its association with crop productivity. Coal emissions impact yields up to 100 km away from power stations. In parts of West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh heavily exposed to coal-linked NO 2 , annual yield losses exceed 10%, equivalent to approximately 6 y worth of average annual yield growth in both rice and wheat in India between 2011 and 2020. While station-specific crop damages (value of lost output) are almost always lower than mortality damages (monetized value of annual premature PM 2.5 -related deaths), crop damage intensity (crop damage per GWh of electricity generated) is frequently higher than mortality damage intensity (mortality damage/GWh). Rice damage intensity exceeds mortality damage intensity at 58, and wheat damage intensity at 35 of the 144 power stations studied. The stations associated with the largest crop losses differ from those associated with the highest mortality. Co-optimizing for crop gains and mortality reduction slightly increases and meaningfully changes the distribution of social benefits from reducing emissions, highlighting the importance of considering crop losses alongside health impacts when regulating coal electricity emissions in India.",

          "abstract": "Research investments in crop improvements, including by national and international agricultural research centers, have made significant contributions to raising yields of staple food crops in developing countries. Although mostly intended to improve food security and rural incomes, innovations in crop production also have major implications for the environment. Building on the latest productivity estimates from historical crop improvements in developing countries and using a gridded (0.25 degrees) equilibrium model of global agriculture, we assess the impacts of improved crop varieties on cropland use, threatened biodiversity, and terrestrial carbon stocks over 1961–2015. We replicate a historical baseline and produce a counterfactual scenario which shows the impact of omitting productivity improvements from these technologies. The results show that higher crop productivity generally lowered commodity prices, which reduced incentives to expand cropland except in those areas where productivity gains outweighed price declines. The net global effect of technology adoption was to limit conversion of natural habitat to agricultural use, although it did cause cropland to expand in some areas. We estimate that adoption of improved crop varieties in developing countries saved on net 16.03 [95% CI, 12.33 to 20.89] million hectares worldwide. With more natural habitat preserved, around 1,043 [95% CI, 616 to 1,503] threatened animal and plant species extinctions were avoided over this period. In addition, net land use savings from the improved crop varieties resulted in avoided terrestrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of around 5.35 [95% CI, 3.75 to 7.22] billion metric tons CO 2 equivalent retained in terrestrial carbon stocks.",

          "abstract": "Tumor cells reshape iron and lipid metabolism for their rapid proliferation. However, how tumor cells coordinate the interplay between tumor cell–specific iron homeostasis and lipid metabolism reprogramming to counteract energy shortages remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that glucose deprivation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells induced AMPK-dependent Transferrin S685 phosphorylation, which exposed Transferrin nuclear localization signal (NLS) for binding to importin α7 and subsequent nuclear translocation. Nucleus-translocated Transferrin interacts with PPARα and enhance its protein stability to increase fatty acid oxidation (FAO) upon glucose deprivation. Mechanistically, PPARα-associated Transferrin upregulates iron-dependent PHD2-mediated PPARα P87 hydroxylation and subsequently disrupts the binding of MDM2 to PPARα, therefore inhibiting MDM2-mediated PPARα ubiquitination and degradation. Reconstitution of Transferrin S685A and NLS mutation or knock-in expression of PPARα P87A inhibited PPARα-mediated FAO upon energy stress, enhanced HCC cell apoptosis, and impeded liver tumor growth in mice. Importantly, combined treatment with Transferrin pS685 blocking peptide suppressing AMPK-Transferrin-PPARα axis could synergize with a well-established AMPK activator Metformin to inhibit tumor growth. Additionally, Transferrin pS685-mediated PPARα P87 hydroxylation is positively correlated with PPARα expression levels in human HCC specimens and poor patient prognosis. These findings revealed a mechanism by which Transferrin can sense energy stress to promote the hydroxylation and protein stability of PPARα through iron-dependent activation of PHD2 and underscore the moonlighting function of Transferrin in lipid catabolism and liver tumor development.",

          "abstract": "Our understanding of how vision functions as primates actively navigate the real-world is remarkably sparse. As most data have been limited to chaired and typically head-restrained animals, the synergistic interactions of different motor actions/plans inherent to active sensing—e.g., eyes, head, posture, movement, etc.—on visual perception are largely unknown. To address this considerable gap in knowledge, we developed an innovative wireless head-mounted eye-tracking system that performs Chair-free Eye-Recording using Backpack mounted micROcontrollers (CEREBRO) for small mammals, such as marmoset monkeys. Because eye illumination and environment lighting change continuously in natural contexts, we developed a segmentation artificial neural network to perform robust pupil tracking in these conditions. Leveraging this innovative system to investigate active vision, we demonstrate that although freely moving marmosets exhibit frequent compensatory eye movements equivalent to other primates, including humans, the predictability of the visual behavior (gaze) is higher when animals are freely moving relative to when they are head-fixed. Moreover, despite increases in eye/head-motion during locomotion, gaze stabilization remains steady because of an increase in vestibularocular reflex gain during locomotion. These results demonstrate the efficient, dynamic visuo-motor mechanisms and related behaviors that enable stable, high-resolution foveal vision in primates as they explore the natural world.",

          "abstract": "A bilateral body plan is predominant throughout the animal kingdom. Bilaterality of amniote embryos becomes recognizable as midline morphogenesis begins at gastrulation, bisecting an embryonic field into the left and right sides, and left–right (LR) asymmetry patterning follows. While a series of laterality genes expressed after the LR compartmentalization has been extensively studied, the laterality patterning prior to and at the initiation of midline morphogenesis has remained unclear. Here, through a biophysical quantification in a high spatial and temporal resolution, applied to a chick model system, we show that a large-scale bilateral counterrotating cellular flow, termed “polonaise movements”, display LR asymmetries in early gastrulation. This cell movement starts prior to the formation of the primitive streak (PS) (the earliest midline structure) and the subsequent appearance of Hensen’s node (the LR organizer). The cellular flow speed and vorticity unravel the location and timing of the LR asymmetries. The bilateral flows displayed a Right dominance after 6 h since the start of cell movements. Mitotic arrest that diminishes PS formation resulted in changes in the bilateral flow pattern, but the Right dominance persisted. Our data indicate that the LR asymmetry in amniote gastrula becomes detectable earlier than suggested by current models, which assume that the asymmetric regulation of the laterality signals at the node leads to the LR patterning. More broadly, our results suggest that physical processes can play an unexpected but significant role in influencing LR laterality during embryonic development.",

          "abstract": "Peptides can bind to specific sites on larger proteins and thereby function as inhibitors and regulatory elements. Peptide fragments of larger proteins are particularly attractive for achieving these functions due to their inherent potential to form native-like binding interactions. Recently developed experimental approaches allow for high-throughput measurement of protein fragment inhibitory activity in living cells. However, it has thus far not been possible to predict de novo which of the many possible protein fragments bind to protein targets, let alone act as inhibitors. We have developed a computational method, FragFold, that employs AlphaFold to predict protein fragment binding to full-length proteins in a high-throughput manner. Applying FragFold to thousands of fragments tiling across diverse proteins revealed peaks of predicted binding along each protein sequence. Comparisons with experimental measurements establish that our approach is a sensitive predictor of fragment function: Evaluating inhibitory fragments from known protein–protein interaction interfaces, we find 87% are predicted by FragFold to bind in a native-like mode. Across full protein sequences, 68% of FragFold-predicted binding peaks match experimentally measured inhibitory peaks. Deep mutational scanning experiments support the predicted binding modes and uncover superior inhibitory peptides in high throughput. Further, FragFold is able to predict previously unknown protein binding modes, explaining prior genetic and biochemical data. The success rate of FragFold demonstrates that this computational approach should be broadly applicable for discovering inhibitory protein fragments across proteomes.",

Here, we show that the C2 domain of RasGAP is required for full catalytic activity toward Ras. Analyses of the RasGAP C2-GAP crystal structure, AlphaFold models, and sequence conservation reveal direct C2 domain interaction with the Ras allosteric lobe. This is achieved by an evolutionarily conserved surface centered around RasGAP residue R707, point mutation of which impairs the catalytic advantage conferred by the C2 domain in vitro. In mice, R707C mutation phenocopies the vascular and signaling defects resulting from constitutive disruption of the RASA1 gene.

In such a context, knowing when and where megafauna find resources to balance their substantial energy requirements is critical for their management. Through an energyscape approach integrating abundance censuses, diet, and energy requirements, we investigated the prey consumption patterns of Mediterranean marine megafauna during the summer. We thereby shed light on a diverse guild of species composed of fishes, mammals, reptiles, and birds and estimated that 4.1 million individuals consume 1.6 million tons of prey each summer, pelagic cephalopods being the primary food resource and cetaceans and tunas being key players in the community. Spatial patterns in prey consumption reflected the diverse distribution and needs of the megafauna species and underlined the critical importance of the western Mediterranean for the megafauna community. Conservation strategies should prioritize spatial and biological diversity to safeguard megafauna and ecosystem functions across the Mediterranean basin.",

          "abstract": "L-thyroxine (L-T4) monotherapy is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism, administered daily to normalize TSH levels. Once absorbed, T4 is converted to T3 to alleviate most symptoms. However, this treatment abnormally elevates plasma T4 levels in over 50% of patients. Using L-T4-treated Thyroid Hormone (TH) Action Indicator mice, which express a T3-regulated luciferase (Luc) reporter, we examined whether these T4 elevations disrupt TH signaling. Hypothyroid mice exhibited reduced Luc expression across brain regions, and L-T4 treatment failed to restore T3 signaling uniformly. There was also variability in the activity of type 2 deiodinase (D2), the enzyme that generates most brain T3. Intracerebroventricular T4 administration achieved higher elevation of Luc expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus compared to the cortex, and studies on cultured cortical astrocytes and hypothalamic tanycytes revealed cell-type-specific responses to T4. In tanycytes, exposure to T4 sustained D2 activity, leading to progressive T3 signaling, whereas in astrocytes, T4 exposure triggered a drop in D2 activity, limiting T3 production through a ubiquitin-dependent, self-limiting mechanism. The sustained D2 activity in tanycytes was linked to rapid deubiquitination by USP33, as confirmed using a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) pan-inhibitor and USP33 knockout mice. In conclusion, the brain’s response to L-T4 treatment is heterogeneous, influenced by cell-specific regulation of D2-mediated T3 production. While cortical astrocytes exhibit limited T3 signaling due to D2 ubiquitination, tanycytes coexpressing USP33 amplify T3 signaling by rescuing ubiquitinated D2 from proteasomal degradation. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the limitations of L-T4 therapy and highlight the need for tailored approaches to managing hypothyroidism.",

TSP-4 was also detected in bulk analysis of SMAPs released by CTLs; however, it has not been investigated whether TSP-4 contributes to distinct SMAP types or the same SMAP type as TSP-1 and, if in the same type of SMAP, whether TSP-4 and TSP-1 cooperate or compete.

Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy and Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy localized TSP-4 and TSP-1 in SMAP-containing multicore granules. Superresolution dSTORM revealed that TSP-4 and TSP-1 are usually enriched in the same SMAPs while particles with single-positive shells are rare. Retention Using Selective Hooks assays showed that TSP-4 localizes to the lytic granules faster than TSP-1 and promotes its accumulation therein. TSP-4 contributed to direct CTL-mediated killing, as previously shown for TSP-1. TSP-4 and TSP-1 were both required for latent SMAP-mediated cell killing, in which released SMAPs kill targets after removal of the CTLs. Of note, we found that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell culture supernatants suppressed expression of TSP-4 in CTL and latent SMAP-mediated killing. These results identify TSP-4 as a functionally important component of SMAPs and suggest that SMAPs may be targeted for immune suppression by CLL.",

          "abstract": "Carbon dioxide is a signaling cue critical for fungal pathogenesis. Ptc2, a type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C), serves as a conserved CO 2 sensor in fungi. By combining phosphoproteomic and biochemical assays, we identified Hsp90 as a direct target of Ptc2 at host CO 2 concentrations and Ssb1 as a Ptc2 target protein regardless of CO 2 levels in Candida albicans , the most prevalent human fungal pathogen. Ptc2 forms reversible condensates at elevated CO 2 , which enables the recruitment of Hsp90, but not Ssb1, to condensates, allowing efficient dephosphorylation. This process confers an enhanced susceptibility to caspofungin in vitro and during in vivo infection therapy. Importantly, we demonstrate this phenomenon in non-albicans Candida species. Sequential passages of C. albicans in mice with caspofungin treatment readily induce in vivo drug tolerance, causing therapeutic failure. These evolved strains display increased resistance to caspofungin under host concentrations of CO 2 but remain susceptible in air. Collectively, our study reveals a profound impact of host concentrations of CO 2 on antifungal drug susceptibility and connects this phenotype to therapeutic outcomes and highlights condensate formation as an efficient means that enables selective recruitment of substrates for certain signaling events.",

Here, we report on a real-time spectroscopic investigation combined with simultaneous visualizations of single aqueous droplet freezing events inside a cryogenically cooled ultrasonic levitation chamber with the ultimate goal of probing the molecular structure evolution and stages of ice formation.

          "abstract": "Disinfectants are essential tools for controlling infectious diseases and maintaining sterile conditions in many medical and food-industry settings. Recent work revealed that a deficiency in the carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) confers pan-tolerance to killing by diverse disinfectant types through its interaction with the cAMP-CRP regulatory network. The present work characterized a pan-tolerance mutant obtained by enrichment using phenol as a lethal probe and an Escherichia coli PTS null mutant as a parental strain. The resulting super-pan-tolerant mutant, which harbored an F158C substitution in PheS, inhibited bacterial killing by multiple disinfectant classes with surprisingly little effect on antimicrobial lethality. The PheS substitution, which was expected to lower substrate recognition efficiency and result in deacylated tRNA phe occupying the ribosomal A site, activated relA expression and synthesis of ppGpp, even in the absence of disinfectant exposure. ppGpp, along with DksA, increased RpoS function by activating promoters of dsrA and iraP , two genes whose products increase the expression and stability of RpoS. Subsequently, RpoS upregulated the expression of genes encoding a universal stress protein (UspB) and an oxidative stress peroxidase (KatE), which preconditioned bacteria to better survive a variety of disinfectants. Disinfectant-mediated accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and bacterial killing were abolished/reduced by exogenous dimethyl sulfoxide and by a PheS F158C substitution up-regulating genes encoding ROS-detoxifying enzymes ( katE, sodA, oxyR, ahpC ). These data identify a pheS mutation-triggered, ppGpp-stimulated transcriptional regulatory cascade that negates biocide-mediated lethality, thereby tying the stringent response to protection from ROS-mediated biocide lethality.",

          "abstract": "Arousal refers to changes in brain-body state underpinning motivated behavior but lacks a proper definition and taxonomy. Neuroscience and psychology textbooks offer surprisingly different views on what arousal is, from a global brain-wide modulation of neuronal activity to a multidimensional construct, with specific brain-body patterns tuned to a given situation. The huge number of scientific articles mentioning arousal (~50,000) highlights the importance of the concept but also explains why such a vast literature has never been systematically reviewed so far. Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. We then ask whether domain-general arousal exists at the cortical level, and run meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature to reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a cortical network composed of the presupplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we find that activity in dysgranular insular area 7 (Jülich atlas), the region with the highest convergence across varieties of arousal, is also specifically associated with arousal. The domain-general arousal network might trigger the reorganization of large-scale brain networks—a global mechanism—resulting in a context-specific configuration—in line with the multidimensional view. Future taxonomies of arousal refining the alignment between concepts and data should include domain-general arousal as a central component.",

          "abstract": "The Caenorhabditis elegans bZIP transcription factor ZIP-2 is activated by toxins or mutations that inhibit translational elongation. The zip-2 DNA-binding protein is encoded in a downstream main open reading frame (mORF), but under normal translation elongation conditions only an upstream overlapping oORF -1 frameshifted from mORF is translated. Mutations or toxins that slow translational elongation, but not inhibitors of translational initiation or termination, activate ZIP-2. An mORF initiation codon mutation does not disrupt the normal zip-2 response to translational elongation defects, suggesting that zip-2 activation does not depend on this ATG. An mORF early termination mutant can be activated by strong translation elongation inhibition, suggesting that translation initiated upstream on oORF +1 frameshifts when elongation is inhibited to the mORF reading frame downstream of the stop codon to activate a fused oORF/mORF ZIP-2 transcription factor. The protein and DNA sequences of zip-2 oORF and mORF are conserved across the Caenorhabditis , suggesting selection for particular codons sensitive to translational elongation defects. Mutations that disrupt the oORF initiation codon constitutively activate zip-2 , but not if the mORF initiation codon is also mutant, showing that zip-2 oORF competes with mORF for translational initiation. oORF initiation codon mutation-activated zip-2 slows C. elegans growth, and this slow growth is suppressed by a zip-2 null mutation. A zip-2 null mutant also strongly suppresses the growth arrest caused by translational elongation inhibitors. Thus, ZIP-2 is both a sensor of translational elongation attack, and a defense regulatory output via its activation of response genes.",

          "abstract": "In light of breakthroughs in superconductivity under high pressure, and considering that record critical temperatures (T c s) across various systems have been achieved under high pressure, the primary challenge for higher T c should no longer solely be to increase T c under extreme conditions but also to reduce, or ideally eliminate, the need for applied pressure in retaining pressure-induced or -enhanced superconductivity. The topological semiconductor Bi 0.5 Sb 1.5 Te 3 (BST) was chosen to demonstrate our approach to addressing this challenge and exploring its intriguing physics. Under pressures up to ~50 GPa, three superconducting phases (BST-I, -II, and -III) were observed. A superconducting phase in BST-I appears at ~4 GPa, without a structural transition, suggesting the possible topological nature of this phase. Using the pressure-quench protocol (PQP) recently developed by us, we successfully retained this pressure-induced phase at ambient pressure and revealed the bulk nature of the state. Significantly, this demonstrates recovery of a pressure-quenched sample from a diamond anvil cell at room temperature with the pressure-induced phase retained at ambient pressure. Other superconducting phases were retained in BST-II and -III at ambient pressure and subjected to thermal and temporal stability testing. Superconductivity was also found in BST with T c up to 10.2 K, the record for this compound series. While PQP maintains superconducting phases in BST at ambient pressure, both depressurization and PQP enhance its T c , possibly due to microstructures formed during these processes, offering an added avenue to raise T c . These findings are supported by our density-functional theory calculations.",

This may slow marine primary productivity, causing cascading effects throughout food webs. However, observing changes in upper ocean nutrients is challenging because surface concentrations are often below detection limits. We show that the nutricline depth, where nutrient concentrations reach well-detected levels, is tied to productivity and upper ocean nutrient availability. Next, we quantify nutricline depths from a global database of observed vertical nitrate and phosphate profiles to assess contemporary trends in global nutrient availability (1972–2022). We find strong evidence that the P-nutricline (phosphacline) is mostly deepening, especially throughout the southern hemisphere, but the N-nutricline (nitracline) remains mostly stable. Earth System Model (ESM) simulations support the hypothesis that reduced iron stress and increased nitrogen fixation buffer the nitracline, but not phosphacline, against increasing stratification. These contemporary trends are expected to continue in the coming decades, leading to increasing phosphorus but not nitrogen stress for marine phytoplankton, with important ramifications for ocean biogeochemistry and food web dynamics.",

We observe a plateau at magnetization equal to 1 9 Bohr magneton per magnetic ion, accompanied by oscillations in the magnetic torque, reminiscent of quantum oscillations in metals.

          "abstract": "Free-electron radiation, such as Cherenkov radiation and transition radiation, can generate light at arbitrary frequencies and is fundamental to diverse applications, ranging from electron microscopy, spectroscopy, lasers, to particle detectors. Generally, the features of free-electron radiation are stochastic when electrons interact with random media. Counterintuitively, here, we reveal a type of free-electron radiation that has both its intensity and directionality invariant to specific sorts of long-range structural randomness. Essentially, this invariance is enabled by the Brewster effect and the judiciously engineered phase coherence condition of emitted light, namely that the light induced by electron’s penetration through a layered aperiodic nanostructure is engineered to interfere constructively at the Brewster angle. As such, when each constituent layer with a random thickness fulfills this phase coherence condition, there is always the emergence of free-electron resonance transition radiation at the Brewster angle. At this resonant Brewster angle, we further find that the radiation intensity and directionality could be enhanced by orders of magnitude by readily increasing the interface number. The revealed resonance transition radiation via long-range Brewster randomness may offer a feasible route to explore more enticing photonic applications driven by free electrons, such as light sources at previously unreachable spectral regimes, optical frequency combs, particle detectors, and random lasers.",

          "abstract": "Soil salinity presents a dual challenge for plants, involving both osmotic and ionic stress. In response, plants deploy distinct yet interconnected mechanisms to cope with these facets of salinity stress. In this investigation, we observed a substantial overlap in the salt (NaCl)-induced transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis roots with those triggered by osmotic stress or the plant stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), as anticipated. Notably, a specific cluster of genes responded uniquely to sodium (Na + ) ions and are not regulated by the known monovalent cation sensing mechanism MOCA1 . Surprisingly, expression of sodium-induced genes exhibited a negative correlation with the ABA response and preceded the activation of genes induced by the osmotic stress component of salt. Elevated exogenous ABA levels resulted in the complete abolition of sodium-induced responses. Consistently, the ABA insensitive snrk2.2/2.3 double mutant displayed prolonged sodium-induced gene expression, coupled with increased root cell damage and root swelling under high salinity conditions. Moreover, ABA biosynthesis and signaling mutants were unable to redirect root growth to avoid high sodium concentrations and had increased sodium accumulation in the shoot. In summary, our findings unveil an unexpected and pivotal role for ABA signaling in mitigating cellular damage induced by salinity stress and modulating sodium-induced responses in plant roots.",

These groups—termed biofilms—can act as refuges from environmental disturbances and from biotic threats, including phages. Despite the ubiquity of temperate phages and bacterial biofilms, live propagation of temperate phages within biofilms has not been characterized on cellular spatial scales. Here, we leverage several approaches to track temperate phages and distinguish between lytic and lysogenic host infections. We determine that lysogeny within Escherichia coli biofilms initially occurs within a predictable region of cell group packing architecture on the biofilm periphery. Because lysogens are generally found on the periphery of large cell groups, where lytic viral infections also reduce local biofilm structural integrity, lysogens are predisposed to disperse into the passing liquid and are overrepresented in downstream biofilms formed from the dispersal pool of the original biofilm-phage system. Comparing our results with those for virulent phages reveals that temperate phages have unique advantages in propagating over long spatial and time scales within and among bacterial biofilms.",

          "abstract": "Human γD-crystallin, a monomeric protein abundant in the eye lens nucleus, must remain stably folded for an individual’s entire lifetime to avoid aggregation and protein deposition-associated cataract formation. γD-crystallin contains two homologous domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), which interact via a hydrophobic interface. Several familial mutations in the gamma crystallin gene are linked to congenital early-onset cataract, most of which affect the NTD. Some of these, including V75D and W42R, are known to populate intermediates under partially denaturing conditions possessing a natively folded CTD and a completely unfolded NTD. We employed hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe the structural and energetic features of variants of γD-crystallin under both native and partially denaturing conditions. For V75D and W42R, we identify a species under native conditions that retains partial structure in the NTD and is structurally and energetically distinct from the intermediate populated under partially denaturing conditions. Residues at the NTD–CTD interface play crucial roles in stabilizing this intermediate, and disruption of interface contacts either by amino acid substitution or partial denaturation permits direct observation of two intermediates simultaneously. These data suggest that the intermediate identified under native conditions is accessed from the native state and not on the folding pathway. The intermediate we have identified here exposes hydrophobic amino acids that are buried in both the folded full-length protein and in the protein’s stable isolated domains. Such nonnative exposure of a hydrophobic patch may play an important role in cataract formation.",

          "abstract": "While the release of sterile males has been highly successful in suppressing some pest populations, it is impractical for many species due to the males disappearing after a single generation, necessitating large, repeated releases to maintain sufficient impact. Synthetic gene drives promise more efficient approaches since they can increase in frequency from rare, yet this also allows them to spread across a landscape, which may not always be desired. Between these two extremes are selectively neutral genetic constructs which persist at the frequency they are released, offering the potential for efficient suppression that remains localized. One way to achieve this would be to have perfect balance, at all construct frequencies, between gene drive increasing frequency and selection decreasing it. Here, we describe a way to closely approximate this balance using a toxin–antidote genetic construct that causes recessive lethality or sterility, encodes a genomic editor that makes dominant lethal or sterile edits in the genome, and provides protection against the action or consequences of the editing. Computer modeling shows that this design can be 100-fold more efficient than sterile males, increasing to 1,000-fold when released alongside a genetic booster. We describe designs for CRISPR-based molecular construction, including options that avoid using recoded genes as antidotes.",

However, electron microscopy (EM) has long ago revealed the presence of particles inside the lumens of neuronal MTs, of yet unknown identity and function. Here, we use cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) to analyze the three-dimensional (3D) organization and structures of MT lumenal particles in primary hippocampal neurons, human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons, and pluripotent and differentiated P19 cells. We obtain in situ density maps of several lumenal particles from the respective cells and detect common structural features underscoring their potential overarching functions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics combined with structural modeling suggest that a subset of lumenal particles could be tubulin-binding cofactors (TBCs) bound to tubulin monomers. A different subset of smaller particles, which remains unidentified, exhibits densities that bridge across the MT protofilaments. We show that increased lumenal particle concentration within MTs is concomitant with neuronal differentiation and correlates with higher MT curvatures. Enrichment of lumenal particles around MT lattice defects and at freshly polymerized MT open-ends suggests a MT protective role. Together with the identified structural resemblance of a subset of particles to TBCs, these results hint at a role in local tubulin proteostasis for the maintenance of long-lived neuronal MTs.",

Increasing evidence suggests that ACC can also act independently of ethylene to regulate various aspects of plant growth and development. Here, we explore the effects of ACC on Arabidopsis thaliana root growth and the mechanisms by which it acts. ACC inhibits growth of the primary root in Arabidopsis seedlings when ethylene signaling is blocked, which becomes evident after 36 h of treatment with ACC. This reduced root growth is in part the result of suppressed cell proliferation in the root meristem resulting from altered expression of a key regulator of stem cell niche activity, WOX5. ACC also promotes lateral root (LR) development, in contrast to ethylene, which inhibits LR formation. Transcriptomic analysis of roots revealed no significant changes in gene expression after 45 min or 4 h of ACC treatment, but longer treatment times revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes, including the downregulation of the expression of a small group of phylogenetically related CLE peptides. Reduced expression of these group 1 CLEs in response to ACC leads to the activation of a transcription factor, LBD18, which promotes LR development. These results suggest that ACC acts to modulate multiple aspects of Arabidopsis root growth independently of ethylene via distinct transcriptional effects in the root meristem and LR precursor cells.",

          "abstract": "Alpine lakes, characterized by isolation, low temperatures, oligotrophic conditions, and intense ultraviolet radiation, remain a poorly explored ecosystem for RNA viruses. Here, we present the first comprehensive metatranscriptomic study of RNA viruses in Lake Nam Co, a high-altitude alkaline saline lake on the Tibetan Plateau. Using a combination of sequence- and structure-based homology searches, we identified 742 RNA virus species, including 383 novel genus-level groups and 84 novel family-level groups exclusively found in Lake Nam Co. These findings significantly expand the known diversity of the Orthornavirae , uncovering evolutionary adaptations such as permutated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motifs and distinct RNA secondary structures. Notably, 14 additional RNA virus families potentially infecting prokaryotes were predicted, broadening the known host range of RNA viruses and questioning the traditional assumption that RNA viruses predominantly target eukaryotes. The presence of auxiliary metabolic genes in viral genomes suggested that RNA viruses (families f . 0102 and Nam-Co_family_51) exploit host energy production mechanisms in energy-limited alpine lakes. Low nucleotide diversity, single nucleotide polymorphism frequencies, and pN/pS ratios indicate strong purifying selection in Nam Co viral populations. Our findings offer insights into RNA virus evolution and ecology, highlighting the importance of extreme environments in uncovering hidden viral diversity and further shed light into their potential ecological implications, particularly in the context of climate change.",

          "abstract": "Ginkgolides are secondary metabolites unique to Ginkgo biloba with the potential to prevent and treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Although the biosynthetic pathways of ginkgolides have been partly uncovered, the mechanism regulating their biosynthesis is still largely unknown. Here, using multiomic and genetic analyses, we report the identification of a transcription factor, named ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH GINKGOLIDE BIOSYNTHESIS (GbEAG), as a critical regulator of ginkgolide biosynthesis. GbEAG is highly expressed in the roots of G. biloba, and its expression is significantly induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Ginkgolide content was significantly increased in roots by overexpressing GbEAG using a “cut-dip-regeneration” system. GbEAG positively regulates ginkgolide biosynthesis by directly binding to the GCC-boxes in the promoter regions of genes involved in the biosynthesis of ginkgolides, such as ISOPENTENYL DIPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE ( GbIDI ) and CYTOCHROME P450 7005C3 ( GbCYP7005C3 ). GbEAG mediates the jasmonic acid (JA)-activated ginkgolide synthesis through its direct interaction with the JASMONATE ZINC-FINGER INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM DOMAIN 3 (GbJAZ3) repressor. Importantly, we also found that the central light-response regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (GbHY5) mediates light induction of ginkgolide biosynthesis by binding to the G-box in the GbEAG promoter. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the coordinated regulation of ginkgolide biosynthesis via JA and light signals, with GbEAG as a central regulator in G. biloba, and shed light on the potential to develop ginkgolide-rich varieties through molecular breeding and gene editing.",

MIPs can be found in axonemes to stabilize flagellar beat or within cytoplasmic microtubules. Plasmodium spp. are the causative agents of malaria that feature different parasite forms across a complex life cycle with both unique and divergent microtubule-based arrays. Here, we investigate four MIPs in a rodent malaria parasite for their role in transmission to and from the mosquito. We show by single and double gene deletions that SPM1 and TrxL1, MIPs associated with subpellicular microtubules, are dispensable for transmission from the vertebrate host to the mosquito and back. In contrast, FAP20 and FAP52, MIPs associated with the axonemes of gametes, are essential for transmission to mosquitoes but only if both genes are deleted. In the absence of both FAP20 and FAP52, the B-tubule of the axoneme partly detaches from the A-tubule, resulting in the deficiency of axonemal beating and hence gamete formation and egress. Our data suggest that a high level of redundancy ensures microtubule stability in the transmissive stages of Plasmodium , which is important for parasite transmission.",

          "abstract": "The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, or floral transition, is a tightly regulated, energy-demanding process. In Arabidopsis , the interplay of light perception and circadian rhythms detects changes in photoperiod length, accelerating flowering under long days (LD). CONSTANS (CO), a transcription factor, upregulates FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in leaves during dusk. The FT protein then moves to the shoot apical meristem, triggering the floral transition. While light and circadian signals control CO protein levels, less is known about how the nutrients/energy sensing regulates the photoperiod pathway for flowering modulation in this process. In our study, we identify the contribution of the Regulatory-associated protein of target of rapamycin 1B (RAPTOR1B), a component of the nutrient-sensing TOR complex (TORC), in the induction of specific flowering genes under CO control. While transcription of CO remains unaffected in raptor1b mutants, a reduction in its protein levels at dusk is observed compared to the wild type. Remarkably, the mutant also exhibits compromised GIGANTEA (GI) protein levels, crucial for CO stabilization during dusk. Our results indicate that the interaction and colocalization of RAPTOR1B with GI in the nucleus might influence GI levels through an unknown posttranscriptional mechanism. Genetic crosses position RAPTOR1B upstream of CO and GI. This is supported by phenotypic and molecular analyses. Our findings demonstrate that RAPTOR1B, likely as part of TORC, contributes to the photoperiod pathway of the flowering network, ensuring the timely initiation of floral transition under LD conditions.",

          "abstract": "The global extinction crisis is intensifying rapidly, driven by habitat loss, overexploitation, climate change, invasive species, and disease. This unprecedented loss of species not only threatens ecological integrity but also undermines ecosystem services vital for human survival. In response, many countries have set ambitious conservation targets such as halting species extinctions, yet the necessary financial commitments to achieve this are rarely prescribed. Estimating costs can be achieved using an ensemble of spatially variable species-specific cost models for threat abatement activities. We employ this method to provide a cost assessment to halt extinctions for Australia’s priority terrestrial and freshwater species. We show that it will cost ~AUD15.6 billion/year for 30 y to halt extinctions for these 99 priority species (comparable to 1% of Australia’s GDP). The more ambitious objectives to move priority species down one threat category (~AUD103.7 billion/year) or remove from the threatened species list entirely (~AUD157.7 billion/year) would require considerably more investment. Regardless of what is spent, we found that 16 (16%) priority species could not be removed from the threatened species list due to extensive historical declines and pervasive, ongoing, unmanageable threats, such as climate change. But implementing these efforts could ensure conservation benefits for over 43% of all nationally listed nonmarine threatened species. Adequate funding is crucial for meeting government commitments and requires both government leadership and private sector investment.",

Developing antibody drugs with broad-spectrum and high efficiency is a long-term task. It is promising but challenging to develop therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) through in vitro evolution based on antigen–antibody binding interactions. From an early B cell antibody repertoire, we isolated antibody 8G3 that retains its nonregressive neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1 and various other strains in vitro. 8G3 protected ACE2 transgenic mice from BA.1 and WA1/2020 virus infection without adverse clinical manifestations and completely cleared viral load in the lungs. Similar to most IGHV3–53 antibodies, the binding sites of 8G3 and ACE2 largely overlap, enabling competition with ACE2 for binding to RBD. By comprehensively considering the binding free energy changes of the antigen–antibody complexes, the biological environment of their interactions, and the evolutionary direction of the antibodies, we were able to select 50 mutants. Among them, 11 were validated by experiments showing better neutralizing activities. Further, a combination of four mutations were identified in 8G3 that increased its neutralization potency against JN.1, the latest Omicron mutant, by approximately 1,500-fold, and one of the mutations led to an improvement in activity against multiple variants to a certain extent. Together, we established a procedure of rapid selection of neutralizing antibodies with potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity.

Loving-kindness meditation (LKM), a specific subtype of meditative practice, involves focusing one’s attention on thoughts of well-being for oneself and others. Meditation has been proven to be beneficial in a variety of settings, including therapeutic applications, but the neural activity underlying meditative practices and their positive effects are not well understood. It has been difficult to understand the contribution of deep limbic structures given the difficulty of studying neural activity directly in the human brain. Here, we leverage a unique patient population, epilepsy patients chronically implanted with responsive neurostimulation devices that allow chronic, invasive electrophysiology recording to investigate the physiological correlates of LKM in the amygdala and hippocampus of novice meditators. We find that LKM-associated changes in physiological activity were specific to periodic, but not aperiodic, features of neural activity. LKM was associated with an increase in γ (30 to 55 Hz) power and an alternation in the duration of β (13 to 30 Hz) and γ oscillatory bursts in both the amygdala and hippocampus, two regions associated with mood disorders. These findings reveal the nature of LKM-induced modulation of limbic activity in first-time meditators.",

          "abstract": "Perception and action are inherently entangled: our world view is shaped by how we explore our environment through complex and variable self-motion. Even when fixating stable stimuli, our eyes undergo small, involuntary movements. Fixational eye movements (FEM) render a stable world jittery on our retinae, which can be expected to harm neural coding. Yet, empirical evidence suggests that FEM help rather than harm human perception of fine detail. Here, we elucidate this paradox by uncovering under which conditions FEM improve or impair retinal coding and human acuity. We combine theory and experiment: model accuracy is directly compared to that of healthy human subjects in a visual acuity task. Acuity is modeled by applying an ideal Bayesian classifier to simulations of retinal spiking activity in the presence of FEM. In addition, empirical FEM are monitored using high-resolution eye-tracking by an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope. FEM introduce variability in retinal ganglion cell activity, but they also effectively preprocess inputs to facilitate retinal information encoding. Based on an interplay of these mechanisms, our model predicts a relation between visual acuity, FEM amplitude, and single-trial stimulus size that quantitatively accounts for experimental observations and captures the beneficial effect of FEM. Moreover, we observe that while human subjects’ FEM statistics vary with stimulus size, our model suggests that subjects’ FEM amplitude remains within a near-optimal range, where acuity is enhanced compared to much larger or smaller amplitudes. Overall, our findings indicate that perception benefits from action even at the fine spatiotemporal scale of FEM.",

          "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) are large intracellular macromolecular assemblies that play a critical role in cell polarization and migration. Talin serves as a direct connection between integrin receptor and actomyosin cytoskeleton within FAs. Talin contains three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) that engage discreetly during the development of FAs, thus acting as a critical player in FA initiation and maturation. However, the molecular basis of the ABS–F-actin interactions remains unknown. Here, we explore interactions of ABSs with F-actin to understand the multivalent behavior of talin. Particularly, the cryo-EM structure of the F-actin–ABS3 complex at 2.9 Å shows ABS3 spanning through two actin monomers along the filament axis, each occupied by the R13 rod subdomain and the DD domain. The dimerization of ABS3 occurs through the DD domain where both protomers interact on the actin surface, and the dimerization of talin to the actin surface is necessary for the engagement to F-actin. The R13 helical bundle is distorted upon binding to F-actin and releases the H1 helix from the rest of the bundle. This phenomenon has also been observed with other tension-sensing proteins like vinculin and α-catenin, highlighting that unfolding is relevant for its force sensing activity. On the contrary, ABS2 (R4R8 subdomains), which is thought to be critical for the maintenance of mature FAs, had multiple F-actin-binding regions within ABS2 and the binding likely occurred by these subdomains running through the surface of F-actin, thus strengthening the interactions upon the maturation of FAs.",

At least one order is relevant to social scientists studying political communication because it aims to “ restore freedom of speech and end federal censorship ” in online forums. At first glance, this is a laudable endeavor; who would disagree with bolstering freedom of speech? On closer inspection, however, this order is unlikely to live up to its stated intent. On the contrary, there are three reasons to fear that it may, ironically, have adverse implications for free speech and for democracy.",

Tiger ( Panthera tigris ) recovery in India, the world’s most populated region, offers a distinct opportunity to evaluate the socio-ecological drivers of megafauna recovery. Tiger occupancy increased by 30% (at 2929 square kilometers per year) over the past two decades, leading to the largest global population occupying ~138,200 square kilometers. Tigers persistently occupied human-free, prey-rich protected areas (35,255 square kilometers) but also colonized proximal connected habitats that were shared with ~60 million people. Tiger absence and extinction were characterized by armed conflict, poverty, and extensive land-use changes. Sparing land for tigers enabled land sharing, provided that socioeconomic prosperity and political stability prevailed. India’s tiger recovery offers cautious optimism for megafauna recovery, particularly in the Global South.",

          "abstract": "Ice streams are major regulators of sea level change. However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power due to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations reveal a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, they appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude to those measured geodetically, thereby providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations.",

Insulin’s actions go beyond metabolic cells and also involve blood vessels, where insulin increases capillary blood flow and delivery of insulin and nutrients. We show that adrenomedullin, whose plasma levels are increased in obese humans and mice, inhibited insulin signaling in human endothelial cells through protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B–mediated dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. In obese mice lacking the endothelial adrenomedullin receptor, insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide–synthase activation and skeletal muscle perfusion were increased. Treating mice with adrenomedullin mimicked the effect of obesity and induced endothelial and systemic insulin resistance. Endothelial loss or blockade of the adrenomedullin receptor improved obesity-induced insulin resistance. These findings identify a mechanism underlying obesity-induced systemic insulin resistance and suggest approaches to treat obesity-associated type 2 diabetes.",

Spatial differences in soil moisture are perceived by root tips, leading to the patterning of new root branches toward available water in a process called hydropatterning.

Here, we developed an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and revealed substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection. Genetic analysis of hydropatterning confirmed the regulatory role of auxin and revealed that the gaseous hormone ethylene locally inhibits root branching from air-exposed tissues.

In this review, we show that at such a level of warming, the Arctic would be transformed beyond contemporary recognition: Virtually every day of the year would have air temperatures higher than preindustrial extremes, the Arctic Ocean would be essentially ice free for several months in summer, the area of Greenland that reaches melting temperatures for at least a month would roughly quadruple, and the area of permafrost would be roughly half of what it was in preindustrial times. These geophysical changes go along with widespread ecosystem disruptions and infrastructure damage, which, as we show here, could be substantially reduced by increased efforts to limit global warming.",

These symmetries often determine the system topology, which is made ever more complex with increased dimensionality. Quasicrystals have neither translational nor global rotational symmetry, yet they intrinsically inhabit a higher-dimensional space in which symmetry resurfaces. Here, we discovered topological charge vectors in four dimensions (4D) that govern the real-space topology of 2D quasicrystals and reveal their inherent conservation laws. We demonstrate control over the topology in pentagonal plasmonic quasilattices, mapped by both phase-resolved and time-domain near-field microscopy, showing that their temporal evolution continuously tunes the 2D projections of their distinct 4D topologies. Our work provides a route to experimentally probe the thermodynamic properties of quasicrystals and topological physics in 4D and above.",

ProtGPS successfully guided generation of novel protein sequences that selectively assemble in the nucleolus.

The density of mutations allowed mapping of putative essential domains within genes, providing a completely new level of genome annotation for any Plasmodium species. Although gene essentiality was largely conserved across P. knowlesi , Plasmodium falciparum , and rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei , a large number of shared genes are differentially essential, revealing species-specific adaptations.

These two archetypes also form on eukaryotic exogenous sequences, depend on sequence composition, and can be predicted using neural networks trained on the native genome.

Targeted deficiency throughout the mitochondrial quality control pathway, including genome integrity, dynamics, or turnover, impaired the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, activating the mitochondrial integrated stress response, eliciting chromatin remodeling, and promoting cellular immaturity rather than apoptosis to yield metabolic dysfunction. Indeed, pharmacologic blockade of the integrated stress response in vivo restored β-cell identity following loss of mitochondrial quality control.

          "abstract": "Measures to combat the parasites that cause malaria have become compromised because of reliance on a small arsenal of drugs and emerging drug resistance. We conducted a transposon mutagenesis screen in the primate malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi , producing the most complete classification of gene essentiality in any Plasmodium spp. to date, with the resolution to define truncatable genes. We found conservation in the druggable genome between Plasmodium spp. and divergences in mitochondrial metabolism. Perturbation analyses with the frontline antimalarial artemisinin revealed modulators that both increase and decrease drug susceptibility. Our findings aid prioritization of drug and vaccine targets for the Plasmodium vivax clade and reveal mechanisms of resistance that can inform therapeutic development.",

          "abstract": "Humpback whale song is a culturally transmitted behavior. Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law. These properties facilitate learning and may therefore arise because of their contribution to the faithful transmission of language over multiple cultural generations. If so, we would expect to find them in other culturally transmitted systems. In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.",

Animals can adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions, but the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We found that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning; instead, the learned behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over escape responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses.",

We elucidated a structural pathway of enzyme activation through cryo-EM analysis of PI3KC3-C1. The inactive conformation of the VPS15 pseudokinase stabilizes the inactive conformation, sequestering its N -myristate in the N-lobe of the pseudokinase. Upon activation, the myristate is liberated such that the VPS34 lipid kinase catalyzes PI3P production on membranes. The VPS15 pseudokinase domain binds tightly to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and stabilizes a web of interactions to autoinhibit the cytosolic complex and to promote the activation upon membrane binding. These findings show in atomistic detail how the VPS34 lipid kinase is activated in the context of a complete PI3K complex.",

This accomplishment was a precursor to an unprecedented burgeoning of large language models (LLMs) in the life sciences. That was just the beginning. In recent months, we have moved into a hyperaccelerated phase of new foundation models , pretrained on massive datasets, with the ability to perform a wide range of tasks that are helping us understand the structure, biology, evolution, and design of proteins, RNA, DNA, and ligands, as well as their biomolecular interactions. Unlike multimodal LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude, which process text, audio, and images, these large language of life models (LLLMs) are multiomic. That is to say, they are not only multimodal but pertain to different layers of molecular biology. For example, Evo , a foundation model trained on 2.7 million diverse phage and prokaryotic genomes (equivalent to about 300 billion DNA nucleotides), predicts the impact of variants in DNA, RNA, or proteins on structure and function, as well as how essential genes are to cell function, and can generate new DNA sequences.",

We describe a bacterial immune system comprising both a caspase-like protease and a TIR-domain protein. We found that the TIR protein, once it recognizes phage invasion, produces the previously unknown immune signaling molecule adenosine 5′-diphosphate-cyclo[N7:1′′]-ribose (N7-cADPR). This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease, which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation. Our study highlights the diversity of TIR-produced immune signaling molecules and demonstrates that cell death regulated by proteases of the caspase family is an ancient mechanism of innate immunity.",

The η-to-θ phase transition of alumina is unidirectional in bulk and retains the crystal lattice orientation. We report a rare example of a statistical kinetics study showing that for nanoparticles on a bulk Al(OH) 3 surface, this phase transition occurs nondeterministically through an ergodic equilibrium through the molten state, and the memory of the lattice orientation is lost in this process. The rate of the interconversion was found to be insensitive to the electron dose rate, and this process had a small Gibbs free energy of activation. These nondeterministic kinetics should be a key feature of crystal nucleation occurring in high-surface-energy regions of bulk crystals.",

We also demonstrate the co-capture of SV identity with single-cell transcriptomes, facilitating the measurement of SV impact on gene expression.

Recombinase induction produced more than 100 stochastic megabase-sized rearrangements in each cell. We tracked these rearrangements over time to measure selection pressures, finding a preference for shorter variants that avoided essential genes.

We used a continuous attractor model of neural activity to demonstrate that neuronal fatigue both generates replay sequences and produces self-avoidance over the observed timescales. In addition, replay of past experience became predominant later into the stopping period, in a manner requiring cortical input.

Scratching-induced inflammation required pain-sensing nociceptors, the neuropeptide substance P, and the mast cell receptor MrgprB2. Scratching also increased cutaneous inflammation and augmented host defense to superficial Staphylococcus aureus infection. Thus, through the activation of nociceptor-driven neuroinflammation, scratching both exacerbated allergic skin disease and provided protection from S. aureus , reconciling the seemingly paradoxical role of scratching as a pathological process and evolutionary adaptation.",

          "abstract": "The origins and prehistory of domestic sheep ( Ovis aries ) are incompletely understood; to address this, we generated data from 118 ancient genomes spanning 12,000 years sampled from across Eurasia. Genomes from Central Türkiye ~8000 BCE are genetically proximal to the domestic origins of sheep but do not fully explain the ancestry of later populations, suggesting a mosaic of wild ancestries. Genomic signatures indicate selection by ancient herders for pigmentation patterns, hornedness, and growth rate. Although the first European sheep flocks derive from Türkiye, in a notable parallel with ancient human genome discoveries, we detected a major influx of Western steppe–related ancestry in the Bronze Age.",

          "abstract": "Influenza virus pandemics and seasonal epidemics have claimed countless lives. Recurrent zoonotic spillovers of influenza viruses with pandemic potential underscore the need for effective countermeasures. In this study, we show that pre-exposure prophylaxis with broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) MEDI8852 is highly effective in protecting cynomolgus macaques from severe disease caused by aerosolized highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus infection. Protection was antibody dose–dependent yet independent of Fc-mediated effector functions at the dose tested. Macaques receiving MEDI8852 at 10 milligrams per kilogram or higher had negligible impairment of respiratory function after infection, whereas control animals were not protected from severe disease and fatality. Given the breadth of MEDI8852 and other bnAbs, we anticipate that protection from unforeseen pandemic influenza A viruses is achievable.",

          "abstract": "In the ancient microbial Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is fixed in a multistep process that ends with acetyl–coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthesis at the bifunctional carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex (CODH/ACS). In this work, we present structural snapshots of the CODH/ACS from the gas-converting acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum , characterizing the molecular choreography of the overall reaction, including electron transfer to the CODH for CO 2 reduction, methyl transfer from the corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CoFeSP) partner to the ACS active site, and acetyl-CoA production. Unlike CODH, the multidomain ACS undergoes large conformational changes to form an internal connection to the CODH active site, accommodate the CoFeSP for methyl transfer, and protect the reaction intermediates. Altogether, the structures allow us to draw a detailed reaction mechanism of this enzyme, which is crucial for CO 2 fixation in anaerobic organisms.",

Previous assessments of temperature-related mortality, however, lack a comprehensive analysis of distinct impacts of temperature change across different timescales and characteristics. Using a longitudinal survey of 27,233 elderly Chinese citizens from 2005 to 2018, we establish connections between rising temperatures, temperature variability, and extreme heat with increased mortality risk, assessed through four annual metrics that combine temperature and humidity. The intensity and prolonged duration of extreme heat are found to have the greatest impact on mortality risk. Furthermore, by identifying heterogeneous impacts based on location, sex, age, obesity, income, and diet, we reveal the pathways through which temperature metrics are likely to influence mortality risk. Our study highlights the compound effects of rising temperatures for elderly populations, and it could be expanded to other countries and regions experiencing similar challenges due to an aging population experiencing warming conditions.",

Although nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods such as t -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t -SNE) have been developed, their implementation in simple biological circuits remains unclear. Here, we develop a biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithm compatible with t -SNE, which uses a simple three-layer feedforward network mimicking the Drosophila olfactory circuit. The proposed learning rule, described as three-factor Hebbian plasticity, is effective for datasets such as entangled rings and MNIST, comparable to t -SNE. We further show that the algorithm could be working in olfactory circuits in Drosophila by analyzing the multiple experimental data in previous studies. We lastly suggest that the algorithm is also beneficial for association learning between inputs and rewards, allowing the generalization of these associations to other inputs not yet associated with rewards.",

This study investigated the role of lipid metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by assessing the contribution of LD-loaded brain macrophages, including microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs), in an AD mouse model. Particularly, BAMs and activated CD11c + microglia localized near β amyloid (Aβ) plaques exhibited a pronounced lipid-associated gene signature and a high LD load. Having observed that elevated intracellular LD content correlated inversely with microglial phagocytic activities, we subsequently inhibited LD formation specifically in CX3CR1 + brain macrophages using an inducible APP-KI/ Fit2 i Δ M φ transgenic mouse model. We demonstrated that reducing LD content in microglia and CX3CR1 + BAMs remarkably improved their phagocytic ability. Furthermore, lowering microglial LDs consistently enhanced their efferocytosis capacities and notably reduced Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma. Therefore, mitigating LD accumulation in brain macrophages provides perspectives for AD treatment.",

Here, we assessed the evidence for both laws in cetaceans by analyzing vocal sequences from 16 baleen and toothed whale species and comparing them to 51 human languages. Eleven whale species exhibit Menzerath’s law, sometimes with greater effect sizes than human speech. Two of the five whale species with categorized element types exhibit Zipf’s law of abbreviation. On average, whales also tend to shorten elements and intervals toward the end of sequences, although this varies by species.

A receptor-kinase signaling pathway for plant stomatal development shares components with the immunity pathway. The mechanism ensuring their signal specificities remains unclear. Using chemical genetics, here, we report the identification of a small molecule, kC9, that triggers excessive stomatal differentiation by inhibiting the canonical ERECTA pathway. kC9 binds to and inhibits the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK6, perturbing its substrate interaction. Notably, activation of immune signaling by a bacterial flagellin peptide nullified kC9’s effects on stomatal development. This cross-regulation depends on the immune receptor FLS2 (FLAGELLIN SENSING 2) and occurs even in the absence of kC9 if the ERECTA family receptor population becomes suboptimal. Proliferating stomatal lineage cells are vulnerable to this immune signal penetration. Our findings suggest that the signal specificity between development and immunity can be ensured by mitogen-activated protein kinase homeostasis, reflecting the availability of upstream receptors, thereby providing an unanticipated view on signal specificity.",

          "abstract": "Metamorphosis is an important way for insects to adapt to the environment. In this process, larval tissue destruction regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and adult tissue reconstruction regulated by insulin-like peptides (ILPs) occur simultaneously, but the detailed mechanism is still unclear. Here, the results of succinylome, subcellular localization, and protein interaction analysis show that non-succinylated insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) localizes in the cytoplasm, binds to insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2-like), and degrades it. When the metamorphosis is initiated, 20E up-regulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A ( Cpt1a ) through transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), thus increasing the level of IDE succinylation on K179. Succinylated IDE translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus, combined with ecdysone receptor to promote 20E signaling pathway, causing larval tissue destruction, while IGF-2-like was released to promote adult tissue proliferation. That is, succinylation alters subcellular localization of IDE so that it can bind to different target proteins and act as a hub of metamorphosis.",

          "abstract": "Nucleosomes at promoters of active genes are marked by specific histone post-translational modifications and histone variants. These features are thought to promote the formation and maintenance of an “open” chromatin environment that is suitable for transcription. However, recent reports have drawn conflicting conclusions about whether these histone modifications depend on active transcription. To further interrogate this relationship, we inhibited transcription initiation using triptolide, which triggered degradation of RNA polymerase II, and examined the impact on histone modifications. Transcription initiation was not required for either hormone-induced or steady-state active histone modifications at transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. Rather, blocking transcription initiation increased the levels of histone acetylation and H2AZ incorporation at active TSSs. P300 activity was dispensable for this effect, but inhibition of histone deacetylases masked the increased acetylation. Together, our results demonstrate that active histone modifications occur independently of transcription. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the process of transcription coordinates the removal of these modifications to limit gene activity.",

The BFMs comprise two bonding fabric chambers with embedded tubes, where the straightening of one chamber compels the other to buckle for the bistability of the structure and the switching of the tube kinking. Our BFMs can facilitate fast bending actuation (more than 1166° s −1 ), on/off and continuous pressure regulation, pneumatic logic computations, and autonomous oscillating actuation (up to 4.6 Hz).

The derived model suggests precise algorithmic roles for the columnar and laminar feed-forward, feedback, and lateral connections, the thalamic pathway, blobs and interblobs, and the innate lineage-specific interlaminar connectivity within cortical columns.

In low-CO 2 scenarios (1.5° and 2°C warming pathways), the suppressive effect of sulfate deposition on wetland methane emissions largely diminishes by 2100 due to clean air policies, with resulting emission increases (7 ± 2 Tg a −1 ) being 35 and 22% of total wetland emission changes.

Across all scenarios, biogeochemical feedbacks can stimulate 30 to 45% of future wetland emission rises. Under 1.5° and 2°C pathways, wetland methane emissions will likely increase by 20 to 34 Tg a −1 by 2100, representing 8 to 15% of the allowable space for anthropogenic methane emissions, a factor not yet considered by current assessments.",

          "abstract": "Breakthroughs in high-throughput sequencing and microscopic imaging technologies have revealed that chromatin structures vary considerably between cells of the same type. However, a thorough characterization of this heterogeneity remains elusive due to the labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of these experiments. To address these challenges, we introduce ChromoGen, a generative model based on state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques that efficiently predicts three-dimensional, single-cell chromatin conformations de novo with both region and cell type specificity. These generated conformations accurately reproduce experimental results at both the single-cell and population levels. Moreover, ChromoGen successfully transfers to cell types excluded from the training data using just DNA sequence and widely available DNase-seq data, thus providing access to chromatin structures in myriad cell types. These achievements come at a remarkably low computational cost. Therefore, ChromoGen enables the systematic investigation of single-cell chromatin organization, its heterogeneity, and its relationship to sequencing data, all while remaining economical.",

Furthermore, most systems have carrier mean free paths l mfp shorter than their spin moiré lattice constant a spin , inhibiting miniband formation. Here, we discover that the layered magnetic semimetal EuAg 4 Sb 2 overcomes these challenges by forming an interface with J ~ 100 milli–electron volts transferred between a Eu triangular lattice and anionic Ag 2 Sb bilayers hosting a two-dimensional electron band in the ballistic regime ( l mfp &gt;&gt; a spin ).

While previous studies have primarily focused on direct modulation of neuronal activity for post-stroke treatment, accumulating evidence suggests that astrocytes may play a critical role in post-stroke progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for recovery. In this study, we investigate the effects of selective modulation of astrocytic calcium signals on chronic stroke using OptoSTIM1, an optogenetic tool that activates endogenous calcium channels. In contrast to channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), OptoSTIM1 robustly elevates astrocytic calcium levels, sustaining the increase for over 10 min upon a single activation. The calcium elevation in astrocytes in the ipsilesional sensory-parietal cortex leads to remarkable recovery from post-stroke impairment. Thus, manipulating intracellular calcium levels in astrocytes holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for improving recovery following a stroke.",

Our study showcases the remarkable precision of x-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) in conducting an advanced three-dimensional examination of gut cellular composition and structure. The exploitation of micro- and nano-XPCT on various AD mouse models unveiled relevant alterations in villi and crypts, cellular transformations in Paneth and goblet cells, along with the detection of telocytes, neurons, erythrocytes, and mucus secretion by goblet cells within the gut cavity.

Here, we design a class of selectively fluorinated aromatic lithium salts (SFALS) as single conducting lithium salts to regulate the solvation structure and interfacial chemistry for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. By tuning the anionic structure, the Li + -polyether coupling is weakened, and the Li + -anion coordination is enhanced. The hydrogen bonding between the SFALS and polymer matrix induces a special “triad”-type solvation structure, which improves the electrolyte homogeneity and mechanical strength, and promotes the formation of an ultrathin and robust Li 2 O-rich solid electrolyte interphase. Therefore, the stable cycling of more than 1650 cycles (Coulombic efficiency, 99.8%) for LiFePO 4 /Li half cells and 580 cycles (97.4% capacity retention) for full cells is achieved. This molecular engineering strategy could inspire further advancements of functional lithium salts for practical application of all-solid-state lithium metal batteries.",

Through analysis of the shifts in free energy profiles within the nanomotors, our results unveil not only the heterogeneous energy release patterns of individual enzyme molecules but also the dynamic disorder of a particular enzyme in energy release over extended monitoring periods. By exploring six distinct types of single-molecule enzymatic reactions, we provide the direct evidence supporting the argument that the reaction enthalpy governs the enzymatic energy release.

Our theoretical results, compared with experimental observations, confirm that quantum interference effects persist to the multiple-partial-wave regime, leading to the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates. Using our model, we go beyond interference and identify a rich spectrum of Feshbach resonances at moderate magnetic fields with the Rb atom in its lower ( f = 1) hyperfine state, which persist at temperatures as high as 1 millikelvin. Future observation of these predicted resonances should allow precise control of the short-range dynamics in Sr + + Rb collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.",

Mechanistic models fit under a Bayesian framework, which enabled joint inference from serological and molecular data, showed that common vampire bats maintain BIV independently of the now assumed fruit bat reservoir through immune waning and seasonal transmission pulses.

          "abstract": "Trichome initiation and development is regulated by a diverse range of environmental signals. However, how leaf carbohydrate status determines the trichome initiation and development of systemic developing leaves remains unclear. Here, we found that a specific organ (such as a mature leaf) could function as a nutrient sensor, subsequently promoting or suppressing nonautonomous regulation of trichome initiation and development in response to alternations in nutrient levels. This physical phenomenon was regulated by a sucrose ⟶ ACS7 ⟶ ethylene ⟶ EIN3 ⟶ SUC4 ⟶ sucrose pathway in mature leaves, with a remote control of trichome production in newly developing leaves via a sucrose ⟶ ACS7 ⟶ ethylene ⟶ EIN3 ⟶ TTG1 pathway. These data provide insights into how mature leaves function as nutrient sensors that control trichome formation within distant developing leaves through a nutrient sensor–relay mechanism. Our findings uncover both a previously unidentified, nutrient sensing–regulatory mechanism and the cognate underpinning molecular architecture.",

Hybrid density functional approximations, which average exact exchange admixtures empirically, have achieved success but fall short of high-level quantum chemistry accuracy due to delocalization errors. We propose adaptive hybrid functionals, generating optimal exact exchange admixture ratios on the fly using data-efficient quantum machine learning models with negligible overhead. The adaptive Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof hybrid density functional (aPBE0) improves energetics, electron densities, and HOMO-LUMO gaps in QM9, QM7b, and GMTKN55 benchmark datasets. A model uncertainty-based constraint reduces the method smoothly to PBE0 in extrapolative regimes, ensuring general applicability with limited training. By tuning exact exchange fractions for different spin states, aPBE0 effectively addresses the spin gap problem in open-shell systems such as carbenes. We also present a revised QM9 (revQM9) dataset with more accurate quantum properties, including stronger covalent binding, larger bandgaps, more localized electron densities, and larger dipole moments.",

Thus, understanding the factors that promote UPEC intestinal colonization is of critical importance to designing therapeutics to reduce rUTI incidence. Although E. coli is found in high abundance in large intestine mucus, little is known about how it is able to maintain residence in this continuously secreted hydrogel. We discovered that the FimH adhesin of type 1 pili (T1P) bound throughout the secreted mucus layers of the colon and to epithelial cells in mouse and human samples. Disruption of T1P led to reduced association with colon mucus. Notably, this mutant up-regulated flagellar production and infiltrated the protective inner mucus layer of the colon.

Analysis of cod otoliths recovered during archaeological excavations of Icelandic fish processing sites revealed that cod in the 10th to 12th centuries were 25% larger and up to 300% older than modern, despite slower density-dependent growth rates attributed to the sixfold increase in abundance. Fishing mortality came to dominate a time-invariant natural mortality rate and other population characteristics after the 14th century, with minimal evidence of environmental effects at the century scale. Despite the absence of catch records and surveys, biological reference points based on pristine fish populations are now possible where otolith collections are available.",

Herein, we introduced an initiator-free cross-linkable monomer (2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) 5-(dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoate (FTA), which can chemically passivate defects and enable real-time fine regulation of crystallization. The resulting perovskite film exhibited higher crystallinity, enlarged grain size, and reduced dependence on the substrate. In addition, the cross-linked FTA [CL(FTA)] distributed along the grain boundaries effectively released the residual stress and securely bound the grains together. Consequently, the CL(FTA)-modified flexible PSCs achieved a record-breaking efficiency of 24.64% (certified 24.08%). Moreover, the scalable potential has been verified by the corresponding rigid and flexible modules, delivering impressive efficiencies of 19.53 and 17.13%, respectively.

We reveal that the dynamic process of phenyl ring rotations at low temperature is dominated by quantum rotation tunneling rather than the quasi-free rotation process. The emergent complexity of different intramolecular rotations in a single aromatic molecule is demonstrated, including the alternating unidirectional rotation with multi-, single-, and half-circle delays driven by inelastic electron tunneling, which has not been previously adequately considered at the macroscopic level.

We show that several NC and CC iron meteorite parent bodies (IMPBs) exhibit chondrite-like MVE abundances, indicating that “first-generation” inner Solar System planetesimals were remarkably MVE rich. Consistent with isotopic signatures of MVEs in Earth and Mars, these planetesimals made a substantial contribution to the MVE inventories of terrestrial planets. Variations in MVE abundances among IMPBs, particularly the two volatile-depleted NC and CC IMPBs (IVA and IVB), reflect secondary volatile loss after disruption of their parent bodies. Consequently, MVE depletion in terrestrial planets is more closely linked to the protracted history of MVE loss during planetesimal collisions rather than incomplete condensation or MVE loss during planetesimal differentiation.",

Seeding is a disease-relevant mechanism involving catalysis by fibrils, leading to the aggregation of proteins in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Chemotyping small molecules with varied backbone structures revealed determinants of aggregation inhibitors and catalysts. Among those identified were monoaminergic NTs. Dose titrations revealed bimodal effects indicative of fibril disaggregation, with aggregation catalysis occurring at low ratios of NTs and inhibited seeding ensuing at higher concentrations.

Field experiments, conducted 20 years apart, revealed that temporal shifts in shell thickness were driven by the evolution of increased trait means and erosion of thickness plasticity. The virtual elimination of the trade-off in tissue mass that often accompanies thicker shells is consistent with the evolution of fixed defenses under increasingly certain predation risk.",

Here, we investigate the influence of age, sex, and their interaction on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the brown anole ( Anolis sagrei ), a lizard with pronounced female-biased survival and longevity. We develop a series of age predictor models and find that, contrary to our predictions, rates of epigenetic aging were not slower in female lizards. However, methylation states at loci acquiring age-associated changes appear to be more “youthful” in young females, suggesting that female DNA methylomes are preemptively fortified in early life in opposition to the direction of age-related drift. Collectively, our findings provide insights into epigenetic aging in reptiles and suggest that early-life epigenetic profiles may be more informative than rates of change for predicting sex biases in longevity.",

Here, we reveal that Arabidopsis KNL1 regulates SAC silencing through the direct recruitment of type one protein phosphatase (TOPP) to kinetochores. We show that KNL1 interacts with all nine TOPPs via a conserved RVSF motif in its N terminus, and this interaction is required for the proper localization of TOPPs to kinetochores during mitosis. Disrupting KNL1-TOPP interaction leads to persistent SAC activation, resulting in a severe metaphase arrest and defects in plant growth and development. Our findings highlight the evolutionary conservation of KNL1 in coordinating kinetochore-localized phosphatase to ensure timely SAC silencing and faithful chromosome segregation in Arabidopsis .",

Chemo-optogenetically activating proprioceptors resulted in hyperalgesic priming that favored chronic pain induced by acidosis. In humans, intramuscular acidification induced acid perception but not pain.

These same human PARP proteins inhibit alphavirus replication in a manner that can be antagonized by the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of the virally encoded macrodomain. Last, we find that knockdown of any of the three CCCH zinc-finger domain containing PARPs, PARP7, PARP12, or the enzymatically inactive PARP13 (ZAP/ZC3HAV1), attenuates the antiviral effects of interferon-γ on alphavirus replication. Combined with evolutionary analyses, these data suggest that zinc-finger PARPs share an ancestral antiviral function that can be antagonized by the activity of viral macrodomains, indicative of an ongoing evolutionary conflict between host ADP-ribosylation and viruses.",

Even with modern computers, anything beyond the simplest turbulent flows is too chaotic and multiscaled to be directly simulatable. An alternative is to treat turbulence probabilistically, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Such PDFs are neither chaotic nor multiscale, yet remain challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here, we overcome the dimensionality problem by encoding turbulence PDFs as highly compressed “tensor networks” (TNs). This enables single CPU core simulations that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a 5 + 1 dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of O ( 10 6 ) and O ( 10 3 ) , respectively, compared to standard finite-difference algorithms. A future path is opened toward something heretofore thought infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that can usefully be described probabilistically.",

We herein report an unprecedented nanosonosensitizer of one-dimensional bamboo-like multisegmented manganese dioxide@manganese–bismuth vanadate (BMMBV) to boost multiple branches of immune responses targeting MHC-I–deficient tumors. BMMBV markedly augments sonodynamic activity contributed by manganese heteroatoms in the lattice of bismuth vanadate with narrowing bandgaps. Under sonoirradiation, BMMBV enhances tumor antigen spreading and emission of adjuvant signals, which potentiate dendritic cell maturation, thereby eliciting high aptitude of CTLs. This therapy substantially up-regulates MHC expression on tumor cells, which are reversely sensitive to CTLs. Alongside, extensive innate immune cells complement the cytolytic activity of CTLs for eliminating mouse urologic tumors. This study offers a reinforced strategy against antigen-loss immune-evasive tumor.",

Popular cavity ring-down spectroscopy can provide ultrahigh precision, below 0.01‰, but its accuracy is often worse than 5‰ due to inaccuracies in light intensity measurements. To eliminate this problem, we exploit optical frequency information carried by the ring-down cavity electromagnetic field. Instead of measuring only the decaying light intensity, we perform heterodyne detection of ring-downs followed by Fourier analysis to provide exact frequencies of optical cavity modes and a high-fidelity dispersive spectrum of a gas sample from them. We demonstrate the sub–per-mil accuracy of our method, confirmed by the best ab initio results for CO line intensity and for HD line shape, and the long-term repeatability of our dispersion measurements at 10 −4 level. We see potential for our approach in atmospheric remote sensing, isotope ratio metrology, thermometry, and establishment of primary gas standards.",

However, currently, inducing room-temperature nonequilibrium polariton condensation in perovskite microcavities requires optical pulsed excitations with high excitation densities. Here, we demonstrate continuous-wave optically pumped polariton condensation with an exceptionally low threshold of ~0.53 W cm −2 and a narrow linewidth of ~0.5 meV.

We also unveil the trapping potential landscape strategy to facilitate polariton relaxation and accumulation.

In this study, we find that both preclinical murine and clinically available human PD-L1 antibodies limit DC migration.

We analyzed 117 canid skulls, representing 40 domestic dog breeds and 18 wild subspecies, using geometric morphometric techniques and k -means clustering. Results show near-full overlap in kennel-club groups and with natural species, except for companion dogs having extreme snout shape.

Most existing approaches addressing this trade-off require controlled “labels,” i.e., metamaterials or contrast agents, to be deposited close to the objects and to either remain static or be tracked precisely during imaging. We propose a “blind-label” approach for acoustic subwavelength imaging. The blind labels are randomly distributed acoustic scatterers with deep-subwavelength sizes whose exact locations and trajectories are not necessary information in image reconstruction. The proposed method achieves the resolution of 0.24 wavelengths in ultrasound imaging experiments and 0.2 wavelengths in simulations, providing over 10 times improvement compared to the diffraction limit. We also elucidate the influence of scatterer size and concentration on imaging performance. The proposed “blind-label” approach relaxes the restrictions of existing acoustic subwavelength imaging technologies relying on controlled labels, therefore substantially improving the practicality of acoustic subwavelength imaging in biomedical ultrasound imaging, sonar, and nondestructive testing.",

We achieve robust and designable superconductivity in Pd-metalized twisted bilayer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe 2 ) and observe anomalous superconducting effects in high-quality junctions across ~20 moiré cells. Unexpectedly, the junction develops enhanced, instead of weakened, superconducting behaviors, exhibiting fluctuations to a higher critical magnetic field compared to its adjacent Pd 7 MoTe 2 superconductor. In addition, the critical current further exhibits a notable V-shaped minimum at zero magnetic field. These features are unexpected in conventional Josephson junctions and absent in junctions of natural bilayer MoTe 2 created using the same approach. We discuss implications of these observations, including the possible formation of mixed even- and odd-parity superconductivity at the moiré junctions.

Immunocompromised individuals from conditions such as primary immune disorders, HIV, or posttransplant immunosuppressive therapies are particularly vulnerable because of EBV’s transformative capability. EBV remodels B cell metabolism to support energy, biosynthetic precursors, and redox equivalents necessary for transformation. Most EBV-driven metabolic pathways center on mitochondria. However, how EBV regulates B cell mitochondrial function and metabolic fluxes remains unclear. Here, we show that EBV boosts cardiolipin (CL) biosynthesis, essential for mitochondrial cristae biogenesis, via EBV nuclear antigen 2/MYC-induced CL enzyme transactivation. Pharmacological and CRISPR genetic analyses underscore the essentiality of CL biosynthesis in EBV-transformed B cells. Metabolomic and isotopic tracing highlight CL’s role in sustaining respiration, one-carbon metabolism, and aspartate synthesis. Disrupting CL biosynthesis destabilizes mitochondrial matrix enzymes pivotal to these pathways. We demonstrate EBV-induced CL metabolism as a therapeutic target, offering synthetic lethal strategies against EBV-associated B cell malignancies.",

In systems from sheared glassy materials to buckling beams to crumpled sheets, this behavior is dominated by return-point memory, in which revisiting a past extremum of driving restores the system to a previous state. Cyclic driving with both positive and negative strains forms multiple nested memories, as in a single-dial combination lock, while asymmetric driving (only positive strain) cannot. We study this case in a general model of hysteresis that considers discrete elements called hysterons. We show how two hysterons with a frustrated interaction can violate return-point memory, realizing multiple memories of asymmetric driving. This reveals a general principle for designing systems that store sequences of cyclic driving, whether symmetric or asymmetric. In disordered systems, asymmetric driving is a sensitive tool for the direct measurement of frustration.",

We show that the inner edge of the habitable zone can now be mapped among exoplanets using their lack of surface water, which, unlike the presence of water, can be unambiguously revealed by atmospheric sulfur species. Using coupled climate-chemistry modeling, we find that the observability of sulfur gases on exoplanets depends critically on the ultraviolet (UV) flux of their host star, a property with wide variation: Most M-dwarfs have a low UV flux and thereby allow the detection of sulfur gases as a tracer of dry planetary surfaces; however, the UV flux of Trappist-1 may be too high for sulfur to disambiguate uninhabitable from habitable surfaces on any of its planets. We generalize this result to show how a population-level search for sulfur chemistry on M-dwarf planets can be used to empirically define the habitable zone in the near future.",

Analyzing 4264 individual bird captures over 27 years, we found that harsher Amazonian dry seasons significantly reduced apparent survival for 24 of 29 species, with longer-lived species being more strongly affected. Our model predicted that a 1°C increase in average dry season temperature would reduce the mean apparent survival of the understory bird community by 63%.

Subcutaneous transplantation of islets with R-VECs reversed hyperglycemia in diabetic mice, with high levels of human insulin detected within recipient serum and relapses of hyperglycemia following graft removal. Examination of retrieved grafts demonstrated that engrafted human islets were mainly vascularized by the cotransplanted R-VECs, which had anastomosed with the host microcirculation. Notably, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that R-VECs, when cocultured with islets, acquired islet EC-specific characteristics.

The existing whisker-like sensors cannot detect slip information effectively. To address this challenge, this study develops a multitasking electronic brush (e-brush) composed of bundle of whiskers powered by reservoir computing (RC). Four pressure sensors are integrated into the brush to monitor its motion, speed, force, slip, and target surface. These sensors can provide long-term, low-pressure detection as low as 50 pascals, allowing for the precise monitoring of brush movements. A RC algorithm is developed to extract multiple brush motion parameters, including the slip.

However, how SnRK2s are released under osmotic stress is unclear. Here, we outline how subgroup I SnRK2s sense molecular crowding to interrupt PP2C-mediated inhibition in plants. Severe hyperosmotic stress triggers condensate formation to activate the subgroup I SnRK2s, which requires their intrinsically disordered region. PP2Cs interact with and inhibit subgroup I SnRK2s, and this interaction is disrupted by phase separation of SnRK2s. The subgroup I SnRK2s are critical for severe osmotic stress responses.

This study investigates the anti-icing properties of polar bear fur. Here, we show that polar bear fur exhibits low ice adhesion strengths comparable to fluorocarbon-coated fibers, with the low ice adhesion a consequence of the fur sebum (hair grease). Lipid analyses reveal the presence of cholesterol, diacylglycerols, anteisomethyl-branched fatty acids, and the unexpected absence of squalene. Quantum chemical calculations predict low ice adsorption energies for identified lipids and high adsorption for squalene, suggesting that sebum composition is responsible for the observed anti-icing properties.

          "abstract": "Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is the foundation of quantum optics to test the degree of indistinguishability of two incoming photons, playing a key role in quantum communication, sensing, and photonic quantum computing. Realizing high-visibility HOM interference with massively parallel optical channels is challenging due to the lack of available natural optical references for aligning independent arrayed laser pairs. Here, we demonstrate 50 parallel comb-teeth pairs of continuous-wave weak coherent photons HOM interference using two independently frequency post-aligned soliton microcombs (SMCs), achieving an average fringe visibility over 46%. The frequencies of all comb-teeth pairs are long-term aligned by developing two sets of fully frequency-stabilized SMCs with independent reference and adjusting free spectral range beyond 100 kilohertz through perturbations in soliton state. The verification experiment proves the feasibility of constructing massively quantum information channels by co-opting classical wavelength division multiplexing optical communications, which paves the way for practical large-scale quantum communication systems.",

          "abstract": "Insect melanization triggered by the conversion of prophenoloxidase to active phenoloxidase via serine proteases (SPs) is an important immediate immune response. However, how phytoplasmas evade this immune response to promote their propagation in insect vectors remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that infection of leafhopper vectors with rice orange leaf phytoplasma (ROLP) activates the mild melanization response in hemolymph. ROLP-encoded effector protein SRP1 is highly expressed in leafhopper hemolymph, where it competitively binds to SP2, thereby inhibiting SP2-mediated cleavage of prophenoloxidase into active phenoloxidase. Consequently, microinjection of SRP1 effectively suppresses the melanization response and enhances ROLP propagation. The histidine residue at position 23 of SRP1 is essential for SRP1-SP2 interaction, and the mutation of this position abolishes its ability to inhibit such SP2-meidated cleavage, ultimately promoting melanization response and inhibiting ROLP propagation. Our findings provide insights into how phytoplasmas antagonize insect melanization response to facilitate their persistent transmission.",

          "abstract": "Coastal vertical land motion (VLM), including uplift and subsidence, can greatly alter relative sea level projections and flood mitigations plans. Yet, current projection frameworks, such as the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, often underestimate VLM by relying on regional linear estimates. Using high-resolution (90-meter) satellite data from 2015 to 2023, we provide local VLM estimates for California and assess their contribution to sea level rise both now and in future. Our findings reveal that regional estimates substantially understate sea level rise in parts of San Francisco and Los Angeles, projecting more than double the expected rise by 2050. Additionally, temporally variable (nonlinear) VLM, driven by factors such as hydrocarbon and groundwater extraction, can increase uncertainties in 2050 projections by up to 0.4 meters in certain areas of Los Angeles and San Diego. This study highlights the critical need to include local VLM and its uncertainties in sea level rise assessments to improve coastal management and ensure effective adaptation efforts.",

          "abstract": "Heteroarene skeletal editing is gaining popularity in synthetic chemistry. Transmuting single atoms generates molecules that have distinctly varied properties, thereby fostering potent molecular exchanges that can be extensively used to synthesize functional molecules. Herein, we present a convenient protocol for nitrogen-carbon single-atom transmutations in isoquinolines, which is inspired by the Wittig reaction and enables easy access to substituted naphthalene derivatives. The reaction uses an inexpensive and commercially available phosphonium ylide as the carbon source to furnish a wide range of substituted naphthalenes. The key to the success of this transformation is the formation of a triene intermediate through ring opening, which undergoes 6π-electrocyclization and elimination processes to afford the naphthalene product. Furthermore, this strategy enables the facile synthesis of 13 C-labeled naphthalenes using 13 CH 3 PPh 3 I as a commercial 13 C source and facilitates modifying the directing group for C─H functionalization.",

          "abstract": "Quantum simulators with hundreds of qubits and engineerable Hamiltonians have the potential to explore quantum many-body models that are intractable for classical computers. However, learning the simulated Hamiltonian, a prerequisite for any quantitative applications of a quantum simulator, remains an outstanding challenge due to the fast increasing time cost with the qubit number and the lack of high-fidelity universal gate operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we demonstrate the Hamiltonian learning of a two-dimensional ion trap quantum simulator with 300 qubits. We use global manipulations and single-qubit–resolved state detection to efficiently learn the all-to-all–coupled Ising model Hamiltonian, with the required quantum resources scaling at most linearly with the qubit number. We further demonstrate a physically guided learning scheme with the quantum sample complexity independent of system sizes by carefully fitting the anharmonic trap potential. Our work paves the way for wide applications of large-scale ion trap quantum simulators.",

          "abstract": "Ice core measurements reveal dipole-like snow accumulation trends over West Antarctica throughout the 20th century, with an increase of &gt;2000 billion metric tons over the Antarctic Peninsula and Ellsworth Land but a decrease of ~500 billion metric tons over Marie Byrd Land. Although atmospheric teleconnections were frequently revealed, linking variability between tropics and higher latitudes on interannual and decadal timescales, centennial-scale teleconnection is absent from literature. Here, using statistical analysis and numerical experiments, we reveal that changes of tropical oceans throughout the 20th century drive the long-term Antarctic snowfall trend. A pronounced warming over the tropical Atlantic and a moderate cooling over the equatorial Pacific have driven an adjustment of moisture transport and thus snowfall pattern in West Antarctica. Our study reveals a centennial tropical-polar teleconnection, producing long-term trends with opposing changes across the regions. Remote forcing from the tropics increased the mass accumulation over Antarctica, balanced rapid iceshelf thinning in recent decades, contributing to global sea-level changes.",

          "abstract": "Ketogenesis is a dynamic metabolic conduit supporting hepatic fat oxidation particularly when carbohydrates are in short supply. Ketone bodies may be recycled into anabolic substrates, but a physiological role for this process has not been identified. Here, we use mass spectrometry–based 13 C-isotope tracing and shotgun lipidomics to establish a link between hepatic ketogenesis and lipid anabolism. Unexpectedly, mouse liver and primary hepatocytes consumed ketone bodies to support fatty acid biosynthesis via both de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) elongation. While an acetoacetate intermediate was not absolutely required for ketone bodies to source DNL, PUFA elongation required activation of acetoacetate by cytosolic acetoacetyl–coenzyme A synthetase (AACS). Moreover, AACS deficiency diminished free and esterified PUFAs in hepatocytes, while ketogenic insufficiency depleted PUFAs and increased liver triacylglycerols. These findings suggest that hepatic ketogenesis influences PUFA metabolism, representing a molecular mechanism through which ketone bodies could influence systemic physiology and chronic diseases.",
