Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06410-z (2023).\n\nTo effectively conserve biodiversity, policymakers must know the extent to which protected areas (PAs) benefit biodiversity. By leveraging impressive datasets on three measures of biodiversity for Southeast Asia, Brodie et al.1 claim to have detected a positive impact of protection within PAs, and spillovers of these impacts into the wider landscape. We argue that their analyses do not provide strong evidence about the benefits of PAs for biodiversity because their design cannot eliminate the most likely rival explanations for the patterns observed in the data, and their interpretations of the two tests for spillovers are flawed. Our concerns have important implications for balancing the trade-offs between investing in more PAs and managing the existing network better, as well as for the better use of causal inference methods in conservation science.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic flux, or the rate of metabolic reactions, is one of the most fundamental metrics describing the status of metabolism in living organisms. However, measuring fluxes across the entire metabolic network remains nearly impossible, especially in multicellular organisms. Computational methods based on flux balance analysis have been used with genome-scale metabolic network models to predict network-level flux wiring1,2,3,4,5,6. However, such approaches have limited power because of the lack of experimental constraints. Here, we introduce a strategy that infers whole-animal metabolic flux wiring from transcriptional phenotypes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using a large-scale Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS) dataset for roughly 900 metabolic genes7, we show that the transcriptional response to metabolic gene perturbations can be integrated with the metabolic network model to infer a highly constrained, semi-quantitative flux distribution. We discover several features of adult C. elegans metabolism, including cyclic flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, lack of de novo purine synthesis flux and the primary use of amino acids and bacterial RNA as a tricarboxylic acid cycle carbon source, all of which we validate by stable isotope tracing. Our strategy for inferring metabolic wiring based on transcriptional phenotypes should be applicable to a variety of systems, including human cells.",

          "abstract": "For nearly 450 million years, mycorrhizal fungi have constructed networks to collect and trade nutrient resources with plant roots 1,2 . Owing to their dependence on host-derived carbon, these fungi face conflicting trade-offs in building networks that balance construction costs against geographical coverage and long-distance resource transport to and from roots 3 . How they navigate these design challenges is unclear 4 . Here, to monitor the construction of living trade networks, we built a custom-designed robot for high-throughput time-lapse imaging that could track over 500,000 fungal nodes simultaneously. We then measured around 100,000 cytoplasmic flow trajectories inside the networks. We found that mycorrhizal fungi build networks as self-regulating travelling waves—pulses of growing tips pull an expanding wave of nutrient-absorbing mycelium, the density of which is self-regulated by fusion. This design offers a solution to conflicting trade demands because relatively small carbon investments fuel fungal range expansions beyond nutrient-depletion zones, fostering exploration for plant partners and nutrients. Over time, networks maintained highly constant transport efficiencies back to roots, while simultaneously adding loops that shorten paths to potential new trade partners. Fungi further enhance transport flux by both widening hyphal tubes and driving faster flows along ‘trunk routes’ of the network 5 . Our findings provide evidence that symbiotic fungi control network-level structure and flows to meet trade demands, and illuminate the design principles of a symbiotic supply-chain network shaped by millions of years of natural selection.",

          "abstract": "In advanced applications such as aerospace and space exploration, materials must balance lightness, functionality and extreme thermal fluctuation resistance 1,2 . Shape-memory alloys show promise with strength, toughness and substantial strain recovery due to superelasticity, but maintaining low mass and effective operation at cryogenic temperatures is challenging 3–6 . We hereby introduce a new shape-memory alloy that adheres to these stringent criteria. Predominantly composed of Ti and Al with a chemical composition of Ti 75.25 Al 20 Cr 4.75 , this alloy is characterized by a low density (4.36 × 10 3 kg m − 3 ) and a high specific strength (185 × 10 3 Pa m 3 per kg) at room temperature, while showing excellent superelasticity. The superelasticity, owing to a reversible stress-induced phase transformation from an ordered body-centred cubic parent phase to an ordered orthorhombic martensite, allows for a recoverable strain exceeding 7%. This functionality persists across a broad range of temperatures, from deep cryogenic 4.2 K to above room temperature, arising from an unconventional temperature dependence of transformation stresses. Below a certain threshold during cooling, the critical transformation stress inversely correlates with temperature. We interpret this behaviour from the perspective of a temperature-dependent anomalous lattice instability of the parent phase. This alloy holds potential in everyday appliances requiring flexible strain accommodation, as well as components designed for extreme environmental conditions such as deep space and liquefied gases.",

A total of 141 new associations were identified, including five for which independent disease–gene evidence was recently published. Following in silico triaging and clinical expert review, 69 associations were prioritized, of which 30 could be linked to existing experimental evidence. The five associations with strongest overall genetic and experimental evidence were monogenic diabetes with the known β cell regulator 3,4 UNC13A , schizophrenia with GPR17 , epilepsy with RBFOX3 , Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease with ARPC3 and anterior segment ocular abnormalities with POMK .

          "abstract": "Despite advancements in wearable technologies1,2, barriers remain in achieving distributed computation located persistently on the human body. Here a textile fibre computer that monolithically combines analogue sensing, digital memory, processing and communication in a mass of less than 5 g is presented. Enabled by a foldable interposer, the two-dimensional pad architectures of microdevices were mapped to three-dimensional cylindrical layouts conforming to fibre geometry. Through connection with helical copper microwires, eight microdevices were thermally drawn into a machine-washable elastic fibre capable of more than 60% stretch. This programmable fibre, which incorporates a 32-bit floating-point microcontroller, independently performs edge computing tasks even when braided, woven, knitted or seam-sewn into garments. The universality of the assembly process allows for the integration of additional functions with simple modifications, including a rechargeable fibre power source that operates the computer for nearly 6 h. Finally, we surmount the perennial limitation of rigid interconnects by implementing two wireless communication schemes involving woven optical links and seam-inserted radio-frequency communications. To demonstrate its utility, we show that garments equipped with four fibre computers, one per limb, operating individually trained neural networks achieve, on average, 67% accuracy in classifying physical activity. However, when networked, inference accuracy increases to 95% using simple weighted voting.",

          "abstract": "The search for simple principles that underlie the spatial structure and dynamics of plant communities is a long-standing challenge in ecology1,2,3,4,5,6. In particular, the relationship between species coexistence and the spatial distribution of plants is challenging to resolve in species-rich communities7,8,9. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the spatial patterns of 720 tree species in 21 large forest plots and their consequences for species coexistence. We show that species with low abundance tend to be more spatially aggregated than more abundant species. Moreover, there is a latitudinal gradient in the strength of this negative aggregation–abundance relationship that increases from tropical to temperate forests. We suggest, in line with recent work10, that latitudinal gradients in animal seed dispersal11 and mycorrhizal associations12,13,14 may jointly generate this pattern. By integrating the observed spatial patterns into population models8, we derive the conditions under which species can invade from low abundance in terms of spatial patterns, demography, niche overlap and immigration. Evaluation of the spatial-invasion condition for the 720 tree species analysed suggests that temperate and tropical forests both meet the invasion criterion to a similar extent but through contrasting strategies conditioned by their spatial patterns. Our approach opens up new avenues for the integration of observed spatial patterns into ecological theory and underscores the need to understand the interaction among spatial patterns at the neighbourhood scale and multiple ecological processes in greater detail.",

          "abstract": "Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a time-sensitive emergency that requires prompt identification and intervention: sudden, unwitnessed cardiac arrest is nearly unsurvivable1–3. A cardinal sign of cardiac arrest is sudden loss of pulse4. Automated biosensor detection of unwitnessed cardiac arrest, and dispatch of medical assistance, may improve survivability given the significant prognostic role of time3,5, but only if the false positive burden on public emergency medical systems is minimized5–7. Here we show that a multimodal, machine learning-based algorithm on a smartwatch can reach performance thresholds making it deployable at societal scale. First, using photoplethysmography (PPG), we show that wearable PPG measurements of peripheral pulselessness (induced via an arterial occlusion model) manifest similarly to pulselessness caused by a common cardiac arrest arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation (VF). Based on the similarity of the PPG signal (from VF or arterial occlusion), we developed and validated a loss of pulse detection algorithm using data from peripheral pulselessness and free-living conditions. Once developed, we evaluated the end-to-end algorithm prospectively: there was 1 unintentional emergency call per 21.67 user-years across two prospective studies; the sensitivity was 67.23% (95% confidence interval, 64.32%–70.05%) in a prospective arterial occlusion cardiac arrest simulation model. These results suggest a new opportunity, deployable at scale, for wearable-based detection of sudden loss of pulse while minimizing societal costs of excess false detections7.",

It is predominantly regulated by the glucagon receptor family which is highly conserved in vertebrates1–4. Compared to other vertebrates, avian blood glucose levels are relatively high5,6, yet its regulatory mechanisms have remained obscure for more than a century. We show that high hepatic expression of the avian glucagon receptor (GCGR) in association with constitutively active Gs signaling was dependent upon the interaction of different domains. In vivo experiments focusing on the regulation of constitutively active GCGR expression in hepatic cells led to correspondingly high blood glucose, rapid hepatic lipid utilization and high metabolic rates via downstream signaling pathway activation in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Furthermore, we identified a point mutation in chicken at the proximal gene region that resulted in GCGR mRNA reduction and weight increase. Overexpressing a natural human GCGR mutation (hsGCGRH339R) with modest constitutive activity in mice, demonstrated that high level expression of this variant augmented high blood glucose, while reducing body weight. The combination of high expression and constitutive activity of the glucagon receptor may have contributed to the evolution of flight in the ancestors of birds.",

Despite the critical role of phagocytosis during bacterial infection, the fate of phagocytosed microbial cargo and its impact on the host cell are poorly understood. In this study, we show that ingested bacteria constitute an alternative nutrient source that skews immunometabolic host responses. By tracing stable isotope-labelled bacteria, we found that phagolysosomal degradation of bacteria provides carbon atoms and amino acids that are recycled into various metabolic pathways, including glutathione and itaconate biosynthesis, and satisfies the bioenergetic needs of macrophages. Metabolic recycling of microbially derived nutrients is regulated by the nutrient-sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex C1 and is intricately tied to microbial viability. Dead bacteria, as opposed to live bacteria, are enriched in cyclic adenosine monophosphate, sustain the cellular adenosine monophosphate pool and subsequently activate adenosine monophosphate protein kinase to inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex C1. Consequently, killed bacteria strongly fuel metabolic recycling and support macrophage survival but elicit decreased reactive oxygen species production and reduced interleukin-1β secretion compared to viable bacteria. These results provide a new insight into the fate of engulfed microorganisms and highlight a microbial viability-associated metabolite that triggers host metabolic and immune responses. Our findings hold promise for shaping immunometabolic intervention for various immune-related pathologies.",

Furthermore, we use catchment climatological data to demonstrate that comparing streamflow timing between low- and high-snow-fraction years, as used by Han et al.4, is a misleading way to study the effects of climate-warming-induced snow changes and subsequent streamflow seasonality.",

Here we report a clear association between late Middle Pleistocene material culture and a wet tropical forest in southern Côte d’Ivoire, a region of present-day rainforest. Twinned optically stimulated luminescence and electron spin resonance dating methods constrain the onset of human occupations at Bété I to around 150 ka, linking them with Homo sapiens . Plant wax biomarker, stable isotope, phytolith and pollen analyses of associated sediments all point to a wet forest environment. The results represent the oldest yet known clear association between humans and this habitat type. The secure attribution of stone tool assemblages with the wet forest environment demonstrates that Africa’s forests were not a major ecological barrier for H. sapiens as early as around 150 ka.",

          "abstract": "Hofstadter’s butterfly, the predicted energy spectrum for non-interacting electrons confined to a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, is one of the most remarkable fractal structures in nature1. At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unit cell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levels that reflect its recursive construction. For most materials, Hofstadter’s butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions that are unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields1,2,3. More recently, electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter’s butterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large lattice constants4,5,6, such as those with moiré superlattices7,8,9,10. Yet, so far, direct spectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadter nearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to investigate the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the predicted second magic angle11,12, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studies of Hofstadter’s spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flat moiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimental signatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, our measurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electron density, showing phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter’s original model owing to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulomb interactions and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in TBG.",

Here we systematically investigate these phenotypes by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility, spatial transcriptomics and glioma organoid explant systems. We discovered four immunomodulatory expression programs: microglial inflammatory and scavenger immunosuppressive programs, which are both unique to primary brain tumours, and systemic inflammatory and complement immunosuppressive programs, which are also expressed by non-brain tumours. The programs are not contingent on myeloid cell type, developmental origin or tumour mutational state, but instead are driven by microenvironmental cues, including tumour hypoxia, interleukin-1β, TGFβ and standard-of-care dexamethasone treatment. Their relative expression can predict immunotherapy response and overall survival. By associating the respective programs with mediating genomic elements, transcription factors and signalling pathways, we uncover strategies for manipulating myeloid-cell phenotypes. Our study provides a framework to understand immunomodulation by myeloid cells in glioma and a foundation for the development of more-effective immunotherapies.",

Solid-state platforms15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 provide a valuable resource for multiplexed quantum networking in which multiple spectrally distinguishable qubits can be hosted in nano-scale volumes. Here we harness this resource by implementing a two-node network consisting of several rare-earth ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities25,26,27,28,29,30,31. This is accomplished with a protocol that entangles distinguishable 171Yb ions through frequency-erasing photon detection combined with real-time quantum feedforward. This method is robust to slow optical frequency fluctuations occurring on timescales longer than a single entanglement attempt: a universal challenge amongst solid-state emitters. We demonstrate the enhanced functionality of these multi-emitter nodes in two ways. First, we mitigate the bottlenecks to the entanglement distribution rate through multiplexed entanglement of two remote ion pairs32,33. Second, we prepare multipartite W-states comprising three distinguishable ions as a resource for advanced quantum networking protocols34,35.

          "abstract": "Revealing the connectivity of functionally identified individual neurons is necessary to understand how activity patterns emerge and support behaviour. Yet the brain-wide presynaptic wiring rules that lay the foundation for the functional selectivity of individual neurons remain largely unexplored. Cortical neurons, even in primary sensory cortex, are heterogeneous in their selectivity, not only to sensory stimuli but also to multiple aspects of behaviour. Here, to investigate presynaptic connectivity rules underlying the selectivity of pyramidal neurons to behavioural state 1–10 in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we used two-photon calcium imaging, neuropharmacology, single-cell-based monosynaptic input tracing and optogenetics. We show that behavioural state-dependent activity patterns are stable over time. These are minimally affected by direct neuromodulatory inputs and are driven primarily by glutamatergic inputs. Analysis of brain-wide presynaptic networks of individual neurons with distinct behavioural state-dependent activity profiles revealed that although behavioural state-related and behavioural state-unrelated neurons shared a similar pattern of local inputs within S1, their long-range glutamatergic inputs differed. Individual cortical neurons, irrespective of their functional properties, received converging inputs from the main S1-projecting areas. Yet neurons that tracked behavioural state received a smaller proportion of motor cortical inputs and a larger proportion of thalamic inputs. Optogenetic suppression of thalamic inputs reduced behavioural state-dependent activity in S1, but this activity was not externally driven. Our results reveal distinct long-range glutamatergic inputs as a substrate for preconfigured network dynamics associated with behavioural state.",

However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain with wide variation across climate models 1,3,4 and some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse 5 . Here we show that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings across 34 climate models. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC in all cases, preventing its complete collapse. As Southern Ocean upwelling must be balanced by downwelling in the Atlantic or Pacific, the AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops. Remarkably, a PMOC does emerge in almost all models, but it is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century. Our findings reveal AMOC-stabilizing mechanisms with implications for past and future AMOC changes, and hence for ecosystems and ocean biogeochemistry. They suggest that better understanding and estimates of the Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations are urgently needed to accurately predict future AMOC change.",

Here we constructed a kilowatt-scale elastocaloric cooling device using compressive tubular NiTi in an ‘SMAs in series–fluid in parallel’ architecture, referred to as the multi-cell architecture. A large specific cooling power of 12.3 W g−1 was achieved by the large surface-area-to-volume ratio of thin-walled tubular NiTi at high-frequency operation (3.5 Hz), complemented by graphene nanofluid as an efficient heat transfer agent. Furthermore, the multi-cell architecture ensures a sufficient elastocaloric mass for tight assembly while maintaining a low system fluid pressure. Our device achieves a cooling power of 1,284 W on the fluid side at zero temperature lift during the initial 500,000 cycles, demonstrating the potential of this green cooling technology for a decarbonized future5,6.",

The north polar cap of Mars is the only millions-of-years-old surface feature that can induce measurable surface deformation on this planet, thereby holding clues to its present-day internal viscosity structure 5,6 . Here we investigate the emplacement of this ice cap by combining thermal evolution models 7 , viscoelastic deformation calculations 8 and radar observations 6 . We show that downward motion of the northern regions is ongoing and can be constrained by analyses of the time-variable gravity field 9 and NASA’s InSight seismic moment rate 10 . Only models with present-day high viscosities (2–6 × 10 22 Pa s for depths greater than 500 km), strong mantle depletion in radiogenic elements (more than 90%) and thick average crusts (thicker than 40 km) are consistent with the negligible flexure beneath the polar cap seen by radars. The northern lithosphere must deform at less than 0.13 mm per year and have a seismic efficiency less than 0.3 to satisfy gravity and seismic constraints, respectively. Our models show that the north polar cap formed over the last 1.7–12.0 Myr and that glacial isostatic adjustment can be further constrained by future gravity recovery missions to Mars 11,12 .",

Recently, the interaction of chiral objects with spin currents has attracted enormous attention from both scientific and technological perspectives 3–5 . Of particular interest is the current-driven motion of chiral topological excitations such as chiral magnetic domain walls in chiral three-dimensional magnetic structures that could allow for high-density memory-storage devices. Here we use state-of-the-art multiphoton lithography 6,7 to create three-dimensional chiral magnetic ribbons and perform current-induced motion of chiral domain walls. The ribbons are designed to have a clockwise or anticlockwise chiral twist with a variable magnitude. We find that domain walls can either pass through the ribbon or are impeded, depending on their chirality and configuration and the geometrical chiral twist of the ribbon. The interplay between the magnetic exchange energy and the geometrical twist generates a torsional field that favours chiral Bloch-type walls rather than the Néel-type wall favoured by the intrinsic magnetic properties of the magnetic ribbon itself. Furthermore, the interplay of spin chirality and chiral twist results in a non-reciprocal domain wall motion, namely, a domain wall filter or diode 8–10 . Our findings show how the interplay between geometrical and spin chiralities can lead to new functionalities that could allow for innovative chiral spintronics.",

The brain endothelial glycocalyx layer, a carbohydrate-rich meshwork composed primarily of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycolipids that coats the BBB lumen, is a key structural component of the BBB3,4. This layer forms the first interface between the blood and brain vasculature, yet little is known about its composition and roles in supporting BBB function in homeostatic and diseased states. Here we find that the brain endothelial glycocalyx is highly dysregulated during ageing and neurodegenerative disease. We identify significant perturbation in an underexplored class of densely O-glycosylated proteins known as mucin-domain glycoproteins. We demonstrate that ageing- and disease-associated aberrations in brain endothelial mucin-domain glycoproteins lead to dysregulated BBB function and, in severe cases, brain haemorrhaging in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that we can improve BBB function and reduce neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in aged mice by restoring core 1 mucin-type O-glycans to the brain endothelium using adeno-associated viruses. Cumulatively, our findings provide a detailed compositional and structural mapping of the ageing brain endothelial glycocalyx layer and reveal important consequences of ageing- and disease-associated glycocalyx dysregulation on BBB integrity and brain health.",

Here we elucidate the cis-regulatory functions of HARs in human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-induced excitatory neurons. Using genomic4 and chromatin looping information, we prioritized 20 HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues for functional characterization via single-cell CRISPR interference, and demonstrated their species-specific gene regulatory functions. Our findings reveal diverse functional outcomes of HAR-mediated cis-regulation in human neurons, including attenuated NPAS3 expression by altering the binding affinities of multiple transcription factors in HAR202 and maintaining iPS cell pluripotency and neuronal differentiation capacities through the upregulation of PUM2 by 2xHAR.319. Finally, we used prime editing to demonstrate differential enhancer activity caused by several HAR26;2xHAR.178 variants. In particular, we link one variant in HAR26;2xHAR.178 to elevated SOCS2 expression and increased neurite outgrowth in human neurons.

In this study, we assessed social responses in several mouse strains, among which FVB/NJ mice emerged as highly, and C57BL/6J mice as moderately, sensitive to social isolation. Using both strains, we uncovered two previously uncharacterized neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus that are activated during either social isolation or social rebound and orchestrate the behaviour display of social need and social satiety, respectively. We identified direct connectivity between these two populations and with brain areas associated with social behaviour, emotional state, reward and physiological needs and showed that mice require touch to assess the presence of others and fulfil their social need. These data show a brain-wide neural system underlying social homeostasis and provide significant mechanistic insights into the nature and function of circuits controlling instinctive social need and for the understanding of healthy and diseased brain states associated with social context.",

Mapping single-cell epigenomic profiles of core histone modifications that cover each individual cell is a fundamental goal in developmental biology. Here we develop target chromatin indexing and tagmentation (TACIT), a method that enabled genome-coverage single-cell profiling of seven histone modifications across mouse early embryos. We integrated these single-cell histone modifications with single-cell RNA sequencing data to chart a single-cell resolution epigenetic landscape. Multimodal chromatin-state annotations showed that the onset of zygotic genome activation at the early two-cell stage already primes heterogeneities in totipotency. We used machine learning to identify totipotency gene regulatory networks, including stage-specific transposable elements and putative transcription factors. CRISPR activation of a combination of these identified transcription factors induced totipotency activation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together with single-cell co-profiles of multiple histone modifications, we developed a model that predicts the earliest cell branching towards the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm in latent multimodal space and identifies regulatory elements and previously unknown lineage-specifying transcription factors. Our work provides insights into single-cell epigenetic reprogramming, multimodal regulation of cellular lineages and cell-fate priming during mouse pre-implantation development.",

This methodology allows flat optical devices to encode spatial information or even extra topological charge in real space while preserving the topology of bound states in the continuum in momentum space with inherent alignment. Here, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the simultaneous and independent generation of a real-space broadband vortex or a holographic image alongside resonant momentum-space vortex beams with a narrow bandwidth, which cannot be achieved with conventional methods. Such engineered disorder contributes to vast intrinsic freedoms without adding extra dimensions or compromising the optical flatness13,14. Our findings of real–momentum duality not only lay the foundation for disorder engineering in topological photonics but also open new avenues for optical wavefront shaping, encryption and communications.",

Artificial atoms mimic real atoms by demonstrating discrete energy levels attributable to quantum confinement3,4,5,6,7,8. As such, they offer a solid-state analogue for simulating intra-atomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation. Signatures of interatomic bond formation have been extensively observed in various artificial atoms9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. However, direct evidence of the intra-atomic orbital hybridization in the artificial atoms remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Here we realize the orbital hybridization in artificial atoms by altering the shape of the artificial atoms. The anisotropy of the confining potential gives rise to the hybridization between quasibound states with different orbital quantum numbers within the artificial atom. These hybridized orbits are directly visualized in real space in our experiment and are well reproduced by both numerical calculations and analytical derivations. Our study opens an avenue for designing artificial matter that cannot be accessed on real atoms through experiments. Moreover, the results obtained inspire the progressive control of quantum states in diverse systems.",

          "abstract": "The virus particles of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are released in an immature, non-infectious form. Proteolytic cleavage of the main structural polyprotein Gag into functional domains induces rearrangement into mature, infectious virions. In immature virus particles, the Gag membrane-binding domain, MA, forms a hexameric protein lattice that undergoes structural transition, following cleavage, into a distinct, mature MA lattice 1 . The mechanism of MA lattice maturation is unknown. Here we show that released spacer peptide 2 (SP2), a conserved peptide of unknown function situated about 300 residues downstream of MA, binds MA to induce structural maturation. By high-resolution in-virus structure determination of MA, we show that MA does not bind lipid into a side pocket as previously thought 1 , but instead binds SP2 as an integral part of the protein–protein interfaces that stabilize the mature lattice. Analysis of Gag cleavage site mutants showed that SP2 release is required for MA maturation, and we demonstrate that SP2 is sufficient to induce maturation of purified MA on lipid monolayers in vitro. SP2-triggered MA maturation correlated with faster fusion of virus with target cells. Our results reveal a new, unexpected interaction between two HIV-1 components, provide a high-resolution structure of mature MA, establish the trigger of MA structural maturation and assign function to the SP2 peptide.",

          "abstract": "A comprehensive, computable representation of the functional repertoire of all macromolecules encoded within the human genome is a foundational resource for biology and biomedical research. The Gene Ontology Consortium has been working towards this goal by generating a structured body of information about gene functions, which now includes experimental findings reported in more than 175,000 publications for human genes and genes in experimentally tractable model organisms 1,2 . Here, we describe the results of a large, international effort to integrate all of these findings to create a representation of human gene functions that is as complete and accurate as possible. Specifically, we apply an expert-curated, explicit evolutionary modelling approach to all human protein-coding genes. This approach integrates available experimental information across families of related genes into models that reconstruct the gain and loss of functional characteristics over evolutionary time. The models and the resulting set of 68,667 integrated gene functions cover approximately 82% of human protein-coding genes. The functional repertoire reveals a marked preponderance of molecular regulatory functions, and the models provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human gene functions. We show that our set of descriptions of functions can improve the widely used genomic technique of Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. The experimental evidence for each functional characteristic is recorded, thereby enabling the scientific community to help review and improve the resource, which we have made publicly available.",

Although the ability to produce new traits can vary between clades and may drive ecological transitions6,7,8,9, the impact of differences in the pace at which innovations evolve at macroevolutionary scales has been overlooked. Complex teeth are one innovation that contributed to the evolutionary success of major vertebrate lineages10,11,12. Here we show that evolutionary lability of tooth complexity, but not complexity itself, spurs rapid diversification across ray-finned fishes. Speciation rates are five times higher when transitions between simple and complex teeth occur rapidly. We find that African cichlids are unique among all fishes; they are dominated by lineages that transition between simple and complex teeth at unparalleled rates. This innovation interacted with the ecological versatility of complex teeth to spur rapid adaptive radiations in lakes Malawi, Victoria and Barombi Mbo. The marked effect on diversification stems from the tight association of tooth complexity with microhabitat and diet. Our results show that phylogenetic variation in how innovations evolve can have a stronger effect on patterns of diversification than the innovation itself. Investigating the impact of innovations from this new perspective will probably implicate more traits in causing heterogeneous diversification rates across the tree of life.",

Although many examples of transcriptional metabolic rewiring have been reported4, a systems-level study of how metabolism is rewired in response to metabolic perturbations is lacking in any animal. Here we apply Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS)—a high-throughput method combining whole-animal RNA-interference and RNA-sequencing5—to around 900 metabolic genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We derive a metabolic gene regulatory network (mGRN) in which 385 perturbations are connected to 9,414 genes by more than 110,000 interactions. The mGRN has a highly modular structure in which 22 perturbation clusters connect to 44 gene expression programs. The mGRN reveals different modes of transcriptional rewiring from simple reaction and pathway compensation to rerouting and more complex network coordination. Using metabolic network modelling, we identify a design principle of transcriptional rewiring that we name the compensation–repression (CR) model. The CR model explains most transcriptional responses in metabolic genes and reveals a high level of compensation and repression in five core metabolic functions related to energy and biomass. We provide preliminary evidence that the CR model may also explain transcriptional metabolic rewiring in human cells.",

Here we investigate the genomic epidemiology of the emerging, multidrug-resistant human fungal pathogen Candida auris in a ventilator-capable nursing home. Coupling strain-resolved metagenomics with isolate sequencing, we report skin colonization and clonal spread of C. auris on the skin of nursing home residents and throughout a metropolitan region.

Integrating microbiome and clinical microbiology data, we detect carbapenemase genes at multiple skin sites on residents identified as carriers of these genes. We analyse publicly available shotgun metagenomic samples (stool and skin) collected from residents with varying medical conditions living in seven other nursing homes and provide additional evidence of previously unappreciated bacterial strain sharing.

          "abstract": "To solve problems of practical importance1,2, quantum computers probably need to incorporate quantum error correction, in which a logical qubit is redundantly encoded in many noisy physical qubits3,4,5. The large physical-qubit overhead associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. Here, using a superconducting quantum circuit19, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance d = 5 (ref. 10). A stabilizing circuit passively protects cat qubits against bit flips20,21,22,23,24. The repetition code, using ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement, corrects cat qubit phase flips. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below the threshold. The logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat qubit mean photon number, enabled by our realization of a cat-transmon noise-biased CX gate. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average 1.75(2)% for the distance-3 code sections, and 1.65(3)% for the distance-5 code. Despite the increased number of fault locations of the distance-5 code, the high degree of noise bias preserved during error correction enables comparable performance. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings enables us to use a hardware-efficient outer error-correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes can be a compelling model for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian genomes are folded through the distinct actions of structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complexes, which include the chromatin loop-extruding cohesin (extrusive cohesin), the sister chromatid cohesive cohesin and the mitotic chromosome-associated condensins1,2,3. Although these complexes function at different stages of the cell cycle, they exist together on chromatin during the G2-to-M phase transition, when the genome structure undergoes substantial reorganization1,2. Yet, how the different SMC complexes affect each other and how their interactions orchestrate the dynamic folding of the three-dimensional genome remain unclear. Here we engineered all possible cohesin and condensin configurations on mitotic chromosomes to delineate the concerted, mutually influential action of SMC complexes. We show that condensin disrupts the binding of extrusive cohesin at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites, thereby promoting the disassembly of interphase topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops during mitotic progression. Conversely, extrusive cohesin impedes condensin-mediated mitotic chromosome spiralization. Condensin reduces peaks of cohesive cohesin, whereas cohesive cohesin antagonizes condensin-mediated longitudinal shortening of mitotic chromosomes. The presence of both extrusive and cohesive cohesin synergizes these effects and inhibits mitotic chromosome condensation. Extrusive cohesin positions cohesive cohesin at CTCF-binding sites. However, cohesive cohesin by itself cannot be arrested by CTCF molecules and is insufficient to establish TADs or loops. Moreover, it lacks loop-extrusion capacity, which indicates that cohesive cohesin has nonoverlapping functions with extrusive cohesin. Finally, cohesive cohesin restricts chromatin loop expansion mediated by extrusive cohesin. Collectively, our data describe a three-way interaction among major SMC complexes that dynamically modulates chromatin architecture during cell cycle progression.",

The two new spacecraft “are going after really important pieces of that puzzle”, says Parvathy Prem, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, who is not affiliated with either mission.\n\nThe lander is expected to touch down on 6 March. It is the second attempt by Intuitive Machines, a company based in Houston, Texas, whose first lunar spacecraft tipped over on landing last year.\n\nLunar Trailblazer will follow a leisurely trajectory and reach the Moon in several months. If all goes well, it will enter its final science-mapping orbit around August.\n\nSearching for water\n\nMany space agencies and scientists are keen to learn more about water at the lunar poles, which hold a geological record of the Solar System’s early history. The Indian mission Chandrayaan-2 is currently orbiting the Moon and building up its own data on where water might exist, as is a Korean probe that carries a NASA instrument to peer into shadowed, potentially ice-rich craters.\n\nIntuitive Machines’ new lander, named Athena, is headed for the Mons Mouton region of the Moon. Researchers think there is water in the lunar soil there, perhaps bound up in minerals or in pores in the soil.\n\nThese six countries are about to go to the Moon — here’s why\n\nAthena will search for water in several ways, including the use of NASA’s ice-mining drill, TRIDENT. If Athena lands successfully, operators will command TRIDENT to penetrate the lunar soil, drilling up to one metre deep to pull up the soil and leave it in a crumbly pile on the surface. A mass spectrometer on board will analyse the pile for signs of water and other volatile substances that might be escaping as gases. That ability to drill and analyse simultaneously provides “critical data on how lunar soils behave”, says Jackie Quinn, the drill’s project manager at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida.",

Not only did this early trade network enable plants to colonize land after long being confined to water, but it also created the soil and atmosphere that nurtured the subsequent evolution and exuberance of nearly all life as we know it2. We’re talking about the mutually beneficial (symbiotic) relationship between plants and fungi, specifically the mycorrhizal fungi that attach to plant roots and exchange key resources, such as nitrogen and phosphorus trapped in primordial rock, for food from plants3. Mycorrhizal fungi support most of Earth’s vegetation and have a key role in sequestering carbon in the soil, which holds more carbon than does the atmosphere and plant biomass combined1.

When a metal is stretched, defects form in its crystal lattice and thereby dissipate the strain energy (the energy stored from applied stress). This limits the amount of deformation that can be recovered (the recoverable strain) to less than 0.5% and causes permanent shape change. Metals are therefore good at permanently retaining their shape and are resistant to breaking, but they are not suitable for applications in which a material cycles through large shape changes. Writing in Nature, Song et al.1 report an impressive lightweight titanium alloy that has high mechanical strength and yet recovers strain of more than 5% across an extensive temperature range — with potential applications for biomedical devices, energy infrastructure and space exploration.",

          "authors": "Dritjon Gruda",
          "abstract": "Credit: Getty/Shutterstock\n\nDo you ever feel that agreeing to review an academic paper guarantees a wasted workday? You’re not alone. Many researchers spend hours marking up a manuscript, only to realize that they need even more time to let everything sink in before they can write coherent feedback. Not surprisingly, they’ve started turning down review invitations — it’s the only way they can safeguard their time and energy.\n\nBut science is a community endeavour, and we all know that many editors struggle to find qualified reviewers who can deliver quality feedback to tight deadlines. We also know that when the most knowledgeable people keep declining editors’ requests, science suffers.\n\nTo find out more, I conducted an informal poll over social media. In posts on Facebook and LinkedIn in January, I asked how much time academic colleagues spend reviewing papers. Close to 900 academics responded, with more than 40% saying they typically spend two to four hours on a single review, over 25% indicating that they spend more than four hours on the task, and a remarkable 14% admitting that they put in significantly more than four hours — sometimes a full eight-hour day or even more (see ‘Lengthy reviews’). Some respondents were stunned by those numbers, especially considering how fragmented or shallow reviewer feedback can seem to authors trying to make sense of it.\n\nWhat if there were a more efficient way to review a paper — without jeopardizing the quality and integrity of the process? Over the years, I’ve fine-tuned a method that has helped me to drastically cut the amount of time I spend on each review, while still providing thorough, constructive critiques. Here’s how it works.\n\nScan, dictate, refine\n\nI break the review process down into three simple steps:\n\nScan. Quickly browse the abstract, introduction, methods and results, focusing on the big picture. If the analysis looks solid, read the rest of the paper. If you detect glaring flaws, however, you’ll know it’s probably one to reject — no need to line-edit the entire manuscript.\n\nDictate. Use dictation in the text-editing tool of your choice (for example, Voice Access in Windows or Voice Control on the Mac) to capture real-time thoughts as you read. This way, you avoid having to scribble notes or needing to recall and type up your feedback later — a major time-saver.\n\nRefine. Feed your dictated notes into an offline large language model (LLM) to clarify and organize your feedback. A simple prompt such as “Write a critical reviewer letter based on the following notes. Maintain a professional tone throughout” will do. Don’t know how to code? No problem. Tools such as GPT4ALL (see ‘How to set up and run a local LLM’) allow you to load and run LLMs locally and offline, so there’s no need to upload sensitive manuscripts to the cloud. Confidentiality is non-negotiable when it comes to unpublished research, and uploading content externally can invite ethical or even legal trouble.\n\nHow to set up and run a local LLM\n\nWhen confidentiality is key, using an offline and ‘no-coding’ set-up such as GPT4ALL is a no-brainer for safeguarding sensitive or unpublished work. Here’s how to get started.\n\n1. Install GPT4ALL (available for Windows, macOS and Ubuntu Linux).\n\n2. Choose your large language model (LLM). Open GPT4ALL, click ‘Models’ in the left-hand panel and download a suitable LLM. Aim for a balance between output quality and hardware demands — bigger isn’t always better if it leaves your system gasping for air. Check each model’s computational requirements and licence before downloading, especially if you’re in a commercial or specialized setting. If your system’s random-access memory (RAM) is limited, try a smaller model with fewer computational requirements. And be wary of commercial models that route data to the cloud, breaking confidentiality — if a model’s indicated system requirements are suspiciously minimal, it is probably using external resources. Remember, the core advantage of GPT4ALL is local use, ensuring your confidential work stays where it belongs — on your device.\n\n3. Chat. Start a conversation by clicking ‘Chats’. After a brief pause to load the model, you should see a chat-like interface into which you can type or paste your text and notes. Request suggestions for clarification, rephrasing or structural improvements. Always review the model’s output carefully before incorporating it into your final review.\n\nBut let’s be clear: LLMs aren’t there to crank out a full review on your behalf. Although survey data published on the arXiv preprint server in January suggest that automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) can help to speed up evaluations and sharpen structure, ASPR tools still struggle with domain-specific expertise, bias and data-security issues1. Instead, use the LLM to spot redundancy, refine phrasing and organize suggestions (for prompts, see my previous column). You — the reviewer — must make the final judgement on the paper’s methodology, findings and overall contribution to the field.\n\nBy the end of this process, you should have a set of structured, section-by-section comments that can be quickly refined into a coherent reviewer report. But be sure to check the publisher’s policy on generative artificial intelligence (AI) before you get started. Some are fine with reviewers using generative AI tools to tidy up written feedback. But uploading a manuscript or review text to the cloud is usually a hard ‘no’ — confidentiality is on the line. Running an LLM offline locally keeps you within policy restrictions and safeguards the authors’ anonymity. Plus, it prevents their work from being scooped up for training future LLMs.\n\nOutcomes and lessons\n\nThis workflow has helped me to reclaim countless hours in my schedule: I used to spend half a day on one manuscript; now 30–40 minutes suffice if the paper’s methods are sound. If there are serious flaws, it’s even faster — there’s no need to polish an unpublishable paper.\n\nThe comments I do make are generally more thorough than before: dictating comments in real time forces me to ‘talk through’ the paper rather than scribble notes, and to articulate critiques on the spot, often exposing logical gaps I would otherwise have missed. It also deepens my engagement with the paper, resulting in clearer, more focused feedback.",

          "authors": "Georgina Ferry",
          "abstract": "Against the Odds: Women Pioneers of Science John Gribbin and Mary Gribbin Icon Books (2025)\n\nWhat is it with toilets? In domestic households, men and women use the same ones without a fuss, but at some point in history it became etiquette for toilets in workplaces to be segregated. And in supposedly male environments, it meant that there simply weren’t any for women. It then became absurdly easy to use the lack of appropriate toilets as an excuse to deny women a role in those environments or, if they did take a job there, to make their lives difficult.\n\n‘Male-dominated campuses belong to the past’: the University of Tokyo tackles the gender gap\n\nToilets come up in several of the 12 stories selected for John and Mary Gribbin’s gallery of female pioneers in science, Against the Odds. In the opening years of the twentieth century, physicist Lise Meitner, banished to a basement because she wasn’t allowed to work in the chemistry laboratories of what was then the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin, had to use the toilets in a neighbouring restaurant. During the 1950s, computer pioneer Lucy Slater, while developing the operating system for an early computer at the University of Cambridge, UK, smashed the sanitary equivalent of a glass ceiling by simply using the men’s toilet (singing loudly to signal her presence). And in 1964, Vera Rubin became the first female astronomer who was officially allowed to use the big telescopes at the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories in California, overturning a ban that had been partly, but explicitly, based on the lack of a women’s toilet.\n\nScience trailblazers\n\nCompared with unequal pay for the same work, the reality of men with fewer qualifications being promoted ahead of them and the frank refusal to recognize that a married woman with children might be capable of a career, the toilet issue was probably a trivial annoyance to these women. But it symbolizes how, for centuries, women have been considered unsuitable as scientists for reasons that have nothing to do with their ability or commitment.\n\nThe Gribbins’ aim is to “highlight the achievements of women who overcame the odds and achieved scientific success ... as society changed over about 150 years”. They don’t justify their selection, other than to note that the women featured (ordered by year of birth) collectively cover the period. But it is startling that physicist Chien-Shiung Wu is the only scientist who is not white or born in a Western country (and she spent most of her career in the United States). The ‘hidden figures’ — African American women who calculated trajectories for early NASA space missions — remain hidden. Many girls won’t find a role model who looks like them in the book.\n\nPhysicist Chien-Shiung Wu made instrumental contributions to the field of nuclear physics.Credit: IanDagnall Computing/Alamy\n\nWith that caveat, the Gribbins tell the stories with an adroit mix of anecdote and exposition. There is a bias towards physical sciences, perhaps reflecting John Gribbin’s background in astrophysics. Some of those featured (such as crystallographer Rosalind Franklin) are close to being household names, others (geophysicists Eunice Newton Foote and Inge Lehmann) are much less familiar. Three of the women (chemists Irène Joliot-Curie and Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin and geneticist Barbara McClintock) won Nobel prizes; two (Meitner and Wu) should have done.\n\nSome of the women were less celebrated during their lifetimes. It took 100 years for historians to uncover the work done by Foote, as a wealthy ‘lady amateur’ working in her home lab in New York state. She demonstrated that water vapour and carbon dioxide absorbed energy from sunlight and so could increase global temperatures. Her 1856 paper included the statement that if “the air had mixed with it a larger proportion [of CO2] than at present, an increased temperature ... would have necessarily resulted”. Three years later, John Tyndall, unaware of Foote’s work, performed the experiments that are generally credited with establishing the nature of the ‘greenhouse effect’.\n\nEqual partners?",

          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "By the time her comprehensive exams rolled around in August 2024, Adriana Ivich had done nearly everything she could to prepare herself. To officially become a PhD student in biomedical informatics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Ivich needed to present her proposed research project and then meet with her committee for a closed-door grilling.\n\n“It’s definitely one of the hardest times to be a PhD student,” Ivich says. “I spent months — years really — preparing, but you still don’t know what they’re going to ask you.”\n\n‘Arms race with automation’: professors fret about AI-generated coursework\n\nShe could make an informed guess, however. Months before, she’d poured the biographies and publications of her five committee members into ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot developed by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, and used it to create digital simulacrums of each person. She then fed the mimics her research proposal and asked the program to respond as her committee might, asking detailed questions and identifying gaps in her knowledge. The actual meeting “went pretty much like ChatGPT said it would,” says Ivich, who passed with flying colours.\n\nHer experience highlights just one of the many imaginative ways in which students are using generative AI. Unlike the ‘early days’ of two years ago, when using AI meant summarizing a paper or outlining an essay, students are now leaning into the tools’ ability to emulate human connection, turning chatbots into podcast hosts, language tutors, professors and even personal trainers.\n\n“I want professors to work with students assuming they’ll be using these models,” says Lily Lee, who is studying manufacturing and design engineering and music at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and is co-creator of the newsletter AI × Education. Although some educators worry about the erosion of critical-thinking skills, she says, “another way to look at it is that AI can help students learn more creatively, which helps them build their critical thinking as well.”\n\nA back-and-forth conversation\n\nWhen ChatGPT first appeared in November 2022, many educators and academic institutions responded with blanket bans, unsure whether these tools were more likely to spark innovation or cheating. The jury is still out on that, but administrators have started to relax some policies and give teachers greater freedom to direct when they can be used. How these tools are used, however, is often driven by students.\n\n“I’m pleasantly surprised at some of their creative uses,” says Victor Lee, a learning-sciences researcher at Stanford University in California who focuses on the intersections between AI and education.\n\nSix tips for better coding with ChatGPT\n\nLike Ivich, many students seem drawn to applications that showcase the ‘human’ side of programs such as ChatGPT and NotebookLM, an AI-powered interface from Google in Mountain View, California, for interpreting documents. Although early iterations of these tools required users to key in queries, newer versions allow people to speak into a microphone, enabling more-natural, organic conversations.\n\nSami Melhem, who is studying computer science at Texas A&M University in College Station, created his own chatbot, Class Primer, to tutor him. Built atop ChatGPT-4, the program begins by asking for details about a class, including a course description, learning outcomes, required textbooks and a syllabus. Then, it breaks down the course into ‘priming sessions’ spread out over the semester.\n\nMelhem now spends his Sunday afternoons familiarizing himself with a few weeks’ worth of material before the concepts are introduced in class. The bot lets Melhem engage with his lectures in different ways, such as by creating playful analogies or visual maps that link concepts and show how they connect over the semester. As a visual learner, Melhem says that the diagrams especially “help with understanding the subject as a whole”.\n\nOther students, such as Jan Bartkowiak, who is studying economics at Minerva University in San Francisco, California, have made chatbots that emulate famous historical figures to interrogate their thinking. In 2024, Bartkowiak wrote an essay on the Vietnam War and used this exercise to probe how historians or contemporary political figures, such as Henry Kissinger, who served as the United States national security adviser and secretary of state during the conflict, might have framed certain events.\n\n“You might want to quickly identify which book or philosopher supports your point, so instead of starting your research by digging deeply into those books, you can start with ChatGPT,” he says. “You can have back-and-forth conversations and ask clarifying questions, and that’s been very useful.”\n\nThree ways ChatGPT helps me in my academic writing\n\nThis ability to speak to chatbots has proven particularly helpful for students taking courses outside their main specialism — for instance, to attain skills that they need or want.\n\nElda Bengu is a psychology student at Arizona State University in Tempe, an institution that has embraced AI tools through an AI Innovation Challenge in partnership with OpenAI. As part of that effort, Bengu’s lecturer Christiane Reves created a chatbot called Language Buddy that Bengu has used to practise speaking German. Research shows that engaging in conversation is among the quickest ways to improve language skills, but students aren’t always able to say things in the clearest way or ramp up the complexity of their speaking. Language Buddy can.\n\nInitially sceptical, Bengu says that after testing how the app handled her first language, Turkish, she was pleasantly surprised with its performance. “I was able to have a conversation and even ask it to speak in a certain dialect or accent, which would be especially useful if you’re learning to live somewhere new.”\n\nMastering the calendar\n\nAnother space in which students have successfully channelled the usefulness of generative AI is in streamlining their workflows. By using AI as a type of personal assistant, tools can quickly pull together information, prepare schedules and free up precious time.",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto, Max Kozlov, Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "The administration of US President Donald Trump has already laid off thousands of government workers.Credit: Tierney L. Cross/Getty\n\nAgencies across the US government have been ordered to initiate another punishing round of layoffs as Congress moves forwards with a plan to slash their budgets — a potential blow to science.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next\n\nOn Wednesday, Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), sent a memo directing agency heads to submit two-step plans for significant ‘reductions in force’ (RIFs), with the first step due by 13 March and the second by 14 April. The memo does not provide absolute numbers but calls for “maximum elimination of functions that are not statutorily mandated”.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump “has targeted every single federal worker and does not seem to care how much turmoil they cause for either the employees or the American public”, the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing about 800,000 workers, said in a 26 February statement. “The chaos is the point.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on this and other statements in this story.\n\nStarving the government\n\nThe OMB memo is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to downsize the federal workforce, which it has said is corrupt, inefficient and overreaching in business regulations. Agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) — two major funders of US academic science — have already endured sizable layoffs. Over the past few weeks, the Trump administration has purged hundreds of people who worked on the federal government’s diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it calls “illegal and immoral discrimination programs”. Agencies have also fired thousands of ‘probationary’ employees, who were newly hired or had recently transferred into new positions, although a federal judge ruled on 27 February that some of the firings were illegal. And on 3 March, NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan sent all staff members at the agency an e-mail stating that the NSF would reinstate more than 80 full-time probationary employees who were fired.\n\nRussell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, sent a memo earlier this week calling for significant reductions in force across government agencies.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nFiring permanent employees en masse, as called for in the latest memo, would be a significant escalation that could face legal challenges. RIFs at government agencies require a valid reason, such as budgetary constraints, says Nick Bednar, a legal scholar at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. But the administration might soon have the justification it needs: Trump’s Republican allies in Congress are working to pass a budget bill that seeks to cut at least US$1.5 trillion–2 trillion from the federal budget over the next ten years. By comparison, last year’s entire discretionary budget — the portion that Congress allocates each year and includes funding for science agencies — was less than $1.7 trillion.\n\nVought has long advocated for slashing government budgets. In a 2023 report making federal budget suggestions, Vought, then-president of a right-wing organization based in Washington DC called the Center for Renewing America, used war-like terms to describe the coming battle to dismantle a “woke and weaponized” federal government, including a “small scientific elite”, that feeds on taxpayer resources. “That is the central and immediate threat facing the country — the one that all our statesmen must rise tall to vanquish,” he wrote, advocating that the government can be “starved in order to dismantle it”.\n\nDisappearing programmes\n\nThe sheer scale of the Trump administration’s effort to downsize the US government has no modern precedent. In the 1990s, then-US-president Bill Clinton ordered comparatively mild reductions: at least 4% of the workforce was cut over 3 years, mainly accomplished through attrition strategies, such as leaving positions vacant when people retired.\n\n‘Targeted and belittled’: scientists at US environmental agency speak out as layoffs begin\n\nSince Clinton, some agencies have seen even larger swings in their workforce over the years. During Trump’s first presidency, from 2017 to 2021, for example, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) culled around 1,100 people, or 7% of its staff members, despite congressional efforts to block budget cuts.\n\nIf the latest RIFs are carried out at the planned scale, they could permanently weaken science agencies, policy specialists say.\n\nAt the NSF, a reduction as high as 50% of the workforce — about 800 of some 1,600 people — was suggested by several NSF sources on the basis of projected budget cuts for next year. “We are concerned that entire programmes and divisions will disappear,” says an NSF employee who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nThese extreme cuts mirror the scale of Vought’s 2023 proposal to reduce the agency’s budget by more than half, from about $9 billion to less than $4 billion. The agency wouldn’t be “able to fulfill its statutory mission — it can’t do that with $4 billion”, says Kenny Evans, a science-policy researcher at Rice University in Houston, Texas. “NSF as we know it could cease to exist.” (The NSF awards about $8.5 billion in research grants each year.)",

          "title": "Can AI help beat poverty? Researchers test ways to aid the poorest people",
          "authors": "Carrie Arnold",
          "abstract": "Beginning in late 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, the mobile phones of tens of thousands of impoverished villagers in Togo pinged with good news. Their money was ready. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), these villagers in the narrow strip of land in West Africa had been approved to receive around US$10 every two weeks, delivered directly to their mobile money accounts. Although that might not sound like much, it could keep people from going hungry.\n\nConventional poverty-relief projects rely on data gathered through in-person surveys — which were not possible during the pandemic. But Togo’s effort, dubbed Novissi, which means ‘solidarity’ in the local Éwé language, incorporated AI to determine who should receive aid. The project, led by Cina Lawson, the Togo Minister of Digital Economy and Transformation, along with scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the non-governmental organization (NGO) GiveDirectly, analysed satellite images and data from mobile-phone networks to estimate the wealth of particular regions and individuals1. “We needed a surgical approach,” says Lawson. It was an important moment for the use of AI in anti-poverty work, she says.\n\nSome 700 million people around the globe live in extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as living on less than $2.15 per day. Ending that poverty, one of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, requires an understanding of who is in need and what their needs are. But measuring poverty has long been a challenge, in large part because of the time and cost involved in trying to collect data from the poorest and most vulnerable populations.\n\nCombine AI with citizen science to fight poverty\n\nAI allowed Lawson to leapfrog the conventional hurdles of using old and incomplete data to quickly make the most of her limited budget. It’s an approach that is garnering both interest and controversy, says Joshua Blumenstock, a computer scientist at University of California, Berkeley, who collaborated on Novissi.\n\nAI tools can not only be fast, says Ariel BenYishay, a development economist at the AidData Research Lab at William & Mary, a university in Williamsburg, Virginia, but they can also include a larger, more representative portion of the population than household surveys do, and identify patterns in data that even specialists could miss. AI might also help researchers to evaluate how well programmes meet their objectives and demonstrate how investments in areas such as health, agriculture, education and infrastructure pay off — or not. The World Bank recognizes this value and has been developing advanced AI tools to try to forecast food crises and violent conflicts, and to pull insights from large swathes of data gathered after an aid intervention. It concluded its Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet report2 in October 2024 by noting that anti-poverty “efforts should focus on leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence models to close data gaps and enable more timely monitoring”.\n\nBut there are reasons to be cautious, says human geographer Ola Hall at Lund University in Sweden, who researches the intersection of AI and poverty. AI models have been criticized for being racist, sexist and otherwise biased. Just as household surveys often miss the poorest families because they do not have permanent housing, AI-driven programmes might not help individuals who do not have digital data trails, Hall says. They are nowhere near accurate enough to determine who qualifies for aid or cash subsidies and who doesn’t, he says.\n\nHowever flawed AI might be, though, current systems of evaluating poverty are just as abysmal, says BenYishay. “The baseline isn’t perfect data. It’s actually very crappy data,” he says.\n\nMeasuring poverty\n\nBritish social reformer Charles Booth undertook an early effort to quantify poverty from 1886 to 1903 when he criss-crossed London’s cobblestones collecting data on people’s incomes and social class. He created a colour-coded map of the city and reported his findings in a treatise titled Life and Labour of the People in London. English sociologist Seebohm Rowntree and his team interviewed 11,560 families in York, UK, and published the findings in a 1901 book called Poverty: A Study of Town Life. The team calculated poverty on the basis of the ability to meet a person’s “physical efficiency”, or their minimal nutritional requirements. A sample minimal diet might include bread, porridge, boiled bacon, potatoes, skimmed milk and little else.\n\nAfter US President Lyndon Johnson declared a ‘War on Poverty’ in 1964, the Office of Economic Opportunity adopted a poverty threshold devised by economist Mollie Orshansky that took a similar approach. It defined poverty as the bare minimum income required to cover food, shelter and other basic costs. Around the same time, India performed similar calculations for its populace. Although each expert tinkered with their formulae to account for local variations in rent and food costs, they all defined poverty on the basis of how much money a person lives on per day.\n\nThe dollar-per-day approach is blunt and easy to communicate, says Dean Jolliffe, an economist at the World Bank in Washington DC. Yet, how much money a person spends to get by is just one aspect of poverty. Economist and Anglican priest Sabina Alkire advocates for a more nuanced way to define poverty. “I want to know how many poor people lack a house, how many poor people have a kid out of school, so I can actually respond in very tangible, direct ways,” says Alkire, who is the director of the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative at the University of Oxford, UK.\n\nMobile phone data can be used alongside satellite imagery and other data to estimate poverty across regions and countries.Credit: Kelvin Juma\n\nIn the early 2000s, Alkire wanted a way to capture poverty’s various affects on people. Just because someone has enough money to buy food doesn’t mean they have enough for medical care or school fees, says Alkire. In 2008, Alkire worked with James Foster, an economist at the George Washington University in Washington DC, to develop what’s called the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)3. The approach estimates a unified measure of poverty by tallying up the deprivations and their intensity, with a total of ten indicators, including nutrition, school attendance, access to drinking water and what a household uses for cooking fuel.\n\nFor the field of poverty, this was a sea change. It allowed policymakers and others to measure, dissect and target the interacting variables that contribute to poverty at the household level. The United Nations Development Programme replaced its Human Poverty Index, which focused on survival, literacy and standard of living, with Alkire and Foster’s MPI in 2010, although certain United Nations agencies along with the World Bank continue to rely on the dollar-per-day definition.\n\n‘It is chaos’: US funding freezes are endangering global health\n\nResearchers and aid agencies have developed myriad ways other than the MPI to define poverty. These methods vary in the factors they include, depending on what they want to measure and the data at hand, says Jennifer Davis, who heads the Program on Water, Health & Development at Stanford University in California. In a 2024 paper, a team led by Davis and her graduate student Christine Pu evaluated four definitions of poverty that are used in the field, including daily per capita expenditure but not MPI, and found massive differences in how those definitions rank households in Ethiopia, Ghana and Uganda4. “When we did our analysis, not only did we not find much agreement at all for the full sample, we didn’t find it for urban households, or for the bottom 20%, or for the bottom 1% where we might expect the greatest need,” says Pu.\n\nAlong with the lack of agreement on definitions, there’s the problem of time. Even a well-oiled field team needs several hours to survey a single family, says Jolliffe. Although poverty researchers have refined their metrics and are incorporating the latest computational methods for analysing data, they often continue to rely on on-the-ground surveys to collect those data. A lot of people are surprised that we still do household surveys, says Jolliffe. But, “this notion that we have data on everything about everybody is very much a rich-world perspective”.\n\nTurning to AI\n\nAs a PhD student in agricultural and resource economics, Marshall Burke was familiar with laborious data collection. To learn about farming and agriculture practices in East Africa, Burke travelled to Kenya and Uganda, where he spent months talking to farmers and walking their fields. But when Burke started the Environmental Change and Human Outcomes Lab at Stanford University in 2015, he wondered whether the computer revolution might offer better approaches.\n\nThese experiments could lift millions out of dire poverty\n\nDavid Lobell, who had vast experience in remote sensing, occupied the office next to him. Around the same time, a specialist in AI and image recognition, Stefano Ermon, also joined Stanford University. The trio’s discussions turned to how the ever-increasing data from satellite images could be used to help identify people living in poverty around the world. Knowing that night-time lighting can be a rough proxy for wealth, the researchers used night-time satellite imagery of areas across Africa alongside daytime imagery to teach computer models to identify features associated with wealth.\n\nAsking a computer to compare images of areas that are already known to be extremely rich or extremely poor is an electronic version of the game “spot the difference”, Burke says. The algorithms compare the distribution and condition of roads, the amount of green space, the size and spacing of buildings and a multitude of other variables. “All the sorts of things you and I would think to look for in an image are a little bit predictive,” says Burke. “A machine can sort through all that data,” and determine what aspects are most relevant.\n\nIn 2016, the team reported that the AI analyses of the satellite images correlated strongly with on-the-ground measurements of poverty5. As machine learning advanced, Lobell, Burke and Ermon refined their models by incorporating the latest techniques.\n\nUsing a pan-African data set of publicly available satellite images, the trio tested an updated approach in May 2020. When the team compared its machine-learning predictions with wealth-related survey data from 20,000 villages, the algorithm performed just as well as the laborious surveys, but at a fraction of the effort and cost6 (see ‘Poverty predictions’).\n\nSource: Ref. 6\n\n“This was a pretty seminal improvement concept for the development community,” says BenYishay. Other teams are joining the experiment, throwing out a lot of different ideas, he says. Scientists are applying machine learning to look for patterns in satellite images and mobile-phone data, and to analyse the impacts of drought, agricultural productivity, infrastructure investments and more, he says.\n\nMuch of this effort remains confined to academic research simply because the field is so young, says Abe Tarapani, chief executive of Atlas AI, a public benefit corporation in Palo Alto, California, co-founded by Burke, Lobell and Ermon. The stakes are too high to just dive in head first, says Tarapani. But when the pandemic hit, Lawson felt she had no other option.",

          "abstract": "The drive had been lazy, uneventful. Window open, AC off, no online activity for hours, no cravings of any kind. On a whim, Akili had decided to visit the new megastore on the outskirts of the outskirts. Someone had told him it would be worth it. They hadn’t been wrong.\n\nThe building stood alone in an empty field, walls all glass, like the skin had been peeled off and one was now privy to its inner workings. On the inside, the aisles were brimming with wonders in all sorts of guises. Clothes, tools, foodstuffs, gadgets and things Akili didn’t even recognize. But the key in this particular store was that the aisles weren’t static: to save storage space they ebbed and flowed, came together and moved apart like the bellows on a harmonium in a mechanical waltz. Plus, it was not just the transparency, somehow Akili could see things more clearly inside the store than in the field it occupied; the colours were more vivid, he could identify details on the products his brain told him he shouldn’t be able to detect at this distance; even hints of pleasant smells were in the air, which, again, seemed impossible. But most impressive was that the hypnotic movement inside the store was synchronized, it had purpose. As the aisles joined and separated, diligent robots replaced items as others picked them up, taking them to be packed and loaded on delivery drones, which zapped constantly in and out, their hum filling the air as if setting the aisle movements to music.\n\nThere were few people in sight except for the ad-hoc tourists like Akili. Just a couple of technicians who wandered around unjamming and lubricating, probably just fulfilling the Minimum Human Employment Law, but at any rate spoiling the show. Wherever they went, the aisles froze in static, parallel, safe-distance normality, jumping back to life the second motion sensors decided it was safe; like in the old tales of workshops animating to dance and song in the absence of their owners. Of course, all this poetic efficiency was mostly for show. These were lightweight short-range drones; the heavy lifters for larger objects or transatlantic delivery were much farther out, on even cheaper land, probably in much more drab warehouses, with normal boring aisles.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nAkili mused that, all in all, it was an interesting and novel spectator sport. Until it wasn’t.\n\nSuddenly, one of those ubiquitous AI-generated, androgynous, race-ambiguous holograms materialized in front of him, eyes the usual disturbing mix of vacant and piercing.\n\n“You have been standing on company property for over five minutes.” The tone was calm, even soothing, but decisive. “According to the terms and conditions of the lease you have tacitly agreed to be approached by a Non-Person Associate.”\n\nThe hologram paused for about half a second and Akili instinctively knew what was happening. He had probably given access to his identity details, and, thus, to his socials, which were being combed through. Not that it mattered, there would probably have been many other ways of getting to the same place even if he had flatly refused, which no one he knew ever did. Why bother? It usually meant you were denied access, got stuck in the middle of something, or that tasks took longer than your attention span. No one craves any of that.\n\n“It looks like you have not made purchases recently,” the hologram stated helpfully. “But do not worry, we have many affordable suggestions that fit your likes and needs. Please make your choice now.”",

          "authors": "Benjamin Plackett",
          "abstract": "Erika Cheung found herself in the spotlight when she helped to expose scientific misconduct.Credit: Xiaomei Chen/Zuma/Alamy\n\nMost people who have endured and survived a toxic workplace don’t end up as a character in an award-winning TV show. But Erika Cheung is not like most people, in more ways than one. She risked her livelihood, right to privacy and professional relationships by speaking out about scientific fraud.\n\nCheung’s journey from researcher to whistle-blower began when she was a junior scientist, not long after she graduated in 2013 from the University of California, Berkeley, with a bachelor’s degree in molecular and cellular biology.\n\nShe landed a job at Theranos, one of the most exciting companies in California at the time. Elizabeth Holmes had founded the company in 2003, aged just 19, and had claimed that Theranos was going to revolutionize disease diagnostics. The days of multiple blood samples and intrusive medical investigations would be replaced by the start-up’s technology, one that could detect everything from cholesterol to cocaine.\n\nTheranos claimed that cancers, diabetes, anaemia, herpes, HIV/AIDS and many other ailments could all be diagnosed by the company’s ‘Edison device’, using just a few drops of blood from a finger-prick test.\n\nAt its zenith in 2015, Theranos was running close to 900,000 tests per year. It did so without the vigorous oversight of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the lack of which has since been criticized by legal experts as a significant loophole in the regulatory process. Theranos’s activities were classified as ‘laboratory-developed tests’, which the FDA defines as “a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory”. This classification meant that Theranos didn’t need to have its tests evaluated before they were offered and sold to patients.\n\nA promising prognosis\n\nCheung still remembers the excitement of the job interview, although the company wouldn’t divulge much of the detail behind Theranos’s technology, citing concerns over corporate espionage. “You're kept in the dark, and the explanation was trade secrets,” and “you’d find out more when you get inside”, says Cheung. That seemed fair enough to her, given that the company was awash with millions of dollars of investment capital from famous names such as media baron Rupert Murdoch and the Walgreens chain of pharmacies. It was also reassuring that the likes of former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger and William Foege, a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were on Theranos’s board. Holmes, for her part, was often proclaimed by the media to be the next Steve Jobs, a comparison made in part because, like the founder of the computer company Apple, she frequently wore a black turtleneck sweater.\n\nIt all seemed legitimate, and Cheung was pleased to have landed a job as a lab assistant at Theranos. She was looking forward to a fruitful career at the cutting edge of medical research.\n\nWould that it were all above board.\n\nIn fact, the science was bogus, the technology was unproven and the boss was a fraud. In 2022, Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for defrauding investors and was ordered to pay back US$452 million. The jury acquitted Holmes of conspiracy to defraud patients and of three counts of fraud against individual patients, and did not reach a verdict regarding three further counts of defrauding individual investors.\n\nElizabeth Holmes verdict: researchers share lessons for science\n\nIt wasn’t too long before Cheung began to suspect that the whole enterprise didn’t pass the sniff test. After she started her job in 2013, the secrecy that defined the interview carried on in the workplace. “The smoke and mirrors didn’t end,” she says. “There were all of these different laboratories that you didn’t have access to,” with something bigger and better supposedly happening behind those doors.\n\nBut in the short term at least, Cheung was preoccupied with making a good impression and settling in. “It takes a while to onboard and just figure out what’s happening at a company, especially a start-up where everything is in chaos and the turnover is so high that they are basically having people quit at the rate they’re hiring,” she says.\n\nEventually, however, Cheung wanted answers to reasonable questions. How did the technology work? How did its results compare with those from conventional testing techniques? Her questions went down like a lead balloon.\n\nShe started digging around the company’s computer records, trying to piece together a research and development (R&D) timeline. “Initially, I bought into the start-up idea, that is, ‘you’re here to fix these problems’. And I was super invested and committed to fixing things. I was definitely stressed; sometimes I was working at least 12 and sometimes 16 hours for 14 days in a row,” she says. But as she started to raise more questions, her access to certain hard drives was cut. To make matters worse, the high turnover of staff meant that it wasn’t clear who she could approach to ask about the history of the technology.\n\n“I didn’t have access to the digital memory of these things,” she says, and ”there were a lot of deliberate ways in which the company had organized itself in order to prevent people from being able to see the full picture”.\n\nSelf-doubt\n\nCheung can’t remember when she first concluded that something pernicious and illegal was afoot. There was no smoking-gun moment. In reality, it was a slow drip, drip of suspicion, followed by fear and then a sense of moral rectitude that led her to the truth about Theranos.\n\nCheung is keen to stress that she wasn’t supremely confident, and was constantly second-guessing herself and her convictions. “I was 22 and I had doubt, asking myself: is this how all lab diagnostics are run?” It seemed outrageous to her, but she “still wasn't too sure”, she recalls.\n\nThe most frustrating thing was the lack of hard information to back up her instincts. “I think that’s an issue for most scientists,” she says, the idea that “if I don’t have the full picture, I could be wrong”.\n\nThis second-guessing and tortured self-doubt comes from an earnest desire to do the right thing, says Rachel Peterson, one of Cheung’s closest friends at university, who became her confidant for all things Theranos. “She is one of the most genuine and brave and tough people I’ve ever met,” she says. ‘\n\n‘Brave’ isn’t an adjective that Cheung likes to use for herself — because she was so conflicted throughout the process. “I don't know if that's how I'd explain how I felt at the time,” she says.\n\nFortunately for Cheung, she happened across a research engineer who became her ally at Theranos —Tyler Shultz, whose grandfather, George Shultz, a former US secretary of state, happened to be on the company’s board. Cheung had worked with Tyler during a night shift in the R&D department.\n\nA scene from the TV miniseries The Dropout, with Camryn Mi-young Kim (left) as Erika Cheung.Credit: Landmark Media/Alamy\n\nShe and Shultz examined the results of some of Theranos’s diagnostic tests, comparing them with the outcomes of conventional tests. “We saw things weren’t right,” says Cheung. “The cancer markers could be threefold different to the standard test. It was the difference between telling someone they don’t have prostate cancer when they do, or telling someone they have hyperthyroidism when they don’t. Crazy stuff.”\n\nIn early 2014, the pair began to work in tandem, gathering as much data as possible so that they couldn’t be easily ignored when they took their findings to someone in authority. They planned to present a dossier of evidence to Shultz’s grandfather and implore him to influence Holmes and the rest of the board to take Theranos’s technology off the market and back into the development labs. In April 2014, they went to George Shultz’s house for dinner and made their case.\n\nThey explained that Theranos’s technology was unsound. “They basically tried to make blood tests for small sample sizes and so they jerry-rigged a bunch of FDA-approved machines. The Edison device was just terrible,” says Cheung. It had a robotic arm, and was supposed to titrate blood samples and add antibodies or reagents to identify a molecule indicating the presence of a disease. “It was like a very impressive PhD project, but it wasn’t ready to be tested on patients and be commercialized,” says Cheung. Over time and with more experience of real labs, she realized “how horrendous this was”, she says.\n\nIn reality, most of Theranos’s testing was being done conventionally by human scientists at the lab bench, although they did not have full blood samples to ensure accuracy.\n\nBut Cheung says that George Shultz was unconvinced. He dismissed their concerns and tried to reassure them that the company was well led by people who were at the top of their game. That came as a blow, not least to Tyler Shultz, who now had to decide whether to go against his grandfather or toe the company line.\n\nThe human cost\n\nCheung already knew in her heart of hearts what she needed to do — she knew before she even had dinner with the Shultzes, when she had seen a patient’s name printed on a blood-sample label. It was a rare moment of clarity for hert. “I started to realize that I wasn’t a scientist tinkering in a lab,” she says. ”I was, in fact, a health-care professional and I could see the names of the people we were providing these faulty results for.” If George Shultz and the rest of the board weren’t going to help, she would have to take a different line of attack.\n\nWhistleblowing in science: this physician faced ostracization after standing up to pharma\n\nThings were starting to take their toll on Cheung, says Peterson. “The number of times when I held her while she was sobbing, just full-on sobbing, even in the years after Theranos, was a constant theme,” remembers Peterson.\n\nWhen the full extent of fraud at Theranos became clear, Peterson told Cheung to get her house in order. “My advice was very American: it was to talk to a lawyer. I said she should then quit and file a complaint with the government,” says Peterson.\n\nCheung took that counsel to heart, quitting the company in 2014; Tyler Shultz left shortly before she did. That same year, Holmes was named one of the richest women in the United States and Theranos raised a further $400 million in funding.\n\nIn 2014, after consulting her lawyer, Cheung filed a complaint with the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a US federal agency responsible for administering the government’s health-insurance programmes. Shultz defied his grandfather, using an alias to report Theranos to the New York state authorities.\n\nAlthough Cheung submitted evidence to the CMS under her real name, she asked to be kept anonymous. But the investigations that Cheung’s and Shultz’s whistle-blowing kicked off led to legal action, and it was no longer possible for their names to be kept out of the spotlight. She became an oft-cited name in news coverage of the Theranos hearings.",

          "abstract": "In the past few weeks, global health research programmes have been shaken by events in the United States. These include the country’s intention to withdraw from the World Health Organization, a freeze on foreign aid from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. HIV programmes are closing down, trials of malaria drugs have ceased and academic societies and universities have scrubbed their websites of mentions of DEI.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, continued efforts to reduce health inequities remain crucial. In the United States, for example, Black women are more likely to die of breast cancer than are white women1. Globally, most clinical trials and biomedical studies focus on men of European ancestry, hindering efforts to improve the health of other communities. Under-represented groups struggle to access health care that meets their needs.\n\nHere, four experts share insights into how to win the trust of under-represented communities to conduct research that can help to achieve health equity.\n\nLYNN HENDRICKS: Embrace unconventional methods\nHealth researcher Lynn Hendricks uses creative arts to engage with communities that might not otherwise wish to be involved in research.Credit: Stefan Els, Stellenbosch University\n\nInclusivity in health research means embracing research styles that best meet a population’s needs and priorities. Sometimes that might mean adopting approaches that don’t look much like typical scientific experiments.\n\nAs a public-health researcher, I’ve found that the creative arts are a great way to connect with communities that might otherwise be disenfranchised from science. Art can cross language and cultural boundaries and can be harnessed to discuss emotions, experiences and challenges. For instance, I’ve used craft and digital storytelling to explore the lives of people who grew up on the streets in South Africa, who do not usually trust anyone easily.\n\nYoung people are crucial to research — how can they be paid fairly?\n\nArt can enable participants to be co-researchers. Part of one study I conducted set out to fill in evidence gaps about the barriers that prevent young women living with perinatal HIV from taking daily antiretrovirals, with the participants driving the project2. Together, we used photographs and videos to study their lives; drawing and collage to identify the key challenges they face; and dance and documentary-making to decide what we wanted to share with others (see go.nature.com/4t6zh5j).\n\nSome might say that these approaches cannot provide the same concrete findings as conventional methods. A more-typical study might have explored the barriers to and facilitators of medication adherence. By contrast, our work revealed a complex net of intersecting environmental factors that had not previously been considered — such as sounds and objects in the women’s surroundings, the tolls taken by hazardous trips to the clinic and the unpleasant sensation of taking the medicine.\n\nEthics boards should be more receptive to participant-led research. The HIV project was questioned by the ethics committee, which wanted specific objectives and methodologies — the typical route for getting ethical clearance. But truly inclusive research requires a fundamental shift in power dynamics, recognizing the importance of participant comfort and agency to dictate the course of the research.\n\nResearchers and institutions should embrace the fact that unconventional research can lead to unconventional research outputs. As well as academic publications, our project produced videos, art exhibitions and photo essays. These outputs should be accepted as valuable products of research. Indeed, they can be more useful than papers when it comes to engaging stakeholders outside science — such as policymakers and local governments — because they are easily understandable by all.\n\nRAEKA AIYAR: Rebuild trust with empathy\nRaeka Aiyar (left) hears from a patient advocate at a panel discussion on health equity.Credit: The New York Stem Cell Foundation\n\nMany minoritized communities share a justifiable distrust of science, because of the long history of exploitation and harm by researchers and physicians. The onus is on scientists to rebuild the trust in these relationships, so that we can engage these communities as partners — not subjects.\n\nI learnt the hard way how even well-intentioned science can amplify mistrust. In 2013, I co-authored the first reported genome sequence of a HeLa cell line3, one of the most widely used cell lines in biomedical science. The scientific community initially shared our excitement about the value of these data for genetic research. But we failed to anticipate the views of the family of Henrietta Lacks, the Black woman whose tumour sample was used to create HeLa cells in the 1950s without her knowledge.\n\nWhat Gives You Hope for Health Equity?\n\nThe Lacks family responded with frustration and concern about how the genome data could affect their privacy, so we pulled the data down from the public domain. Ultimately, the US National Institutes of Health — which had funded a separate study of the HeLa genome — engaged with the family over several months, and we reached an agreement to restore the data under controlled access.\n\nThere are many lessons to be learnt from our oversight. Before beginning a study, scientists should always ask: how will the communities that are affected by the research perceive it? Could the way in which the data are presented amplify a fear or harmful narrative? Can the research design be improved to bring more benefits to the communities?\n\nFinding the answers starts with empathy. Scientists and science communicators should listen to the stories of the people behind the data. Understanding our own privileges and biases in the light of diverse perspectives makes us better, more objective scientists.\n\nCommunities that might be affected by research should be asked for input respectfully, early and often. We as researchers should share our hopes for what our research will achieve; listen and respond to concerns; continue the dialogue if communities are willing; and desist if they are not — even if that means stopping a project.\n\nFor some communities, letting scientists continue to benefit more from their data than the communities do will be a non-starter. An Indigenous community whose land was stolen, for example, might be understandably reticent to openly share their genome data. Given the current upheaval in US funding, it is urgent that funders and institutions train and incentivize scientists to learn from these communities and build more effective research programmes, together.\n\nBelieving that everyone deserves to benefit from research is not sufficient to rebuild trust with communities that have been abused in the name of science. Open-hearted engagement with diverse communities and responsible communication of science — including honest reckoning with systemic discrimination — are crucial, now more than ever.\n\nUMA PALANISAMY: Centre communities throughout projects\nUma Palanisamy helped to develop an app that uses real-time sign language interpretation services through video conferencing to improve health-care access for Deaf Malaysians.\n\nAs researchers, it can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking that because we are trained in scientific processes and well acquainted with the literature in our field, we are ideally placed to design experiments and interventions. But what we think will work best is not as important as the stakeholders we want to help. Scientists must be willing to listen, adapt and alter research plans, to suit a community’s needs.\n\nThe Deaf community in Malaysia has a unique language and cultural identity. This causes problems for Deaf people when it comes to accessing health-care services — with sign-language interpreters in short supply, Deaf people can find themselves trying to explain a complex medical condition to a physician who can’t understand them, and whom they cannot hear. I’ve been involved in developing an app, called Deaf In Touch Everywhere (DITE), to improve health-care access for Deaf Malaysians by providing real-time sign language interpretation services through video conferencing, among other support services.\n\nHealth of people who are displaced in their own countries is a neglected global crisis",

          "abstract": "The brain’s blood vessels (artificially coloured) are lined with slick molecules, forming a guard against inflammation in brain tissue.Credit: Vsevolod Zviryk/Science Photo Library\n\nA slimy barrier lining the brain’s blood vessels could hold the key to shielding the organ from the harmful effects of ageing, according to a study in mice.\n\nThe study showed that this oozy barrier deteriorates with time, potentially allowing harmful molecules into brain tissue and sparking inflammatory responses. Gene therapy to restore the barrier reduced inflammation in the brain and improved learning and memory in aged mice. The work was published today in Nature1.\n\nThe finding shines a spotlight on a cast of poorly understood molecules called mucins that coat the interior of blood vessels throughout the body and give mucus its slippery texture, says Carolyn Bertozzi, a Nobel-prizewinning chemist at Stanford University in California and a lead author of the study. “Mucins play a lot of interesting roles in the body,” she says. “But until recently, we didn’t have the tools to study them. They were invisible.”\n\nSnotty barrier\n\nMucins are large proteins decorated with carbohydrates that form linkages with one another, creating a water-laden, gel-like substance. They are crucial constituents of the blood–brain barrier, a system that restricts the movement of some molecules from the blood into the brain.\n\nResearchers have long sought ways to sneak medicines past this barrier to treat diseases of the brain. Previous work also showed that the integrity of the barrier erodes with age2, suggesting that it could be an important target for therapies to combat diseases associated with ageing, such as Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nConquering Alzheimer’s: a look at the therapies of the future\n\nBut scientists knew little about the contribution of mucins to these changes, until Sophia Shi, a graduate student at Stanford, decided to focus on a mucin-rich layer called the glycocalyx, which lines blood vessels. Shi and her colleagues looked at what happens to the glycocalyx in the brain as mice age. “The mucins on the young blood vessels were thick and juicy and plump,” says Bertozzi. “In the old mice, they were thin and lame and patchy.”\n\nThe team went on to find that mucins in a particular class were less abundant in old mice than in young mice. The scientists also showed that a decrease in the activity of enzymes needed to produce these mucins caused the blood–brain barrier to become leakier.\n\nAnd bolstering the activity of those enzymes in old mice reduced the leakage and improved the animals’ performance on learning and memory tests. Old mice can be forgetful, says Bertozzi. “They can’t get out of the maze like they used to. But they do better on those tests after we restore the mucin barrier.”",

Credit: Gordon Scammell/Loop Images/Universal Images Group/Getty\n\nA crucial ocean-current system seems unlikely to collapse even in the face of severe climate change ― despite predictions that it would disintegrate if Earth continues to warm. That’s the finding of a study1 suggesting that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will survive at least until the end of the century.\n\nThe study found that the combined forces of various ocean currents and winds would keep the system stable even under the most pessimistic climate scenarios.\n\nThe authors are confident that there is sufficient evidence to support this finding, even though the climate models they analysed do not perfectly mirror reality. “Unlikely isn’t impossible,” says Jonathan Baker, a co-author of the study and a climate scientist at the Met Office in Exeter, UK. “But we have confidence in our results.” The work is published today in Nature.\n\nWater-moving machine\n\nThe AMOC is like a giant conveyor belt in the Atlantic Ocean: warm water travels in the upper layers from south to north. Once the water reaches its northernmost point, it sinks and travels southwards in a cold, deep layer until it reaches the southern oceans, where it rises back up to the surface. The AMOC therefore has a crucial role in the global distribution of heat, salt and other components of seawater.\n\nThe system called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (warm water in red, cold water in blue; artist’s illustration) would survive, although in weakened form, even with extreme climate change.Credit: Jonathan Baker (Met Office) and co-authors\n\nThe intensity of the AMOC has declined over time2, a trend traced to polar ice melt, changes in wind patterns and precipitation changes linked to climate change. Although scientists agree that the collapse of the AMOC would have devastating consequences for local and regional climates, they are divided on whether and when such an event would occur.\n\nStudies of the AMOC’s future generally rely on analyses of its past behaviour and on models that simulate future scenarios under different climate conditions. Some have concluded that the AMOC would reach a tipping point sometime between 2025 and 2095, then abruptly shut down3. Other research indicates that a collapse is unlikely before the end of the century2, but scientists had not previously identified the factors that might be stopping it from happening.\n\nA passel of models\n\nBaker and his team used 34 climate models to examine how the AMOC might respond to 2 extreme scenarios: a four-fold increase in carbon-dioxide levels from pre-industrial levels; and the addition of massive amounts of freshwater, consistent with the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The team found that the AMOC would weaken in both scenarios, but not collapse.",

          "title": "US universities curtail PhD admissions amid Trump science funding cuts",
          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "Some universities across the United States are reducing or halting their PhD admissions because of federal-funding uncertainties stemming from actions taken by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Few universities have released public statements about their strategies, so prospective graduate students have remained mostly in the dark about which institutions are cutting back. Nature spoke to several young scientists caught up in the confusion. Some have received e-mails from universities indicating that they would have been accepted if not for funding uncertainties; others have been told that programmes are completely paused.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, some prospective students even received informal offers to join the graduate programme, only to later have them rescinded, according to the institution’s newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian.\n\n“The whole thing is horrendous,” says a professor at the university, who requested anonymity because they are involved in admissions. “They’re cutting the heart of the intellectual mission of the university.” The university did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the centre of most of the turmoil is the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), which, with an annual budget of US$47 billion, is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research. Funding of NIH research grants has mostly been frozen for the past month, owing to actions taken by the Trump administration to reduce federal spending. The freeze has persisted despite a federal judge’s order to release the money. Separately, under Trump, the NIH has attempted to slash the rate paid to US research institutions for the ‘overhead costs’ that, for instance, keep electricity on and pay the rent in researchers’ workspaces. The agency proposed cutting the rate from between 40% and 70% to a flat 15% — a potential loss of billions of dollars for universities. A coalition of universities, as well as the attorneys-general of 22 states sued to halt the policy, which they say is illegal, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it from taking effect.\n\nBecause of the dearth of information from universities curtailing their admissions, researchers have crowdsourced information about affected institutions on social media. Nature contacted nearly 30 universities from one list of programmes, posted to the platform Bluesky, to verify the information. Some, such as the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, confirmed they had paused admissions. Others, including Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, said that their cuts were not made in response to the current federal-funding situation. More than 60% did not reply.\n\nUncertain futures\n\nAlthough many of the affected programmes are in the biomedical sciences, as reporting in STAT has detailed, uncertainty about federal funds exists across a number of disciplines. A prospective PhD student who applied to the physics programme at the University of Arizona in Tucson received a temporary rejection e-mail, which they shared with Nature. “We are truly impressed by your outstanding academic record,” the correspondence states, but “recent uncertainties in U.S. federal funding policies have significantly impacted our admissions process. At this time, we are unable to extend an offer to you, despite your strong ranking in our applicant pool”. The University of Arizona did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPostdocs and PhD students hit hard by Trump’s crackdown on science\n\n“It’s awfully demoralizing,” says the prospective student who, along with others interviewed for this story, requested anonymity out of fear for their admissions opportunities. “I feel terrible for the departments, too, whose professors spent so much time reading applications and picking out their new students only to find out they cannot be funded. I think everyone has had the rug completely pulled out from under them.” The student says they are thankful to have got into other programmes.\n\nBut not every student has been so lucky. One who applied to a social-sciences programme at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, received an informal offer of acceptance in January. Three weeks later, they received a letter from the school stating that admissions for the programme had been paused for the year. “Right now I don’t have any offers, and I’m not sure if I want to stay in research or not,” they say. Vanderbilt did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome universities have also stopped and restarted admissions in the past few weeks, creating more confusion. For instance, a student working in the post-baccalaureate programme at the NIH had applied to be a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh. They received a letter from the university on 24 February that said it was suspending admission of all graduate students. One day later, the university told Nature that the pause has now been lifted. “Our goal is to properly support existing community members while also responsibly adding new members to the community,” a spokesperson says.",

Although international funding does not seem to be specifically threatened by the latest NIH policy changes, some overseas researchers say that concerns about the future of the agency’s funding has spurred them to seek support from other sources.\n\nRevealed: NIH research grants still frozen despite lawsuits challenging Trump order\n\n“The global research endeavour is enormously complex and enormously interdependent, and if a big part of it starts sputtering, the whole thing slows down,” says Ethan Scott, a neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who is a lead investigator on an NIH grant. “It’s difficult to overstate the degree to which the US NIH is one of the major engines behind global biomedical research.”\n\nGrants frozen\n\nAs part of efforts to slash US government spending and bureaucracy, the Trump administration has implemented policies that freeze NIH funding and grant reviews. This month, the NIH said it would slash funding for indirect costs, which pay for necessities such as electricity and waste removal at US research institutions. It proposed cutting the rate from an average of around 40% to 15% of grant awards — although the policy is facing legal challenge.\n\nOn its website, the NIH lists 811 grants to international teams in more than 60 countries, together worth more than $340 million. The nations with the most awards are South Africa, Canada and the United Kingdom. Grant sizes range from a few thousand dollars to $7 million.\n\nThe policy developments “cast a shadow across future planning”, especially for international collaborations involving interdisciplinary research, says Scott, whose grant looks at how the brain of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) processes visual and auditory information. The NIH has “a very generous and outward-looking policy” of funding researchers overseas, grounded in a philosophy of expanding knowledge and advancing medical research, he says. “The uncertainty that arises for international researchers is whether the NIH will consider continuing to send money overseas.”\n\n‘Devastating’ cuts to NIH grants by Trump’s team put on hold by US judge\n\nInternational collaborations\n\nA researcher in Australia who uses genomic techniques to study health equity and prostate cancer spent their Christmas holiday applying for non-US grants as a backup for the millions of dollars they receive from the NIH and the US Department of Defense. The researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of fears about their project’s future, says that the collaboration involves some 50 research staff in Australia, the United States and several African countries, among others. “This year I was meant to take a break and just enjoy doing research,” they say. “Instead of taking a break, I’ve just been writing every grant I possibly can,” — for funding from agencies in countries including Australia and the United Kingdom — “anywhere but America”.\n\nThe scientist says that applying for other grants could make those application pools more competitive.",

          "authors": "Elisabeth Sweetman",
          "abstract": "Ukrainian researchers hope that research-funding reforms will revitalize the innovation sector.Credit: Ukrinform/Shutterstock\n\nUndaunted by the turmoil of the Russian invasion, the European Union has scaled up its presence in the Ukrainian research sector, establishing funding channels and offices in Kyiv. Scientists hope that these moves will drive reforms in Ukraine’s research-funding system and breathe new life into its struggling innovation sector.\n\nSince a Horizon Europe office was opened in Kyiv in late 2023, some norms have been beginning to shift, but the pace is slow because of the ongoing war. In 2024, for the first time, applications for grants at Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science took into account European values such as gender balance, open science and the impact of results on society, says Ganna Tolstanova, vice-rector for research at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. If these developments gain momentum, a new era of Ukrainian research could be in sight.\n\nEU support for Ukrainian research includes three initiatives, launched in December 2023: a Kyiv-based office for Horizon Europe, the EU’s research and innovation (R&I) programme; a commitment to award funding to at least 200 Ukrainian ‘deep-tech’ start-up companies; and a technology and innovation hub in Kyiv. The hub is one of 16 such initiatives that have been opened across central, eastern and southern Europe to boost connections between local businesses, education authorities and researchers.\n\nIn addition to the almost €59 million (US$62 million) in funding that Ukrainian research has so far received through Horizon Europe, the EU says it intends to increase its presence in the country to drive wide-ranging cultural changes in the research sector. “Ukraine’s successful integration into the EU R&I ecosystem will require large-scale policy reforms,” a Council of the European Union memorandum announced in 2023.\n\nFor Tolstanova, the opportunity for Ukraine to emulate the relative transparency and efficiency of the EU’s research-funding system would would be a game-changer. The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has announced plans for a comprehensive review of the country’s research infrastructure, including auditing all research institutions to determine the current state of their research practices.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nThese audits have not yet started, and nor has the wider review, owing to the continuing conflict with Russia. As of late 2023, almost 20% of Ukraine’s scientists had left the country1. Power outages occur for several hours each day — often without warning — and at least 35% of the research infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. According to Peter Berczik, who runs the Department of Physics of Stars and Galaxies at the Main Astronomical Observatory of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU) in Kyiv, the entire antenna system of the Radio Astronomy Institute in Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, was destroyed during the Russian occupation in 2022.\n\nBerczik says Horizon Europe is much more than a fund; its support could help to revitalize Ukrainian R&I by promoting competitiveness and fairness in how grants are allocated. But this will be no small feat. Ukrainians themselves will have to untangle the ageing roots of the research system to make a lasting difference, says Berczik. “Horizon Europe can be a first step, but it will not solve our problems. These are deep and go back more than 30 years.”\n\nDigging up old roots\n\nBerczik’s institution, NASU, is foremost in the minds of Ukrainian researchers who want to see changes in funding allocation. As Ukraine’s premier national research organization, NASU is the target of much criticism, and some scientists see it as antiquated and ineffective.\n\nNASU lacks transparency in how it handles grant applications, and information is sometimes obscured from researchers who might want to apply, one scientist who requested anonymity told Nature Index. The problem, they say, is that funding decisions are made by the directors of individual NASU centres, without involving the wider departments. Information about funding competitions often takes a long time to reach departments, says the scientist, so there is often no time left to submit an application. They note that some of the people who had key roles in allocating funding and managing grant applications have left Ukraine.\n\nBerczik, too, is concerned by what he sees as a lack of accountability and objectivity in funding decisions at NASU, and a stubborn culture of closed networks that makes it difficult for young researchers to progress. NASU did not respond to Nature Index’s requests for comment.\n\nLow salaries for researchers make the funding issue particularly contentious. NASU data show that the gross monthly salaries of PhD staff at NASU institutions amount to around €460, before tax and pension deductions. Researchers have to save their own money to cover the costs of publishing in top research journals. According to Berczik, some of these publications charge around £2,500 (US$3,100) per paper. Funding for scientists who win foreign grants from bilateral projects with EU countries, such as Poland, Lithuania and Austria, pays mainly for research done in the collaborating country. Moreover, the funding excludes accommodation, equipment and food.\n\nUkraine seeks to resume its role in cancer clinical trials\n\nSome Ukrainian research organizations are improving the competitiveness of the grant-application process, according to Tolstanova. She says the National Research Foundation of Ukraine (NRF) in Kyiv, a state budgetary institution established in 2018, is a good example of this. However, the bureaucracy in Ukraine can be oppressive, Tolstanova adds, which means that any improvements will take time. “There’s a lot of paperwork and restrictions.”\n\nFor example, researchers in Ukraine must justify each unit of chemical reagent or other consumables in agreements for research grants from the NRF, says Tolstanova. Any subsequent requirements trigger extra individual requests, creating further administrative burdens. By contrast, Tolstanova cites typical research-procurement processes at EU universities, which require the principal investigator to calculate costs across broad categories, such as equipment, travel expenses and event organization.\n\nThat said, the rigour of the process under the supervision of principal investigators at the NRF maximizes accountability for research, says Tolstanova. “I am confident that every penny of the NRF funding spent on science is spent for the intended purpose, and that the pricing is justified.” One advantage of the current system at the NRF is that government officials — rather than senior academics, as is the case at NASU — assess and award grant proposals. This brings more objectivity to the process, says Tolstanova.",

          "authors": "Jian-Wei Pan",
          "abstract": "In fields such as computing, information security and precise measurement, quantum systems promise to outperform classical ones. And there’s been much progress over the century since the formulation of quantum mechanics.\n\nQuantum computers have reached the ‘quantum advantage’ milestone: they are able to solve problems that classical supercomputers cannot. And one method of secure communication, quantum cryptography, uses keys that are known only to the parties involved — a form of unconditional security, which means the protection cannot be broken even with unlimited computer power.\n\nHow to introduce quantum computers without slowing economic growth\n\nQuantum sensors are measuring both time and gravity with unprecedented precision. For instance, gravimeters for detecting earthquakes and for navigation are already commercially available.\n\nHowever, other than these encryption devices and quantum sensors, few quantum technologies have practical applications. In the next few years, quantum simulations will probably advance fields such as quantum chemistry and high-temperature superconductivity. The community is making progress, but the development of noise-resilient quantum computers that can be used for a wide range of problems will take another 10–15 years. Current challenges include protecting the fragile states of quantum bits (qubits) from errors and unwanted interference from the environment.\n\nThree steps would help to spur the field.\n\nFirst, calm down the quantum-computing hype. As a quantum physicist with more than 30 years of experience, I’ve seen how oversold promises have attracted a lot of capital and attention but can lead to unrealistic expectations. Some companies suggest that they can provide quantum-computing services, for example, when they have merely demonstrated small-scale quantum algorithms.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nExaggerated claims can mislead the public and investors and undermine societal confidence in quantum information technology. For example, January saw a collective plunge in quantum-computing stocks, triggering concerns that this technology bubble has now burst.\n\nTo prevent such stock-market jitters, academic and industrial research communities, as well as the media, must accurately communicate the state of quantum technology to the public, to foster realistic expectations.\n\nSecond, stable and long-term government investment is essential for the continued advancement of quantum information technology. Unlike mature technologies, such as the Internet or mobile phones, quantum information research cannot yet rely fully on market-driven financing.\n\nGovernments in the United States, Europe and China have increased their investments in quantum information research and development over the past few years. For example, the US National Quantum Initiative invested US$3.75 billion in 2023 — nearly triple its five-year budget of $1.3 billion (see go.nature.com/3cw6qtr). The next budget is in the process of being reauthorized, with a plan to allocate $2.7 billion over five years. But the eventual investment might be higher.",

This area is a volcanic peninsula, and although there’s a lot of precipitation, most of the water passes through the rocks and flows underground to the sea. So the places where fresh water is available, such as the lake in Sandgerði, attract a lot of birds.\n\nOur project is to screen for strains of avian influenza (bird flu) to study how they spread. We focus on certain species of gull with migration paths that overlap here.\n\nLesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus) breed in Iceland during the summertime, and in the winter they migrate to Europe or West Africa. By contrast, the Iceland gull (Larus glaucoides) breeds farther north, in Greenland or Canada, but returns to Iceland for winter. Then there are the local ones, such as the great black-backed gull (Larus marinus) and the glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), that are here all year round.\n\nAll of that mixing means that Iceland is a key location for avian influenza viruses from Europe to move into North America, and vice versa.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Cambricon's Cambrian-1 chip uses a computing architecture specially designed for an artificial-intelligence technique known as deep learning.Credit: Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nChina is now producing most of the basic research that could underpin future computing hardware, an analysis has found. If that work develops into commercial applications, the United States might soon find it impossible to use export controls to retain its competitive advantage in high-performance microchip design and production, the authors say.\n\nAlthough the study’s findings do not mean that China is currently leading this field, “arguably, it’s showing us where things are headed”, says Zachary Arnold, a lead analyst at the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO) at Georgetown University in Washington DC, which performed the analysis.\n\nThe study, published on 3 March, finds that between 2018 and 2023, research papers on chip design and fabrication included authors affiliated with Chinese institutions more than twice as often as they did US ones. And it wasn’t just a matter of quantity: China also excelled when it came to highly cited papers. Chinese-affiliated authors co-authored 50% of papers that were in the top 10% most cited for their publication year. That compared with 22% for US-affiliated authors and 17% for those associated with European institutions.\n\nSuch research spans a wide range of academic disciplines, and encompasses everything from conventional computer chips and fast graphics-processing units optimized for artificial intelligence (AI) to completely new architectures. To find and collate relevant papers for their study, analysts at the ETO had to train a machine-learning algorithm. Their analysis captures mainly emerging chip technology, rather than commercial advances, which are often incremental and proprietary, says Arnold.\n\nThe study included only papers with English-language abstracts; for Chinese-authored papers, these are more likely to be those with international reach. China has been boosting its research output in many fields, Arnold says. “But I don’t know if we’ve seen a field where there is quite this difference,” he adds. “When you see so much activity, it’s hard to imagine that [won’t] have an effect on China’s technological capability and ultimately manufacturing capability in the coming years.”\n\nAcademic impact\n\nThe findings chime with what Yunji Chen sees on the ground in China. Chen, who heads up the State Key Laboratory of Processors in Beijing and is a co-founder of Cambricon, a company that designs chips optimized for AI, says that the country’s manufacturing ability lags behind its chip design, partly as a result of US export controls.\n\nStarting in October 2022, the US Department of Commerce began to prohibit the sale to China of certain advanced chips and manufacturing equipment. The US government said it was acting, in part, because China was using AI capabilities to “monitor, track, and surveil their own citizens, and fuel its military modernization”.",

          "abstract": "After earning degrees in mathematics and physics, Ewan Kirk pivoted into entrepreneurship.Credit: Isaac Raymond\n\nIn 2023, technology entrepreneur and early-stage investor Ewan Kirk joined the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge, UK, as its first Royal Society entrepreneur in residence.\n\nKirk helps staff and students to better understand business and entrepreneurship, offering them practical advice and support in launching companies, attracting funding and investment and collaborating with industry partners.\n\nHe talks about the role, the history of his entrepreneurial career and why the United Kingdom needs to do more to retain talent in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) if it is to remain a science superpower.\n\nTell us about your entrepreneur-in-residence role.\n\nOne of the first things I did after being appointed was to plan and deliver a lecture series that included practical advice on how to turn an idea into a business, give a presentation pitch and fund and grow a new enterprise.\n\nI also ran a series of drop-in sessions, during which people could discuss their ideas, ask for career or interview advice or talk about their next steps after earning their PhD.\n\nSometimes, faculty members will connect me with a postdoc who wants to talk about a piece of technology they have developed, and whether there is a commercial angle. They might be an international specialist in an incredibly complex area of mathematics or physics. These conversations are always intellectually demanding for me — but the real challenge is in working out how to turn an interesting technology into a commercial enterprise.\n\nWhat types of question do you get asked by budding maths entrepreneurs?\n\nSome things are relatively simple, such as, “How do you start a company?” Some aspects of entrepreneurship are domain-specific, but there’s also a lot of commonality — forecasting your cash flows, hiring employees, understanding your customers, forward planning, raising money and selling your product to a customer or to an investor.\n\nI advise people to refine their message. The fundamental question for every potential investor is, “How and when do you expect to make money?”\n\nA big challenge for early-stage entrepreneurs is raising money. I see an enormous number of company pitch decks — slide-format presentations made to pitch ideas to investors — both in my entrepreneur-in-residence role and through DeepTech Labs, which I started in 2020 in conjunction with Cambridge Innovation Capital, a venture-capital company, and the university.\n\nWhy postdocs need entrepreneurship training\n\nDeepTech Labs invests in early-stage technology companies and runs a 10-week programme to help them bridge the gap between early-stage pre-seed funding (which gets the company off the ground) and a larger series A funding round. We select five or six at a time, and the programme includes sessions on developing a strategic roadmap, value proposition and fundraising strategies, and building high-performing teams.\n\nPeople generally don’t think about how to pitch their business. They’re often excited about their own technology, but an investor has to see some kind of exit, or an opportunity to realize a return on their investment.\n\nWhat specific skills do mathematicians have that can help to nurture entrepreneurial instincts?\n\nMathematics is fundamental to absolutely everything, from particle physics to economics. The current interest in artificial intelligence (AI) — which is fundamentally just a branch of statistics — ensures that maths is at the cutting edge of the economy. Not only is maths a fundamental part of science, but mathematical training produces smart thinkers who have a lot to offer academia, businesses and society in general.\n\nI explain to mathematicians, statisticians and theoretical physicists that being able to control, program and understand computer networks is an incredibly valuable skill. ‘Data are the new oil’ is a cliché, but it’s true. And in most commercial jobs, you have to weigh up uncertainty or find ways to prove things, which is precisely what mathematicians and statisticians are trained to do.\n\nPresenting your ideas and convincing the audience of your conclusions are crucial skills. One of the most common mistakes made by people transitioning from academia to the commercial world is to present their work as if they are presenting an academic paper.\n\nIn fact, most people, including investors and customers, just want to hear the conclusion. Presenting is an essential skill that start-up candidates need.\n\nTell us about your own entrepreneurial career journey.\n\nI grew up in Cumbernauld, a town in west Scotland. I couldn’t play football, so my only option was to go down the academic route.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor’s degree in natural philosophy and astronomy at the University of Glasgow, UK, I was admitted to the University of Cambridge to do Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, a one-year master’s-level taught course, followed by a PhD in general relativity at the University of Southampton, UK.\n\nThe business of science\n\nI was always very interested in learning to program, and while earning my PhD, a friend and I created a software package, called MicroDraft, for Amstrad, which was a UK consumer-electronics company. To commercialize it, we formed a company called DaLEK Software.\n\nBack then, there was little to no support for entrepreneurs, so we pretty much had to work out everything ourselves, such as company formation, accounting and marketing.\n\nIt was a good but frustrating experience. We finally sold the rights to the software, and I think that experience really sparked my interest in entrepreneurship.\n\nI’d realized after earning my PhD that academic research wasn’t for me: I was good, but definitely not good enough to make a career as a researcher in the general theory of relativity.\n\nIn 1989, I went to work for a consultancy called Scientific Generics in Cambridge, as its director of innovation. The company, now called Sagentia Innovation, provided a great introduction to entrepreneurship and technology in a commercial environment.\n\nThree years later, I got a call from the investment bank Goldman Sachs, inviting me to interview for a position. During my interview, I was asked about programming for quantitative analysis, which involves using complex mathematical and statistical modelling to analyse financial markets. They offered me a job as a strategist on the commodities desk, based in London, despite my lack of knowledge about the industry.\n\nAfter a discussion with a colleague in the London currencies department, I started building software and creating models to price commodity derivatives, financial tools that allow an investor to profit from a commodity without owning it.\n\nAfter a few years there was a group of nearly 30 mathematicians and programmers who were writing the software and the models for the commodity-trading group, and eventually we gained a dominant position in that market. I was promoted to partner at Goldman in 2000; in 2005, I retired from the firm and I travelled around the world with my family.\n\nI then started a systematic hedge fund, which uses algorithms to trade financial instruments on the basis of quantitative data, called Cantab Capital Partners.\n\nThe company initially employed just a few people in a small office in Cambridge. We wanted to be the geekiest, most technologically advanced trading firm we could be — and five years later, we were managing US$5 billion.",

Nature has now confirmed with several sources that the US State Department delegation is not attending the meeting, which is slated to end with the adoption of an outline for the panel’s seventh climate assessment, due for completion by late 2029. The IPCC assessments, which are the gold-standard guide to the pace and effects of climate change, are used by governments to shape their climate policies.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nNASA has also cancelled a contract that funded a team including scientists and others to provide administrative and technical support to the climate-assessment effort, says a US official who is familiar with the situation but asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press. The team would have supported Calvin and her co-chair, Joy Jacqueline Pereira, a geologist at the University Kebangsaan Malaysia in Bangi. The cancellation was reported by the Washington Post and independently confirmed by Nature. A NASA spokesperson said that the move was prompted by guidance “to eliminate non-essential consulting contracts”.\n\nThe absence of the US delegation from the meeting “is obviously a loss for the international community”, says Li Shuo, the director of the Asia Society Policy Institute’s China Climate Hub in Washington DC. “The US plays an important role in the IPCC process, contributing both financial and intellectual support.”\n\nIPCC spokesperson Andrej Mahecic declined to comment, except to say that the organization has not received official notification of any decisions regarding a change in status of the technical support team. For now, the process is moving forwards, he says.\n\nNASA officials confirmed that Calvin would not be attending the meeting in China but declined to make her available for an interview. The White House referred Nature’s queries to the State Department; officials there declined to comment.\n\nOutsized role\n\nThe United States has historically made substantial scientific and monetary contributions to the IPCC. US scientists publish research that informs the assessment and run computer simulations of the climate that feed into it. For the seventh report, Calvin was co-chairing one of three IPCC working groups; hers was assessing the scientific literature on options to reduce emissions and halt global warming.\n\nCalvin’s support team would have helped with everything from reviewing the literature and designing graphics for the final IPCC report to managing travel logistics. The group was funded by a NASA contract but situated in the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), a White House organization that coordinates climate work across federal agencies. That contract has now been ended, according to the US official. “We don’t know if Kate will be allowed to continue as a co-chair” of the working group, they said.\n\n“It would be a real shame if the administration pulled Kate out of that role, not just for her, but for the US,” says Andy Miller, who was one of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s liaisons to the USGCRP, until his retirement in December. “And it would be a loss for IPCC to lose someone of Kate’s calibre.”\n\nScramble to recover",

          "authors": "Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "Credit: photos777/Getty\n\nChina’s highest court has called for a crack down on the activities of paper mills, businesses that churn out fraudulent or poor-quality manuscripts and sell authorships. Some researchers are cautiously optimistic that the court’s guidance will help curb the use of these services, while others think the impact will be minimal.\n\n“This is the first time the supreme court has issued guidance on paper mills and on scientific fraud,” says Wang Fei, who studies research-integrity policy at Dalian University of Technology in China.\n\nPaper mills sell suspect research and authorships to researchers who want journal articles to burnish their CVs. They are a significant contributor to overall research misconduct, particularly in China.\n\nLast month, the the Supreme People’s Court published a set of guiding opinions on technology innovation. Among the list of 25 articles, one called for lower courts to crack down on ‘paper industry chains’, and for research fraud to be severely punished.\n\nOver the past decade, the Chinese government has issued regulations and policies to deter researchers from committing misconduct, including the use of paper mills, and has directed research institutions to investigate and punish researchers involved. But paper mills have largely continued, says Yin Bo, a lawyer and criminal-justice researcher at China University of Political Science and Law, in Beijing.\n\n“Paper mills are very popular in China and there is a very huge business” involving them, says Gengyan Tang, who studies research integrity in China at the University of Calgary, Canada.\n\nThe guidelines issued by the supreme court are very important and signal that the courts will contribute to creating a fairer research ecosystem, says Yin, who also runs an online course on research integrity at Beijing Normal University.\n\nGrowing caseload\n\nThere have been an increasing number of cases involving paper mills in lower courts. In a search of a public database of court judgments, Tang identified 41 cases involving ghostwriting services between 2013 and 2024. The reports, shared with Nature, include some civil cases involving contract disputes, such as researchers who paid for writing and other academic publishing services from paper mills or individuals who didn’t fulfil their contracts.\n\nIn response to the government’s goal of reducing research misconduct, the way in which the lower courts adjudicate cases involving paper mills has changed over the past decade, says Yin. Some six or seven years ago, the courts would have considered contracts signed with paper mills as valid and warranting protection, he says. But courts now deem them invalid, recognizing that these contracts violate standards of research integrity and a fair system of evaluation and promotion, as described in several government policies.\n\nIn one case from 2023, a salesperson for a media company contacted an academic on the Chinese social-media platform, WeChat to offer academic ghostwriting services. The salesperson wrote that the cost of getting an article published in an established Chinese journal within two months was 16,200 yuan (US$2,200), paid in three instalments. The salesperson guaranteed a ’plagiarism score’ of less than 10%, and a full refund if the article couldn’t be published.\n\nBut after receipt of the first instalment, the salesperson went silent. More than a year later, the academic took the company to court, where a judge deemed that since writing and distributing papers on behalf of someone else “violates the principles of academic integrity and public order and good morals”, the contract between the two parties was invalid. Therefore, the media company had to return the 6,000 yuan instalment it had received.\n\n“In most instances, paper mills were simply required to refund the fees paid by researchers,” says Tang.\n\nBut in cases that were considered criminal because they involved fraud, public prosecutors took individuals offering academic writing and publishing services, with no intention of delivering, to court for scamming or deceiving researchers. In cases where fraud was involved, penalties were more severe and included fines or even prison sentences.\n\nMore severe punishments\n\nSome of the harshest language in the supreme court’s guidance was reserved for paper mills, says Wang. As a result, she expects that “paper mills in China will be punished more severely”.",

We found significant consistency across participants in their memory for voice clips and for speakers across different utterances. Regression models incorporating both low-level (for example, fundamental frequency) and high-level (for example, dialect) voice properties were significantly predictive of memorability and generalized out of sample, supporting an inherent memorability of speakers’ voices. These results provide strong evidence that listeners are similar in the voices they remember, which can be reliably predicted by quantifiable low-level acoustic features.",

          "abstract": "Mentoring is a key component of scientific achievements, contributing to overall measures of career success for mentees and mentors. Within the scientific community, possessing a large research group is often perceived as an indicator of exceptional mentorship and high-quality research. However, such large, competitive groups may also escalate dropout rates, particularly among early-career researchers. Overly high dropout rates of young researchers may lead to severe postdoc shortage and loss of top-tier academics in contemporary academia. In this context, we collect longitudinal genealogical data on mentor–mentee relations and their publications, and analyse the influence of a mentor’s group size on the future academic longevity and performance of their mentees. Our findings indicate that mentees trained in larger groups tend to exhibit superior academic performance compared with those from smaller groups, provided they remain in academia post graduation. However, we also observe two surprising patterns: academic survival rate is significantly lower for (1) mentees from larger groups and for (2) mentees with more productive mentors. The trend is verified in institutions of different prestige levels. These findings highlight a negative correlation between a mentor’s success and the academic survival rate of their mentees, prompting a rethinking of effective mentorship and offering actionable insights for career advancement.",

We do not find evidence of positive causal effects of both maternal and paternal age at first birth on children’s test scores at age 10 years once the children’s PGI and correlations among different PGIs are controlled for. We therefore conclude that our results do not provide evidence in favour of sociological theories that predict positive causal effects of parental age on children’s educational attainment.",

The cognitive and neural mechanisms of speech inhibition are not well understood.

Neural recordings revealed distinct activity in the premotor frontal cortex correlated with stopping speech. This activity was found in largely separate cortical sites from regions encoding vocal tract articulatory movements. Moreover, this activity primarily occurred with abrupt stopping in the middle of an utterance, rather than naturally completing a phrase. Electrocortical stimulation at many premotor sites with inhibitory stop activity caused involuntary speech arrest, which contradicts previous clinical interpretations of this effect as evidence for critical centres of speech production.

          "abstract": "Death anxiety (DA), apprehension when thinking about death, has long been associated with distress. Studies have suggested that DA may transdiagnostically contribute to mental disorders. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, aiming to estimate the relationship between DA and distress or symptoms of mental disorders. The included studies reported the correlation between DA and distress or symptoms of mental disorders, across general population and clinical samples, using previously validated measures for all outcomes. PsychInfo and the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection (via EBSCO), Embase, and Medline (via PubMed) were systematically searched up to 30 October 2023. Study quality was evaluated with the Study Quality Assessment Tools (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute). A total of 129 studies were included, reporting on 158 independent samples, for a total of 34,147 participants. Most studies were rated as poor quality. The findings indicated consistently positive associations between DA and distress outcomes (general anxiety: r = 0.42, P < 0.001; depression: r = 0.41, P < 0.001; distress: r = 0.36, P < 0.001). Heterogeneity was substantial, and prediction intervals crossed zero for all outcomes, except for anxiety and distress. We found no moderation by DA measure, sample type or the proportion of women in the sample. However, the association was stronger (t(35.37) = −2.055, P = 0.047) when medical conditions were present (r = 0.48, P < 0.001) than when they were absent (r = 0.37, P < 0.001). There was evidence of small-study effects, indicating possible publication bias. DA should be investigated in longitudinal studies across diverse samples of patients to clarify its contribution to psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Faced with a dangerous epidemic humans will spontaneously social distance to reduce their risk of infection at a socioeconomic cost. Compartmentalized epidemic models have been extended to include this endogenous decision making: Individuals choose their behavior to optimize a utility function, self-consistently giving rise to population behavior. Here, we study the properties of the resulting Nash equilibria, in which no member of the population can gain an advantage by unilaterally adopting different behavior. We leverage an analytic solution that yields fully time-dependent rational population behavior to obtain, 1) a simple relationship between rational social distancing behavior and the current number of infections; 2) scaling results for how the infection peak and number of total cases depend on the cost of contracting the disease; 3) characteristic infection costs that divide regimes of strong and weak behavioral response; 4) a closed form expression for the value of the utility. We discuss how these analytic results provide a deep and intuitive understanding of the disease dynamics, useful for both individuals and policymakers. In particular, the relationship between social distancing and infections represents a heuristic that could be communicated to the population to encourage, or “bootstrap,” rational behavior.",

However, the varying degrees of epidemiological dominance among different lineages or clades of H9N2 AIVs have not been fully clarified. The matrix protein M1, a key structural component of the virion, plays a crucial role in maintaining the viral structure and lifecycle. To elucidate the intrinsic relationship between the genetic patterns of M1 and the adaptive dynamics of H9N2 AIVs, this study focused on the five major evolutionary patterns of M1 and conducted in vitro and in vivo investigations from the perspectives of vRNP release after viral uncoating, polymerase activity, mRNA and vRNA levels, the nuclear export of vRNPs, plasma membrane–binding capacity, proliferation capacity, growth competitiveness, and transmission potential. The results revealed a strong correlation between the epidemiological dominance of H9N2 AIVs and the specific patterns of M1, with M1 P5 standing out as particularly significant. This finding highlights the pivotal influence of the M1 gene patterns on the replication and transmission dynamics of H9N2 AIVs, thereby offering valuable insights into the mechanisms driving differences in adaptive evolution and shifts in epidemiological dominance within the H9N2 AIV population.",

          "abstract": "The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) generates a direct current photocurrent under uniform irradiation and is a nonlinear optical effect traditionally studied in noncentrosymmetric materials. The two main origins of BPVE are the shift and injection currents, arising from transitions in electron position and electron velocity during optical excitation, respectively. Recently, it was proposed that photon-drag effects could unlock BPVE in centrosymmetric materials. However, experimental progress remains limited. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of photon-drag effects inducing BPVE (photon-drag BPVE). Notably, we find that photon-drag BPVE can be directly linked to quantum geometric tensors. Additionally, we propose that photon-drag shift currents can be fully isolated from other current contributions in nonmagnetic centrosymmetric materials. We apply our theory explicitly to the 2D topological insulator 1 T ′ -WTe 2 . Furthermore, we investigate photon-drag BPVE in a centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal, where we demonstrate that linearly polarized light generates photon-drag shift currents.",

In this paper, we report that vimentin forms liquid condensates which appear to enable rapid filament growth. Given the transient nature of these droplets, we focus on properties of vimentin-Y117L, which has a point mutation that leads to formation of condensates but not IFs, enabling us to study these droplets in detail. The droplets dissolve under 1,6-Hexanediol treatment and under decreasing concentration, confirming that they are liquid, and phase separated. These condensates extensively wet actin stress fibers, rendering them resistant to actin-binding drugs and protecting them from depolymerization. We show similar behavior occurs in wild-type vimentin during its assembly into filaments.",

          "abstract": "NASA’s Kepler mission identified over 4,000 extrasolar planets that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. This sample has revealed detailed features in the demographics of planet sizes and orbital spacings. However, knowledge of their orbital shapes—a key tracer of planetary formation and evolution—remains far more limited. We present measurements of eccentricities for 1,646 Kepler planets, 92% of which are smaller than Neptune. For all planet sizes, the eccentricity distribution peaks at e = 0 and falls monotonically toward zero at e = 1. As planet size increases, mean population eccentricity rises from ⟨ e ⟩ = 0.05 ± 0.01 for small planets to ⟨ e ⟩ = 0.20 ± 0.03 for planets larger than ∼3.5 Earth-radii R ⊕ . The overall planet occurrence rate and planet-metallicity correlation also change abruptly at this size. Taken together, these patterns indicate distinct formation channels for planets above and below ∼3.5 R ⊕ . We also find size-dependent associations between eccentricity, host star metallicity, and orbital period. While smaller planets generally have low eccentricities, there are hints of a noteworthy exception: eccentricities are slightly elevated in the “radius valley,” a narrow band of low occurrence rate density which separates rocky “super-Earths” (1.0 to 1.5 R ⊕ ) from gas-rich “sub-Neptunes” (2.0 to 3.0 R ⊕ ). We detect this feature at 2.1σ significance. Planets in single- and multitransiting systems exhibit the same size–eccentricity relationship, suggesting they are drawn from the same parent population.",

          "abstract": "In the polar regions, which are vulnerable receptors of mercury pollution, atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) efficiently convert elemental mercury (Hg(0)) into oxidized mercury (Hg(II)) via bromine oxidation. Hg(II) subsequently deposits onto snow and sea ice. While field observations have shown that a large percentage of deposited mercury is re-emitted from the ice to the atmosphere by a photoinduced process, the fundamental photochemistry that drives the re-emission process remains unknown. Here, using multiconfigurational quantum chemistry, we find that the photoreduction of HgBr 2 , HgBr 3 − , and HgBr 4 2− in ice is more efficient than in the gas phase. This results from the influence of water molecules on the molecular geometry and electronic structure of mercuric bromides in ice, which enhances the absorption intensities at wavelengths relevant in the troposphere (λ &gt; 290 nm), as compared to gas phase. Kinetic modeling shows that ~30 to 60% of deposited mercury in AMDEs can be reemitted due to the photoreduction of mercuric bromides in ice, in agreement with field observations. Our results reveal a photoreduction mechanism of sunlight-induced excited state chemistry of mercuric bromides on ice. These findings strongly suggest that this chemistry should be incorporated into atmospheric models to account for ice-atmosphere mercury cycling in the polar environments, currently not considered.",

          "abstract": "Pathogen-derived nuclear localization signals (NLSs) enable vigorous nuclear invasion in the host by the virulence proteins harboring them. Herein, inspired by the robust nuclear import mechanism, we show that NLSs originating from the plant infection–associated Agrobacterium proteins VirD2 and VirE2 can be incorporated into the Cas9 system as efficient nuclear delivery enhancers, thereby improving the low gene-editing frequency in a model microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , caused by poor nuclear localization of the bulky nuclease. Prior to evaluation of the NLSs, IPA1 (Cre04.g215850) was first defined in the alga as the nuclear import-related importin alpha (Impα) that serves as a counterpart adaptor protein of the NLSs, based on extensive in silico analyses considering the protein’s sequence, tertiary folding behavior, and structural basis when interacting with a well-studied SV40TAg NLS. Through precursive affinity explorations, we reproducibly found that the NLSs mediated the binding between the Cas9 and Impα with nM affinities and visually confirmed that the fusion of the NLSs strictly localized the peptide-bearing cargoes in the microalgal nucleus without compensating for their cleavage ability. When employed in a real-world application, the VirD2 NLS increases the mutation frequency (~1.12 × 10 −5 ) over 2.4-fold compared to an archetypal SV40TAg NLS (~0.46 × 10 −5 ) when fused with Cas9. We demonstrate the cross-species versatility of the Impα-dependent strategy by successfully applying it to an industrial alga, Chlorella Sp. HS2. This work, focused on affinity augmentation, provides insights into increasing the frequency of gene editing, which can be advantageously used in programmable mutagenesis with broad applicability.",

Wang et al ., Nat. Mat. 23, 492–498 (2024)]. This spontaneous intra-unit-cell orbital ordering, also known as electronic nematicity, breaks C 4 symmetry and is thought to arise from the Coulomb interaction (denoted by V pp ) between oxygen p x and p y electrons. In this work, we study the spontaneous emergence of electronic nematicity within the three-band Hubbard [aka the Emery-VSA (Varma-Schmitt-Rink-Abrahams) model], using cluster dynamical mean-field theory. This method incorporates short-range electronic correlations and gives us access to the density of states, a quantity that is directly probed in experiments. We argue that there is a delicate competition between V pp and V pd (the latter being the Coulomb interaction between copper d x 2 − y 2 and oxygen p x , y electrons) that must be taken into account in order to find a Zhang-Rice singlet band well-resolved from the upper Hubbard band, and a splitting of the charge-transfer band (one of the signatures of charge nematicity) by roughly 50 meV, as observed recently.",

TEX38 interacts and colocalizes with ZDHHC19, a testis-enriched acyltransferase catalyzing protein S-palmitoylation, at the plasma membrane of spermatids. ZDHHC19 and TEX38 are each downregulated in mouse testes lacking the other protein. TEX38 stabilizes and localizes ZDHHC19 to the plasma membrane of cultured cells and vice versa, consolidating their interdependence. Mice deficient in ZDHHC19 or harboring a C142S mutation that disables the palmitoyltransferase activity of ZDHHC19 display phenotypes resembling those of Tex38 KO mice. Strikingly, ZDHHC19 palmitoylates ARRDC5, an arrestin family protein regulating sperm differentiation. Overall, our findings indicate that TEX38 forms a stable complex with ZDHHC19 at the plasma membrane of spermatids, which governs downstream S-palmitoylation of proteins essential for morphological transformation of spermatids.",

          "abstract": "Sea otters are an iconic keystone predator that can maintain kelp forests by preying on grazing invertebrates such as sea urchins. However, the effects of sea otters on kelp forests vary over their geographic range. Here, we analyze two 30-y datasets on kelp forest communities during the reintroduction of sea otters along the west coast of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada, and around San Nicolas Island, CA. We developed a community model to estimate species interactions as dynamic rates, varying with community state. We find evidence of a classic trophic cascade off Vancouver Island; the arrival of otters quickly led to depletion of urchins and recovery of kelp. However, this cascade was muted around San Nicolas Island, with otters, urchins, and kelp all coexisting at intermediate densities for multiple years. Our models show that this difference came from a pulse of strong otter impacts on urchins following recolonization off Vancouver Island, but not off San Nicolas Island. The mean effects of otters on urchins and urchins on kelp were not stronger in the north, indicating that interaction dynamics and not average interaction strength are key to explaining differences in community trajectories. We also find stronger multistep interaction chains in the south, arising from competitive interactions that indirectly buffered otter effects. These findings shed light on long-standing hypotheses about how interspecific interactions can alter the function of keystone species across community contexts. More broadly, we show how community change can be more accurately predicted by considering dynamic interaction strengths.",

          "abstract": "Nucleotide sequence data are being harnessed to identify species, even in cases in which organisms themselves are neither in hand nor witnessed. But how genome-wide sequence divergence maps to species status is far from clear. While gene sequence divergence is commonly used to delineate bacterial species, its correspondence to established species boundaries has yet to be explored across eukaryotic taxa. Because the processes underlying gene flow differ fundamentally between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, these domains are likely to differ in the relationship between reproductive isolation and genome-wide sequence divergence. In prokaryotes, homologous recombination, the basis of gene flow, depends directly on the degree of genomic sequence divergence, whereas in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, reproductive incompatibility can stem from changes in very few genes. Guided by measures of genome-wide sequence divergence in bacteria, we gauge how genomic criteria correspond to species boundaries in eukaryotes. In recognized species of eukaryotes, levels of gene sequence divergence within species are typically very small, averaging &lt;1% across protein-coding regions in most animals, plants, and fungi. There are even instances in which divergence between sister species is the same or less than that among conspecifics. In contrast, bacterial species, defined as populations exchanging homologous genes, show levels of divergence both within and between species that are considerably higher. Although no single threshold delineates species, eukaryotic populations with &gt;1% genome-wide sequence divergence are likely separate species, whereas prokaryotic populations with 1% divergence are still able to recombine and thus can be considered the same species.",

          "abstract": "B cells generate pathogen-specific antibodies and play an essential role in providing adaptive protection against infection. Antibody genes are modified in evolutionary processes acting on the B cell populations within an individual. These populations proliferate, differentiate, and migrate to long-term niches in the body. However, the dynamics of these processes in the human immune system are primarily inferred from mouse studies. We addressed this gap by sequencing the antibody repertoire and transcriptomes from single B cells in four immune-rich tissues from six individuals. We find that B cells descended from the same pre-B cell (“lineages”) often colocalize within the same tissue, with the bone marrow harboring the largest excess of lineages without representation in other tissues. Within lineages, cells with different levels of somatic hypermutation are uniformly distributed among tissues and functional states. This suggests that the relative probabilities of localization and differentiation outcomes change negligibly during affinity maturation, and quantitatively agrees with a simple dynamical model of B cell differentiation. While lineages strongly colocalize, we find individual B cells nevertheless appear to make independent differentiation decisions. Proliferative antibody-secreting cells, however, deviate from these global patterns. These cells are often clonally expanded, their clones appear universally distributed among all sampled organs, and form lineages with an excess of cells of the same type. Collectively, our findings show the limits of peripheral blood monitoring of the immune repertoire, and provide a probabilistic model of the dynamics of antibody memory formation in humans.",

However, at micro- or nanometer scales, probe dynamics become inherently stochastic due to Brownian motion and complex interactions, leading to varied diffusion behaviors. Typically, analysis of such trajectory data involves certain moving-window operation and assumes the existence of some pseudo–steady states, particularly when evaluating predefined parameters or specific types of diffusion modes. Here, we introduce the stochastic particle-informed neural network (SPINN), a physics-informed deep learning framework that integrates stochastic differential equations to model and infer particle diffusion dynamics. The SPINN autonomously explores parameter spaces and distinguishes between deterministic and stochastic components with single-frame resolution. Using the anomalous diffusion dataset, we validated SPINN’s ability to reduce frame-to-frame variability while preserving key statistical correlations, allowing for accurate characterization of different stochastic processes. When applied to the diffusion of single gold nanorods in hydrogels, the SPINN revealed enhanced microrheological properties during hydrogel gelation and uncovered interfacial dynamics during dextran/tetra-PEG liquid–liquid phase separation. By improving the temporal resolution of stochastic dynamics, the SPINN facilitates the estimation and prediction of complex diffusion behaviors, offering insights into underlying physical mechanisms at mesoscopic scales.",

          "abstract": "Advances in sequencing technology have unveiled examples of nucleus-encoded polycistrons, once considered rare. Exclusively polycistronic transcripts are prevalent in green algae, although the mechanism by which multiple polypeptides are translated from a single transcript is unknown. Here, we used bioinformatic and in vivo mutational analyses to evaluate competing mechanistic models for translation of bicistronic mRNAs in green algae. High-confidence manually curated datasets of bicistronic loci from two divergent green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Auxenochlorella protothecoides , revealed a preference for weak Kozak-like sequences for ORF 1 and an underrepresentation of potential initiation codons before the ORF 2 start codon, which are suitable conditions for leaky ribosome scanning to allow ORF 2 translation. We used mutational analysis in A. protothecoides to test the mechanism. In vivo manipulation of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence and start codon altered reporter expression at ORF 2, with a weaker Kozak-like sequence enhancing expression and a stronger one diminishing it. A synthetic bicistronic dual reporter demonstrated inversely adjustable activity of green fluorescent protein expressed from ORF 1 and luciferase from ORF 2, depending on the strength of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence. Our findings demonstrate that translation of multiple ORFs in green algal bicistronic transcripts is consistent with episodic leaky scanning of ORF 1 to allow translation at ORF 2. This work has implications for the potential functionality of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) found across eukaryotic genomes and for transgene expression in synthetic biology applications.",

While surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy delays disease progression, these treatments do not lead to tumor control, and targeted therapies or biologics have failed to further improve survival. Utilizing a transient radiation-induced state of multipotency, we used the adenylcyclase activator forskolin to alter the fate of irradiated glioma cells. The effects of the combined treatment on neuronal marker expression, cell cycle distribution, and proliferation were studied. Gene expression profiling was conducted using bulk RNA-seq. Changes in cell populations were investigated using single-cell RNA-seq. Effects on glioma stem cells (GSCs) were studied in extreme limiting dilution assays, and the effects on median survival were studied in both syngeneic and PDOX mouse models of GBM. The combined treatment induced the expression of neuronal markers in glioma cells, reduced proliferation, and led to a distinct gene expression profile. scRNA-seq revealed that the combined treatment forced glioma cells into a microglia- and neuron-like phenotype. In vivo, this treatment led to a loss of GSCs and prolonged median survival. Collectively, our data suggest that revisiting a differentiation therapy with forskolin in combination with radiation could lead to clinical benefit.",

Seed exchange, hybridization, and cloning have played an essential role across their wild distribution from Mexico to South America to create the modern varieties of today. Archaeological sites with well-preserved and directly radiocarbon-dated botanical assemblages are rare, however, so we know very little about the complexities of the domestication process. Here, we define an early locus of avocado domestication using well-dated desiccated and carbonized avocado remains from El Gigante rockshelter in western Honduras spanning the last 11,000 y. Measurements of avocado seeds and rinds show evidence for long-term management resulting in selection for larger, more robust fruits through time that culminated by 2,250 to 2,080 calendar B.P. (cal. B.P.). However, human-directed selection for larger fruits with thicker rinds is evident as early as 7,565 to 7,265 cal. B.P. Seed morphology is similar to P. americana var. guatemalensis and is congruent with genetic data for the development of this variety in both the highlands of Guatemala and Honduras. Increases in seed size and rind thickness through time are consistent with genetic evidence for the enrichment of putative candidate genes for fruit development and ripening in this variety.",

The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess associations between long-term exposure to air pollutants and the risk of COVID-19 outcomes (infection, hospitalization, and death) in a COVID-19-naive cohort (n = 458,396). Additionally, associations between air pollutants and the risk of COVID-19 severity (hospitalization and death) were evaluated in a COVID-19 infection cohort (n = 110,216). Furthermore, this study investigated the role of host genetic susceptibility in the relationships between exposure to air pollutants and the development of COVID-19-related outcomes. Long-term exposure to air pollutants was significantly associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes in the COVID-19 naive cohort. Similarly, in COVID-19 infection cohort, hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 hospital admission were 1.23 (1.19, 1.27) for PM 2.5 and 1.22 (1.17, 1.26) for PM 10 , whereas HRs for COVID-19 death were 1.28 (1.18, 1.39) for PM 2.5 and 1.25 (1.16, 1.36) for PM 10 . Notably, significant interactions were found between PM 2.5 /PM 10 and genetic susceptibility in COVID-19 death. In COVID-19 infection cohort, participants with both high genetic risk and high air pollutants exposure had 1.86- to 1.97-fold and 1.91- to 2.14-fold higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death compared to those with both low genetic risk and low air pollutants exposure. Exposure to air pollution is significantly associated with an increased burden of severe COVID-19, and air pollution–gene interactions may play a crucial role in the development of COVID-19-related outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from its onset due to disease or trauma to either recovery or death is poorly understood. Currently, there are no generally accepted treatments aside from supportive care using mechanical ventilation. However, this can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which contributes to a 30 to 40% mortality rate. In this study, we develop and demonstrate a technique to quantify forms of energy transport and dissipation during mechanical ventilation to directly evaluate their relationship to VILI. A porcine ARDS model was used, with ventilation parameters independently controlling lung overdistension and alveolar/airway recruitment/derecruitment (RD). Hourly measurements of airflow, tracheal and esophageal pressures, respiratory system impedance, and oxygen transport were taken for six hours following lung injury to track energy transfer and lung function. The final degree of injury was assessed histologically. Total and dissipated energies were quantified from lung pressure–volume relationships and subdivided into contributions from airflow, tissue viscoelasticity, and RD. Only RD correlated with physiologic recovery. Despite accounting for a very small fraction (2 to 5%) of the total energy dissipation, RD is damaging because it occurs quickly over a very small area. We estimate power intensity of RD energy dissipation to be 100 W/m 2 , equivalent to 10% of the Sun’s luminance at the Earth’s surface. Minimizing repetitive RD events may thus be crucial for mitigating VILI.",

          "abstract": "Drainage divide migration alters the geometry of drainage basins, influencing the distribution of water, erosion, sediments, and ecosystems across Earth’s surface. The rate of divide migration is governed by differences in erosion rates across the divide and is thus sensitive to spatiotemporal variations in tectonics and climate. However, established approaches for quantifying divide migration rates offer only indirect evidence for the motion of the divide and provide only migration rate averages. Consequently, transience in divide migration cannot be resolved, hindering the ability to explore environmental changes that drive the dynamics of such potential transience. Here, we study a set of datable terraces identified as markers of paleo-divide locations, which provide direct evidence for the paleo motion of the divide. The location and age of the terraces reveal intermittent divide migration at timescales of 10 4 to 10 5 y, with phases of rapid migration—at rates more than twice the average—which coincide with documented regional paleoclimate fluctuations. These findings highlight the intermittent nature of divide migration dynamics over geomorphic timescales and its potential sensitivity to climate changes, underscoring the impact of such changes on the planform evolution of drainage basins.",

          "abstract": "To meet decarbonization targets, nations around the globe have made ambitious commitments to expand forested land. Operationalizing these commitments requires choosing a planting strategy: How many trees should be planted, of which species, and where? Given those choices must be made now but have long-term consequences, such decisions are plagued by uncertainty. For example, species that are well suited to present conditions may perform poorly under future climates, yet those future climates are themselves highly uncertain. Using the exemplar of the United Kingdom, a nation committed to achieving net zero emissions by midcentury, we quantify key uncertainties pertaining to coevolving climate and economic conditions and examine how modern methods of decision-making under uncertainty can advise on planting choices. Our analysis reveals that the best planting strategy assuming a “high-emissions” future is radically different to that for a future that remains on a “near-historic” path. Planting for the former while experiencing the latter results in substantial net costs to UK society. Assimilating uncertainty into decision-making identifies planting strategies that diversify risk and significantly reduce the probability of high-cost outcomes. Importantly, our research reveals that the scope for mitigating risk through choice of planting strategy is relatively limited. Despite this persistent risk, we find that tree planting remains a highly cost-effective carbon removal solution when compared to alternative technologies, even when those alternatives are assumed to be riskless.",

This study presents a database of over 2,000 pristine and defective nanoscale CNT bundles and other graphitic assemblies, inspired by microscopy, with associated stress–strain curves from reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the reactive INTERFACE force field (IFF-R). These 3D structures, containing up to 80,000 atoms, enable detailed analyses of structure-stiffness-failure relationships. By leveraging the database and physics- and chemistry-informed machine learning (ML), accurate predictions of elastic moduli and tensile strength are demonstrated at speeds 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than efficient MD simulations. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Spatial Information (HS-GNNs) are introduced, which integrate chemistry knowledge. HS-GNNs as well as extreme gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) achieve forecasts of mechanical properties of arbitrary carbon nanostructures with only 3 to 6% mean relative error. The reliability equals experimental accuracy and is up to 20 times higher than other ML methods. Predictions maintain 8 to 18% accuracy for large CNT bundles, CNT junctions, and carbon fiber cross-sections outside the training distribution. The physics- and chemistry-informed HS-GNN works remarkably well for data outside the training range while XGBoost works well with limited training data inside the training range.

Here, we establish an accessible, generalizable approach, harnessing synchrotron X-ray tomography, to rapidly determine the three-dimensional structure of the multimillimeter-scale CNS of Lymnaea . Focusing on the feeding ganglia, we generate a full neuron-level reconstruction, revealing key design principles and revising cell count estimates upward threefold. Our atlas uncovers the superficial but also nonsuperficial ganglionic architecture, reveals the cell organization in normally hidden regions—ganglionic “dark sides”—and details features of single-neuron morphology, together guiding targeted follow-up functional investigation based on intracellular recordings. Using this approach, we identify three pivotal neuron classes: a command-like food-signaling cell type, a feeding central pattern generator interneuron, and a unique behavior-specific motoneuron, together significantly advancing understanding of the function of this classical control circuit. Combining our morphological and electrophysiological data, we also establish a functional CNS atlas in Lymnaea as a shared and scalable resource for the research community.

          "abstract": "Myosin-IC (myo1c) is a class-I myosin that supports transport and remodeling of the plasma membrane and membrane-bound vesicles. Like other members of the myosin family, its biochemical kinetics are altered in response to changes in mechanical loads that resist the power stroke. However, myo1c is unique in that the primary force-sensitive kinetic transition is the isomerization that follows ATP binding, not ADP release as in other slow myosins. Myo1c also powers actin gliding along curved paths, propelling actin filaments in leftward circles. To understand the origins of this unique force-sensing and motile behavior, we solved actin-bound myo1c cryo-EM structures in the presence and absence of ADP. Our structures reveal that in contrast with other myosins, the myo1c lever arm swing is skewed, partly due to a different actin interface that reorients the motor domain on actin. The structures also reveal unique nucleotide-dependent behavior of both the nucleotide pocket as well as an element called the N-terminal extension (NTE). We incorporate these observations into a model that explains why force primarily regulates ATP binding in myo1c, rather than ADP release as in other myosins. Integrating our cryo-EM data with available crystallography structures allows the modeling of full-length myo1c during force generation, supplying insights into its role in membrane remodeling. These results highlight how relatively minor sequence differences in members of the myosin superfamily can significantly alter power stroke geometry and force-sensing properties, with important implications for biological function.",

          "abstract": "Depletion or inhibition of core stress granule proteins, G3BP1 in mammals and TIAR-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans , increases the growth of spontaneously regenerating axons. Inhibition of G3BP1 by expression of its acidic or “B-domain” accelerates axon regeneration after nerve injury, bringing a potential therapeutic strategy for peripheral nerve repair. Here, we asked whether G3BP1 inhibition is a viable strategy to promote regeneration in injured mammalian central nervous system (CNS) where axons do not regenerate spontaneously. G3BP1 B-domain expression was found to promote axon regeneration in the transected spinal cord provided with a permissive peripheral nerve graft (PNG) as well as in crushed optic nerve. Moreover, a cell-permeable peptide (CPP) to a subregion of B-domain (rodent G3BP1 amino acids 190 to 208) accelerated axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury and promoted regrowth of reticulospinal axons into the distal transected spinal cord through a bridging PNG. G3BP1 CPP promoted axon growth from rodent and human neurons cultured on permissive substrates, and this function required alternating Glu/Asp-Pro repeats that impart a unique predicted tertiary structure. The G3BP1 CPP disassembles axonal G3BP1, G3BP2, and FMRP, but not FXR1, granules and selectively increases axonal protein synthesis in cortical neurons. These studies identify G3BP1 granules as a key regulator of axon growth in CNS neurons and demonstrate that disassembly of these granules promotes retinal axon regeneration in injured optic nerve and reticulospinal axon elongation into permissive environments after CNS injury. This work highlights G3BP1 granule disassembly as a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing axon growth and neural repair.",

          "abstract": "Proteins and the complexes they form are central to nearly all cellular processes. Their flexibility, expressed through a continuum of states, provides a window into their biological functions. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an ideal tool to study these dynamic states as it captures specimens in noncrystalline conditions and enables high-resolution reconstructions. However, analyzing the heterogeneous distributions of conformations from cryo-EM data is challenging. We present RECOVAR, a method for analyzing these distributions based on principal component analysis (PCA) computed using a REgularized COVARiance estimator. RECOVAR is fast, robust, interpretable, expressive, and competitive with state-of-the-art neural network methods on heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets. The regularized covariance method efficiently computes a large number of high-resolution principal components that can encode rich heterogeneous distributions of conformations and does so robustly thanks to an automatic regularization scheme. The reconstruction method based on adaptive kernel regression resolves conformational states to a higher resolution than all other tested methods on extensive independent benchmarks while remaining highly interpretable. Additionally, we exploit favorable properties of the PCA embedding to estimate the conformational density accurately. This density allows for better interpretability of the latent space by identifying stable states and low free-energy motions. Finally, we present a scheme to navigate the high-dimensional latent space by automatically identifying these low free-energy trajectories.

          "abstract": "Efficient methods for conjugating proteins to RNA are needed for RNA delivery, imaging, editing, interactome mapping, and barcoding applications. Noncovalent coupling strategies using viral RNA binding proteins such as MS2/MCP have been widely applied but are limited by tag size, sensitivity, and dissociation over time. We took inspiration from a sequence-specific, covalent protein–DNA conjugation method based on the Rep nickase of a porcine circovirus called “HUH tag”. Though wild-type HUH protein has no detectable activity toward an RNA probe, we engineered an RNA-reactive variant, called “rHUH”, through 7 generations of yeast display–based directed evolution. Our 13.4 kD rHUH has 12 mutations relative to HUH and forms a covalent tyrosine-phosphate ester linkage with a 10-nucleotide RNA recognition sequence (“rRS”) within minutes. We engineered the sensitivity down to 1 nM of target RNA, shifted the metal ion requirement from Mn 2+ toward Mg 2+ , and demonstrated efficient labeling in mammalian cell lysate. This work paves the way toward a potentially powerful methodology for sequence-specific covalent protein–RNA conjugation in biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Telomerase elongates telomeres to maintain chromosome stability in most eukaryotes. Despite extensive studies across eukaryotic kingdoms, the telomerase holoenzyme in arthropods remains poorly understood. In this study, we purify the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex from the lepidopteran insect Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) and identify a copurified 135-nucleotide telomerase RNA (TR) component. This miniature S. frugiperda TR (sfTR), the smallest TR known to date, retains a universal pseudoknot structure and a structurally defined template. Despite its small size, sfTR assembles with the recombinant S. frugiperda telomerase reverse transcriptase (sfTERT) protein in vivo to reconstitute telomerase activity for the synthesis of insect telomeric DNA repeats (TTAGG)n. The sfTR gene, like other animal TR genes, features an snRNA-type RNA polymerase II promoter. Uniquely, the sfTR transcript harbors a 5′-7-methylguanosine (M 7 G) cap, as opposed to the more typical snRNA-type 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap. The difference in 5′-cap is likely because sfTR lacks the H/ACA snoRNA biogenesis domain necessary for cap hypermethylation. Moreover, sfTR also lacks the CR4/5 regulatory domain that is indispensable in vertebrate TRs for telomerase activity. This degenerate sfTR complements an enigmatic sfTERT that is missing certain telomerase-specific elements yet catalytically active in the absence of sfTR. Thus, insects have evolved a simplified telomerase, consisting of a small noncoding RNA that retains only minimal attributes essential for telomerase function. The simplified insect telomerase demonstrates a plausible evolutionary pathway for the emergence of telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex, arising from an ancient reverse transcriptase associated with a simple templating RNA component in early eukaryotes.",

Previous studies have analyzed environmental drivers influencing spatial variation in canopy height at landscape-to-regional scales; however, far less is known about the environmental determinants underlying regional and global scale variation in forest canopy height. Using the canopy height metrics products from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a space-borne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument specifically designed to characterize forest structure, we analyze the environmental correlates of spatial variation of global tropical forest canopy height. Our study demonstrates that climate, topography, and soil properties account for 75% of the variation in tropical forest canopy height. Elevation, dry season length, and solar radiation are the most important drivers in determining canopy height both locally and regionally. These results emphasize the vulnerability of tropical forest structure to ongoing changes in the earth’s climate and provide a valuable empirical baseline for tropical forest management.",

Here, we use a variety of in situ techniques to examine cholesterol monohydrate crystallization over multiple length scales. In this study, we first identified a biomimetic solvent to generate triclinic monohydrate crystals, while avoiding the formation of nonphysiological solvates and enabling crystallization at rates where the dynamics of surface growth could be captured in real time. Using a binary mixture of water and isopropanol, with the latter serving as a surrogate for lipids in physiological environments, we show that cholesterol monohydrate crystals grow classically by the nucleation and spreading of crystal layers. Time-resolved imaging confirms that layers are generated by dislocations and monomers incorporate into advancing steps after diffusion along the crystal surface and not directly from the solution. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and microfluidics measurements concertedly reveal abundant macrosteps, which engender a self-inhibition mechanism that reduces the rate of crystal growth. This finding stands in contrast to numerous other systems, in which classical mechanisms lead to unhindered growth by spreading of single layers.",

We recently demonstrated that human B cell responses to membrane-associated but not to soluble antigens in vitro depended on the expression and activity of the plasma membrane mechanosensitive ion channel, Piezo1. Here, we provide evidence that the efficacy of the current human papillomavirus virus-like particle (HPV VLP) vaccines may be due in part to their inherent ability to mimic Piezo1-dependent membrane presentation of antigens to B cells. We compared HPV-specific human B cell responses to HPV VLPs versus soluble HPV pentameric capsomeres and showed that although both induced calcium responses, only HPV VLP-induced responses were blocked by Piezo1 inhibitors. The kinetics of internalization of HPV-VLP and capsomeres into HPV-specific B cells were similar and neither required Piezo1 function as shown by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Piezo. However, trafficking of HPV-VLPs into intracellular major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) + antigen-processing compartments was Piezo1-dependent, whereas trafficking of capsomeres was not. In addition, a time course of intracellular trafficking suggested that colocalization of HPV-VLP with MHC classII was more stable over time as compared to capsomeres. Taken together these findings suggest that the ability of HPV-VLP vaccines to mimic Piezo1-dependent membrane antigen presentation may be exploited in the design of highly effective human vaccines.",

Therefore, we profiled the stool microbiome of people with MS (PwMS) and healthy controls (HC) using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. PwMS showed a distinct microbiome compared to HC, with Prevotella copri ( PC ) and Blautia species as drivers of microbial communities in HC and PwMS, respectively. Administration of MS-driving Blautia species ( Blautia wexlerae; BW ) to mice resulted in increased levels of gut inflammatory markers and altered microbiota with increased capacity to induce proinflammatory cytokines. Utilizing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, we identified a lower gut Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio as a hallmark of the disease. BW -administered mice also showed a lower Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio pre-EAE induction which correlated with increased disease severity post-EAE induction. The importance of the Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio at the species level, lower Bifidobacterium adolescentis to Akkermansia muciniphila ( BA:AM ), was validated in our MS cohort and a large International Multiple Sclerosis Microbiome Study.

          "abstract": "Understanding both local and systemic immunity is essential to optimizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the dynamic alterations in systemic immunity during tumor development are yet to be clearly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized connection that bridges the interaction between the spleen and tumor through erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), which suppress tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. We performed the single-cell RNA-seq and RNA-seq to demonstrate the presence of EPCs and identify the characteristic and an immunomodulatory role of EPCs during tumor progression. These tumor-hijacked EPCs proliferate in situ in spleens and impaired systemic and local antitumor response through the interaction between tumor and spleen. Specifically, the splenic CD45 − EPCs secreted heparin-binding growth factor to regulate PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression of splenic CD45 + EPCs. Educated CD45 + EPCs from the spleen then migrated to the tumors via the CCL5/CCR5 axis, thereby weakening local antitumor immunity. Consequently, targeting EPCs not only revitalized antitumor immunity but also improved the anti-PD-L1 effect by promoting intratumoral T cell infiltration. Importantly, CD45 + EPCs are associated with immunosuppression and reduced survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal the role of EPCs in orchestrating the interaction between the spleen and tumor, which could have significant implications for the development of more effective cancer immunotherapy.",

This study investigated the geochemical properties of Textularia agglutinans, a cosmopolitan agglutinated benthic species from the order Textulariida which has an exceptional inner calcareous test and is evolutionarily basal to Rotaliida. This study confirms the evolutionary link between textulariids and rotaliids based on their geochemistry and establishes T. agglutinans as a geochemical recorder of marine environments. Specimens from the Mediterranean coast of Israel were analyzed using laser ablation ICP-MS and compared to whole-test ICP-MS measurements of rotaliid and miliolid taxa from the same location. An Mg/Ca temperature calibration was established by LA-ICP-MS analyses of cultured specimens at 15, 17, 20, and 25 °C. Results show that T. agglutinans is a mid-Mg species (~19 to ~60 mmol/mol), with an Mg/Ca temperature correlation similar to high-Mg species. Its Pb, Zn, and Mn/Ca ratios are variable, generally overlapping with rotaliids and significantly lower than miliolids. Notably, T. agglutinans exhibits significantly higher Sr/Ca ratios (3.2 to 4.7 mmol/mol) compared to most foraminifera. Raman analyses reveal that the inner wall comprises a mix of aragonite and calcite, explaining these elevated Sr/Ca ratios. Rotaliida are the most prolific group of calcifying foraminifera. Our findings suggest that rotaliid tests evolved from an agglutinated textulariid ancestor with an inner aragonitic wall, a hypothesis that is further supported by the close phylogenetic relationship of the two groups.",

          "abstract": "Analyzing cardiac pulse waveforms offers valuable insights into heart health and cardiovascular disease risk, although obtaining the more informative measurements from the central aorta remains challenging due to their invasive nature and limited noninvasive options. To address this, we employed a laboratory-developed cuff device for high-resolution pulse waveform acquisition and constructed a spectral machine learning model to nonlinearly map the brachial wave components to the aortic site. Simultaneous invasive aortic catheter and brachial cuff waveforms were acquired in 115 subjects to evaluate the clinical performance of the developed wave-based approach. Magnitude, shape, and pulse waveform analysis on the measured and reconstructed aortic waveforms were correlated on a beat-to-beat basis. The proposed cuff-based method reconstructed aortic waveform contours with high fidelity (mean normalized-RMS error = 11.3%). Furthermore, continuous signal reconstruction captured dynamic aortic systolic blood pressure (BP) oscillations (r = 0.76, P &lt; 0.05). Method-derived central pressures showed strong correlation with the independent invasive measurement for systolic BP (R 2 = 0.83; B [LOA] = −0.3 [−17.0, 16.4] mmHg) and diastolic BP (R 2 = 0.58; B [LOA] = −0.7 [−13.1, 11.6] mmHg). Shape-based features are effectively captured by the spectral machine learning method, showing strong correlations and no systemic bias for systolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.91, P &lt; 0.05), diastolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.95, P &lt; 0.05), and subendocardial viability ratio (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the nonlinear transformation of wave components from the distal to the central site predicts the morphological waveform changes resulting from complex wave propagation and reflection within the cardiovascular network. The proposed wave-based approach holds promise for future applications of noninvasive devices in clinical cardiology.",

These experiments provide insight into the interplay of intramolecular coordinates along the reaction coordinate. However, a general theoretical foundation for analyzing, and even for explaining rigorously, these data is lacking. In this work, we study vibrational decoherence in a model VCET reaction using the nearly exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulation method. We explore how analyzing the density matrix with quantum information measures can help elucidate the evolution of vibrational coherence in simulations of dynamics. We examine how vibrational coherence is affected by electron transfer on the timescale of approximately 100 femtoseconds. Our results suggest that electron transfer, in the nonadiabatic model, changes the vibrational equilibrium position abruptly—an example of a “quantum quench” event. This explains the concomitant vibrational decoherence. We find that abrupt vibrational decoherence can be mitigated by wavepacket motion occurring on the timescale of the electron transfer.",

Genomic analyses reveal a complex interplay among mutant genes, with co-occurring and mutually exclusive patterns. Hyperactivation of c-MYB and deficiency of PU.1 have been linked to myeloid disorders. We report a case of AML with concurrent PU.1 and c-MYB mutations, exhibiting early onset, high blast count, chemo-resistance, indicating high-risk features, along with elevated Pelger–Huët anomaly (PHA). However, the synergistic mechanism of c-MYB and PU.1 in sAML remains unclear. Using c-Myb-hyperactivation and Pu.1-deficient double-strain ( c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D ) zebrafish, we investigated MDS/sAML progression. Surprisingly, the double mutant exhibited a distinct type of neutrophil resembling clinical PHA cells and demonstrated a higher rate of MDS/sAML transformation. Further expression analysis revealed reduced lmnb1 expression in double-mutant zebrafish. Knockdown of lmnb1 resulted in PHA and increased blast cells, while overexpression of lmnb1 in c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D reduced PHA cell level. This suggests that c-Myb hyperactivation and Pu.1 deficiency synergistically reduce lmnb1 expression, inducing the development of PHA-like neutrophils and promoting MDS/sAML progression in zebrafish. Moreover, coadministration of cell cycle inhibitor cytarabine (Ara-C) and the differential inducer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) could effectively relieve the neutrophil expansion and PHA symptoms in c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D zebrafish. Our findings revealed that c-Myb hyperactivation and Pu.1 deficiency played a synergistic role in sAML development and suggests a phenotypic association between the emergence of PH-like cells and the transformation to sAML.

          "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which connects these neuropathologies by a common phenotype. Various proteins and peptides form aggregates that are poorly degraded, and their ensuing pathological accumulation underlies these neurodegenerative diseases. Similarities may exist in the mechanisms responsible for the buildup of these aggregates. Therefore, therapeutics designed to treat one neurodegenerative disease may be beneficial to others. In ALS models, the compound NU-9 was previously shown to block neurodegeneration produced by aggregation-inducing mutations of SOD-1 and TDP-43 [B. Genç et al., Clin. Transl. Med. 11 , e336 (2021)]. Here, we report that NU-9 also prevents the accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs), small peptide aggregates that are instigators of Alzheimer’s disease neurodegeneration [M. Tolar et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci. 22 , 6355 (2021)]. AβO buildup was measured by immunofluorescence imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to exogenous monomeric Aβ. In this model, AβO buildup occurs via cathepsin L- and dynamin-dependent trafficking. This is prevented by NU-9 through a cellular mechanism that is cathepsin B- and lysosome-dependent, suggesting that NU-9 enhances the ability of endolysosomal trafficking to protect against AβO buildup. This possibility is strongly supported by a quantitative assay for autophagosomes that shows robust stimulation by NU-9. These results contribute additional understanding to the mechanisms of protein aggregation and suggest that multiple neurodegenerative diseases might be treatable by targeting common pathogenic mechanisms responsible for protein aggregation.",

Yet the genetic basis of adaptation is often unknown and potentially underpinned by a wide range of mutational types—from single nucleotide changes to large-scale alterations of chromosome structure. Copy number variation (CNV) is thought to be an important source of adaptive genetic variation, as indicated by decades of candidate gene studies that point to CNVs underlying rapid adaptation to strong selective pressures. Nevertheless, population-genomic studies of CNVs face unique logistical challenges not encountered by other forms of genetic variation. Consequently, few studies have systematically investigated the contributions of CNVs to adaptation at a genome-wide scale. We present a genome-wide analysis of CNV contributing to the adaptation of an invasive weed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia . CNVs show clear signatures of parallel local adaptation between North American (native) and European (invaded) ranges, implying widespread reuse of CNVs during adaptation to shared heterogeneous patterns of selection. We used a local principal component analysis (PCA) to genotype CNV regions in whole-genome sequences of samples collected over the last two centuries. We identified 16 large CNV regions of up to 11.85 megabases in length, eight of which show signals of rapid evolutionary change, with pronounced frequency shifts between historic and modern populations. Our results provide compelling genome-wide evidence that CNV underlies rapid adaptation over contemporary timescales of natural populations.",

          "abstract": "The outer membrane (OM) of gram-negative bacteria is a robust, impermeable barrier that excludes many classes of antibiotics. Contrary to the classical model of an asymmetric lipid bilayer, recent evidence suggests the OM is predominantly an asymmetric proteolipid membrane (APLM). Outer leaflet lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that surround integral β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are shared with other OMPs to form a supramolecular network in which the levels of OMPs approach those of LPS. Some of the most abundant OMPs in the Escherichia coli OM are trimeric porins. How porins and LPS are incorporated into the OM of growing bacteria is poorly understood. Here, we use live-cell imaging and microfluidics to investigate how LPS, labeled using click chemistry, and the porin OmpF, labeled using the bacteriocin colicin N, are incorporated into the E. coli OM. Diffraction-limited fluorescence microscopy shows OmpF and LPS to be uniformly distributed and immobile. However, clustering of both macromolecules becomes evident by superresolution microscopy, which is also the case for their biogenesis proteins, BamA and LptD, respectively. Notwithstanding these common organizational features, OmpF insertion into the OM is cell-cycle-dependent leading to binary partitioning and strong polar accumulation of old OmpF. Old LPS on the other hand is diluted ~50% at each division cycle by new LPS, resulting in only mild polar accumulation of preexisting LPS. We conclude that although LPS and OMPs are destined to form the APLM their insertion dynamics are fundamentally different, which has major implications for understanding how the OM is assembled.",

          "abstract": "cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) plays an important role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and long-term memory formation through the regulation of neuronal activity-dependent gene expression, and CRTC1 dysregulation is implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we show that increased S-nitrosylation of CRTC1 (forming SNO-CRTC1), as seen in cell-based, animal-based, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cerebrocortical neuron-based AD models, disrupts its binding with CREB and diminishes the activity-dependent gene expression mediated by the CRTC1/CREB pathway. We identified Cys216 of CRTC1 as the primary target of S-nitrosylation by nitric oxide (NO)-related species. Using CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, we mutated Cys216 to Ala in hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons bearing one allele of the APP Swe mutation (AD-hiPSC neurons). Introduction of this nonnitrosylatable CRTC1 mutant rescued defects in AD-hiPSC neurons, including decreased neurite length and increased neuronal cell death. Additionally, expression of nonnitrosylatable CRTC1 in vivo in the hippocampus rescued synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation in 5XFAD mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that formation of SNO-CRTC1 contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by attenuating the neuronal activity-dependent CREB transcriptional pathway, and suggests a therapeutic target for AD.",

The depth of knowledge derived from nature extends far beyond mere trial-and-error fabrication by providing deep insights into the toughening mechanisms that are integral to natural materials. A key challenge is understanding how these toughening mechanisms can be effectively translated into biomimetic materials. Here, we characterize the multiscale mechanical behavior of tendon-like fibrous hydrogels, unraveling the intricate toughening mechanisms at play across multiple scales—from dynamic molecular interactions and nanoscale fibril sliding, to anisotropic microscale characteristics and macroscopic performance—using a combination of experimental and simulation approaches. Additionally, we address the open question of how hierarchical structures exhibit mechanical properties at different scales, demonstrating that hydrogels, fibrils, and chains take up successively lower levels of strain in a ratio of 11.5:3.2:2.

Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material’s morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalizes puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics. These insights could lay the foundations for a class of disorder-based catalytic and interfacial materials.",

Here, we integrate human brain and physiological data to investigate underlying mechanisms. Functional MRI analyses across four large datasets (totaling 19,300 participants) show that brain networks not only destabilize throughout the lifetime but do so along a nonlinear trajectory, with consistent temporal “landmarks” of brain aging starting in midlife (40s). Comparison of metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory biomarkers implicate dysregulated glucose homeostasis as the driver mechanism for these transitions. Correlation between the brain’s regionally heterogeneous patterns of aging and gene expression further supports these findings, selectively implicating GLUT4 (insulin-dependent glucose transporter) and APOE (lipid transport protein). Notably, MCT2 (a neuronal, but not glial, ketone transporter) emerges as a potential counteracting factor by facilitating neurons’ energy uptake independently of insulin. Consistent with these results, an interventional study of 101 participants shows that ketones exhibit robust effects in restabilizing brain networks, maximized from ages 40 to 60, suggesting a midlife “critical window” for early metabolic intervention.",

          "abstract": "The recently identified histone modification lysine lactylation can be stimulated by L-lactate and glycolysis. Although the chemical group added upon lysine lactylation was originally proposed to be the L-enantiomer of lactate (K L-la ), two isomeric modifications, lysine D-lactylation (K D-la ) and N-ε-(carboxyethyl) lysine (K ce ), also exist in cells, with their precursors being metabolites of glycolysis. The dynamic regulation and differences among these three modifications in response to hypoxia remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that intracellular K L-la , but not K D-la or K ce , is up-regulated in response to hypoxia. Depletion of glyoxalase enzymes, GLO1 and GLO2, had minimal impact on K D-la , K ce , or hypoxia-induced K L-la . Conversely, blocking glycolytic flux to L-lactate under hypoxic conditions by knocking out lactate dehydrogenase A/B completely abolished the induction of K L-la but increased K D-la and K ce . We further observed a correlation between the level of K L-la and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression under hypoxic conditions and when small molecules were used to stabilize HIF-1α in the normoxia condition. Our result demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between HIF-1α and K L-la in lung cancer tissues and that patient samples with higher grade tend to have higher K L-la levels. Using a proteomics approach, we quantified 66 K L-la sites that were up-regulated by hypoxia and demonstrated that p300/CBP contributes to hypoxia-induced K L-la . Collectively, our study demonstrates that K L-la , rather than K D-la or K ce , is the prevailing lysine lactylation in response to hypoxia. Our results therefore demonstrate a link between K L-la and the hypoxia-induced adaptation of tumor cells.",

          "abstract": "Optimal activation of CD8+ T cells is crucial for immunity-mediated destruction of cancer, requiring a substantial amount of proteins involved in metabolism, proliferation, and effector function. Despite extensive studies emphasizing the role of transcriptional regulation in this process, paired transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal that the RNA profile is poorly correlated with protein levels. This discrepancy underscores the importance of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in controlling protein abundance during activation. However, the impact of PTMs on the CD8+ T cell protein dynamic remains underexplored. We identify that neddylation, a recently discovered PTM, is activated in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and enriched in effector CD8+ T cells from colon cancer patients. Mechanistically, we found the rate-limiting enzyme of neddylation, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8 activating enzyme E1 (NAE1), is induced by the NFATc1, a critical transcription factor downstream of TCR signaling. Our observation revealed that genetic ablation of NAE1 significantly disturbed the proteomic landscape related to activation and mitochondrial function. As a result, CD8+ T cells lacking NAE1 exhibited severely compromised activation, proliferation, and survival, which was accompanied by impaired mitochondrial function. Consistently, deletion of NAE1 in CD8+ T cells abolished their antitumor function and promoted tumor progression. By contrast, the overexpression of NAE1 significantly improved the function of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Overall, we uncovered neddylation, a previously underappreciated PTM, as a proteomic checkpoint for CD8+ T cell activation. Enforced expression of NAE1 offers promising therapeutic potential for boosting the antitumor CD8+ T cell responses.",

To date, recessive genotypes (RGs) have commonly been implicated through anecdotal ascertainment of consanguineous families and candidate gene-based analysis; the recessive contribution to the broad range of CHD phenotypes has been limited. We analyzed whole exome sequences of 5,424 CHD probands. Rare damaging RGs were estimated to contribute to at least 2.2% of CHD, with greater enrichment among laterality phenotypes (5.4%) versus other subsets (1.4%). Among 108 curated human recessive CHD genes, there were 66 RGs, with 54 in 11 genes with &gt;1 RG, 12 genes with 1 RG, and 85 genes with zero. RGs were more prevalent among offspring of consanguineous union (4.7%, 32/675) than among nonconsanguineous probands (0.7%, 34/4749). Founder variants in GDF1 and PLD1 accounted for 74% of the contribution of RGs among 410 Ashkenazi Jewish probands. We identified genome-wide significant enrichment of RGs in C1orf127 , encoding a likely secreted protein expressed in embryonic mouse notochord and associated with laterality defects. Single-cell transcriptomes from gastrulation-stage mouse embryos revealed enrichment of RGs in genes highly expressed in the cardiomyocyte lineage, including contractility-related genes MYH6, UNC45B , MYO18B , and MYBPC3 in probands with left-sided CHD, consistent with abnormal contractile function contributing to these malformations. Genes with significant RG burden account for 1.3% of probands, more than half the inferred total. These results reveal the recessive contribution to CHD, and indicate that many genes remain to be discovered, with each likely accounting for a very small fraction of the total.",

We circumvent this problem by focusing on the morphology of deglaciation and inception, which we show depends strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity. We demonstrate that although both parameters are important, precession has more influence on deglacial onset, whereas obliquity is more important for the attainment of peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. We find that the set of precession peaks (minima) responsible for terminations since 0.9 million years ago is a subset of those peaks that begin (i.e., the precession parameter starts decreasing) while obliquity is increasing. Specifically, termination occurs with the first of these candidate peaks to occur after each eccentricity minimum. Thus, the gross morphology of 100-thousand-year (100-kyr) glacial cycles appears largely deterministic.",

          "abstract": "Numerous gram-negative bacterial pathogens employ the type III secretion system (T3SS), a multiprotein injectisome, to deliver virulence proteins into host cells and cause diseases. We uncover erucamide as a previously unknown phytoalexin of both dicots and monocots that blocks the T3SS function of multiple bacterial pathogens. Genetically impairing erucamide accumulation or exogenous application in Arabidopsis highlighted erucamide’s role in antibacterial immunity. Erucamide binds Hypersensitive response and conserved C (HrcC), a key T3SS component, to block injectisome assembly. Analyses of erucamide analogs and HrcC mutants indicated that the erucamide-HrcC binding is required for inhibiting T3SS in vitro and antibacterial resistance in plants, suggesting an essential role of erucamide-HrcC binding in disease resistance. This work reveals a plant chemical defense that targets major virulence machinery in bacterial pathogens.",

In particular, identifying active sites and understanding the interaction between components and the dynamic behavior of the participant species remain unclear. This fundamental knowledge is essential for the design of more efficient and stable catalysts. Because the nature of the active site (metal, oxide, carbide) is the main factor that determines the catalytic activity of the catalysts, this Review focuses on various types of heterogeneous catalysts that have been recently reported in the literature as efficient for CO 2 conversion to C1 [carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (CH 3 OH), methane (CH 4 )], and higher hydrocarbons. We focus on establishing key connections between active-site structures and selectivity, regardless of catalyst composition.",

The phylum further encompasses many more unfamiliar experiments in animal body-plan evolution. In this work, we reconstructed the phylogeny for living Mollusca on the basis of metazoan BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) genes extracted from 77 (13 new) genomes, including multiple members of all eight classes with two high-quality genome assemblies for monoplacophorans. Our analyses confirm a phylogeny proposed from morphology and show widespread genomic variation. The flexibility of the molluscan genome likely explains both historic challenges with their genomes and their evolutionary success.",

However, the capability of electron microscopy to image structures with high spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution is often limited by poor signal-to-noise ratios. With an unsupervised deep denoising framework, we observed metal nanoparticle surfaces (platinum nanoparticles on cerium oxide) in a gas environment with time resolutions down to 10 milliseconds at a moderate electron dose. On this timescale, many nanoparticle surfaces continuously transition between ordered and disordered configurations. Stress fields can penetrate below the surface, leading to defect formation and destabilization, thus making the nanoparticle fluxional. Combining this unsupervised denoiser with in situ electron microscopy greatly improves spatiotemporal characterization, opening a new window for the exploration of atomic-level structural dynamics in materials.",

Using magnetic resonance image (MRI)–guided spatiotemporal RNA profiling in marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), we mapped lesion dynamics and modeled molecular perturbations relevant to MS. Five distinct lesion microenvironments emerged, involving neuroglial responses, tissue destruction and repair, and brain border regulation. Before demyelination, MRI identified a high ratio of proton density–weighted signal to T 1 relaxation time, capturing early hypercellularity, and elevated astrocytic and ependymal senescence signals marked perivascular and periventricular areas that later became demyelination hotspots. As lesions expanded, concentric glial barriers formed, initially dominated by proliferating and diversifying microglia and oligodendrocyte precursors, later replaced by monocytes and lymphocytes. We highlight SERPINE1 + astrocytes as a signaling hub underlying lesion onset in both marmoset EAE and MS.",

We found that self-peptide-specific Treg cells were dispensable for the control of Tconv cells of matched specificity at homeostasis. However, they were required to control such Tconv cells and prevent autoimmunity toward the prostate following exposure to elevated self-peptide during infection. Importantly, the Treg cell response to self-peptide did not impact protective Tconv cell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide. Thus, self-peptide-specific Treg cells promoted self-nonself discrimination during infection by selectively controlling Tconv cells of shared self-specificity.",

Structural and enzymatic analyses of the Nudix effector family demonstrate that they selectively hydrolyze PP-InsP. Gene deletion experiments of Nudix effectors in Magnaporthe oryzae , Colletotrichum higginsianum , and Colletotrichum graminicola indicate that PP-InsP hydrolysis substantially enhances disease symptoms in diverse pathosystems. Further, we show that this conserved effector family induces phosphate starvation signaling in plants.

ALKBH5 is up-regulated in the liver during obesity and also phosphorylated by protein kinase A, causing its translocation to the cytosol. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Alkbh5 reduces glucose and lipids by inhibiting the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathways. Targeted knockdown of hepatic Alkbh5 reverses T2DM and MAFLD in diabetic mice, highlighting its therapeutic potential.

We demonstrate that brown nitrogen (BrN), the absorptive nitrogenous component of OAs, dominates their global absorption. Using a global model, we quantified BrN abundance, tracked its optical evolution with chemical aging, and assessed its radiative absorption. BrN contributes 76% of OAs’ surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs’ absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN. BrN represents 18% of the global absorptive direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols, with biomass burning being the largest contributor. Our research establishes a nitrogen-centric framework for attributing the climate impacts of OAs.",

By tailoring the local curvature of nanodumbbells, we can precisely and flexibly adjust particle bonding directionality, a level of control rarely achievable with conventional convex building blocks. These nanodumbbells can undergo long-range ordered assembly into various intricate two-dimensional superlattices, including the chiral Kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Kagome lattice is a thermodynamically stable phase, with depletion interactions playing a crucial role in stabilizing these non–close-packed structures. The emergence of Kagome lattices and other unusual structures highlights the vast potential of nonconvex nanocrystals for creating sophisticated architectures.",

Herein, we report the discovery of an organometallic “berkelocene” complex prepared from 0.3 milligrams of berkelium-249. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction shows a tetravalent berkelium ion between two substituted cyclooctatetraene ligands, resulting in the formation of berkelium–carbon bonds. The coordination in berkelocene resembles that of uranocene, and calculations show that the berkelium 5f orbitals engage in covalent overlap with the δ-symmetry orbitals of the cyclooctatetraenide ligand π system. Charge transfer from the ligands is diminished relative to uranocene and other actinocenes, which maximizes contributions from the stable, half-filled 5f 7 configuration of tetravalent berkelium.",

In contrast to assumptions made by these models, locusts do not explicitly align with neighbors. While individuals respond to moving-dot stimuli through the optomotor response, this innate behavior does not mediate social response to neighbors. Instead, locust marching behavior, across scales, can be explained by a minimal cognitive framework, which incorporates individuals’ neural representation of bearings to neighbors and internal consensus dynamics for making directional choices.

We report state-prepared and state-resolved measurements of methane scattering from a room-temperature gold surface that demonstrate total destructive interference between molecular states related by a reflection symmetry operation. High-contrast interference effects prevail for all processes investigated, including vibrationally excited and vibrationally inelastic collisions.

          "abstract": "Extreme heat is well-documented to adversely affect health and mortality, but its link to biological aging—a precursor of the morbidity and mortality process—remains unclear. This study examines the association between ambient outdoor heat and epigenetic aging in a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 56+ ( N = 3686). The number of heat days in neighborhoods is calculated using the heat index, covering time windows from the day of blood collection to 6 years prior. Multilevel regression models are used to predict PCPhenoAge acceleration, PCGrimAge acceleration, and DunedinPACE. More heat days over short- and mid-term windows are associated with increased PCPhenoAge acceleration (e.g., B prior7-dayCaution+heat : 1.07 years). Longer-term heat is associated with all clocks (e.g., B prior1-yearExtremecaution+heat : 2.48 years for PCPhenoAge, B prior1-yearExtremecaution+heat : 1.09 year for PCGrimAge, and B prior6-yearExtremecaution+heat : 0.05 years for DunedinPACE). Subgroup analyses show no strong evidence for increased vulnerability by sociodemographic factors. These findings provide insights into the biological underpinnings linking heat to aging-related morbidity and mortality risks.",

These AI algorithms cannot be modified during the operation process according to environmental changes, resulting in significantly poorer adaptability to new environments, longer learning latency, and higher power consumption compared to the human brain. In contrast, neurobiological circuits can function while simultaneously adapting to changing conditions. Here, we present a brain-inspired Super-Turing AI model based on a synaptic resistor circuit, capable of concurrent real-time inference and learning. Without any prior learning, a circuit of synaptic resistors integrating ferroelectric HfZrO materials was demonstrated to navigate a drone toward a target position while avoiding obstacles in a simulated environment, exhibiting significantly superior learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability compared to computer-based artificial neural networks. Synaptic resistor circuits enable efficient and adaptive Super-Turing AI systems in uncertain and dynamic real-world environments.",

However, the postselection (PS) effect may also introduce unintended biases in precision measurements. Here, we investigate the influence of PS in the precision spectroscopy of the 2 3 S − 2 3 P transition of helium ( 4 He) using an atomic beam. We directly observe that PS based on atomic positions causes a shift in the measured transition frequency, amounting to approximately −55 kHz. After accounting for this PS shift, we obtain a corrected frequency of 276,764,094,712.45 ± 0.86 kHz for the 2 3 S 1 − 2 3 P 0 transition. Combining this result with existing data for 3 He, we derive a value for the difference in squared nuclear charge radii, which shows a σ deviation from measurements of muonic helium ions, potentially pointing to new physics that challenges lepton universality in quantum electrodynamics.",

DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) is a conserved central regulator of dormancy cooperating with the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) through negative regulation of ABA HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION (AHG) 1 and AHG3 phosphatases. The current molecular mechanism of DOG1 signaling proposes it regulates the activation of central ABA-related SnRK2 kinases. Here, we unveil DOG1’s functional autonomy from the regulation of ABA core signaling components and unravel its pivotal control over the activation of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE FIVE BINDING PROTEINs (AFPs). Our data revealed a molecular relay in which AFPs’ genuine activation by AHG1 is contained by DOG1 to prevent the breakdown of maturation-imposed ABA responses independently of ABA-related kinase activation status. This work offers a molecular understanding of how plants fine-tune germination timing, while preserving seed responsiveness to adverse environmental cues, and thus represents a milestone in the realm of conservation and breeding programs.",

We confirmed these findings in newborn, inflammation-free samples of a CF animal model and further identified ultrastructural alterations in the olfactory epithelium and bulbs of these animals. We established that CFTR, the anion channel whose dysfunction causes CF, is dispensable for odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons, yet CF animals displayed defective odor-guided behaviors consistent with the morphological and molecular alterations. Our study highlights CF’s major role in modulating epithelial structure and OR expression, shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to olfactory loss in CF.",

To model SCCOHTs, we have established eight patient-derived tumoroid lines from tumor lesions of three patients with SCCOHT. The tumoroids recapitulate genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the corresponding patient tumors and capture intrapatient tumor heterogeneity. Organoid drug profiling using a library of 153 clinical compounds identified methotrexate as an effective and selective drug against SCCOHTs with a clinically relevant IC 50 of 35 nanomolars. RNA sequencing demonstrated that methotrexate induced TP53 pathway activation and apoptosis.

          "abstract": "Transcription factor ubiquitination is a decisive regulator of growth and development. The DET1-DDB1-DDA1 (DDD) complex associates with the Cullin-4 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) and a second ubiquitin ligase, COP1, to control ubiquitination of transcription factors involved in neurological, metabolic, and immune cell development. Here, we report the structure of the human DDD complex, revealing a specific segment of DET1 that can recruit ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes. Structural variability analysis, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis based on AlphaFold predictions suggest that dynamic closure of DET1, stabilized by DDA1, underlies coordinated recruitment of E2 enzymes and COP1. Biochemical assays suggest that the E2 acts as a recruitment factor to bring COP1 to DET1 for more effective substrate ubiquitination, which parallels a catalytically inactive E2 enzyme (COP10) in plant DDD complexes. This work provides a clear architecture for regulation and cooperative CRL4 DET1-COP1 complex assembly, which can affect degradation of diverse targets by COP1 complexes.",

The coherence of interactions is determined by the single-pass atomic absorption and number of photon round-trips. Reducing the cavity loss has enabled resonators supporting 1 million roundtrips but with limited material choices and increased alignment sensitivity. Here, we present a high–numerical aperture, lens-based resonator that pushes the single-atom single-photon absorption probability near its fundamental limit, reducing the mode size at the atom to order λ. This resonator provides a single-atom cooperativity of 1.6 in a cavity where the light circulates ∼10 times. We load single 87 Rb atoms into this cavity, observe strong coupling, and demonstrate cavity-enhanced atom detection with fidelity of 99.55(6)% and survival of 99.89(4)% in 130 μs. Introducing intracavity imaging systems will enable cavity arrays compatible with Rydberg atom array computing technologies, expanding the applicability of the cavity QED toolbox.",

The flexible sensor shows excellent adaptability to soft tissues, providing a strain monitoring range of 0 to 10% with a minimum detection threshold of 0.25% and maintaining stability more than 300,000 stretching cycles. The wireless sensor could be integrated with complex structures in surgical scenarios involving lateral collateral ligament injury and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, enabling distinct responses to graft stretching, reinjury, and loosening. Animal experiments demonstrate that the sensor can acquire real-time, clinical-grade strain data while exhibiting high biocompatibility.

          "abstract": "Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are used worldwide for weed management. However, GBHs pose a threat to soil fungal community, although fungi can degrade and use glyphosate as a nutrient source. How fungi respond to GBHs remains enigmatic. Here, we found that, not as in plants, the commercial GBH Roundup does not target the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the soil-derived fungus Trichoderma guizhouense , whereas it impairs fungal growth. We demonstrate that the herbicide adjuvant Triton CG-110 is more toxic to fungal cells than pure glyphosate. It limits nitrogen uptake, which induces the expression of proteinase YPS1 to catalyze the shedding of the MSB2 extracellular domain from the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of the MAPK TMK1 pheromone pathway. The downstream B2H2-type transcription factor STE12 directly regulates ergosterol biosynthesis, affecting membrane fluidity and stability. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that the pheromone pathway is implicated in ergosterol biosynthesis and plasma membrane integrity.",

Here, we report that components involved in lagging strand synthesis, DNA polymerases α and δ, have substantially reduced levels in stem cells compared to progenitor cells, and this promotes local asymmetry of parental histone incorporation at the replication fork. Compromising Polα genetically induces the local replication-coupled histone incorporation pattern in progenitor cells to resemble that in stem cells, seen by both nuclear localization patterns and chromatin fibers. This is recapitulated using a Polα inhibitor in a concentration-dependent manner. The local old versus new histone asymmetry is comparable between stem cells and progenitor cells at both S phase and M phase. Together, these results indicate that developmentally programmed expression of key DNA replication components is important to shape stem cell chromatin. Furthermore, manipulating one crucial DNA replication component can induce replication-coupled histone dynamics in nonstem cells to resemble those in stem cells.",

This system facilitates remote perception and replication of taste sensations through the coupling of physically separated sensors and actuators with wireless communication modules. By using chemicals representing five basic tastes, systematic codesign of key functional components yields reliable performance including tunability, versatility, safety, and mechanical robustness. Field testing involving human subjects focusing on user perception confirms its proficiency in digitally simulating a range of taste intensities and combinations.

However, their measurement in the heart was not feasible because the required homogenous current injection cannot be performed with electrical stimulation. We overcame this problem by optogenetic current injection into all illuminated cardiomyocytes of mouse hearts in different action potential phases. Precisely triggered and patterned illumination enabled measuring R m and λ, which both were smallest at diastole. Pharmacological and depolarization-induced reduction of inwardly rectifying K + currents ( I K1 ), gap junction block, and cardiac infarction reduced I thr , showing the importance of high I K1 density and intact cardiomyocyte coupling for preventing arrhythmia initiation. Combining optogenetic current injection and computer simulations was used to classify pro- and anti-arrhythmic mechanisms based on their effects on R m and I thr and allowed to quantify I K1 inward rectification in the intact heart, identifying reduced I K1 rectification as anti-arrhythmic concept.",

          "abstract": "High-entropy materials have expanded the frontier for discovering uncharted physicochemical properties. The phenomenon of chemical fluctuation is ubiquitous in high-entropy materials, yet its role in the thermoelectric field is often overlooked. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of (Mg 0.94− n Yb 0.26 Sr 0.26 Zn m )(Mg n Cd 0.69 Zn 0.69− m Na x )(Sb 1.74 Ca 0.26 ) samples characterized by ultrahigh configurational entropy. These samples exhibit a homogeneous single-phase structure at macroscopic and microscopic scales, yet display notable chemical fluctuations at the atomic to nanoscale. These fluctuations, along with the unusual atomic occupations, lead to an exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity akin to that of amorphous materials. Combining the optimized carrier concentration and well-maintained carrier mobility, we ultimately achieved a high zT value of 1.2 at 750 kelvin, outperforming most previously reported AB 2 Sb 2 -type Zintls. This study underscores that the atomic to nanoscale chemical fluctuations are the crucial catalyst for the enhanced thermoelectric performance in high-entropy materials.",

Corpuscles are composed of a mechanoreceptor afferent surrounded by lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs), enclosed by a multilayered outer core. The spatial arrangement of these components and their contribution to sensory tuning are unclear. We report the three-dimensional architecture of the Pacinian corpuscle and reveal the role of its cellular components in touch detection. In the prevailing model, the outer core acts as a mechanical filter that limits static and low-frequency stimuli from reaching the afferent terminal—the presumed sole site of touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for the sensory tuning to transient touch and vibration; instead, these properties arise from the inner core. By acting as additional touch sensors, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast inactivating ion channels. Thus, functional tuning of the Pacinian corpuscle is enabled by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core.",

In the gliding bacterium, Mycoplasma mobile , a dimeric F 1 -like ATPase forms a chain structure within the cell, which is proposed to drive the gliding motility. However, the mechanisms of force generation and transmission remain unclear. We determined the electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the dimeric F 1 -like ATPase complex. The structure revealed an assembly distinct from those of dimeric F 1 F O -ATPases. The F 1 -like ATPase unit associated by two subunits GliD and GliE was named G 1 -ATPase as an R 1 domain of rotary ATPases. G 1 -β subunit, a homolog of the F 1 -ATPase catalytic subunit, exhibited a specific N-terminal region that incorporates the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase into the complex. Structural features of the ATPase displayed strong similarities to F 1 -ATPase, suggesting a rotation based on the rotary catalytic mechanism. Overall, the cryo-EM structure provides insights into the mechanism through which G 1 -ATPase drives the Mycoplasma gliding motility.",

However, their preparation methods remain a challenge. Here, we develop a gas-solid reactive sintering technique that successfully fabricates a variety of textured lithium ceramics, including electrolyte and electrode materials. These textured lithium ceramic electrolytes exhibit large columnar grains perpendicular to the surface. The textured electrodes indicate an out-of-plane crystallographic texture. As a result, the Li-ion transport pathways across the grain boundary plane are avoided in the textured lithium ceramic with low tortuosity, resulting in great ionic conductivity enhancement by 42 times compared to its traditional equiaxed counterpart. In addition, both Monte Carlo simulation and finite element analysis support the experimental results. This innovative gas-solid reactive sintering technique can extend to prepare various structured and functional ceramics with tailored structures and properties.",

Elevated spike-specific IgG4 reduced binding to FcγRIIIa and decreased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, in individuals with lower total spike-specific IgG, IgG4 acted in synergy with other IgG subclasses to improve FcγRI and FcγRIIa binding and consequently antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Furthermore, this trend was more pronounced with more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants where vaccination induced comparably lower total spike-specific titers. These observations were further confirmed by in silico modeling where antibody subclass concentrations and FcγR polymorphisms were modulated. Collectively, we illustrate that the impact of elevated IgG4 titers upon Fc functions is dependent on multiple interconnected antibody and antigen factors, which should be taken into consideration when dissecting the mechanisms driving an effective Fc-mediated response following vaccination.",

While polaron formation is believed to facilitate efficient carrier transport, the elementary processes of the underlying electron-lattice coupling are yet poorly understood because of the multiscale chemical and structural heterogeneities. Here, we resolve in combined ground- and excited-state spatiospectral ultrafast nanoimaging how structural characteristics are related to both molecular cation and polaron dynamics. We use the observed nanoscale spatial variations of the formamidinium (FA) cation transient vibrational blue shifts as a local probe of the nonlocal polaron-cation coupling. From the correlation with nanomovies of the polaron dynamics, we then infer how a softer more polarizable lattice supports stable polarons and longer-lived residual carriers. This, together with a relative intragrain homogeneity in contrast to high intergrain heterogeneity, suggests pathways for improved synthesis and device engineering, and that perovskite photonics performance is still far from any fundamental limits.",

However, we lack data and a standardized framework to accurately assess and compare temporal activity for species during rapid ecological change. Through a global network representing 38 countries, we leveraged 8.9 million mammalian observations to create a library of 14,587 standardized diel activity estimates for 445 species. We found that less than half the species’ estimates were in agreement with diel classifications from the reference literature and that species commonly used more than one diel classification. Species diel activity was highly plastic when exposed to anthropogenic change. Furthermore, body size and distributional extent were strongly associated with whether a species is diurnal or nocturnal. Our findings provide essential knowledge of species behavior in an era of rapid global change and suggest the need for a new, quantitative framework that defines diel activity logically and consistently while capturing species plasticity.",

Projections of how those hazards will change are affected by uncertainties in the climate sensitivity of climate models, among other factors. While the level-of-global-warming approach can circumvent model climate sensitivity uncertainties in some applications, practitioners faced with specific adaptation responsibilities often find such projections difficult to use because they generally require time-oriented information. Earth system projections following specified emissions scenarios can, however, be constrained by applying the level-of-global-warming approach to observationally constrained warming projections to yield more reliable time-oriented projections for adaption planning and implementation. This approach also allows individual groups to produce consistent and comparable assessments of multifaceted climate impacts and causal mechanisms, thereby benefiting climate assessments at national and international levels that provide the science basis for adaptation action.",

By implementing a corresponding dynamical decoupling strategy, we are able to surpass the empirical limit and approach the upper physical limit T 2 = 2 T 1 for NVs, from room temperature down to 220 kelvin. Our observations, including the independence across different spatial sites and its dependence on temperature in the same way as spin-lattice relaxation, suggest an emerging decoherence mechanism dominated by spin-lattice interaction.

Host caspase-3 cleaves the precursor NS1/2, leading to NS1 secretion via an unconventional pathway. An unbiased CRISPR screen identifies NINJ1 as an essential factor for NS1 secretion. During infection, NINJ1 is recruited to the viral replication site, where it oligomerizes and forms speckled bodies, directly interacting with NS1. Subsequent mutagenesis studies identify critical amino acid residues of NS1 necessary for its interaction with NINJ1 and selective secretion. Genetic ablation or pharmaceutical inhibition of caspase-3 inhibits oral MNoV infection in mice.

Perovskites have superior optoelectronic properties and structural diversity, making them ideal candidates for high-performing direct full-stokes polarimetry. However, perovskite suffers low chiroptical activity due to inefficient chiral transfer, which greatly limits its circular-polarization-vector discrimination. These issues urgently require remedy. Here, we demonstrate that perovskites’ chiroptical activity is highly related to their structural chiral-distortion extent. We propose using halide mixing to construct asymmetric chiral transfer to heighten its structural chiral-distortion extent. Accordingly, we report a 16-fold increment in the optical chiroptical activity. Further ab initio calculations verify that the enhancement is due to the strengthened magnetic transition dipole in mixed-halide structures. We herein report a self-powered, direct full-Stokes polarimetry with a high detectivity up to 1.2 × 10 12 Jones and low detection errors (Δ S 1–3 ≤ 5.0%).

Aequorin-based examinations disclosed dual cytosolic Ca 2+ peaks shortly after flg22 application, which corresponded with two voltage shifts from the epidermis to SEs. These signals were converted into rapid long-range action potentials (APs) or slower short-range variation potentials (VPs). Modified phytohormone-levels demonstrated systemic AP effects. Jasmonic acid up-regulation was significantly higher in wild-type than Atseor1/2 mutants. Abundant Ca 2+ influx associated with VPs was responsible for transient sieve element occlusion (SEO) near the flg22 perception site, whereas SEO was absent in Atseor1/2 and Atfls2 mutants. Biological relevance of SEO was demonstrated by higher susceptibility of Atseor1/2 mutants to Pseudomonas syringae than wild-type plants.",

Soft-primed cells generate brain metastases in vivo through enhanced transendothelial migration across blood-brain barrier and brain colonization, which is further supported by the findings that tumor cells residing in local soft niches of primary xenografts exhibit brain metastatic tropism. Mechanistically, soft niches suppress cytoskeleton-nucleus–mediated mechanotransduction, which promotes histone deacetylase 3 activity. Inhibiting histone deacetylase 3 abolishes niche softness-induced brain metastatic ability. Collectively, this study uncovers a previously unappreciated role of local niche softness within primary tumors in brain metastasis, highlighting the significance of primary tumor mechanical heterogeneity in metastatic organotropism.",

Here, we manipulate the formation statistics of MN x sites by using sacrifice alkali metals (AM = Li, Na, and K) to form metal vacancy-N x carbon (AM-MVN x -C) templates, which are used to direct the solution-phase formation of CoN 4 sites in Co-N-C catalysts. We build a probability weight function based on the embedding energy of M in MN x sites as the descriptor for MN x formation statistics, and we predict that the alkali metals are prone to induce the formation of MVN 4 sites. By coordinating Co 2+ ions with AM-MVN x -C templates, we synthesize Co-N-C with CoN 4 sites, demonstrating remarkable oxygen reduction activity in anion exchange membrane fuel cells. These results highlight the statistical thermodynamics of MN x formation and open up the possibility for the rational design of complex M-N-C electrocatalysts with well-defined MN x sites.",

However, the cause of this trend in the BKS atmospheric circulation remains unknown. Here we show that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the primary driver of the strengthening of the BKS anticyclonic circulation, with anthropogenic aerosols playing a secondary role, both together accounting for about 86% of the observed circulation trend. Both forcings induce an amplified BKS low-tropospheric warming through coupling with strong sea ice loss. This amplified warming raises geopotential height aloft through thermal expansion, causing an anomalous anticyclonic anomaly, which in turn enhances warming and sea ice loss, forming a positive feedback loop. Our work provides a theoretical framework for understanding Arctic atmospheric circulation responses to anthropogenic warming and may have implications for climate and environment in the Arctic and beyond.",

Here, we systematically benchmark regional gene expression in macaque cortex against (i) macaque cortical receptor density and in vivo and ex vivo microstructure and (ii) human cortical gene expression. We find moderate cortex-wide correspondence between macaque gene expression and protein density, which improves by considering layer-specific gene expression. Half of the examined genes exhibit significant correlation between macaque and human across the cortex. Interspecies correspondence of gene expression is greater in unimodal than in transmodal cortex, recapitulating evolutionary cortical expansion and gene-protein correspondence in the macaque.

We also identified BtMEDOR6 as a key whitefly olfactory receptor of β-myrcene involved in the distinct preference of B. tabaci MED for TYLCV-infected plants. TYLCV inhibits the expression of BtMEDOR6, canceling this preference and thereby facilitating TYLCV transmission to uninfected plants.

Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by using a combination of surface treatment improving the 13 C relaxation ( T 1 ) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Adjustments to the dynamical nuclear polarization sequence (PulsePol) are performed, as well as slow sample rotation, to improve the NV- 13 C polarization transfer rate. The hyperpolarized 13 C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2-micrometer and 100-nanometer median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29-tesla magnetic field) of 1500 and 940, respectively.

In this study, we investigated the fundamentals of applying a solid-state electrolyte (SSE), typically used in battery technologies, as a membrane material for aqueous lithium extraction. We find that the anhydrous hopping of lithium ions through the ordered and confined SSE lattice is highly distinct from ion migration through the hydrated free volumes of conventional nanoporous membranes, thus culminating in unique membrane transport properties. Notably, we reveal that the SSE provides unparalleled performance with respect to ion-ion selectivity, consistently demonstrating lithium ion selectivity values that are immeasurable by even the part-per-billion detection limit of mass spectrometry. Such exceptional selectivity is shown to be the result of the characteristic size and charge exclusion mechanisms of solid-state ion transport, which may be leveraged in the design of next-generation membranes for resource recovery.",

Extensive low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory and many-body calculations show that even-numbered spin chains host a collective state with gapped excitations, while odd-numbered chains feature a Kondo excitation. We found that a given antiferromagnetic coupling J value between first neighbors in the entangled quantum states is responsible for the quantum phenomena, strongly relating to their parities of the chain.

Under depolarizing conditions, it accumulates on mitochondria where it becomes activated, phosphorylating both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin, at Ser 65 . Our experiments reveal that in retinal pigment epithelial cells, only a fraction of PINK1 becomes stabilized after depolarization by electron transport chain inhibitors. Furthermore, the observed accrual of PINK1 cannot be completely accounted for without an accompanying increase in biosynthesis. We have used a ubiquitylation inhibitor TAK-243 to accumulate cleaved PINK1. Under these conditions, generation of unconjugated “free” phospho-ubiquitin serves as a proxy readout for PINK1 activity. This has enabled us to find a preconditioning phenomenon, whereby an initial depolarizing treatment leaves a residual pool of active PINK1 that remains competent to seed the activation of nascent cleaved PINK1 following a 16-hour recovery period.",

Here, high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy revealed how two clinically relevant inhibitors block CDK7 function. In cells, CDK7 inhibition rapidly suppressed transcription, but constitutively active genes were disproportionately affected versus stimulus-responsive. Distinct transcription factors (TFs) regulate constitutive versus stimulus-responsive genes. Accordingly, stimulus-responsive TFs were refractory to CDK7 inhibition whereas constitutively active “core” TFs were repressed. Core TFs (n = 78) are predominantly promoter associated and control cell cycle and proliferative gene expression programs across cell types. Mechanistically, rapid suppression of core TF function can occur through CDK7-dependent phosphorylation changes in core TFs and RB1. Moreover, CDK7 inhibition depleted core TF protein levels within hours, consistent with durable target gene suppression. Thus, a major but unappreciated biological function for CDK7 is regulation of a TF cohort that drives proliferation, revealing an apparent universal mechanism by which CDK7 coordinates RNAPII transcription with cell cycle CDK regulation.",

We apply a statistical physics model—concurrence percolation—to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ( U , V ) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, ≤ V . This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they “superpose” parallel, nonshortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to nonshortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: When nonshortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.",

We have previously shown that as a lipid catalyst, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) electrostatically triggers vesicle fusion by lowering the hydration energy, and masking PIP2 arrests vesicle fusion in a state of the partial SNARE assembly. In this study, we show that calmodulin and protein kinase C–epsilon unmask PIP2 through the dissociation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate from membranes and, thus, rescue basal fusion and potentiate synaptotagmin-1–mediated Ca 2+ -dependent vesicle fusion.

By integrating this chemogenetic approach with in vivo two-photon imaging, we observed that exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling transiently inhibited microglial process dynamics, reduced neuronal activity, and impaired neuronal synchronization.

A key reaction pathway from perfluorocarboxylic acids to ketenes via acyl fluorides is proposed. We furthermore propose CF 2 /CF 3 radical–centered pyrolysis mechanisms and explain their roles in the formation of other products that may form in full-scale incinerators. These results have not only unveiled the role of radicals and intermediates in thermal PFAS decomposition and recombination mechanisms but also provide unique insight into improving the safety and viability of industrial PFAS incineration.",

The auxin-inducible degron (AID) system is a powerful tool for analyzing inducible protein loss in vitro, but it is toxic to mice. Here, we use an optimized second-generation AID system to achieve the conditional and reversible loss of the essential centrosomal protein CEP192 in live mice. We show that the auxin derivative 5-phenyl-indole-3-acetic acid is well tolerated over 2 weeks and drives near-complete CEP192 degradation in less than 1 hour in vivo. CEP192 loss did not affect centriole duplication but decreased γ-tubulin recruitment to centrosomes impairing mitotic spindle assembly. Sustained CEP192 loss in vivo led to cell division failure and cell death in proliferative tissues. Thus, the second-generation AID system is well suited for rapid and/or sustained protein depletion in live mice to study essential functions in vivo.",

However, the neural mechanisms mediating these effects and the role of endogenous central GLP-1 signaling in cocaine seeking remain unknown. Here, we show that voluntary cocaine taking decreased plasma GLP-1 levels in rats and that chemogenetic activation of GLP-1–producing neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius that project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) decreased cocaine seeking. Single-nuclei transcriptomics and FISH studies revealed that GLP-1Rs are expressed primarily on GABA neurons in the VTA. Using in vivo fiber photometry, we found that the efficacy of a systemic GLP-1R agonist to attenuate cocaine seeking was associated with increased activity of VTA GABA neurons and decreased activity of VTA dopamine neurons. Together, these findings suggest that targeting central GLP-1 circuits may be an effective strategy toward reducing cocaine relapse and highlight a functional role of GABAergic GLP-1R–expressing midbrain neurons in drug seeking.",

How 3D-genome organization differs among different cell types and relates to cell type–dependent transcriptional regulation remains unclear.

We uncovered a wide spectrum of differences in the nuclear architecture and 3D-genome organization among different cell types, ranging from the size of the cell nucleus to higher-order chromosome structures and radial positioning of chromatin loci within the nucleus. These cell type–dependent variations in nuclear architecture and chromatin organization exhibit strong correlations with both the total transcriptional activity of the cell and transcriptional regulation of cell type–specific marker genes. Moreover, we found that the methylated DNA binding protein MeCP2 promotes active-inactive chromatin segregation and regulates transcription in a nuclear radial position–dependent manner that is highly correlated with its function in modulating active-inactive chromatin compartmentalization.",

Directional dichroism is the nonreciprocal phenomenon of light; the light transmittance varies depending on the direction of light propagation. It arises from interference between electromagnetic fields of light, resulting in the nonreciprocal transmittance determined by the resonance light absorption. For the maximum interference, it shows one-way transparency, and achieving this is an outstanding experimental challenge. Concerning energy dispersion, the resonance generally occurs only at a specific energy with a narrow bandwidth. When the excited state of the magnon spontaneously decays into lower energy states, the absorption linewidth gets broader. Here, using electron spin resonance, we identify the specific absorption mode in a multiferroic material Sr 2 CoSi 2 O 7 with the spontaneous magnon decay accompanied by the maximum interference, achieving the broadband one-way transparency.",

However, recent estimates on younger OJN eruption ages cast doubt on the link between OJN volcanism and OAE1a. Here, we further demonstrate the synchroneity between OJN volcanism and OAE1a by refining the chronology of Pacific volcanogenic sedimentary records on Magellan Rise, nearby OJN, with detailed osmium and carbon isotopic stratigraphy. Our geochemical data reveal that a thick tuffaceous interval at this site was deposited during OAE1a. Furthermore, multisite compilation of osmium isotopes, Pacific volcanic ash beds, and paleontological data just above OJN basalts illustrate that explosive OJN eruptions spanned ~5 million years, peaking around OAE1a. Their synchroneity strongly indicates that OJN volcanism most likely caused OAE1a and relevant late Barremian to mid-Aptian environmental perturbations.",

Our results present evidence for localized, anisotropic structures with a near-zero Poisson’s ratio in the medium surrounding 1 to 2 kilometer–sized earthquake clusters, suggesting that the fault medium is damaged, foliated, and enriched with fluid. Such localized structures may cause stress perturbations on faults that in turn favor the frequent occurrence of deep interplate earthquakes at depths of 60 to 70 kilometers. Therefore, identifying the distribution and properties of fault material heterogeneity is important for more informed assessment of earthquake hazards.",

To bridge these gaps, biomimetic synthetic vesicles (SVs) have emerged as innovative platforms, combining the advantageous properties of EVs and liposomes. This review emphasizes critical aspects of EV biology, such as mechanisms of EV-cell interaction and source-dependent functionalities in targeting, immune modulation, and tissue regeneration, informing biomimetic SV engineering. We reviewed a broad array of biomimetic SVs, with a focus on lipid bilayered vesicles functionalized with proteins.

A210-CAART incorporating a CD8α transmembrane domain (TMD8α) showed functional but unstable surface expression, partially restored by inhibiting lysosomal degradation. A210-CAART with a CD28 TMD showed sustained surface expression, independent of TMD dimerization motifs. In a mouse xenograft model, A210.TMD8α-CAART demonstrated early control of anti-AChR B cell outgrowth but subsequent rebound and loss of surface CAAR expression, whereas A210.TMD28-CAART induced sustained surface CAAR expression and target cell elimination.

One key challenge that these quantum sensors face is improving the sensitivity within a given timeframe while preserving a high dynamic range.

Using a tailored adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation algorithm designed for Ramsey interferometry using coherent population trapping (CPT), cold-atom magnetometry facilitates adaptive high-precision detection of a dc magnetic field with high dynamic range. Through implementing a sequence of correlated CPT-Ramsey interferometry, the sensitivity significantly surpasses the standard quantum limit with respect to total interrogation time. We yield a sensitivity of 6.8 ± 0.1 picotesla per square root of hertz over a range of 145.6 nanotesla, exceeding the conventional frequentist protocol by 3.3 ± 0.1 decibels.

We show that SIC-induced radiation anomalies at the top of the atmosphere are sensitive to the location of SIC reduction in each season, which qualitatively explains how and why the effect of sea ice loss on Earth’s energy budget is determined by its spatial pattern. Idealized experiments indicate that SIC-induced surface warming is greater in the Arctic regions, resulting in a more negative Planck feedback. Global low-level cloud cover responses to Arctic and Antarctic SIC reduction are also distinct, leading to more negative SIC-cloud feedback in Arctic regions. SIC-induced albedo feedback is sensitive to latitude due to inhomogeneous solar radiation at the surface. As a result, the simulated radiative effect of SIC anomalies during 1980–2019 is dominated by variations in the spatial pattern of SIC.",

Nevertheless, inherent shortcomings of short half-life, activation of regulatory T (T reg ) cells, and systemic toxicity limit its application. To tackle these, a circular RNA (cRNA)–based IL-2 therapy using immunomodulatory lipid nanoparticles [ursodeoxycholic acid lipid nanoparticles (ULNPs)] and sustained-release hydrogel was developed. Fusing fragment crystallizable (Fc) region into IL-2 and encoding this fusion protein IL-2-Fc (IL-2F) in cRNA (cRNA IL-2F ) greatly extend the half-life. ULNPs containing ursodeoxycholic acid, a transforming growth factor-β1 inhibitor, suppress the function of T reg cells. Consequently, the ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F formulation promotes CD8 + T cells and suppresses T reg cells, increasing the CD8 + /T reg ratio for effective immunotherapy. Furthermore, a locally administrated hydrogel loading with ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F sustains the release, enhancing efficacy and reducing toxicity. This innovative approach achieves remarkable tumor inhibition in both melanoma and orthotopic glioma models with or without surgery, offering a promising future for cancer immunotherapy.",

Crucially, the canonical ultrastructure of the synaptonemal complex is altered upon weakening this interface using charge-reversal mutations. We developed a thermodynamic model that recapitulates our experimental observations, indicating that the liquid-like central region can assemble by wetting the axes without active energy consumption.

Our present cryo-EM analysis of Aquifex aeolicus RseP ( Aa RseP) revealed that a substrate-like membrane protein fragment from the expression host occupied the active site while spanning a transmembrane cavity that is inaccessible via lateral diffusion. Furthermore, in vivo photocrosslinking supported that this substrate accommodation mode is recapitulated on the cell membrane.

The microscope features a unique micro four-point probe for fast, nondestructive scanning without calibration or extra sample preparation.
