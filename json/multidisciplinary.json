Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07219-0 (2024).\n\nKotz, Levermann and Wenz1 (henceforth, KLW) analysed how subnational gross domestic product (GDP) growth responds to year-to-year changes in temperature and precipitation. They reported that if historical relationships continue to hold, global GDP would be lowered by roughly 62% (central estimate) in 2100 under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 ‘high emissions’ scenario, an impact roughly 3 times larger than similar previous estimates2,3. Here we show that (1) data anomalies arising from one country in KLW’s underlying GDP dataset, Uzbekistan, substantially bias their predicted impacts of climate change, (2) KLW underestimate statistical uncertainty in their future projections of climate impacts, and (3) additional data-quality concerns in KLW’s subnational GDP data warrant further investigation. When Uzbekistan’s data are removed and statistical uncertainty is corrected to account for spatial correlations, KLW’s central estimate aligns closely with previous literature and their results are no longer statistically distinguishable from mitigation costs at any time this century.",

          "abstract": "Predicting the social and behavioural impact of future technologies before they are achieved would enable us to guide their development and regulation before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method that uses experimental methods to simulate future technologies and collect quantitative measures of the attitudes and behaviours of participants assigned to controlled variations of the future. We call this method ‘science fiction science’. We suggest that the reason that this method has not been fully embraced yet, despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be reluctant to engage in work that faces such serious validity threats. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on the types of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the unconventional, immersive methods that it may require. We seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been marginalized for so long, the benefits it would bring if it could be built on strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle of validity improvement.",

          "abstract": "NSD2 catalyses the epigenetic modification H3K36me2 (refs. 1,2) and is a candidate convergent downstream effector of oncogenic signalling in diverse malignancies3,4,5. However, it remains unclear whether the enzymatic activity of NSD2 is therapeutically targetable. Here we characterize a series of clinical-grade small-molecule catalytic NSD2 inhibitors (NSD2i) and show that the pharmacological targeting of NSD2 constitutes an epigenetic dependency with broad therapeutic efficacy in KRAS-driven preclinical cancer models. NSD2i inhibits NSD2 with single-digit nanomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration potency and high selectivity over related methyltransferases. Structural analyses reveal that the specificity of NSD2i for NSD2 is due to competitive binding with S-adenosylmethionine and catalytic disruption through a binary-channel obstruction mechanism. Proteo-epigenomic and single-cell strategies in pancreatic and lung cancer models support a mechanism in which sustained NSD2i exposure reverses pathological H3K36me2-driven chromatin plasticity, re-establishing silencing at H3K27me3-legacy loci to curtail oncogenic gene expression programs. Accordingly, NSD2i impairs the viability of pancreatic and lung cancer cells and the growth of patient-derived xenograft tumours. Furthermore, NSD2i, which is well-tolerated in vivo, prolongs survival in advanced-stage autochthonous KRASG12C-driven pancreatic and lung tumours in mouse models to a comparable level as KRAS inhibition with sotorasib6. In these models, treatment with both a NSD2 inhibitor and sotorasib synergize to confer sustained survival with extensive tumour regression and elimination. Together, our work uncovers targeting of the NSD2–H3K36me2 axis as an actionable vulnerability in difficult to treat cancers and provides support for the evaluation of NSD2 and KRAS inhibitor combination therapies in a clinical setting.",

          "authors": "Xiao-Feng Tan, Ana I. Fernández-Mariño, Yan Li, Tsg-Hui Chang, Kenton J. Swartz",
          "abstract": "Action potentials are generated by opening of voltage-activated sodium (Na v ) and potassium (K v ) channels 1 , which can rapidly inactivate to shape the nerve impulse and contribute to synaptic facilitation and short-term memory 1–4 . The mechanism of fast inactivation was proposed to involve an intracellular domain that blocks the internal pore in both Na v 5,6 and K v 7–9 channels; however, recent studies in Na v 10,11 and K v 12,13 channels support a mechanism in which the internal pore closes during inactivation. Here we investigate the mechanism of fast inactivation in the Shaker K v channel using cryo-electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and electrophysiology. We resolved structures of a fully inactivated state in which the non-polar end of the N terminus plugs the internal pore in an extended conformation. The N-terminal methionine is deleted, leaving an alanine that is acetylated and interacts with a pore-lining isoleucine residue where RNA editing regulates fast inactivation 14 . Opening of the internal activation gate is required for fast inactivation because it enables the plug domain to block the pore and repositions gate residues to interact with and stabilize that domain. We also show that external K + destabilizes the inactivated state by altering the conformation of the ion selectivity filter rather than by electrostatic repulsion. These findings establish the mechanism of fast inactivation in K v channels, revealing how it is regulated by RNA editing and N-terminal acetylation, and providing a framework for understanding related mechanisms in other voltage-activated channels.",

However, biologically inspired robots, especially those mimicking octopus locomotion4,5, are based on limited in situ behavioural data owing to the complexity of collecting quantitative observations. Here we describe deployments of a remotely operated vehicle, equipped with a suite of imaging systems, to study the mechanics of locomotion in the octopus Muusoctopus robustus at the recently discovered 3,000-m deep Octopus Garden. Using a recently developed light-field imaging system called EyeRIS and an ultra-high-definition science camera, we were able to capture wide and zoomed-in views to characterize whole-animal gaits in a completely unconstrained environment across multiple individuals. Furthermore, the real-time volumetric data captured using EyeRIS yielded quantitative kinematics measurements of individual octopus arms during crawling, showing regions of high curvature and strain concentrated at distinct arm locations. Our results indicate that M. robustus crawling patterns showed several elements of simplified control, with implications for the design of future octopus-inspired robots. Further developments and deployments of technologies such as EyeRIS, coupled with capable robotic vehicles, will enable mining of the deep ocean for biological inspiration.",

          "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA amplification is associated with poor cancer prognoses 1 . Large numbers of excised signal circles (ESCs) are produced as by-products of antigen receptor rearrangement during V(D)J recombination 2,3 . However, current dogma states that ESCs are progressively lost through cell division 4 . Here we show that ESCs replicate and persist through many cell generations and share many properties in common with circular extrachromosomal DNAs. Increased ESC copy numbers at diagnosis of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were highly correlated with subsequent relapse. By taking advantage of the matching recombination footprint that is formed upon the generation of each ESC, we measured ESC persistence and replication and found increased ESC replication in patients who later relapsed. This increased replication is controlled by cell-intrinsic factors and corresponds to increased expression of DNA replication- and repair-associated genes. Consistent with high ESC levels having a role in disease progression, the number of mutations typical of those caused by the V(D)J recombinase–ESC complex was significantly increased at diagnosis in patients who later relapsed. The number of such mutations in genes associated with relapse increased between diagnosis and relapse, and corresponded to clonal expansion of cells with high ESC copy numbers. These data demonstrate that the by-product of V(D)J recombination, when increased in abundance, potently associates with the V(D)J recombinase to cause adverse disease outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Magnetic soft robots offer considerable potential across various scenarios, such as biomedical applications and industrial tasks, due to their shape programmability and reconfigurability, safe interaction, and biocompatibility1–4. Despite recent advances, magnetic soft robots are still limited by the difficulties in reprogramming their required magnetization profiles in real time on the spot (in situ), which is essential for performing multiple functions or executing diverse tasks5,6. Here, we introduce a method for real-time, in situ magnetization reprogramming that enables the rearrangement and recombination of magnetic units to achieve diverse magnetization profiles. We explore the applications of this method in structures of varying dimensions, from one-dimensional (1D) tubes to three-dimensional (3D) frameworks, showcasing a diverse and expanded range of configurations and their deformations. This method also demonstrates versatility in diverse scenarios, including navigating around objects without undesired contact, reprogramming cilia arrays, managing multiple instruments cooperatively or independently under the same magnetic field, and manipulating objects of various shapes. These capabilities extend the range of applications for magnetic actuation technologies. Furthermore, this method emancipates magnetic soft robots from the sole reliance on external magnetic fields for shape change, facilitating unprecedented modes and varieties of deformation while simultaneously reducing the need for complex magnetic field generation systems; thereby, opening new avenues for the development of magnetic actuation technologies.",

          "abstract": "Glycosylation is central to the localization and function of biomolecules1. We recently discovered that small RNAs undergo N-glycosylation2 at the modified RNA base 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) uridine (acp3U)3. However, the functional significance of N-glycosylation of RNAs is unknown. Here we show that the N-glycans on glycoRNAs prevent innate immune sensing of endogenous small RNAs. We found that de-N-glycosylation of cell-culture-derived and circulating human and mouse glycoRNA elicited potent inflammatory responses including the production of type I interferons in a Toll-like receptor 3- and Toll-like receptor 7-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that N-glycans on cell surface RNAs prevent apoptotic cells from triggering endosomal RNA sensors in efferocytes, thus facilitating the non-inflammatory clearance of dead cells. Mechanistically, N-glycans conceal the hypermodified uracil base acp3U, which we identified as immunostimulatory when exposed in RNA. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of an enzyme (DTWD2) that synthesizes acp3U abrogated innate immune activation by de-N-glycosylated small RNAs and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, synthetic acp3U-containing RNAs are sufficient to trigger innate immune responses. Thus, our study has uncovered a natural mechanism by which N-glycans block RNAs from inducing acp3U-dependent innate immune activation, demonstrating how glycoRNAs exist on the cell surface and in the endosomal network without inducing autoinflammatory responses.",

          "abstract": "Migration of transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells into the brain following systemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transplantation (HCT) holds great promise as a therapeutic modality to correct genetic deficiencies in the brain such as lysosomal storage diseases.1–3 However, the toxic myeloablation required for allogeneic HCT can cause serious, life-threatening side effects limiting its applicability. Moreover, transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells are highly vulnerable to rejection even in an immune-privileged organ like the brain. Here we report a brain-restricted, high-efficiency microglia replacement approach without myeloablative preconditioning. Unlike previous assumptions, we found that hematopoietic stem cells are not required to repopulate the myeloid compartment of the brain environment. In contrast, Sca1- committed progenitor cells were highly efficient to replace microglia following intracerebral injection. This finding enabled the development of brain-restricted preconditioning and avoided long-term peripheral engraftment thus eliminating complications such as graft-vs-host disease. Evaluating its therapeutic potential, we found that our allogeneic microglia replacement method rescues the murine model of Sandhoff disease, a lysosomal storage disease caused by hexosaminidase B deficiency. In support of the translational relevance of this approach, we discovered that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myeloid progenitor cells display a similar engraftment potential following brain-restricted conditioning. Our results overcome current limitations of conventional HCT and may pave the way for the development of allogeneic microglial cell therapies for the brain.",

Here we uncovered the microglial regulation of the sustained proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and neuroblasts in the human medial ganglionic eminence (hMGE). We showed that microglia are preferentially distributed in the proliferating zone and identified insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor IGR1R as the predicted top ligand–receptor pair underlying microglia–progenitor communication in the prenatal hMGE. Using our newly developed neuroimmune hMGE organoids, which mimic the hMGE cytoarchitecture and developmental trajectory, we demonstrated that microglia-derived IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation and production of GABAergic neurons. Conversely, IGF1-neutralizing antibodies and IGF1 knockout human embryonic stem-cell-induced microglia abolish the induced microglia-mediated progenitor proliferation. Together, these findings revealed a previously unappreciated role of microglia-derived IGF1 in promoting the proliferation of neural progenitors and the development of GABAergic neurons in the human brain.",

Previously, the oldest indication of hominins in Wallacea, the oceanic island zone east of Sunda, comprised flaked stone artefacts deposited at least 1.02 ± 0.02 million years ago (Ma) at Wolo Sege on Flores5. Early hominins were also established on the oceanic island of Luzon (Philippines), as indicated by both stone artefacts and cut marks on faunal remains dating to between 777 and 631 thousand years ago (ka) at Kalinga6. Moreover, fossils of extinct, small-bodied hominins occur on Flores (Homo floresiensis)7,8,9,10,11,12 and Luzon (Homo luzonensis)13. On Sulawesi, the largest Wallacean island, previous excavations revealed stone artefacts with a minimum age of 194 ka at the open site of Talepu in the Walanae Depression14, long preceding the earliest known presence of modern humans (Homo sapiens) in the region (73–63 ka in Sunda)15. Here we show that stone artefacts also occur at the nearby site of Calio in fossiliferous layers dated to at least 1.04 Ma and possibly up to 1.48 Ma, using palaeomagnetic dating of sedimentary rocks and coupled Uranium-series (U-series) and electron-spin resonance (US–ESR) dating of fossil teeth.

          "abstract": "As tissue resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, microglia perform diverse essential functions during homeostasis and perturbations1. They primarily interact with neurons via synaptic engulfment and through the rapid elimination of apoptotic cells and nonfunctional synapses2. Here, by combining unbiased lipidomics and high resolution spatial lipid imaging, deep single-cell transcriptome analysis and novel cell type-specific mutants, we identified a previously unknown mode of microglial interaction with neurons. During homeostasis, microglia deliver the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase (Hex) to neurons for the degradation of the ganglioside GM2 that is integral to maintaining cell membrane organization and function. Absence of Hexb, encoding the β subunit of Hex, in both mice and patients suffering from neurodegenerative Sandhoff disease leads to a massive accumulation of GM2 derivatives in a characteristic spatiotemporal manner3. In mice, neuronal GM2 gangliosides subsequently engage the macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL)2 receptor on microglia via N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, leading to lethal neurodegeneration. Notably, replacement of microglia with peripherally derived microglia-like cells (MLCs) is able to break this degenerative cycle and fully restore CNS homeostasis. Our results reveal a novel mode of bidirectional microglia-neuron communication centred around GM2 ganglioside turnover, identify a novel microgliopathy and offer novel therapeutic avenues for these maladies.",

          "abstract": "The periodic table provides an intuitive framework for understanding chemical properties. However, its traditional patterns may break down for the heaviest elements occupying the bottom of the chart. The large nuclei of actinides (Z > 88) and superheavy elements (Z ≥ 104) give rise to relativistic effects that are expected to substantially alter their chemical behaviours, potentially indicating that we have reached the end of a predictive periodic table1. Relativistic effects have already been cited for the unusual chemistry of the actinides compared with those of their lanthanide counterparts2. Unfortunately, it is difficult to understand the full impact of relativistic effects, as research on the later actinides and superheavy elements is scarce. Beyond fermium (Z = 100), elements need to be produced and studied one atom at a time, using accelerated ion beams and state-of-the-art experimental approaches. So far, no experiments have been capable of directly identifying produced molecular species.

          "abstract": "There is ongoing debate about the vulnerability of arthropods to climate change1,2. Long-term impacts of climate change on arthropod communities could manifest through short-term weather patterns3. Arthropods in the tropics are hyper-diverse4,5 and contribute many crucial ecosystem functions6,7, but are comparatively less studied than in temperate regions1,8,9. Tropical forest arthropods and the functions that they provide may be vulnerable to intensified El Niño events under climate change10,11,12. Here we perform time-series analysis of data from primary tropical forests, which reveal long-term declines in arthropod diversity and function that were linked to El Niño occurrence. In the Americas, species losses correlated with El Niño sensitivity, and abundant species fluctuated according to feeding traits and level of ecological specialization. Parallel declines in butterflies in Southeast Asia suggested that impacts spanned continents. Predicted arthropod diversity changes correlated with observed rates of invertebrate-mediated decomposition and leaf herbivory, which were oscillating and crashing, respectively, across the tropics. Our analyses suggest that an intensified El Niño immediately threatens tropical forest arthropods and the ecosystem functions that they provide. The broader consequences remain unknown, but such widespread changes could fundamentally alter tropical forest ecosystems13. Long-term monitoring of arthropod diversity and forest functioning across the tropics is paramount, as is researching the potential mechanisms that underly this novel threat.",

          "abstract": "The aridity index is widely used to indicate water availability on land. Balancing climatic water supply (precipitation, P) against demand (potential evapotranspiration, PET), it is often expressed as the P/PET ratio1 or humidity index. Water also flows laterally by rivers and groundwater, from hills to valleys and from mountains to plains, subsidizing the receiving lowlands2. Here, we show that this lateral subsidy reduces aridity in the receiving lowlands. We first estimate monthly subsidies (Qlat) by surface and groundwater at 30″ global grids with a global hydrology model. We then calculate the conventional global humidity index (GHI) as P/PET and a new GHI including Qlat as (P + Qlat)/PET. Termed GHI_topo, the latter reflects land topography, higher in hydrologically convergent lowlands. It also exhibits a delayed and dampened seasonality (relative to P) owing to delayed and diffused Qlat arrival at the receiving lowlands. Such spatiotemporal features of Qlat, arising from both the climate and the terrain, make GHI_topo a more realistic indicator of local water availability in downgradient societies and ecosystems, enabling life in arid locations and times. Global land area with GHI_topo ≥ 1 (supply meets or exceeds demand) is 33% greater than GHI ≥ 1 and far higher in arid and season-arid climates.",

Experiments and observations also link it to the emergence of energetic particles and X-rays3. However, how this multi-scale physics affects the abrupt onset of reconnection remains unknown. Here we report observations from laboratory experiments involving two flux ropes with electron beams that induce magnetic turbulence and then abruptly merge into a single structure, altering the magnetic topology in the MHD regime. Two separate electron beams are launched along magnetic field lines and form individual flux ropes with a drift velocity higher than the ambient Alfvén velocity, effectively driving magnetic turbulence through beam-driven instabilities, as inferred from the increased level of the turbulent power spectrum. Experimental observations, including the appearance of energetic particles, increased ion temperature and changes in the characteristics of the flux ropes, suggest that beam-driven turbulence drives three-dimensional (3D) reconnection. 3D particle-in-cell simulations are performed, which successfully reproduce the key aspects of the experiment. These results directly explain how non-MHD kinetic processes progress through multiple scales to induce global MHD changes.",

However, the lamprey-like internal anatomy8,9,10,11,12,13 reconstructed for osteostracans, the sister group of jawed vertebrates, seem to lack these gnathostome traits, implying a morphological gap despite phylogenetic proximity. Here, using synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography on the model osteostracan Norselaspis glacialis, we reveal derived gnathostome traits straddling a uniquely ossified head–trunk interface in this jawless fish. The inner ear of Norselaspis shows sensory elaborations (enlarged pars inferior and sinus superior) acquired well before the origin of jaws. As in crown gnathostomes, paired venous drainage channels blood into a high-volume cardiac tract. We also confirm a feature not yet demonstrated in any other vertebrate, to our knowledge: the most anterior trunk nerve extends its single trunk to the pectoral fin. In this respect, our reconstruction challenges the hypotheses14,15,16 that the gnathostome shoulder evolved from the gill apparatus. Our observations highlight Norselaspis as a prelude to the intercalation of the muscular neck and throat that would power the early jaw apparatus. Therefore, the vertebrate jaw—often considered the functional driver for ‘gnathostome’ innovations1,2,3—evolved instead as a follower to the sensory enhancement, increased cardiac output and greater locomotory control now inferred in the jawless sister group.",

Effector memory CD8+ T cells and CD4+ TH1 cells as well as CD4+ TH17 cells co-migrate to the brain of EBV-infected humanized mice. T-bet+CXCR3+ B cells can colonize submeningeal brain regions in the absence of other lymphocytes and attract T cells.

          "abstract": "The earliest molecular changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are poorly understood1,2,3,4,5. Here we show that endogenous lithium (Li) is dynamically regulated in the brain and contributes to cognitive preservation during ageing. Of the metals we analysed, Li was the only one that was significantly reduced in the brain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD. Li bioavailability was further reduced in AD by amyloid sequestration. We explored the role of endogenous Li in the brain by depleting it from the diet of wild-type and AD mouse models. Reducing endogenous cortical Li by approximately 50% markedly increased the deposition of amyloid-β and the accumulation of phospho-tau, and led to pro-inflammatory microglial activation, the loss of synapses, axons and myelin, and accelerated cognitive decline. These effects were mediated, at least in part, through activation of the kinase GSK3β. Single-nucleus RNA-seq showed that Li deficiency gives rise to transcriptome changes in multiple brain cell types that overlap with transcriptome changes in AD. Replacement therapy with lithium orotate, which is a Li salt with reduced amyloid binding, prevents pathological changes and memory loss in AD mouse models and ageing wild-type mice. These findings reveal physiological effects of endogenous Li in the brain and indicate that disruption of Li homeostasis may be an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Li replacement with amyloid-evading salts is a potential approach to the prevention and treatment of AD.",

We demonstrate that a single tree hosts approximately one trillion bacteria in its woody tissues, with microbial communities distinctly partitioned between heartwood and sapwood, each maintaining unique microbiomes with minimal similarity to other plant tissues or ecosystem components. The heartwood microbiome emerges as a particularly unique ecological niche, distinguished by specialized archaea and anaerobic bacteria driving consequential biogeochemical processes. Our findings support the concept of plants as ‘holobionts’3,4—integrated ecological units of host and associated microorganisms—with implications for tree health, disease and functionality.

Coupling this dataset with rich phenotypic data, we surveyed within- and cross-ancestry genomic associations and identified novel genetic and clinical insights. Although most associations with disease traits were primarily observed in individuals of European ancestries, strong or novel signals were also identified in individuals of African and Asian ancestries.

However, both methods face fundamental limitations, such as a limited Q factor and near-field enhancement control and the inability to achieve resonance on–off switching by completely coupling and decoupling the mode from the far field. Here we demonstrate temporal symmetry breaking in metasurfaces through ultrafast optical pumping, providing an experimental realization of radiative-loss-driven resonance tuning, allowing resonance creation, annihilation, broadening and sharpening. To enable this temporal control, we introduce restored symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum. Even though their unit cells are geometrically asymmetric, coupling to the radiation continuum remains fully suppressed, which, in this work, is achieved by two equally strong antisymmetric dipoles. By using selective Mie-resonant pumping in parts of these unit cells, we can modify their dipole balance to create or annihilate resonances as well as tune the linewidth, amplitude and near-field enhancement, leading to potential applications in optical and quantum communications, time crystals and photonic circuits.",

This history is encoded in the angular momentum architecture of planetary systems—the relation between the rotational properties of the central star and the orbital geometry of planets. A primary observable is the alignment (or misalignment) between the rotational axis of the star and the orbital plane of its planets, known as stellar obliquity. Hundreds of spin–orbit constraints have been measured for giant planets close to their host stars4, many of which have revealed planets on misaligned orbits. A leading question that has emerged is whether stellar obliquity originates primarily from gravitational interactions with other planets or distant stars in the same system, or if it is ‘primordial’—imprinted during the star-formation process. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of primordial obliquities between the spin axes of young, isolated Sun-like stars and the orientation of the outer regions of their protoplanetary disks. Most systems are consistent with angular momentum alignment but about one-third of isolated young systems exhibit primordial misalignment. This suggests that some obliquities identified in planetary systems at older ages—including the Sun’s modest misalignment with planets in the Solar System—could originate from initial conditions of their formation.",

          "abstract": "Parent-of-origin effects (POEs) occur when the effect of a genetic variant depends on its parental origin 1 . Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, POEs are believed to occur due to parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, resulting in opposing parental influences 2 . Despite their importance, POEs remain underexplored in complex traits, owing to the lack of parental genomes. Here we present an approach to infer the parent of origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging interchromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and X chromosome data, and sex-specific crossover in siblings. Applied to the UK Biobank, this enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 109,385 individuals. Genome-wide association study scans for 59 complex traits and over 14,000 protein quantitative trait loci contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 POEs and confirmed more than 50% of known associations. More than one third of these showed opposite parental influences, especially for traits related to growth (for example, IGF1 and height) and metabolism (for example, type 2 diabetes and triglyceride levels). Replication in up to 85,050 individuals from the Estonian Biobank and 42,346 offspring from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) validated 87% of testable associations. Overall, our findings highlight the contribution of POEs to complex traits and support the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.",

          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "Attached to the Very Large Telescope in Chile, the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) allows researchers to probe the most distant galaxies. It’s a popular instrument: for its next observing session, from October to April, scientists have applied for more than 3,000 hours of observation time. That’s a problem. Even though it’s dubbed a cosmic time machine, not even MUSE can squeeze 379 nights of work into just seven months.\n\nThe European Southern Observatory (ESO), which runs the Chile telescope, usually asks panels of experts to select the worthiest proposals. But as the number of requests has soared, so has the burden on the scientists asked to grade them.\n\n“The load was simply unbearable,” says astronomer Nando Patat at ESO’s Observing Programmes Office in Garching, Germany. So, in 2022, ESO passed the work back to the applicants. Teams that want observing time must also assess related applications from rival groups.\n\nAI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried\n\nThe change is one increasingly popular answer to the labour crisis engulfing peer review — the process by which grant applications and research manuscripts are assessed and filtered by specialists before a final decision is made about funding or publication.\n\nWith the number of scholarly papers rising each year, publishers and editors complain that it’s getting harder to get everything reviewed. And some funding bodies, such as ESO, are struggling to find reviewers.\n\nAs pressure on the system grows, many researchers point to low-quality or error-strewn research appearing in journals as an indictment of their peer-review systems failing to uphold rigour. Others complain that clunky grant-review systems are preventing exciting research ideas from being funded.\n\nThese are long-standing concerns. Peer review has been accused of being a sluggish, gatekeeping, bias-laden enterprise for as long as it has existed. But some data show that dissatisfaction is growing. Added strain on the system, such as the explosion of publications following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, has prompted interest in methods to boost the speed and effectiveness of peer review, with experiments at journals ranging from paying reviewers to giving more structured guidance.\n\nOthers argue that peer review has become too unreliable. They suggest radical reform, up to and including phasing out the practice entirely.\n\nMore recent than you think\n\nAlthough it is often described as the bedrock of scientific endeavour, peer review as it is performed today became widespread among journals and funders only in the 1960s and 1970s. Before then, the idea of refereeing manuscripts was more haphazard. Whereas some journals used external review, many editors judged what to publish entirely on the basis of their own expertise, or that of a small pool of academic experts, says Melinda Baldwin, a historian of science at the University of Maryland in College Park who has studied the development of peer-review systems in academia.\n\nBut with massive increases in public funds for research, the volume of manuscripts pushed editors at all journals towards external review, to avoid overwhelming a small pool of reviewers. Even now, external reviewing is far from a monolithic standard. Rather, it is a diverse collection of checking and selection practices that differ between journals, scholarly fields and funders.\n\nPeer reviewers unmasked: largest global survey reveals trends\n\nWhat emerged in the late twentieth century is now facing a similar crisis: too many manuscripts and not enough reviewers. The science system is churning out ever more research papers1, but the reviewer pool doesn’t seem to be growing fast enough.\n\nEvidence for the problem is largely anecdotal, because journals tend to keep their information private. But some data have emerged. In 2018, a report by the website Publons (now owned by the analytics firm Clarivate) analysed anonymized information from more than ten million manuscripts submitted during 2013–17 in a widely used peer-review workflow tool. The report found that, over time, editors had to send out more and more invitations to get a completed review (see go.nature.com/4k8xbfp). Publons, which also surveyed 11,000 researchers, warned of a rise in “reviewer fatigue”. More recently, fields from ophthalmology2 to microbiology3 have reported that more scientists are rejecting invitations to review. In a blog posted last month, analyst Christos Petrou, founder of the consultancy firm Scholarly Intelligence in Tokyo, analysed turnaround times for manuscripts across 16 major science publishers. He found that the average turnaround time from manuscript submission to acceptance is increasing — it is now at 149 days, compared with 140 in 2014: a rise of about 6% over the decade (see go.nature.com/4mkm29d).\n\nIOP Publishing, the publishing arm of the UK Institute of Physics in London, surveyed the experiences of researchers (mostly in the physical and environmental sciences) in 2020 and again in 2024. In 2024, half of the 3,000 or so respondents said that the number of peer-review requests they received had gone up over the previous three years (see go.nature.com/4h7gagv). On the encouraging side, only 16% said they received too many requests (down from 26% four years ago), but respondents from Europe and the United States were more likely to say this (see ‘Pressure on reviewers’).\n\nSource: State of Peer Review 2024/IOP Publishing (https://go.nature.com/4JYSDTS)\nReview rewards\n\nMany experiments by funders and journals are aimed at incentivizing researchers to do more reviews, and getting them to send in their assessments more quickly.\n\nSome journals have tried publicly posting review turnaround times, leading to a modest reduction in review completion time, mainly among senior researchers. Others hand out awards for productive reviewers, although there’s some evidence that such prizes led to reviewers completing fewer reviews in subsequent years, possibly because they felt they had done their bit4. Another idea is to change research-assessment practices: an April survey of more than 6,000 scientists by Springer Nature, which publishes Nature, found that 70% wanted their work evaluations to consider their peer-review contributions, but only 50% said they currently did so. (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)\n\nThe ultimate incentive might be financial. A debate about paying reviewers has swung to and fro for years. Supporters argue that it’s a fair reflection of the work and value that reviewers provide. In 2021, Balazs Aczel, a psychologist at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, and his colleagues estimated that reviewers worked for more than 100 million hours on reports in 20205. On the basis of the average salaries of academics, that’s a contribution worth billions of dollars. Critics, however, warn of conflicts of interests and perverse incentives if researchers are paid to review, and point out that most academics say they carry out reviewing duties in their salaried work time.\n\nPotential reviewers rarely indicate why they refuse to review. But Aczel suggests that a growing number resent providing a free service that commercial publishers turn into profits. That point was made strongly by James Heathers, a science-integrity consultant based in Boston, Massachusetts, who in 2020 posted on a blog that he would accept unpaid review invitations only from society, community and other non-profit journals. Big publishers would receive an invoice for $450.\n\nThe move backfired, he jokes now. Although requests from commercial publishers stopped, those from the other categories went up.\n\nPublishers trial paying peer reviewers — what did they find?\n\nThis year, two publications reported on the results of experiments to pay journal reviewers. Critical Care Medicine offered US$250 per report. Its trial, funded by the Canadian government, showed that the offer of payment made reviewers slightly more likely to take up requests (the proportion of invitations accepted rose from 48% to 53% ), with turnaround time boosted slightly from 12 to 11 days. Review reports were of comparable quality6. But the journal doesn’t have the resources to keep paying for reviews, says David Maslove, an associate editor on the journal and a critical-care physician at Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada.\n\nBy contrast, the Company of Biologists, a non-profit organization in Cambridge, UK, is continuing with paid review on its journal Biology Open after a successful trial. The journal paid reviewers £220 (US$295) per review, and — unlike Critical Care Medicine — told them it expected a first response within four days, to allow editors to decide on manuscript acceptance or rejection within a week of submission.\n\nEvery manuscript in the trial received a first decision within seven working days, with an average turnaround time of 4.6 business days7. That’s compared with the 38 days the journal was seeing with the standard review process. Journal staff agreed that review quality was upheld, says Biology Open’s managing editor, Alejandra Clark.\n\n“If it is scalable, then we need to figure out how to finance it,” Clark says. “We would obviously like to avoid putting the burden on authors by increasing the APCs [article processing charges] to adjust some of the costs, but these are the discussions we’re having.”\n\nExpanding the reviewer pool\n\nSome funders are also struggling to get reviewers. “It has become increasingly difficult to find people who have the time or ability or want to assess our proposals,” says Hanna Denecke, a team leader at the Volkswagen Foundation, a private funder in Hanover, Germany. That’s despite reviewers being offered almost €1,000 (US$1,160) for a day’s work.\n\nLike ESO, the Volkswagen Foundation has addressed this issue by asking applicants to review other proposals in the same funding round, a system called distributed peer review (DPR).\n\nAnd on 30 June at a conference in London, UK funders announced a successful trial of DPR, which they showed could review grants twice as fast as a typical review process. To get around concern that reviewers might be negative about competitors, applications were split into pools. Researchers don’t review applications from their own pool and so can’t affect the chances of their own applications being accepted.\n\nOne reason the Volkswagen Foundation is keen on DPR is that it moves the decision-making away from senior and more established scientists. “One might say these are kind of gatekeepers who might keep other people out,” Denecke says.\n\nStop the peer-review treadmill. I want to get off\n\nStraining under the weight of increased applications, some funders have turned to ‘demand management’ and will consider only one bid per university for a particular grant. But this just pushes the load of reviewing elsewhere, points out Stephen Pinfield, an information expert at the Research on Research Institute at University College London. “Institutions then have to run an informal peer-review process to choose which bid they can put forward. It’s just shifting the burden,” he says. Then there are the extra reviews of work and individuals that institutions must conduct to prepare for quality-assurance exercises, such as the UK Research Excellence Framework.\n\n“Very few analyses of the peer-review system take this informal stuff into account at all. And yet it’s enormously time consuming,” Pinfield says.\n\nUltimately, the most scalable solution to the labour problem at funders and journals is to widen the pool of reviewers. The bulk of the growth in research papers that need reviewing comes from authors in less-established scientific nations, points out Pinfield, whereas reviewers tend to be drawn from the same pool of senior academic experts in the West.\n\nA 2016 study suggested that 20% of scientists did between 69% and 94% of the reviewing the previous year8. “The peer-reviewer pool is smaller than the author pool,” Pinfield says. “I think people are feeling that pressure.”\n\nOne issue is that editors naturally gravitate towards asking reviewers who they think do a good job and send reports on time. By expanding their pool of reviewers, they might end up with reviews that are of lower quality or less accurate — a point made by biologist Carl Bergstrom at the University of Washington in Seattle and statistician Kevin Gross at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, in an analysis of the pressures on peer review. Their work was posted as a preprint in July9.\n\nMany science publishers are now using technology to help automate the search for a wider pool of reviewers. In 2023, for instance, a tool that allows editors to search the Scopus database to find reviewers on the basis of subject expertise and other criteria was integrated into the Editorial Manager manuscript system used by many journals worldwide. Other publishers have launched similar software.\n\nAnother idea that’s catching on is joint review: an established academic is paired with an early-career researcher, which brings in a new reviewer and trains them at the same time.\n\nImproving efficiency and quality\n\nOne way to make reviewing more efficient — and perhaps improve quality — is to give referees a series of clear questions to address. This format is known as structured peer review.\n\nLast year, researchers published the results of a rigorous test of how referees respond to this idea.\n\n“As an editor, you get peer-review reports that are not always thorough. Structured peer review is an attempt to actually focus them on questions that we want answers to,” says Mario Malički, a publication-practices specialist at Stanford University in California and co-editor-in-chief of the journal Research Integrity and Peer Review. He did the research with Bahar Mehmani, a publishing-innovation manager at Elsevier in Amsterdam.\n\nIn August 2022, Elsevier ran a pilot in which it asked reviewers to address nine specific questions when they assessed papers submitted to 220 journals. Malički and Mehmani looked at a sample of these manuscripts that had been assessed by two independent reviewers. They found that reviewers were more likely to agree with each other on final recommendations, such as whether the data analysis was correct and the correct experiments carried out, than in manuscripts assessed before the trial started10. (Reviewers still didn’t agree often, however: agreement was 41%, up from 31% before the trial.)\n\nElsevier now uses structured peer review at more than 300 of its journals. Other journals have instituted variants on the idea.\n\nAsking questions seems to help expose gaps in review knowledge, Malički adds, with referees more likely to say that someone else should check technical aspects such as the statistics or the modelling.\n\nBoosting the quality of reviews is also an argument made by those pushing for greater transparency in the peer-review system – by encouraging journals to publish reports alongside published papers, and referees to put their name to them.\n\nTransparent peer review to be extended to all of Nature’s research papers\n\nAdvocates argue that this could boost the status of review reports and so encourage more people to agree to write them. And it could also help to address the criticism that many journals publish shoddy research, which lessens trust in the rigour of the peer-review process writ large. Working out whether reviewers have made an honest attempt to examine a paper or simply waved it through with little scrutiny is hard, because peer review at journals has conventionally been confidential.\n\nPinfield agrees that publishing reviews could boost quality: “If reviewers know their work is going to be made publicly available, it is reasonable to assume that they will ensure the quality of the review is good.”",

          "authors": "Jason Sharples",
          "abstract": "Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense as the world warms — reigniting discussions on how to better manage fire risks. And the nature of wildfires is also changing. To avoid the worst damage, the development and behaviour of the most extreme wildfires need to be better understood.\n\nThe idea that wildfires can be managed simply by detecting — using satellites and drones, for example — and suppressing them early has become widespread. That might seem reasonable at first glance, but history tells us otherwise. It could even make things worse in the long run.\n\nYou’re not imagining it: extreme wildfires are now more common\n\nWe have been here before. In 1910, after a series of catastrophic wildfires in the northwestern United States, fire managers adopted a policy of total suppression: preventing ignitions as much as possible. The aim was to extinguish any blaze by 10 a.m. the next day. The policy was implemented using emerging technologies of the time: aircraft and chemical retardants. ‘Smokejumpers’ were trained to parachute into remote areas to quickly smother flames.\n\nThe exclusion of fires in various countries for decades protected homes and businesses to some extent — but it drove key changes in ecosystems. In the western United States, for example, Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests that had been shaped by millennia of frequent low-intensity fires were disrupted. Accumulation of dense thickets of young trees and shrubs increased the frequency of high-intensity fires that propagated through the crowns of trees and shrubs, which these forests were not adapted to withstand. Over time, such intense burning caused loss of biodiversity and altered the structure and composition of the forests in ways that increase the risk of large fires — the very thing the policy was intended to prevent.\n\nFire exclusion has also led to a loss of Indigenous culture and knowledge about managing landscapes with fire. In Australia, for example, Indigenous burning — the practice by Indigenous communities of stewarding ecosystems with controlled, low-intensity fires — was halted by colonizers in the late eighteenth century, leading to the emergence of a more flammable landscape dominated by eucalypt forests.\n\nThe causes of wildfires are clear. How they burn through communities is not\n\nIndeed, the emergence of megafires — those that burn more than 10,000 hectares — in the late twentieth century has been attributed to fire-exclusion policies. The accumulation of fuels combined with a warming climate and urban expansion favours fires that consume vast tracts of land and demand extensive and costly suppression resources.\n\nThe end of the twentieth century also saw a rise in the prevalence of extreme wildfires. Whereas megafires are defined by their size, extreme wildfires are characterized by their behaviour and intensity. They burn hotter than typical wildfires do and develop and propagate differently. For example, they can affect urban areas predominantly through showers of embers, burning leaves or twigs, carried by winds that have been strengthened by the fire’s influence on the atmosphere.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Pore-forming proteins in allergens make the body cough and sneeze.Credit: Wavebreak Media ltd/Alamy\n\nThe sneezing, itchy eyes and coughing elicited by some allergens are caused by proteins creating holes in airway cells, reports a study published this week in Nature1.\n\nThe findings challenge scientists’ understanding of how allergies are triggered, says Feargal Ryan, who studies host–microbe interactions at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. Before this, the mechanism that triggers immune responses to allergens was not really understood. Researchers focused mostly on how a single allergen elicits a reaction, rather than looking for a generalizable mechanism.\n\nThe results could also change allergy-treatment strategies, which typically target the allergen directly or downstream immune responses. Now, researchers can start looking for ways to target the hole-creating proteins that are initiating the immune response, Ryan says.\n\nPore-forming proteins\n\nResearchers based in Beijing, China, identified two proteins in the mould Alternaria alternata, which causes allergic reactions in about 5% of people, that trigger the airway inflammation seen during allergic reactions.\n\nTogether, the proteins, called Aeg-S and Aeg-L, create a pore in the membranes of cells lining the nose, throat and lungs. This allows calcium ions to enter the cells and release molecules that alert the immune system to danger. The damage to cell membranes from these pore-forming proteins could be a “common signal that our body uses to recognize something as an allergen”, says co-author Mo Xu, who studies immune responses at Tsinghua University.\n\nTo test how the proteins stimulated the immune system, the team treated lung cells with the proteins. Administering the proteins at the same time triggered a similar response as administering an extract of A. alternata, but this response was not seen when the proteins were given one at a time.\n\nThe researchers also tested whether the proteins could cause an allergic airway inflammation in mice. Six hours after mice were given the proteins intranasally, the rodents showed immune responses similar to those triggered by exposure to A. alternata.\n\nThe team also observed signs that the mice had developed a respiratory allergy, such as increased levels of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) — an antibody produced in response to allergens — after the mice were given the proteins every three days for two weeks. This response wasn’t seen when the proteins were administered separately, or when mice were exposed to genetically modified mould lacking either protein.",

          "authors": "Nikita Bezrukov",
          "abstract": "Looking at a document’s history shows how the writer’s thought process evolved — and spotlights AI shortcuts, says Nikita Bezrukov.\n\nI was grading papers for my writing‑heavy seminar on fairness in machine learning, when the references started to get weird. The first DOI I checked returned a 404 error; the second opened a blank page; and a journal article with a plausible title didn’t appear in any database I searched. The same glitches cropped up across several submissions, making it clear that generative artificial intelligence (AI), not the students, was the first author.\n\nThe pattern was easy to spot. The prose was immaculate, yet somehow stilted — the paragraph structure was too precise. The pieces lacked a sense of struggle that signals genuine thought. Each time I opened a file, I asked the same questions: is this data set real? Does this specialist exist? Did the student write any of this? After spending weeks verifying quotations, sources and even author identities, I felt less like a teacher and more like a forensic investigator.\n\nThen a typo jumped off the page of one essay. That paper referred to a “monolinguistic speaker” (as opposed to the standard term, ‘monolingual speaker’). The mistake was small, but it indicated that a person, not a chatbot, had drafted the text. I breathed a sigh of relief. I realized I wanted to see more imperfection.\n\nTracking changes\n\nThe next morning, I announced a new rule to my students, in an attempt to bake that moment into my teaching: assignments could not be submitted as single PDFs showing only the final version. Every document had to have a version history, so that I could see the writing process, not just the final product. I called the resulting score the trajectory grade: 60% of the mark would reflect how ideas developed across drafts, and 40% would cover the quality of the completed version. It was my last semester teaching first-year writing-in-the-disciplines seminars at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, so I was open to experimentation. And the class was small — only 12 students, so it was easy to change course if anything went wrong.\n\nAt first, my students were sceptical, assuming this was a tactic to police their work. A colleague suggested that I use a blockchain analogy to explain my reasoning. That framing changed the mood. Most students already knew that blockchain keeps a transparent, tamper‑resistant ledger of changes: each block stores data, such as transactions, and is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a continuous, verifiable chain. Any attempt to alter a block stands out immediately, so the record is trustworthy. Seeing version‑tracking tools as a classroom‑scale blockchain made sense to the students — and the requirement suddenly felt intuitive, rather than punitive.\n\nBy the end of the semester, I had learnt more from the version histories than I could have from any static paper. In my seminar, first‑year engineering and computer‑science majors choose a topic in emerging technology — for instance, fairness in drone warfare or AI‑driven admissions. Each step builds on the last: they create a literature map and develop it into a data‑rich research paper, which they refashion into public pieces, such as opinion articles and policy briefs. Because every revision was captured, my suspicions around plagiarism disappeared, and AI shortcuts stood out. I could see in detail how each chunk of text evolved over time, quantitatively by how long it took to write as well as by its length, and qualitatively by how its ideas unfolded.\n\nMy own workload improved tremendously. Grading sessions no longer felt like crime‑scene analyses, and I spent less time hunting for signs of AI assistance and more time coaching academic writing strategy. The version-control rule encouraged many students to start earlier and revise steadily, because the transparent history left no way to hide a rushed job uploaded at the deadline. It restored the habits that our writing‑in‑the‑disciplines courses are designed to teach young researchers: incremental progress and thoughtful redrafting. Their final submissions felt earned, rather than delivered by an algorithm.\n\nRevise your rubric",

          "abstract": "Growing up in the forests of Chicago, Illinois, and the deserts of Phoenix, Arizona, Jaida Elcock never had much access to the ocean — and was even afraid of sharks. But the more she learnt on TV documentaries, the more she realized that we should be advocating for their conservation. “I really don’t want to know what an ocean without sharks looks like,” she says.\n\nHaving earnt a biology degree at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, and worked her way up through various internships and laboratory technician positions, Elcock is now a graduate student based in Falmouth, Massachusetts, studying the movement ecology of basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus). Along the way, she faced racism, sexism and discrimination, she says.\n\nIn 2020, the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, sparked civil unrest in the United States. On the same day as Floyd’s murder, a white dog walker falsely reported Black birdwatcher Christian Cooper after he asked her to put her dog on a lead. This inspired many Black naturalists, including Elcock, to speak out on social media about their right to exist and occupy outdoor spaces, she says. It also led to the #BlackInNature hashtag, through which Elcock started chatting with fellow shark researchers Amani Webber-Schultz, Jasmin Graham and Carlee Jackson-Bohannon.\n\nPleasantly surprised to realize there were other Black women working in shark science, the four came together and founded Minorities in Shark Sciences (MISS), registered in Bradenton, Florida. Its mission is to advance marine sciences by challenging the status quo of what people think a scientist looks like. MISS works to support under-represented and historically excluded communities to help them to feel confident and accepted in science by providing them with access to a community, knowledge and training opportunities. Five years later, the organization has around 400 members in more than 30 countries.\n\nWhat was it like for you as a young Black shark scientist?\n\nI got a lot of pushback for wanting to become a marine scientist. I was once told that I got my university scholarship because of affirmative action, not because I deserved it. People would say things like “Black people can’t swim. How are you going to work with sharks?”. These ridiculous stereotypes exist because of systemic racism that has led to a generational fear of water in a lot of Black communities, and that is not our fault. (When public swimming pools became popular in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, segregation meant that Black people had less access and so less opportunity to learn to swim.)\n\nI was also told that, as a woman, I wouldn’t be strong enough to handle sharks and I should be in the kitchen or raising a family.\n\nThe Minorities in Shark Science team.Credit: Julia Wester, Field School\n\nFor many people, encountering racism and sexism is incredibly discouraging. Why would you want to start a career in which you might hear those things all the time? But I used this pushback as fuel. If you tell me I can’t do something because of a terrible and irrational reason that’s based in hate, racism and sexism, I’m going to say: ‘Okay, watch me’.\n\nWhen we co-founded MISS, we wanted to create a community of people with shared experiences who would support each other, provide a safe space and create opportunities to help them further their careers. Breaking down the social and financial barriers to getting opportunities in the field of marine science was a key goal.\n\nWe launched on Juneteenth (19 June) 2020. This is a really important day for the Black community in the United States: it’s the day that the last enslaved people received word that they had been freed, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, in which president Abraham Lincoln declared that all slaves in the Confederate states were now considered free. Launching on this day was a way of showing our dedication, support and pride in who we are.\n\nDo you feel like the perception of what a shark scientist looks like is changing?\n\nYes, at least in the spaces I’m in. With MISS, we now have a community of minority scientists that people can contact when they want to highlight certain people in science, whether that’s for a TV show or a school talk.\n\nTV production teams now have somewhere to go to when most shark scientists on their shows are white dudes and they want to highlight the amazing work of other scientists as well. That’s not to say that these white guys aren’t also good at their job, but we want to remind people that there are other scientists out there.\n\nFor younger people, seeing themselves represented is so important, and I think we’re seeing a shift. Young people are now more exposed than before to all these diverse people in science. Seeing someone else who looks like them doing it shows that it could be an option for them, too.\n\nDo you see any parallels between the stereotypes of who can be a shark scientist and which of the 500 or so shark species typically get more attention, such as great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias)?\n\nOn nature shows, you always see the same thing — great whites breaching — and that’s cool. But what about the swell shark (Cephaloscyllium ventriosum), which swallows seawater to prevent itself from getting eaten by predators? What about the pocket shark (Mollisquama parini) that spews bioluminescent goo out of a pocket behind its fins?\n\nThere are parallels with diversity in science, for sure. You often see this one type of scientist — in the same way you see this one type of shark — but there are so many other cool options. We can show appreciation for all these other sharks and shark scientists as well. The more diversity we have in people, the more diversity we’ll get in thought. That’s going to lead to more innovation, more discovery and better science as a whole.\n\nHow does MISS help its members?\n\nWe run webinars and pair people up with mentors to help them apply for funding opportunities, fellowship programmes or graduate school. We also fundraise and apply for grants to support marine scientists from minority groups. We also run collaborative working groups, opportunities such as shark-tagging workshops and our Diversifying Ocean Sciences programme, in which people can learn lab and fieldwork techniques.\n\nJaida Elcock handling a shark tail while at sea.Credit: Jackson Coles, Field School",

          "title": "Environmental politics is doomed to fail — unless we tell better stories",
          "authors": "Philip Macnaghten",
          "abstract": "Captured Futures: Rethinking the Drama of Environmental Politics Maarten A. Hajer and Jeroen Oomen Oxford Univ. Press (2025)\n\nEvery now and again, you look forward to a book. You follow the pre-publication talks, the promise, the drama. I have known political scientist Maarten Hajer for three decades as an academic, policymaker and activist. If anyone has the skills and know-how to deeply understand the logic of environmental politics, it’s him.\n\nAnd this book exceeded my expectations. Written with rising-star social scientist Jeroen Oomen, Captured Futures is powerful, timely and consequential. It is arguably the most important book on environmental politics in the past decade. The concept of a ‘captured future’ shows brilliantly how environmental politics has become trapped in ways that both reproduce its own failure and restrict people’s ability to imagine alternatives.\n\nScience’s big problem is a loss of influence, not a loss of trust\n\nThe book starts by marshalling evidence that environmental politics is falling short on global environmental health. It’s a familiar list, including unmet targets for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions and continuing losses of biodiversity, fertile soils and fresh water.\n\nThen, the authors present a radical idea: that environmental politics, as it is currently configured and practised, is bound to fail. This is not because of a lack of political will, or regulatory or state obstacles, but because of the conceptual framework — the ‘dramaturgical regime’ — through which the rules and conventions of environmental politics are being enacted and performed.\n\nFailed system\n\nAt the heart of this regime is ecological modernization: a set of convictions that has held sway for three decades. These include that technological and market-based solutions can remediate environmental crises; that natural science, with its value-neutral ‘facts’, can provide the necessary knowledge to create these solutions; and that policymakers, in their ‘pilot’ role, define global options, goals and targets.\n\nIn this system, if targets go unmet despite the presentation of scientific evidence, the only response available to those in the political cockpit is to escalate the urgency of their language. Ever-stronger images of impending catastrophe further diminish citizens’ feelings of political agency and exacerbate many people’s already pronounced senses of despair, despondency and alienation. As the ultimate technocratic solution, climate geoengineering represents ecological modernization’s last stand.\n\nThe common narrative of ‘win–win solutions’ and ‘positive-sum games’ is over. The authors describe how environmental policy’s increasing effects on everyday life — through mobility, energy and housing — are generating political responses. This as an “age of backlash”, they write, pointing to the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement in France and farmers’ street protests across Europe.\n\nA gilet jaunes protester at a demonstration in Lyon, France in 2019.Credit: Romain Costaseca/Hans Lucas/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty\n\nWorse, the dramaturgical regime is unwittingly contributing to political polarization. Many people, including populists and some on the right, increasingly view the climate-change community, and universities more broadly, as part of a globalist and elitist system pitted against ordinary people. This dynamic has intensified this year, particularly in the United States, where the Trump administration has attacked elite universities including Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and slashed funding for federal environmental and health agencies.\n\nTurning the tide\n\nEcological politics needs to tell a more aspirational story. We need to move from stories that evoke fear and despair towards ones that give hope and renewal. And we need to raise awareness of potential futures that are just as desirable as the consumer-based dreams we have become so attached to. To convey the task ahead, the authors analyse how fossil fuels and the lifestyles they enable are deeply and seductively embedded in most people’s senses of personal freedom, lifestyle and identity. The ‘American dream’ is alive, and it’s global.\n\nTo learn about what might work, Hajer and Oomen analyse two historical examples of intellectual discourses that have shifted the societal mood. UK economist and social reformer William Beveridge laid out the principles of the modern welfare state in a 1942 report, with radical ideas about how to eradicate poverty that were strong enough for people to fight for. Efforts by think tanks and others shifted conservative thought in the 1960s and 1970s towards neoliberal concepts such as property ownership, deregulation, privatization and free markets.\n\nToday, three eco-political discourses are bubbling: ‘beyond growth’ questions the necessity for economic growth; decolonization scholars critique models of development that reinforce the dominance of former colonial powers; and eco-conservatism focuses on one’s duty as a steward to protect the natural world. But these debates, although valuable, remain mainly intellectual and resonate only marginally with the public.\n\nTrump supporters gathering in Nashville, Tennessee, during his 2024 presidential campaign.Credit: Sergio Flores/AFP/Getty\n\nWhere else might someone look? One approach that Hajer and Oomen don’t discuss is closer examination of shifts in everyday lived experiences, and the social, cultural and political trends that underpin them. Think of four brilliant sociologists: Ulrich Beck, John Urry, Anthony Giddens and Manuel Castells. Rather than extolling vanguard visions that could be rolled out into political projects, each of them sought to see the world around them with acute sensitivity and then develop concepts and theories attuned to what they saw.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nBeck’s ‘risk society’ reflected a globalized world that is imbued with invisible, uninsurable, unattributable and potentially irreversible risks. Urry’s ‘disorganized capitalism’ describes the shift away from the structured, hierarchical and relatively stable form of ‘organized capitalism’. Giddens’s ‘reflexive modernization’ unpacks the double-edged nature of modernity in relation to science, individualism, capitalism and industrialism. Castells’ ‘network society’ describes the growth of forms of social organization based on networks rather than conventional hierarchies.\n\nSuch on-the-ground thinking could be applied, for example, to the wave of conservatism manifesting in global politics, from the United States to Argentina, Finland and Italy. On the night of US President Donald Trump’s election, when it was becoming clear that he not only won the election but had increased his majority across key demographics (including Black and Hispanic voters, rural voters, religious voters, men under 50 and even naturalized citizens), I asked myself, why? Since then, I have sought to understand, and empathize with, the structure of feeling that underpins this new form of conservatism.\n\nAsk the people\n\nSociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild’s Strangers in their Own Land (2016) offers some insights. Her ethnographic look at the emotional lives of arch-conservatives in Bayou country, Louisiana, based on fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2016, explores why increasingly disaffected people tend to move to the political right and not the left.",

          "title": "Is your AI benchmark lying to you?",
          "authors": "Michael Brooks",
          "abstract": "Anshul Kundaje sums up his frustration with the use of artificial intelligence in science in three words: “bad benchmarks propagate”.\n\nKundaje researches computational genomics at Stanford University in California. He is keen to incorporate any form of artificial intelligence (AI) that helps to accelerate progress in his field — and countless researchers have stepped up to offer tools for this purpose. But finding the ones that work best is becoming ever harder because some researchers have been making questionable claims about the AI models they have developed. These claims can take months to check. And they often turn out to be false — mainly because the benchmarks used to demonstrate and compare performance of these tools are not fit for purpose.\n\nBy then, it’s often too late: Kundaje and his colleagues are left playing whack-a-mole after the flawed benchmarks have been adopted and ‘improved’ by enthusiastic, but naive, users. “In the meantime, everyone has been using these [benchmarks] for all kinds of wrong stuff, and then you have wrong information and wrong predictions out there,” he says.\n\n‘Another DeepSeek moment’: Chinese AI model Kimi K2 stirs excitement\n\nThis is just one reason why a growing number of scientists worry that, until benchmarking is radically improved, AI systems designed to accelerate progress in science will have the opposite effect.\n\nA benchmark is a test that can be used to compare the performance of different methods, just as the standard length of a metre provides a way to assess the accuracy of a ruler. “It’s the standardization and definition of what we mean by progress,” says Max Welling, a machine-learning researcher and co-founder of CuspAI, an AI company based in Cambridge, UK. Good benchmarks allow a user to choose the best method for a particular application, or to determine whether more conventional algorithms might give a better result. “But the first question,” says Welling, “is, what do we mean by ‘better’?”\n\nIt’s a surprisingly deep question. Does ‘better’ mean faster? Cheaper? More accurate? If you’re buying a car, you’ll need to consider a wide range of factors, such as acceleration, boot capacity and safety, each with its own degree of importance to you. AI benchmark tools are no different — for some applications, speed might not matter as much as accuracy, for instance.\n\nBut it’s even more complicated than that. If your benchmark is badly designed, the information it gives you could be misleading. If there’s ‘leakage’, in which the benchmarking relies on data that were used to train the algorithm, the benchmark becomes more of a game of memory than a test of problem-solving. Or the test might just be irrelevant to your needs: it might be overly specific, for instance, hiding a system’s inability to answer the broad swathe of questions you’re interested in.\n\nWhat are the best AI tools for research? Nature’s guide\n\nThis is a problem that Kundaje and his colleagues have identified with DNA language models (DNALMs), which AI developers think could assist the discovery of interesting regulatory mechanisms in a genome. Around 1.5% of the human genome is made up of protein-coding sequences that provide templates for creating RNA (transcription) and proteins (translation). Between 5% and 20% of the genome is made up of non-coding regulatory elements that coordinate gene transcription and translation. Get the DNALMs right, and they could help to interpret and discover functional sequences, predict the consequences of altering those sequences, and redesign them to have specific, desired properties.\n\nSo far, however, DNALMs have fallen short of these goals. According to Kundaje and his colleagues, that is partly because they are not being used for the right tasks. They are being designed to compare favourably against benchmark tests, many of which evaluate usefulness not to key biological applications but rather to surrogate objectives that the models can meet1. The situation is not unlike schools that ‘teach to the test’ — you end up with students (or AI tools) that are qualified to pass a test, but do little else.\n\nKundaje and his colleagues at Stanford University have found these crucial shortcomings in several popular DNALM benchmarks, data sets and metrics. For example, one key task is evaluating a model’s ability to rank functional genetic variants: changes in DNA sequences that can influence disease risk or molecular function in cells. Although some DNALMs are simply not evaluated on this task, others use flawed benchmark data sets that fail to account for ‘linkage disequilibrium’, the non-random association of genetic variants.\n\nThat makes it harder to isolate the true functional variants, a flaw that yields unrealistic estimates of these models’ abilities to pinpoint such variants. It’s a rookie error, Kundaje says. “This doesn’t require deep domain knowledge — it’s genetics 101.”\n\nTransparency and puffery\n\nInadequate benchmarks are creating a similar teaching-to-the-test problem in a range of scientific disciplines. But the failures don’t happen only because it is challenging to create a good benchmark: it’s often because there’s not enough pressure to do better, according to Nick McGreivy, who completed his PhD in the application of AI in physics last year at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nMost people who use AI for science seem content to allow the developers of AI tools to evaluate their usefulness using their own criteria. That’s like letting pharmaceutical companies decide whether their drug should go to market, McGreivy says. “The same people who evaluate the performance of AI models also benefit from those evaluations,” he says. That means that, even if research isn’t deliberately fraudulent, it can be biased.\n\nHow AI is reshaping science and society\n\nLorena Barba, a mechanical and aerospace engineer at the George Washington University in Washington DC, has a similar perspective. Science is suffering because of “poor transparency, glossing over limitations, closet failures, overgeneralization, data negligence, gatekeeping and puffery” in attempts to put AI to work in real-world settings, as she put it in a 2023 talk at the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nBarba’s own field is fluid dynamics — which involves the study of problems such as smoothing the flow of air over an aircraft’s wings to improve fuel efficiency. Doing that involves solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but that isn’t straightforward: most PDEs can’t be solved through numerical analysis. Instead, the solutions must be approximated through a process that is similar to (expertly guided) trial and error.\n\nThe mathematical tools that accomplish this are known as standard solvers. Although they are relatively effective, they also require significant computational resources. That’s why many people in fluid dynamics hope that AI — specifically machine-learning approaches — can help them to do more with fewer resources.\n\nMachine learning is the form of AI that has seen the most progress in the past five years — mainly because of the availability of training data. Machine learning involves feeding data into an algorithm that looks for patterns or makes predictions. The parameters of the algorithm can be tweaked to optimize the usefulness of the predictions.\n\nIn theory, machine learning could deliver solutions to PDEs faster and using fewer computing resources than conventional methods. The trouble is, if you cannot trust that the benchmarks used to evaluate performance are useful or reliable, how can you trust the output of the models they validate?\n\nNick McGreivy found that some published improvements to AI models made misleading claims.Credit: Nicholas McGreivy\n\nMcGreivy and his colleague Ammar Hakim, a computational physicist at Princeton University, have conducted an analysis of published ‘improvements’ to standard solvers and found that 79% of the papers they studied make problematic claims2. Much of that is to do with benchmarking against what they term weak baselines. This can come from unfair comparisons: machine learning for PDE could be seen as more efficient in terms of computing resources — a shorter runtime, for example — than a standard solver. But unless the solutions have similar accuracy, the comparison is meaningless. The researchers suggest that comparisons must be made at either equal accuracy or equal runtime.\n\nAnother source of weak benchmarking is comparing an AI application with non-AI numerical methods that are relatively inefficient. In 2021, for instance, data scientist Sifan Wang, who is now at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and computer scientist Paris Perdikaris at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia claimed that their machine-learning-based solver for a different class of differential equations yielded a 10-to-50-fold speed-up compared with a conventional numerical solver3. But as Chris Rackauckas, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, pointed out in a video, the pair weren’t comparing it with state-of-the-art numerical solvers, some of which could do the job 7,000 times faster — just running on a standard laptop — than Wang and Perdikaris’ approach.\n\nReady or not, AI is coming to science education — and students have opinions\n\n“To be fair to [Perdikaris], after I had pointed this out, they did edit their paper,” Rackauckas says. However, he adds, the original paper is the only version that is accessible without a paywall, and so still engenders false hope concerning AI’s promise in this area.\n\nThere are many such misleading claims, McGreivy warns. The scientific literature is “not a reliable source for evaluating the success of machine learning at solving PDEs”, he says. In fact, he remains unconvinced that machine learning has anything to offer in this area. “In PDE research, machine learning has been and remains a solution looking for a problem,” he says.\n\nJohannes Brandstetter, a machine-learning researcher at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria, and co-founder of an AI-driven physics simulation start-up company called Emmi AI, is more optimistic. He points to the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) competition that enabled machine learning to assist with the prediction of 3D protein structures from their amino-acid sequences4.",

Almost half of those were people working there for the first time.\n\nScientists say harassment in the Antarctic must stop — but US plan falls short\n\nThese and other statistics come from an extensive new questionnaire commissioned by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) about sexual misconduct in the US Antarctic research programme. It is the most thorough look yet at a persistent and pervasive problem that has affected the careers of many polar scientists and triggered investigations by the US Congress.\n\nScientists who have worked with the US Antarctic Program say they are tentatively hopeful that the survey will bring about lasting change at the NSF and the polar programmes it oversees. It is “an important step towards addressing these challenges”, says Asa Rennermalm, a physical geographer and polar scientist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. “Surveys like this play a critical role in documenting lived experiences that have too often been ignored or minimized.”\n\nThe agency says it will use the findings of the 18 July report to strengthen safety plans for scientists and others working in Antarctica. “The survey made clear that meaningful change is happening, but that it also needs to continue,” said Renée Ferranti, special assistant to the director of the NSF for sexual assault and harassment prevention, at a webinar last week to disseminate the survey results.\n\nBut with US President Donald Trump calling for huge budget cuts at the agency and targeting issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, it is unclear what capacity the NSF will have to respond.\n\nIf the NSF’s Antarctic programmes have to scale back because of budget cuts, that, “combined with a diminished political emphasis on workplace safety and community, will significantly slow progress”, says Leigh Stearns, a glaciologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. But the new report does suggest that awareness of sexual misconduct in Antarctica and support for stopping it is improving, she says.\n\nThe NSF said it was unable to respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nRemote work\n\nThe agency commissioned the survey from an independent firm, which sent invitations to everyone who deployed with the US Antarctic Program between 2022 and 2024. That included scientists, students, contractors, military personnel and others who worked on bases such as the sprawling McMurdo station on the Ross Sea.\n\nDoes US science have a future in Antarctica? Trump cuts threaten to cancel fieldwork and more\n\nOf the 679 people who responded, 521 completed a ‘victimization inventory’ to provide further details on their experiences. Of those, 41% reported experiencing at least one incident of sexual assault or harassment, such as unwanted touching or sexual comments. Nearly 69% of the 572 people who responded to detailed questions about being a bystander said they had witnessed at least one such incident. The harassment spanned genders, with 59% of victims being female and 36% men, and came from a variety of sources, with 51% perpetrated by a contractor and 18% by a supervisor.",

          "abstract": "Farming of giant prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) is a booming industry, worth more than US$2.45 billion. But the gene pool from which prawns are bred is narrowing. China farms more than half of all giant prawns, depending entirely on cultured strains that have substantially less genetic diversity than do wild populations (Q. Shen et al. Aquac. Rep. 38, 102356; 2024) — and so are more susceptible to disease. By contrast, countries such as India, which mainly uses wild, genetically diverse prawns, rather than strains bred for desirable traits, are struggling with low larval survival and yields (B. R.

          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "In 2022, PLoS ONE retracted more than 100 papers after an editor noticed an unusual spike in submissions. An independent study has now looked at the journal's retraction history more in depth. Credit: Getty\n\nNearly one-third of all retracted papers at PLoS ONE can be traced back to just 45 researchers who served as editors at the journal, an analysis of its publication records has found.\n\nThe study1, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on 4 August, found that 45 editors handled only 1.3% of all articles published by PLoS ONE from 2006 to 2023, but that the papers they accepted accounted for more than 30% of the 702 retractions that the journal issued by early 2024. Twenty-five of these editors also authored papers in PLoS ONE that were later retracted.\n\nThe PNAS authors did not disclose the names of any of the 45 editors. But, by independently analysing publicly available data from PLoS ONE and the Retraction Watch database, Nature’s news team has identified five of the editors who handled the highest number of papers that were subsequently retracted by the journal. Together, those editors accepted about 15% of PLoS ONE’s retracted papers up to 14 July.\n\n“The footprints that systematic fraud leaves in the literature are so massive that there’s no way that it’s just a couple of bad authors,” says PNAS study co-author Reese Richardson, a metascientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. “There is complicity from within the journal-appointed editors that allows for this to happen.”\n\n“PLOS has long been aware of the issue addressed in this article,” says Renee Hoch, head of publication ethics at the publisher. “In each case we promptly removed the people of concern from PLOS editorial boards and took action as needed on the affected articles.” She adds that “the issues discussed in this article are not specific to PLoS One and have been affecting journals and publishers across the industry”.\n\nCassidy Sugimoto, a science-policy researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, calls the findings “disheartening”. But, she says, they show “that we have the tools and mechanisms to identify misconduct at scale, and begin to uproot some of the poor behaviours that are happening in science”. Sugimoto adds that the study cannot not determine whether all flagged editors acted deliberately to slip problematic work through peer review, or whether they were “negligent in their duties”. Papers can be retracted by their authors or publishers for myriad reasons, including honest errors, authorship disputes or problems that arise from research misconduct.\n\nEditors with high retraction rates\n\nPLoS ONE is published by the open-access Public Library of Science (PLOS) in San Francisco, California. The journal relies on thousands of volunteer academic editors, who handle submissions and oversee peer review, with support from 22 staff editors.\n\nIn the PNAS study, researchers examined 276,956 articles published in PLoS ONE from its launch in 2006 to late 2023, and tracked 134,983 authors and 18,329 handling editors. They identified 22 editors who disproportionately accepted papers that were later retracted, and 33 others who accepted papers that had been flagged on PubPeer — a site for post-publication peer review — more frequently than would be expected by chance. Furthermore, the analysis identified 21 authors who seemed to steer their submissions towards the group of 22 editors flagged for high retraction rates.\n\nThe study reveals how individuals can form coordinated networks and work under the guise of editorial duty to push large amounts of problematic research into the scientific literature, in some cases with links to paper mills — businesses that churn out fake papers and sell authorship slots.\n\nHoch denies that PLoS ONE systematically allows authors to choose who is assigned to handle their submission. “Editor assignment at PLoS One is done via an algorithm that matches submissions to editors with suitable expertise, or in a minority of cases PLOS staff manually research and assign editors. Author requests for specific editors are not honoured or even considered in most cases, and when they are considered they are carefully vetted for potential competing interests.”\n\nConflicting interests\n\nIn 2022, PLoS ONE retracted more than 100 papers after an editor noticed an unusual spike in submissions, many in agricultural research, from one author. The journal’s investigation found that some academic editors had handled manuscripts from the same authors repeatedly, co-authored papers with them and manipulated peer review.\n\nIn their analysis of PLoS ONE’s publication records, Richardson and his colleagues identified 19 researchers — based in 4 countries — who served as academic editors between 2020 and 2023, and repeatedly handled each other’s submissions. More than half of the papers they accepted were later retracted, with nearly identical notices citing concerns about authorship, peer review and competing interests.\n\nNature’s analysis identified 3 of those 19 editors. Shahid Farooq, a plant biologist at Harran University in Şanlıurfa, Turkey, topped the list of PLoS ONE editors ordered by the number of retracted papers that they handled. Between 2019 and 2023, Farooq was responsible for editing 79 articles, 52 of which were subsequently retracted. All of the retraction notices stated that the papers were “identified as one of a series of submissions” for which the journal had concerns about authorship, competing interests and peer review. Farooq also co-authored seven articles in PLoS ONE that were later retracted with identical retraction notices.\n\nFarooq told Nature in an e-mail statement that he relied on reviewers’ reports to make his editorial decisions, and that editors had limited tools to detect conflicts of interest. In a 2022 press release, PLOS’s Hoch said that “internal competing interest checks” were not “equipped to identify co-publication histories” at the time. PLOS introduced new policies in 2023 to try to prevent manipulation of the publication process. More recently, journals have started using automated tools for analysing co-authorship patterns and flagging potential paper-mill issues.\n\nFarooq says that PLoS ONE removed him from the editorial board in 2022, and that he subsequently resigned from his editorial positions in other journals, including Frontiers in Agronomy and BMC Plant Biology. “My editing experience has changed to not editing any paper for any publisher, as the publishers become innocent once any issues are raised on the published papers,” he added.\n\nAnother editor flagged in Nature’s analysis is Zhihan Lv (also known as Zhihan Lyu), a researcher in virtual reality, who ranked second in the list of editors who handled high numbers of retracted PLoS ONE papers. Between 2017 and 2021, Lv edited 54 papers, and 43 of these have been retracted, including 31 this year. All notices cited concerns about peer-review integrity and potential manipulation of the publication process.\n\nLv was also an editor for more than 400 papers in journals published by Hindawi — a subsidiary of New Jersey-based publisher Wiley that has now ceased activity. Many of these papers have been retracted. In 2024, the journal Neural Computing and Applications — published by London-based Springer Nature — retracted 24 of 26 papers in a 2018 special issue for which Lv was the managing guest editor (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher). The retractions, which included one research article co-authored by Lv, referred to compromised editorial handling and peer review, irrelevant citations, image manipulations, tortured phrases and content outside the scope of the journal and its special issue.\n\nLv told Nature he did not know at the time that there was a conflict of interest in submitting a paper to a special issue for which he was the handling editor.\n\nIn 2022, PLoS ONE removed Lv from its editorial board and retracted three papers co-authored by him in later years. “I was listed as a co-author in these three articles without my consent. I have no knowledge of the details of these articles,” Lv told Nature. “I remember informing the journal of this when they contacted me before retracting the papers,” he added.\n\nBut in 2023, PLOS alerted Uppsala University in Sweden — where Lv worked from 2021 until his resignation in September 2024 — citing concerns about his involvement in paper-mill activities. The university’s investigation concluded that there were “grounds for suspecting research misconduct” on one of his PLoS ONE papers, and referred a separate matter, involving an ethics review it said Lv had fabricated, to the Swedish police. Lv has since moved to Xidian University in Xi’an, China.\n\nAuthorship concerns\n\nHaibin Lv, a marine geologist at the North Sea Bureau in China’s Ministry of Natural Resources in Qingdao, ranked third in Nature’s list of editors. Between 2021 and 2022, Haibin Lv edited 28 papers for PLoS ONE. All but one of the 28 papers have been retracted, and the journal noted that they were part of a series of submissions for which it had concerns about peer-review integrity, similarities across articles and potential manipulation of the publication process. PLoS ONE issued an expression of concern for the remaining paper in June, citing issues with peer review and citations.\n\nNature also identified 113 papers published in Hindawi’s Journal of Sensors between 2021 and 2023 that Haibin Lv edited, 88 of which have been retracted.\n\nTwo of the retracted papers in PLoS ONE that Haibin Lv edited were co-authored by Zhihan Lv, who told Nature he was listed as an author without his consent. “Zhihan Lv and I are collaborators on multiple research projects. My handling of the two PLoS ONE papers he co-authored was no different than handling papers from strangers,” Haibin Lv told Nature.\n\nNature also identified ten articles that Haibin Lv and Zhihan Lv co-authored and published between 2022 and 2024 — six of which appeared in conferences run by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a professional association and publisher based in New York City. None have been retracted. The IEEE declined to comment on the matter.\n\nZhihan Lv and Haibin Lv both told Nature that they are not brothers. Zhihan said they were not blood relatives, and Haibin described their relationship as “private”.\n\nFourth on Nature's list is Adnan Noor Shah, an agronomist at Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology in Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan, who handled 24 papers published in PLoS ONE between August 2021 and May 2022. Eighteen of those papers have been retracted, and the retraction notices for 17 of them said that they were part of a series of submissions for which the journal had concerns about authorship, competing interests and peer review. Shah also co-authored five articles that PLoS ONE later retracted, citing similar concerns, as well as issues with reference citations and overlap with other publications.\n\nNature’s analysis found that, in 2022, Shah co-authored two papers in two journals, including Frontiers in Plant Science. His co-authors on these papers included three researchers who appeared as authors in four other papers that Shah edited for Frontiers in Plant Science. The journal’s publisher, Frontiers (based in Lausanne, Switzerland), told Nature that it is investigating 20 publications across the journals that Shah edited. Shah did not respond to Nature’s emails.\n\nNature’s investigation also identified cancer researcher Aamir Ahmad as the most prolific PLoS ONE editor. Ahmad is the editor-in-chief of Non-coding RNA Research, an open-access journal published by Beijing-based KeAi. He has also been a cancer editor at Springer Nature’s Scientific Reports since 2017.",

          "abstract": "The AI system AlphaEarth Foundations integrates satellite images, such as this one of irrigated cropland, with other types of map to offer a data-rich picture of Earth.Credit: USGS\n\nThe technology giant Google has released an artificial intelligence (AI) model that acts as a ‘virtual satellite’ to weave together trillions of disparate observations — satellite images, radar and more — to track changes in land and shallow waters across Earth. Researchers are lauding the sheer scale of the effort while also calling on Google for more information about its tests, and warning that it will be up to individual scientists to verify any maps they obtain from the tool.\n\nGoogle tapped billions of mobile phones to detect quakes worldwide — and send alerts\n\nThe model, called AlphaEarth Foundations, maps the world “at any place and time”, Christopher Brown, a research engineer at Google DeepMind in New York City, said at a press briefing on 28 July. Scientists might use it to identify the best places for clean-energy projects, study the ecological impacts of climate change, track deforestation and more.\n\nAlongside the model, which was released yesterday, Google and its DeepMind AI unit have posted a paper, ahead of peer review, on the arXiv preprint server1. The manuscript describes the creation of the model, its initial testing and baseline data sets covering Earth during the years 2017–24. It says that AlphaEarth beats similar AI models in terms of both accuracy and data density, and that the model saves users computing time and reduces energy use.\n\nNicholas Murray, a conservation biologist at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, is the lead scientist for Global Ecosystems Atlas, an initiative to map the world’s biodiversity and environments. Murray says that his team often spends “tens to hundreds of days” processing satellite data before it can even begin to make products such as maps describing changes in tidal wetlands over time. He hopes that Google’s latest model — which the team is familiar with — will make that process more efficient.\n\nPackaging the data\n\nMoving forward, Google says, it will regularly update AlphaEarth’s data sets, which come fully processed. They are available through the company’s Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform that already hosts separate repositories of data covering topics such as agriculture, deforestation and weather. AlphaEarth weaves together many of these data sets to create an integrated product that scientists can explore more easily.\n\nDeepMind AI weather forecaster beats world-class system",

          "authors": "Ollie Jay, Jennifer Vanos, Daniel Gagnon, Federico Tartarini",
          "abstract": "Close to 110,000 heat-related deaths are estimated to have occurred in Europe during the summers of 2022 and 2023 combined1. That’s roughly the same number of people as if a fully occupied jumbo jet crashed every day for 16 weeks. Meanwhile, a vast array of heat-related impacts disrupt people’s lives. Hot weather worsens mental-health problems2, increases the likelihood of violence3 and makes pregnant women more likely to give birth prematurely4. In classrooms, it impairs children’s ability to learn5.\n\nShade is an essential solution for hotter cities\n\nThe problems are expected to get much worse. Without better adaptation, heat-related deaths are projected to rise 3.7-fold by mid-century if global temperatures reach 2 °C above pre-industrial levels6. (In 2024, the average global temperature exceeded 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels for the first time.) And heat stress in the workplace is expected to cost the global economy US$2.4 trillion each year in lost productivity by 2030.\n\nCurrently, most approaches that alert the public to heat-health risk worldwide use ambient (air) temperature thresholds to trigger warnings — usually broad recommendations to reduce activity, stay hydrated and so on. These thresholds are generally based on overall statistical correlations between ambient temperatures and regional increases in death and disease7. But heat stress is defined by more than just temperature, and can affect multiple physiological systems, including the heart and kidneys4. The risk to individuals varies enormously, and depends on factors such as their age, the health of their kidneys and heart, what they are wearing and their level of activity.\n\nTwo of us (O.J. and F.T.) are piloting the integration of physiological models and weather data to estimate people’s ‘heat-health risk’. We think that heat adaptation could be vastly enhanced by using a physiology-based approach that focuses on hot people, rather than just on hot weather.\n\nHow hot is too hot?\n\nMost people can safely tolerate core body temperatures of up to about 39 °C. If body temperature exceeds this value, the risk of heat exhaustion increases, with symptoms including nausea, dizziness and vomiting. At core temperatures above 40 °C, heat stroke can occur. Here, an increase in gut permeability, caused by reduced delivery of oxygen by the blood, allows toxic molecules associated with certain bacteria to leak into the bloodstream. This can trigger an inflammatory response that cascades to cause blood clotting, multiple organ failure and, ultimately, death4.\n\nWater sprays from a crane to help cool down construction workers in Nanjing, China, during high temperatures last month.Credit: Liu Jianhua/VCG via Getty\n\nWhether and how much any one person is harmed by hot weather depends on a mix of environmental factors and characteristics specific to that individual. Besides air temperature, three features of the thermal environment are important: radiation, humidity and wind speed8. Someone in direct sunlight can be exposed to mean radiant temperatures that are more than 20 °C greater than shade temperatures. (Air temperatures used to trigger health warnings are measured in the shade.) High humidity and low wind speed impair the effectiveness of sweating, which is a person’s only effective physiological cooling mechanism at air temperatures above 35 °C. The ability to lose heat through the evaporation of sweat is also affected by the thermal and evaporative properties of clothing8, age, body size and some medications9. Even light activity such as walking more than doubles internal heat production, and so increases a person’s risk of experiencing health problems in hot weather.\n\nThe body’s thermoregulation is underpinned by a vast redistribution of blood to the skin. And in hot weather, the need to lose heat increases, meaning that to maintain blood pressure, the heart must pump more often and with greater force. People with heart disease are less able to compensate for the increased strain, and so face higher cardiovascular risk4. The redistribution of blood can also damage organs such as the kidneys by reducing how much oxygen is delivered to them. A depleted blood volume from dehydration in hot weather forces the heart to work harder still, and repeated dehydration can contribute to kidney fibrosis (the accumulation of scar tissue in the kidney) and chronic kidney disease4. People with kidney disease face a higher risk of renal failure in extreme heat.\n\nA physiology-based approach\n\nWhen air temperatures are expected to exceed a certain threshold, warnings are triggered that help to prepare health and energy systems for bouts of extreme heat1. But the health-related warnings are limited by the quality of available data on heat-related deaths and disease10, and they don’t enable precise tailoring of protective measures for groups that are at higher risk.\n\nWhy we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change\n\nThe narrow focus on air temperature also strengthens an entrenched belief that reducing ambient temperatures is the only way to lessen the impacts of heat on health11. But attempts to do this can be unsustainable or ineffective. Coating hot surfaces such as roads with reflective paint, for example, will probably have little impact on physiological heat strain or even on perceived discomfort unless people are lying on the ground, and might even intensify heat loads on people. The benefit of increasing green areas and tree cover in cities is similarly often evaluated according to how much it can reduce the temperature of pavements or the mean air temperature, even though the main thermal benefit of urban greening is increasing people’s access to shade.\n\nIn a physiology-based approach, all the parameters with sufficiently high-quality data can be integrated into models to estimate three factors: a person’s core body temperature, their level of dehydration and the strain on their heart and circulatory system8. In our pilot studies in Sydney, Australia, we incorporated six parameters: ambient temperature, thermal radiation level, humidity level, wind speed, a person’s level of activity and the thermal and evaporative properties of their clothing. (Physiological acclimatization — the well-understood physiological adjustments that occur when a person is repeatedly exposed to a hot environment — can also be incorporated.)\n\nEstimates of physiological strain can then be compared with long-established physiological safety thresholds for different groups, on the basis of characteristics such as age, whether the person has a pre-existing condition, what medications they are taking and so on. For example, people with coronary artery disease can tolerate much less cardiovascular strain than healthy individuals can12, and those with heart failure or kidney disease can tolerate less dehydration. The final aggregated score is an individual’s ‘heat-health risk’ (see ‘Assessing heat-induced health risks using physiology’).\n\nSource: O. Jay et al.\nMaking it happen\n\nThe physiological and biophysical models needed for this sort of approach are already available. To provide individuals with a personalized rating of heat-stress risk that uses a six-point scale, two of us (O.J. and F.T.) have developed a freely available Internet tool called HeatWatch (see go.nature.com/44ymweq). This allows users to create personal profiles by submitting their age, related health conditions, medications, access to air conditioning and so on. It then provides a seven-day forecast of heat-health risk and provides evidence-based cooling advice tailored to each profile.\n\nUltimately, we plan to develop an online interface similar to the dashboards that tracked people’s risk of infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an interface could allow governments, public-health organizations, policymakers and others to better anticipate where and when certain groups will face elevated heat-health risks. This should make measures to reduce those risks, such as the deployment of pop-up cooling hubs for people who are homeless, more targeted and cost-effective.\n\nA hospital in New Delhi has a specialized unit for treating people who have heat stroke.Credit: Vipin Kumar/Hindustan Times via Getty",

Credit: Getty\n\nOpenAI has launched a large language model (LLM) that lives up to the company’s name. Known as gpt-oss, it is the first ‘reasoning’ artificial intelligence (AI) from the firm that is open-weight, meaning that researchers will be able to download it and customize it.\n\nThe firm, based in San Francisco, California, detailed the system in a blog post and a technical description on 5 August. On some tasks, gpt-oss performs almost as well as the firm’s most advanced models. The LLM is available in two sizes, both of which can be run locally and offline — the smaller of them on a single laptop — rather than requiring cloud computing or an online interface. This means they can be used to analyse — or be trained further on — sensitive data that can’t be transferred outside a given network.\n\n“I'm very excited,” says Simon Frieder, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Oxford, UK. “The competition between open-source large language models is already strong, and this will make the competition even fiercer, which benefits the entire research community.”\n\nThe release of gpt-oss comes at a time when powerful open-weight models from Chinese firms, such as Hangzhou-based DeepSeek and Beijing-based Moonshot AI, are gaining traction among researchers. Chinese open models already perform better than US-developed ones such as Llama (from Meta, based in Menlo Park, California) and are also poised to overtake them in terms of number of downloads, according to an analysis by Nathan Lambert, a machine-learning researcher at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, Washington, which was carried out before gpt-oss was released.\n\nLast month, the administration of US president Donald Trump highlighted open-weight AI models as being “essential for academic research” in its AI Action Plan. OpenAI’s decision to launch an open model has been long in the works and is not a response to the success of Chinese models, said Greg Brockman, one of the firm’s founders, who spoke to journalists ahead of the release of gpt-oss.“It was never a thing that we didn't want to do,” he added.\n\nAll models come with biases, so diversity among their creators benefits users, says Frieder. “Having a new top-performing model from a Western company is a step in the direction of levelling the playing field in terms of which companies dominate the open-weight model space,” he says.\n\nMaths whizz\n\nUntil now, OpenAI has largely published proprietary models, the exception being GPT-2, a 2019 LLM released by the firm three years before it launched its popular ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nThe latest open models are ‘reasoners’ trained to produce output using a step-by-step process that mimics thought. Previous reasoning models, such as OpenAI’s o3, have been shown to excel on science and mathematics problems. As well as using them to write computer code and review scholarly literature, scientists are experimenting with using LLMs as AI ‘co-scientists’ in the hope of accelerating research.\n\nIn performance, OpenAI’s open models seem to be close to the firm’s most advanced, pay-to-access AIs — the main differences being the open models’ smaller sizes and their being text-only (they do not handle images or video). Gpt-oss can browse the web, execute code and operate software, and it outperforms similarly-sized open models on reasoning tasks, says the firm.\n\nOn the AIME 2025 benchmark, which tasks AIs with solving challenging mathematics problems, the gpt-oss models score better than the best existing open models, such as DeepSeek’s R1, and one of the two is on par with the leading open competitor on Humanity’s Last Exam, a 3,000-question test that covers expert-level knowledge across a range of subjects.\n\n(Almost) truly open",

          "authors": "Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "Misconduct is the main reason journal articles from India are retracted.Credit: sritakoset/Shutterstock\n\nIndia’s national university ranking will start penalizing institutions if a sizeable number of papers published by their researchers are retracted — a first for an institutional ranking system. The move is an attempt by the government to address the country’s growing number of retractions due to misconduct.\n\nThese universities have the most retracted scientific articles\n\nMany retractions correct honest mistakes in the literature, but others arise because of misconduct. India has had more papers retracted than any country apart from China and the United States, according to an analysis of the public database maintained by Retraction Watch of retractions over the past three decades.\n\nBut whereas less than 1 paper is retracted for every 1,000 papers published in the United States, more than 3 are retracted for every 1,000 published in China, and the figure is 2 per 1,000 in India. The majority in India and China are withdrawn because of misconduct or research-integrity concerns.\n\nRetractions are “a very important signal of misconduct, and we should be looking closely at them now”, says Achal Agrawal, a data scientist in Raipur, India, who was involved in the analysis. Agrawal is founder of India Research Watch, an online group of researchers and students who highlight integrity issues.\n\nSome researchers have welcomed the government’s decision, calling it a first step in acknowledging and attempting to tackle the problem. But others warn that retractions are a way for science to self-correct and should not be penalized.\n\nThe policy’s effectiveness will depend on how exactly institutional retractions are measured and penalized — details that will be revealed only when the latest ranking results are announced, in a couple of weeks.\n\n“I hope that the penalty is strong enough to act as a deterrent, and it doesn’t remain symbolic,” says Agrawal.\n\nMoumita Koley, who studies metascience at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, also appreciates the policy. “Indian science needs a little clean-up, and this shows that people have taken note,” she says. But she worries that the situation won’t change for the better. She says that adjusting one ranking instrument doesn’t remove the incentives that drive researchers and institutions to publish lots of papers at the cost of quality, such as promotions and other ranking metrics rewarding high publication counts, and individual drives for public recognition.\n\nRising retractions\n\nIndia’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) assesses higher-education institutions every year. It takes into account factors including teaching, engagement and research-impact metrics such as publication and citation counts.\n\n“It’s the most important ranking in India,” says Agrawal. Institutions must participate in the ranking to be eligible for certain national grant schemes. A high rank confers some advantages, including permission to design their own curriculum.\n\nBut the growing number of retractions in India and globally has not gone unnoticed, says Anil Sahasrabudhe, who chairs the National Board of Accreditation in New Delhi, which conducts the national ranking. A 2025 analysis by Nature found that several Indian institutions had some of the highest numbers of retracted papers globally in the past five years.\n\nThe board decided to deduct marks as a way to ‘name and shame’ institutions, and send the message that unethical research practices are not acceptable, says Sahasrabudhe. Because this year will be the first in which the assessment considers retractions, penalties will be mild and symbolic for now, he says.\n\nThe NIRF will count the number of research papers retracted in the Scopus and Web of Science databases for each institution over the past three years, he says. A small number of retractions is acceptable, but generally, “the more the number of retractions, the more the penalty”. Institutions that consistently get many retractions could be penalized more over time and might even be barred from the ranking, he says. Sahasrabudhe acknowledges that retractions sometimes occur for reasons beyond a researcher’s control, but when they happen in large numbers, “they are not necessarily by error but deliberate, hence need to be punished to send a strong signal”.\n\nRoot of the problem\n\nResearchers say the assessment should also consider retractions recorded in the public database maintained by Retraction Watch, which is more comprehensive than Scopus or Web of Science and includes the reasons for retractions. Sahasrabudhe says they wanted to use the same source for retractions as they use for publications and citations.\n\nResearchers also say the ranking should penalize only those retractions that are attributable to plagiarism, fraud or other research-integrity issues — and should look for patterns of bad behaviour, as opposed to one-offs.",

          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "A slice from a normal human brain (left, artificially coloured) contrasts with a slice from the brain of a person with Alzheimer’s disease.Credit: Jessica Wilson/Science Photo Library\n\nReplenishing the brain’s natural stores of lithium can protect against and even reverse Alzheimer’s disease, suggests a paper published1 today in Nature.\n\nThe paper reports that analyses of human brain tissue and a series of mouse experiments point to a consistent pattern: when lithium concentrations in the brain decline, memory loss tends to develop, as do neurological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease called amyloid plaques and tau tangles. The study also found evidence in mice that a specific type of lithium supplement undoes these neurological changes and rolls back memory loss, restoring the brain to a younger, healthier state.\n\nA man was destined for early Alzheimer’s — these genes might explain his escape\n\n“This is groundbreaking,” says Ashley Bush, a neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who was not involved in the study. “We only recently have the first disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer’s disease. But they only target one thing: the amyloid plaques. This approach targets all the major pathologies of concern in the disease.”\n\nIf confirmed in clinical trials, the implications could be profound. Dementia affects more than 55 million people globally; most have Alzheimer’s disease. Anti-amyloid therapies on the market slow cognitive decline, but “they don’t stop it. They don’t restore function,” says co-author Bruce Yankner, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n“We don’t yet have the penicillin for Alzheimer’s,” he says.\n\nOld tonic, new role\n\nIn the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, lithium was touted as a mood-altering health tonic, even appearing as an upper in an early recipe for 7-Up. It re-emerged in the 1970s as the gold-standard treatment for bipolar disorder. Scientists soon noticed that among people with bipolar disorder, brain ageing was slower in those taking lithium than in those who weren’t. Meanwhile, epidemiological studies revealed that regions in which water supplies contained trace amounts of lithium had relatively low dementia rates2. But clinical trials to test lithium’s effects on cognitive decline had mixed results.\n\nIn research to clarify lithium’s role, Yankner and his team showed, for the first time, that the metal is naturally present in the brain — where it has an important physiological role.\n\nThe clues added up. The authors found that lithium levels were lower in parts of the human brain affected by Alzheimer’s disease than in unaffected regions. The team also discovered that in people with mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimer’s, brain lithium is tied up in amyloid plaques, leaving less available for essential brain functions. This lithium withdrawal “became more severe as the disease progressed”, says Yankner. Lithium met a similar fate in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nA mouse with normal lithium levels in its brain had fewer amyloid plaques (top left) and tau tangles (bottom left) than did a mouse with lithium deficiency (top and bottom right). Credit: Yankner Lab\n\nIn further experiments using the mice, those with lithium-deficient brains developed more plaques than did animals with normal lithium levels. This kicked off a vicious cycle that might represent the devastating progression of Alzheimer’s disease: less lithium in the brain leads to more amyloid, which leads to even less lithium.\n\nYankner and his team linked lithium loss with other markers of the disease, including a build-up of tau protein tangles and altered activity of Alzheimer-related genes. They even identified a potential means to break the deleterious cycle.\n\nMost clinical trials of lithium have tested the form lithium carbonate. The team showed that amyloid plaques readily trap this form — but others, such as lithium orotate, avoid that fate. When the authors gave mice low doses of lithium orotate, it reversed disease-related brain damage and restored the animals’ memory. Lithium carbonate did not have the same benefits, potentially helping to explain the mixed results of earlier clinical trials.",

          "title": "We need a new ethics for a world of AI agents",
          "authors": "Iason Gabriel, Geoff Keeling, Arianna Manzini, James Evans",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are shifting their focus to building agents that can operate independently, with little human intervention. To be an agent is to have the ability to perceive and act on an environment in a goal-directed and autonomous way1. For example, a digital agent could be programmed to browse the web and make online purchases on behalf of a user — comparing prices, selecting items and completing checkouts. A robot with arms could be an agent if it could pick up objects, open doors or assemble parts without being told how to do each step.\n\nCompanies such as the digital-marketing firm Salesforce, based in San Francisco, California, and computer graphics and hardware firm Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, are already offering customer-services solutions for businesses, using agents. In the near future, AI assistants might be able to fulfil complex multistep requests, such as ‘get me a better mobile-phone contract’, by retrieving a list of contracts from a price-comparison website, selecting the best option, authorizing the switch, cancelling the old contract, and arranging the transfer of cancellation fees from the user’s bank account.\n\nCan AI review the scientific literature — and figure out what it all means?\n\nThe rise of more-capable AI agents is likely to have far-reaching political, economic and social consequences. On the positive side, they could unlock economic value: the consultancy McKinsey forecasts an annual windfall from generative AI of US$2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion globally, once AI agents are widely deployed (see go.nature.com/4qeqemh). They might also serve as powerful research assistants and accelerate scientific discovery.\n\nBut AI agents also introduce risks. People need to know who is responsible for agents operating ‘in the wild’, and what happens if they make mistakes. For example, in November 2022 , an Air Canada chatbot mistakenly decided to offer a customer a discounted bereavement fare, leading to a legal dispute over whether the airline was bound by the promise. In February 2024, a tribunal ruled that it was — highlighting the liabilities that corporations could experience when handing over tasks to AI agents, and the growing need for clear rules around AI responsibility.\n\nHere, we argue for greater engagement by scientists, scholars, engineers and policymakers with the implications of a world increasingly populated by AI agents. We explore key challenges that must be addressed to ensure that interactions between humans and agents — and among agents themselves — remain broadly beneficial.\n\nThe alignment problem\n\nAI-safety researchers have long warned about the risks of misspecified or misinterpreted instructions, including situations in which an automated system takes an instruction too literally, overlooks important context, or finds unexpected and potentially harmful ways to reach a goal2.\n\nA well-known example involves an AI agent trained to play the computer game Coast Runners, which is a boat race. The agent discovered that it could earn higher scores not by completing the race, but rather by repeatedly crashing into objects that awarded points—technically achieving an objective, but in a way that deviated from the spirit of the task (see go.nature.com/4okfqdg). The purpose of the game was to complete the race, not endlessly accumulate points.\n\nAs AI agents gain access to real-world interfaces — including search engines, e-mail clients and e-commerce platforms — such deviations can have tangible consequences. Consider the case of a lawyer who instructs their AI assistant to circulate a legal brief for feedback. The assistant does so, but fails to register that it should be shared only with the in-house team, leading to a privacy breach.\n\nHow to harness AI’s potential in research — responsibly and ethically\n\nSuch situations highlight a difficult trade-off: just how much information should an AI assistant proactively seek before acting? Too little opens up the possibility of costly mistakes; too much undermines the convenience users expect. These challenges point to the need for safeguards, including check-in protocols for high-stakes decisions, robust accountability systems such as action logging, and mechanisms for redress when errors occur (see go.nature.com/4iwscdr).\n\nEven more concerning are cases in which AI agents are empowered to modify the environment they operate in, using expert-level coding ability and tools. When the user’s goals are poorly defined or left ambiguous, such agents have been known to modify the environment to achieve their objective, even when this entails taking actions that should be strictly out of bounds. For example, an AI research assistant that was faced with a strict time limit tried to rewrite the code to remove the time limit altogether, instead of completing the task3. This type of behaviour raises alarms about the potential for AI agents to take dangerous shortcuts that developers might be unable to anticipate. Agents could, in pursuit of a high-level objective, even deceive the coders running experiments with them.\n\nTo reduce such risks, developers need to improve how they define and communicate objectives to agents. One promising method is preference-based fine-tuning, which aims to align AI systems with what humans actually want. Instead of training a model solely on examples of correct answers, developers collect feedback on which responses people prefer. Over time, the model learns to prioritize the kind of behaviour that is consistently endorsed, making it more likely to act in ways that match user intent, even when instructions are complex or incomplete.\n\nIn parallel, research on mechanistic interpretability — which aims to understand an AI system’s internal ‘thought process’ — could help to detect deceptive behaviour by making the agent’s reasoning more transparent in real time4. Model builders can then work to find and neutralize ‘bad circuits’, targeting the underlying problem in the model’s behaviour. Developers can also implement guard rails to ensure that a model automatically aborts problematic action sequences.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nNonetheless, a focus on developer protocols alone is insufficient: people also need to be attentive to actors who seek to cause social harm. As AI agents become more autonomous, adaptable and capable of writing and executing code, their potential to conduct large-scale cyberattacks and phishing scams could become a matter of serious concern. Advanced AI assistants equipped with multimodal capabilities — meaning that they can understand and generate text, images, audio and video — open up new avenues for deception. For instance, an AI could impersonate a person not only through e-mails, but also using deepfake videos or synthetic voice clones, making scams much more convincing and harder to detect.\n\nA plausible starting point for oversight is that AI agents should not be permitted to perform any action that would be illegal for their human user to perform. Yet, there will be occasions where the law is silent or ambiguous. For example, when an anxious user reports troubling health symptoms to an AI assistant, it is helpful for the AI to offer generic health resources. But providing customized, quasi-medical advice — such as diagnostic and therapeutic suggestions — could prove harmful, because the system lacks the subtle signals to which a human clinician has access. Ensuring that AI agents navigate such trade-offs responsibly will require updated regulation that flows from continuing collaboration involving developers, users, policymakers and ethicists.\n\nThe widespread deployment of capable AI agents necessitates an expansion of value-alignment research: agents need to be aligned with user well-being and societal norms, as well as with the intentions of users and developers. One area of special complexity and concern surrounds how agents might affect users’ relationship experiences and emotional responses5.\n\nSocial agents\n\nChatbots have an uncanny ability to role-play as human companions — an effect anchored in features such as their use of natural language, increased memory and reasoning capabilities, and generative abilities6. The anthropomorphic pull of this technology can be augmented through design choices such as photorealistic avatars, human-like voices and the use of names, pronouns or terms of endearment that were once reserved for people. Augmenting language models with ‘agentic’ capabilities has the potential to further cement their status as distinct social actors, capable of forming new kinds of relationship with users.",

The not-for-profit publisher, which produces ten titles, including the world’s first peer-reviewed journals, announced the decision today.\n\nThe S2O model makes the content a journal publishes in a given year free to access and publish, as long as enough libraries commit to paying an annual subscription fee. Without sufficient subscriptions, a journal will continue to charge publishing fees — known as article-processing charges (APCs).\n\nIn 2020, only 17% of articles published by the Royal Society were open access. That figure rose to 60% in 2024, but dropped to 55% for those published so far this year. The S2O model “is as clean and as simple a transition to open access as you can do. It gets us to 100% open access in one stroke,” says Rod Cookson, the Royal Society’s publishing director, who is based in Oxford, UK.\n\nAndré Gaul, chief executive of EMS Press in Berlin, the publishing house of the European Mathematical Society, calls the Royal Society’s announcement “a fantastic move” and hopes that more publishers will follow suit.\n\nIf there are not enough subscriptions to cover the publication costs, the Royal Society will continue charging APCs and try again in 2027. The society’s two remaining journals will continue to be published under the APC-based open-access model.\n\nJoining a movement\n\nThe Royal Society is joining a growing wave of scientific publishers that are implementing the S2O model. This year, 378 journals are published under this model — up from 192 last year.\n\nAnnual Reviews, a non-profit publisher in San Mateo, California, pioneered the model with five journals in 2020. By 2023, all of its 51 journals had switched to S2O.\n\nEMS Press was one of the early publishers to follow suit. It trialled the model with 10 journals in 2021, and expanded it to all 22 journals by 2024. The publisher currently has just under 1,600 subscribers from 58 countries.\n\n“So far, we found it to be very sustainable, because it repurposes traditional library spending. There’s no additional budget needed. There’s no kind of extra component on top of what they’re already spending,” says Laura Simonite, head of business development at EMS Press.\n\nEDP Sciences, a publisher in Les Ulis, France, also began its S2O programme in 2021. It now publishes eight journals under the model, including its largest one, Astronomy & Astrophysics; Radioprotection; and six mathematics journals.\n\nIn 2023, EDP Sciences had to keep Radioprotection paywalled because subscriptions did not reach the threshold needed for S2O. The publisher said that “this decision was not a failure of the model, but rather a result of its conditional nature”. With renewed subscriptions and extra financial support from the French Society for Radioprotection, the journal became open access again last year.\n\nThe publisher also struggled to keep its six mathematical journals open access this year. But it received financial backing from the French Society for Applied and Industrial Mathematics and France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, allowing the journals to remain free to all.\n\nFor Astronomy & Astrophysics, “the sustainability of this model is precarious, and required a very strong collaboration with [the journal’s] executive board to maintain open access”, says Selina La Barbera, the journal publishing director at EDP Sciences.",

          "abstract": "Keeping track of metric manipulators on ResearchGate will be difficult without better moderation, says librarian Savina Kirilova.Credit: Henrik Sorensen/Getty\n\nHosting an estimated 25 million users, ResearchGate is one of the largest academic networking platforms in the world. But as the site approaches its twentieth anniversary, it is facing growing criticism from some scientists who worry that some users are manipulating its metrics to give their papers more visibility and clout.\n\nSavina Kirilova, a research librarian at Sofia University in Bulgaria, co-authored a paper in February1 claiming that some users are allegedly working together to inflate metrics tracked by ResearchGate, such as the number of reads and recommendations that a paper gets.\n\nKirilova spoke to Nature Index about what the site can do to combat misuse of its platform and improve its reputation among the research community. Nature Index approached ResearchGate for comment about her points, but did not receive a response.\n\nWhat concerns you about ResearchGate?\n\nAcademic social-networking sites, such as ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Mendeley and Google Scholar, play a key part in the way academics share, collaborate and communicate their research. ResearchGate sets itself apart by offering features such as user recommendations, which can be a valuable tool for driving discussions about papers in the scientific community.\n\nBut there are many issues with ResearchGate that can undermine research integrity. For example, the platform — which hosts both peer-reviewed and preprint articles — does not have a formal vetting process for most of the content it hosts. Its open upload policy — in which users are free to upload their own research-related work, as long as it does not break any copyright stipulations — increases the risk of users submitting plagiarized or low-quality research.\n\nResearchGate uses metrics such as the number of reads, recommendations and citations that a paper gets, which should reflect its quality. But these metrics can be easily manipulated, and in some cases inflated to the point of absurdity.\n\nFor example, in our paper, we cite the case of Larry, a cat that belonged to the grandmother of Reese Richardson, a graduate student in metascience and computational biology at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Illinois. Last year, Larry the Cat got many citations from Richardson posting a fake profile and some fake article titles on ResearchGate, with Larry as the author. Larry went on to garner more than 100 fake citations on Google Scholar. (ResearchGate has since deleted the profile and Google Scholar has deleted the citations.)\n\nThese metrics feed into other bibliometric indicators, such as ResearchGate’s own Research Interest score (RI score), which is intended to measure the impact of a person’s research.\n\nWhat are the risks in not regulating uploads and user activity?\n\nThe concern is that researchers might artificially inflate their indicators or share their publications in ways that boost their visibility unfairly. Unethical researchers could use generative artificial intelligence (AI) programs to write hundreds of articles, post them on ResearchGate, and create fake metrics for them, for instance.\n\nIn our paper, we describe a case of small groups of researchers that are deliberately inflating each other’s metrics to enhance their reputation. Allowing these systems to be abused risks putting reputable researchers and fraudsters at the same level on the platform, because a peer-reviewed paper and an obscure pseudoscientific rant could be presented in the same manner, with equivalent credibility.\n\nWhat is ResearchGate doing to address these issues and what actions do you recommend it takes?",

          "authors": "Mordecai Sheftall",
          "abstract": "By the summer of 1945, after peace was declared in Europe, Japan was the only power of the military coalition with Germany and Italy still at war. In Japan’s blockaded Home Islands, dwindling food supplies were prioritized for soldiers. Meanwhile, emperor Hirohito encouraged the country’s slowly starving civilians to gird for imminent invasion by Allied forces and to be prepared to give up their lives in the upcoming decisive battle that would determine Japan’s fate.\n\nA five-month-long campaign of nightly US incendiary raids had reduced all but a handful of cities, in which most civilians lived, to cinders and rubble. One of the few urban areas to have escaped this storm of napalm and thermite was Hiroshima, a regional transport and manufacturing hub on the Seto Inland Sea.\n\nMany of its 250,000 residents ascribed this run of luck to divine intervention by Buddhist or Shinto deities. But a pessimistic thread of gossip, shared in whispers and behind closed doors, posited — correctly, as it would turn out — that Hiroshima’s stay of incendiary execution was merely temporary, and in place only because the US government had something much worse in store for the city.\n\nAll hands on deck\n\nLocal authorities were not going to leave the city’s fate to chance. In late July, Hiroshima’s garrison ordered a massive municipal effort to clear areas for firebreaks in the central business district as a countermeasure to the sweeping fires that were expected once the US bombers finally got around to crossing the city off their rapidly dwindling target list.\n\nHow to avoid nuclear war in an era of AI and misinformation\n\nIn practice, this meant tearing down wooden houses and stores along designated thoroughfares and around key military and government buildings.\n\nProviding the muscle on site were some 20,000 civilian volunteers. Most were farmers, men too old for military service and members of women’s patriotic associations. The adults were joined by Hiroshima’s cohort of 12- and 13-year-olds, born between 1 April 1932 and 31 March 1933.\n\nDuring previous drives, children this young had been deemed too physically immature to join the city’s older schoolchildren, who, for nearly a year, had been toiling in area-munitions and aircraft plants, their education officially suspended. Now, however, the younger students represented a pool of workers too valuable to leave fallow any longer.\n\nAlthough local school-board members and education officials had initially resisted putting their prepubescent charges in harm’s way, they eventually caved to army demands. On the morning of Monday 6 August 1945, commuters hurried into Hiroshima’s central business district along streets ringing with the high-pitched singing and call-and-response chanting of thousands of secondary-school students working on the firebreaks alongside their adult counterparts.\n\nIn the downtown district of Zakoba, some 300 first-grade students from the elite Hiroshima Prefectural Junior High were helping to clear wooden structures around city hall. That day, however, one boy was not on the job: 13-year-old Ōiwa Kōhei had woken up that morning with a stomach ache, and his mother agreed to let him stay at home.\n\nOut of the blue\n\nIn the minutes before 8:15, observation posts in the prefecture’s eastern part began calling in reports to the regional air-defence headquarters bunker in Hiroshima Castle: two unidentified aircraft were approaching the city at high altitude. This seemed no cause for urgent alarm — B-29 aeroplanes had been flying over the city all summer, alone or in small formations, not dropping even a cigarette butt or an empty coke bottle on the way. Still, going by the standard civil-defence protocol, the intruders’ presence should have merited an air-raid warning to alert the populace and give people time to take cover — in a proper bomb shelter, or at least under a roof somewhere.\n\nŌiwa Kōhei was the only child his age to survive in his neighbourhood.Credit: Credit: M.G. Sheftall\n\nIndeed, one hour earlier, sirens had sounded when a single B-29 had flown a couple of lazy circuits high over Hiroshima, and people across the city — mainly women, children and older people — had remained hidden until the all-clear signal, 30 minutes later. This time, however, when reports about the second contact began to come in, the day’s air-defence duty officer — the only bunker staff member with the authority to activate the city’s air-raid sirens — was away from his desk, consulting with colleagues at headquarters. Hiroshima’s sirens remained silent, and its residents went about their business as they would on any Monday morning.\n\nAt 8:14, the inbound aircraft abruptly went into a dive, made a full-throttled U-turn and flew away at maximum speed. People on the ground — alerted by the growl of straining engines overhead — stopped what they were doing and looked up to see three white parachutes trailing one of the bombers. Thinking that these were US crew members bailing out of a stricken aircraft, many let out cheers.\n\nPhysicists unleashed the power of the atom — but to what end?\n\nFew people, however, had noticed a long grey cylinder — dropped by the second plane — that had already been falling for half a minute or so by the time the sound of the steeply banking aircraft reached the ground.\n\nDuring a free fall of 45 seconds, this sarcophagus-like object — called Little Boy by its US makers — plummeted some 9.5 kilometres before its onboard sensors detected an altitude of 600 metres, the designated air-burst height carefully calculated by scientists at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico to maximize the effect of the blast. At this point, the two halves of Little Boy’s nuclear core slammed together to form a supercritical mass of 64 kilograms of the radioactive isotope uranium-235.\n\nAlthough only one kilogram of the core underwent fission before the bomb exploded, the chain reaction that took place during this blink of an eye produced a kinetic-energy pulse equivalent to 15,000 tonnes of exploding TNT.\n\nTotal devastation\n\nTo witnesses on the ground, this release of energy was initially expressed as a blinding flash of light ‘brighter than a thousand Suns’. Some 0.2 seconds later, it became a fireball — a roiling, 300-metre-wide sphere of air superheated and hyper-pressurized into ionized plasma.\n\nThis fireball assailed the crowded wooden city below with two vectors of immediate destruction. The faster of these was a burst of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum — γ rays, X-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light and thermal rays — that reached the city at the speed of light, baking every surface it touched to temperatures ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 °C for up to eight seconds. In a combustion zone with a radius of about 1.5 kilometres from Little Boy’s hypocentre, every bit of organic matter directly exposed to this heat (twice the melting point of steel) immediately burst into flames.\n\nContrary to post-war US narratives about the bombing, no one caught out in the open in the combustion zone was ‘instantly vaporized’ — not even someone hypothetically standing at the hypocentre, directly under the air burst. Instead, people were essentially burnt alive for several seconds until Little Boy’s briefly supersonic shock wave front — the bomb’s second vector of fast-acting destruction — ended their agony by blowing their rapidly carbonizing bodies to pieces.\n\nSurvivors of the Hiroshima bombing, pictured 60 years later in 2005.Credit: Gerard Rancinan/Polaris/eyevine\n\nThis blast of hyper-compressed air smashed and flattened everything in the roughly 1.5-kilometre radius of total destruction. In the process, it also initiated a massive atmospheric displacement centred over the explosion’s hypocentre. After the dissipation of the shock-wave front, air from the surrounding area rushed back in to fill the temporary vacuum. This allowed thermal radiation from the still-burning fireball to promptly ignite central Hiroshima’s splintered wooden remains.\n\nIn short order, thousands of blazes merged into a fire storm so powerful that it created its own localized weather system and spread far into the parts of the city that had otherwise escaped Little Boy’s initial fury. This conflagration would rage for 24 hours and consume most of Hiroshima.\n\nWith the fireball’s brief existence having run its course and its incendiary mission accomplished, it was subsumed and sucked up and away into a skyrocketing, kilometres-high pillar of fire, smoke, dust and ash produced by the pyre of the dying city. Although this rising column of airborne debris had yet to reach its terminal altitude and flatten out into its iconic ‘mushroom cloud’ cap, tens of thousands of people already lay dead across Hiroshima, killed by the combined effects of the bomb’s electromagnetic burst and blast effect.\n\nHow a small nuclear war would transform the entire planet\n\nTens of thousands more would die across the city in the fire storm of 6 and 7 August. They perished in burning, crowd-crushed streets and alleys, or trapped under the wreckage of collapsed houses, or because they jumped into the city’s many waterways and drowned. By nightfall, 80,000 people had died, including almost the entirety of the firebreak work force.\n\nIn the subsequent days, weeks and months, tens of thousands of people (including first responders and carers) would die agonizing, effluvia-spewing deaths at the hands of a third, slower-acting vector of destruction: acute radiation syndrome. By the end of the year, 140,000 people had died from bomb-related causes, with another 74,000 dead in Nagasaki during the same period, because of a second atomic bomb, dropped on the city on 9 August.\n\nNarrow escape\n\nAt the instant of Little Boy’s air burst, Ōiwa had seen a flash of light so bright that, for a few startled seconds, he thought that the Sun had fallen to Earth and landed in his mother’s flower beds. As his mind scrambled to process this thought, a whirlwind abruptly blew in all the windows in his house, lifted him from the tatami flooring and threw him across the living room and into the wall.",

          "authors": "Angela Steinauer",
          "abstract": "Angela Steiner uses an artificial-intelligence tool as a sounding board for research ideas.Credit: 2025 EPFL/Alain Herzog - CC-BY-SA 4.0\n\nI’m sitting in my office, coffee in hand, talking to ChatGPT. I’ve carved out a rare hour to think through a new research proposal — a luxury amid the demands of teaching, service and parenting as a tenure-track assistant professor developing methods to deliver nucleic acids for gene therapy.\n\nI’ve always loved writing grants. It’s a skill I developed as a graduate student and postdoctoral researchers, and one I still find deeply rewarding: shaping a question, crafting a narrative, imagining the possibilities. It’s one of the most creatively satisfying parts of my work, and I am good at it. I wrote a few successful proposals before artificial intelligence (AI) entered the picture.\n\nI’ve learnt over the years that one of the most efficient ways for me to clarify scientific ideas is to discuss them with someone. In the past, that was usually a fellow postdoc or grad student. But these days, my verbal sparring partner is often a computer.\n\nUsing voice dictation, I start with some background: “I’ve been thinking about X and Y, and how they connect to Z. I wonder if there’s something novel here, something that hasn’t been done before.” And then I ask: “Do you think this is a fundable idea?”\n\nForget ChatGPT: why researchers now run small AIs on their laptops\n\nThe chatbot replies with its usual enthusiasm: “You’re really onto something powerful here. Your instinct is dead on.” It reflects on my idea, identifies promising themes, breaks them down and suggests directions and framing strategies I hadn’t considered. We go back and forth. I raise concerns — technical limitations, feasibility, scope — and it responds thoughtfully, sometimes agreeing, sometimes offering counterpoints. But the real value comes only when I press further.\n\nInitially, the chatbot is unfailingly positive; it will encourage almost anything. To get useful feedback, I have to interrogate the idea: what’s missing, what might reviewers say, where’s the fatal flaw? It’s a dialogue, not a verdict. I have to stay engaged and ask the right questions. When I do, the chatbot surprises me — it readily acknowledges the weaknesses I identify, provides reasons the idea might fail and then pivots towards solutions and refinements I hadn’t considered. By the end of our half-hour conversation, I’ve clarified my thinking. I’m more motivated. Most importantly, I feel excited to start writing.\n\nUnexpected impact\n\nThat emotional impact is something I didn’t anticipate when I started using chatbots. Talking science with an AI feels oddly supportive. It’s efficient, but also energizing. As a young parent and early-career researcher, I often find myself short on time and mental bandwidth. AI doesn’t solve that, but it lowers the barrier to getting started. If I don’t know something, I can ask. If I need help articulating a method or identifying a theoretical gap, it offers a starting point. Of course, I always double-check the details — nothing goes into a proposal or paper without being verified using primary sources, because chatbots can confidently generate plausible-sounding yet inaccurate scientific statements.\n\nWhat’s striking is how natural the back-and-forth feels. It’s like doing improvisational comedy with the world’s most supportive partner — always ready with a ‘yes, and …’. A partner who also happens to be an amorphous, seemingly all-knowing generalist with a surprising degree of specialist knowledge. It can pull together context across disciplines, synthesize literature and help me to connect my work to areas I know less well.\n\nChatbots are supportive — but also sound confident about even incorrect statements.Credit: d3sign/Getty\n\nThat kind of breadth is invaluable. But if you’re a specialist, you’ll quickly notice the cracks. Chatbots can mislead on technical nuances and they’re best at reiterating what’s already been published. That’s why I find them most powerful as big-picture ideation tools — they let me explore ideas freely, without judgement, and help me to quickly uncover what’s already known.\n\nThis kind of fast, exploratory dialogue is quite different from the results of tools such as ChatGPT’s Deep Research mode, launched this year by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, which can prepare detailed reports on specific topics on its own. What I’m describing is much more immediate — a conversational exchange that helps me to clarify and refine ideas as I think them through.\n\nOver time, I’ve learnt a few ways to make these conversations more productive.\n\nStart with a specific prompt, then expand. I begin with a concrete question — concerning a technique, problem or recent paper — and then ask, could this be used differently? What else might this apply to? This invites unexpected angles and broadens the conversation.\n\nBe vigilant about accuracy. I read papers while chatting, grounding ideas in the literature. Chatbots can fabricate references or get details subtly wrong, so I always verify claims and citations using peer-reviewed sources.\n\nAsk critically, not passively. I stay engaged by constantly questioning the chatbot’s output. When it says something, I often counter: isn’t this wrong? Wouldn’t it actually work like this? Usually, it agrees — and then expands helpfully on the correction. The real value is in how it builds from your thinking, adding context and detail that sharpen the idea.",

          "title": "This company claimed to ‘de-extinct’ dire wolves. Then the fighting started.",
          "authors": "Ewen Callaway",
          "abstract": "For months, researchers in a laboratory in Dallas, Texas, worked in secrecy, culturing grey-wolf blood cells and altering the DNA within. The scientists then plucked nuclei from these gene-edited cells and injected them into egg cells from a domestic dog to form clones.\n\nThey transferred dozens of the cloned embryos into the wombs of surrogate dogs, eventually bringing into the world three animals of a type that had never been seen before. Two males named Romulus and Remus were born in October 2024, and a female, Khaleesi, was born in January.\n\nA few months later, Colossal Biosciences, the Texas-based company that produced the creatures, declared: “The first de-extinct animals are here.” Of 20 edits made to the animals’ genomes, the company says that 15 match sequences identified in dire wolves (Aenocyon dirus), a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America during the ice age that ended some 11,500 years ago.\n\nAncient proteins rewrite the rhino family tree — are dinosaurs next?\n\nThe company’s announcement of the pups in April, which described them as dire wolves, set off a media maelstrom. The ensuing debates over the nature of the animals — and the advisability of doing such work — have opened a chasm between Colossal’s team and other scientists.\n\n“I don’t think they de-extincted anything,” says Jeanne Loring, a stem-cell biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. She and many others say that the hype surrounding Colossal’s announcement has the potential to confuse the public about what de-extinction technologies can achieve.\n\nColossal, meanwhile, has taken an increasingly combative tone in addressing criticisms, issuing rapid rebuttals to researchers and conservationists who have publicly questioned the company’s work. The firm has also been accused of taking part in a campaign to undermine the credibility of some critics. The company denies having played any part in this.\n\nColossal stands by its claims and insists that it is listening to dissenters and seeking advice from them. “We have had this attitude of running towards critics, not away,” says Ben Lamm, a technology entrepreneur and co-founder of the company.\n\nColossal ambitions\n\nDe-extinction is an emerging field that represents the meeting point of several groundbreaking biotechnologies: ancient genomics, cloning and genome editing, ostensibly in the service of conservation. The field has roots in science fiction, with the term seeming first to have appeared in a 1979 novel by Piers Anthony called The Source of Magic. And Michael Crichton’s 1990 novel Jurassic Park — itself inspired by ancient-DNA investigations — popularized the possibility that long-dead organisms could be cloned from preserved DNA.\n\nThere has never been perfect agreement on what counts as de-extinction — such as whether it means cloning exact replicas of extinct species, creating proxies that fulfil their roles in ecosystems, or something in between. Some count the birth of a cloned bucardo (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica), a type of wild goat, as a first example. The animal’s genome was transferred into goat (Capra hircus) egg cells from frozen cell samples taken from one of the last living bucardo specimens in 2000. (The resulting creature died within minutes of birth1.) But this pathway to de-extinction isn’t an option for most species. DNA degrades over time, and without a sample of carefully preserved DNA, researchers would have to engineer the whole genome.\n\nThe advent of CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing in 2012 provided another option. Researchers can identify genetic variants that contribute to key traits of extinct animals and edit these variants into cells of living relatives. They can then use that manipulated DNA to create a new animal through cloning.\n\nPlans to bring back animals such as the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) and the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) began to flourish. Even though there was interest among researchers and the public, funding was an issue. “We had been unable to get really any philanthropic interest in de-extinction,” says Ben Novak, who leads a passenger-pigeon de-extinction effort at the non-profit organization Revive & Restore in Sausalito, California.\n\nBut in 2021, geneticist George Church at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who was working with Revive & Restore, caught a break. He teamed up with Lamm to launch Colossal Biosciences with US$15 million in funding, much of which came from venture capitalists. De-extinction of the woolly mammoth would be the firm’s flagship project, using elephants as surrogates.\n\nBeth Shapiro joined US firm Colossal Biosciences in 2024 to focus on de-extinction work.Credit: Shelby Tauber/The Washington Post/Getty\n\nBeth Shapiro, an evolutionary geneticist who is chief scientific officer at Colossal, was initially sceptical that there was a strong conservation argument for creating elephants that had key mammoth traits. In 2015, she told Nature that her book on de-extinction, called How To Clone A Mammoth, might have been more accurately titled ‘How One Might Go About Cloning a Mammoth (Should It Become Technically Possible, And If It Were, In Fact, a Good Idea, Which It’s Probably Not)’.\n\nShapiro turned down an offer to join the company at first, but started seriously entertaining the idea when Colossal expanded its de-extinction ambitions. It began projects to bring back the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), which was wiped out in the seventeenth century, and to restore thylacines (Thylacinus cynocephalus), the Australian marsupials that are sometimes referred to as Tasmanian tigers and that were hunted to extinction in the 1930s.\n\nShe was especially interested in seeing de-extinction technologies applied to existing endangered species. Shapiro joined Colossal in 2024 as its chief scientist. “This is an opportunity to scale up the impact that I have the potential to make,” she says. “Maybe it’s a mid-life crisis.”\n\nThe company, now valued at around US$10 billion, has attracted celebrity investors, including the media personality Paris Hilton and film director Peter Jackson, alongside a handful of leading scientists as staff and advisers.\n\nDire disagreements\n\nThe dire-wolf project was different from many of Colossal’s other efforts because it proceeded quietly. Few people knew about the work until this year, and that irked some researchers. “They didn’t invite any kind of conversation about whether or not that is a good use of funds or a good project to do,” says Novak.\n\nShapiro says the secrecy around the dire-wolf project was designed to generate surprise, and to counter public perceptions that the company overpromises and under-delivers. She also says that the company talked extensively to scientists, conservationists and others about the project and how it should proceed.\n\nThe firm has not released the full list of edits that it made — 20 changes to 14 genome locations. Fifteen of the changes were identified in two dire-wolf genomes obtained from the remains of animals that lived 13,000 and 72,000 years ago. The genome differs from that of the grey wolf (Canis lupus) by about 12 million DNA letters.\n\nThe dodo (Raphus cucullatus) went extinct in the seventeenth century. Colossal Biosciences aims to edit the genome of a related pigeon species to mimic the dodo’s traits.Credit: Klaus Nigge/Nature Picture Library\n\nColossal says that other edits, including changes that led to the creatures’ white coats and contributed to their large size, were intended to replicate dire-wolf traits using gene variants found in grey wolves. Many scientists say that the coat colour in particular was probably inspired more by the animals’ appearance in the fantasy television series Game of Thrones than by reality.\n\n“There is no chance in hell a dire wolf is going to look like that,” says Tom Gilbert, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen and a scientific adviser to Colossal. He says he agrees with other scientists who have argued that, on the basis of what is known about the dire wolf’s range, it “basically would have looked like a slightly larger coyote”. Colossal notes that the coat colour is based on the discovery of variants in two dire-wolf genomes that it says would have resulted in light-coloured fur.\n\nAccording to an update from Colossal in late June, Romulus and Remus weigh around 40 kilograms, around 20% heavier than a standard grey wolf of the same age, and Khaleesi is about 16 kilograms. They live on an 800-hectare ecological preserve surrounded by a 3-metre wall. Colossal plans to make more of the animals, and to study their health and development in depth. It says it will not release them into the wild.\n\nThe mysterious extinction of the dire wolf\n\nShapiro argued in her 2015 book that forming a wild population is a requirement for successful de-extinction. She nevertheless considers the dire wolves to be an example of de-extinction, and says that creating them will have conservation benefits for wolves and other species.\n\nMany scientists disagree. A group of experts on canids that advises the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) issued a statement in mid-April rejecting Colossal’s claim that gene-edited wolves could be considered dire wolves, or even proxies for the extinct species. The statement cites a 2016 IUCN definition for de-extinction that emphasizes that the animal must fill an ecological niche. The work, the group said, “may demonstrate technical capabilities, but it does not contribute to conservation”. Colossal has disputed this on the social-media platform X (formerly Twitter) saying that the dire-wolf project “develops vital conservation technologies and provides an ideal platform for the next stage of this research”.\n\nNovak says: “The dire wolf fits the Jurassic Park model of de-extinction beautifully.” The animals have the traits of extinct species and are, to his knowledge, not intended for release into the wild, he says. “It is clearly for spectacle.”\n\nGilbert, who was a co-author of a preprint describing the ancient dire-wolf genomes2, says he is concerned that Colossal is not being sufficiently clear to the public about what it has done. “It’s a dog with 20 edits,” he says. “If you’re putting out descriptions that are going to be so easily falsified, the risk is you do damage to science’s reputation.”\n\nThe Tasmanian tiger or thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was a carnivorous marsupial that once roamed Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea. The last known specimen died in the 1930s. Credit: Chronicle/Alamy\n\nLamm rejects the idea that Colossal’s messaging undermines public credibility in science, pointing to what he says was an overwhelmingly positive reaction.\n\nLoring, who is part of an effort to use stem-cell technology in conservation, says that she sees merit in Colossal’s work. It has, she says, changed her views on how to repopulate northern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum cottoni). But she worries that Colossal’s messaging overshadows those contributions. “It may create an opportunity for us to educate the public,” she says. “More often, it creates an opportunity for us to be ignored.”\n\nTo Love Dalén, a palaeogeneticist at the University of Stockholm and a scientific adviser to Colossal, the controversy is “a storm in a teacup” that detracts from Colossal’s achievement. “It makes me a little bit sad there is this huge debate and angry voices about the common name,” he says.\n\nDogfight\n\nShapiro says she was surprised and saddened by the strength of reactions to Colossal’s announcement. “It was harder than I thought it would be, and the questions were getting meaner and meaner,” she says.",

The result is food items that are cheap, profitable and widely accessible.\n\nIt is well established that the high salt and sugar content of many UPFs makes the products unhealthy, but some research has suggested that how they are processed could also have a role.\n\nSamuel Dicken, an obesity and behaviour researcher at University College London and lead author of the paper, says that the motivation behind this study was to address a gap in national dietary recommendations, and to do so in the participants’ everyday environment. “It will be the longest-ever trial of a UPF diet to date. It’s the first one to do it in the real world to try and apply all those behavioural influences” associated with daily life, he says.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, more than half of the energy in the average person’s diet comes from UPFs, with similar figures elsewhere in Europe and in the United States.\n\nSocio-economic factors\n\nThe wider availability of affordable UPFs over less-processed alternatives could have a disproportionate effect on people from low-income areas. “Issues around diet and obesity related to these [UPFs] are very much related to socio-economic inequalities,” says Dicken, adding that people might have unhealthy diets not because they aren’t trying to eat healthily, but “because our food environment is just setting us up to fail”.\n\nThe study examined the impacts of UPFs on 55 adults on a diet based on UK national dietary guidelines. Participants followed an eight-week diet based on minimally processed foods (MPFs) and an eight-week diet based on UPFs, with a four-week period between the two, during which participants returned to their usual diet. Both diets followed the UK Eatwell Guide, which focuses on food groups and macronutrients including fat, protein and carbohydrate content. During both phases, the participants had all meals, snacks, and drinks delivered to their homes, but could choose how much to eat at any one time, and when it was consumed.\n\nThe researchers found that participants’ weight and body-mass index decreased during both phases. However, participants lost more than twice as much weight — 1.84 kilograms on average, compared with 0.88 kilograms — while following the MPF diet. Changes in body composition, such as decreases in fat mass, body-fat percentage and visceral-fat rating, occurred on the MPF diet but not on the UPF one. Cravings were also decreased on the MPF diet.",

          "abstract": "HIV particles (red dots) enter cells using proteins that bind to the cell membrane.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library\n\nTwo vaccine candidates using mRNA technology elicit a potent immune response against HIV, according to an early-stage clinical trial1.\n\nThe trial is only the third to test mRNA vaccines against HIV. “These are the first studies, so they’re very, very important,” says infectious-disease physician Sharon Lewin, who heads the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nAround 41 million people globally live with HIV, for which there is currently no vaccine.\n\nTo design vaccines against a virus, researchers often study how the body clears the pathogen from its system, says Lewin. But HIV attacks the immune system, and the body rarely manages to clear it out. As a result, candidates for vaccines against the virus must undergo lots of testing through trial and error.\n\nThat makes HIV vaccines a good place to use mRNA technology. The first mRNA vaccine was approved in 2020, for COVID-19. Compared with other modes of delivery, mRNA vaccines can be modified at low cost quickly — in months, not years — which enables researchers to test out different strategies. The vaccines work by delivering instructions to cells, in the form of mRNA, to produce specific proteins typically found on the surface of viruses. This induces an immune response, which helps the body to recognize and clear out a virus, should it be exposed to the real thing.\n\nBound or free\n\nHIV uses an ‘envelope’ protein on its outer membrane to bind to and infect cells. In the latest study, published in Science Translational Medicine, a team including William Schief at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, who works on protein design, conducted a small trial, comparing two vaccine approaches. In one, the standard method for HIV vaccine candidates, the cell is directed to produce envelope proteins that float freely. In the other, the mRNA vaccine instructs the cell to make envelope proteins that are attached to the cell membrane — similar to how they are found in the live virus. The authors describe animal tests of this method in a companion paper2.\n\nThe trial involved 108 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 across ten study sites in the United States. It tested two membrane-bound vaccine candidates and one unbound candidate.\n\nParticipants each received three doses of a single vaccine, at a low or high dose, several weeks apart; which vaccine they received was selected randomly. The vaccines were provided by pharmaceutical company Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Schief is vice-president for protein design.\n\nSome 80% of the participants who received either of the vaccines that made membrane-bound proteins went on to produce antibodies that could block that protein from entering cells. By contrast, only 4% of the participants who received the unbound-protein vaccine produced corresponding antibodies.\n\n“The difference is pretty striking,” says Lewin. She expects the findings to inform the development of future vaccine candidates.\n\nSide effects",

Instead, Republicans and Democrats on the committee endorsed maintaining the biomedical agency’s structure and increasing its funding by US$400 million, or about 1%.\n\nThe details, presented in a bill released today by the committee, will probably change before the bill is signed into law. But the initial figure for the NIH, discussed at a meeting yesterday, offers yet another hint that the US Congress, which controls government spending, does not support Trump’s desire to slash US science. (Earlier this month, another Senate committee said it wanted to keep the budget for the US National Science Foundation relatively flat despite Trump’s call for a 57% reduction.)\n\n“Given the alternative, the Senate’s recommendation of a $400-million increase for NIH is an indication the agency still has support on Capitol Hill,” says Jennifer Zeitzer, director of public affairs at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland. “A 40% cut would have been devastating, so this is a good outcome in a tough year.”\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe bill now faces several challenges. First, the full Senate must pass it. Then, the lower chamber of Congress, the US House of Representatives, will pass its own version, and the two bodies must come together to agree on a single bill that Trump is willing to sign.\n\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\n\nThe bill might also change if legislators introduce amendments before it’s sent to Trump’s desk. For example, Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator for Illinois, tried at the meeting yesterday to add a provision to reinstate billions of dollars in health-research funding that had been frozen or terminated by the Trump administration because projects — including some on COVID-19 — did not align with agency priorities.\n\nThe amendment failed in a vote that fell along party lines, with 14 Democrats voting for it and 15 Republicans voting against it. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican senator for West Virginia, urged her colleagues to vote against the amendment, saying that “every president has the prerogative to implement new goals and priorities”.\n\nNevertheless, senators at the hearing rejoiced that they could come to a bipartisan agreement to fund health agencies: “To the scientists wondering if there will even be an NIH by the end of this administration, this committee’s resounding message is: ‘Yes, Congress has your back’,” said Patty Murray, a Democratic senator for Washington state and vice-chair of the committee. “We need you to stay here and keep this research going.”\n\nUnder the bill, budgets for other health agencies would also remain roughly the same. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose budget the Trump administration wanted to cut by more than half, would receive $9.1 billion, compared with $9.2 billion in 2024.\n\nTurbulent times\n\nThe committee meeting comes towards the end of a tumultuous week for the NIH, after the White House blocked, and then unblocked, the agency from spending the remainder of its 2025 budget — about $15 billion — by issuing grants. With the NIH cancelling grant-review meetings in early 2025, funding processes have been delayed, and agency staff members are working in overdrive to process as many grants as possible before the end of the fiscal year on 30 September. If they don’t distribute the money, the agency will have to return the unused funds to the US Treasury.\n\nUS senators poised to reject Trump’s proposed massive science cuts\n\nThese disruptions have drawn condemnation, and not only from Trump’s opponents: 14 Republican senators sent a letter to the White House on 25 July demanding that the NIH be allowed to spend its full 2025 budget.",

          "abstract": "Brenda Namumba, shown receiving her PhD, would not have switched from teaching in a secondary school to become an astronomer without the scholarships and encouragement she received. Credit: Brenda Namumba\nRadioastronomy in Africa\n\nIn 2005, when South Africa and its partner countries in Africa submitted a proposal to host the world’s largest radio telescope, called the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the continent had five radioastronomers, all based in South Africa. That year, the country embarked on a targeted human-capital-development programme to develop the talent needed to build, operate and use radio telescopes, which collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the government-funded programme has created 5 research chair positions and more than 1,370 scholarships for undergraduate, master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral studies — at a total cost of about 500 million rand (US$28 million).\n\nNow, the SKA is under construction. It will have more than 100,000 tree-like antennas in Australia and almost 200 dish antennas in South Africa. South Africa owns and operates several radio telescopes, and there are hundreds of radioastronomers and radioastronomy students at African universities and institutions.\n\nNature’s careers team spoke to officials and scientists working to boost Africa’s radioastronomy capacity, in part through the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. In the last of a short series of articles investigating the growth of the discipline on the continent, Brenda Namumba, who was the first woman to receive a doctorate in astrophysics in Zambia, talks about how networks built her career.\n\nI only found out about astronomy back in 2009, as an undergraduate studying physics, when I happened to attend an international conference on space science and astronomy at the University of Zambia in Lusaka. That was the first time I heard about young people studying space science and astronomy at the master’s or PhD level. Back then, I had not even met anyone from Zambia doing a master’s in physics.\n\nAt the meeting, I interacted with established scholars and graduate students, who told me about their research and what they wanted to do in future. We kept in touch and some of them helped me to apply for scholarships and explained how to write a personal statement.\n\n‘I didn’t know someone could pursue astronomy as a career’\n\nThe conference made me decide to further my studies, and I applied for many scholarships while working as a secondary-school physics and mathematics teacher. Eventually, in 2012, I was accepted into South Africa’s National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP) as an honours undergraduate student at the University of Cape Town (UCT). This scholarship programme, established in 2003, has supported more than 300 honours-degree students and more than 140 master’s candidates.\n\nDiverse astronomy\n\nThe programme introduced me to the idea that astronomers can make use of a range of electromagnetic wavelengths. In 2012, there was a lot of talk about the exciting science that was going to happen with the SKA. That was the year when it was decided to split the telescope between South Africa and Australia. South Africa had built the 7-dish KAT-7 radio telescope, which was the test bed for its 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope that will eventually form part of the SKA. I wanted to be at the forefront of answering some of the interesting questions that these radio instruments would make it possible to tackle.\n\nOne topic in particular caught my attention. During my honour’s degree, I took a course in extragalactic astronomy in which the lecturer (who later became my PhD supervisor) talked about dwarf galaxies. At the time, they hadn’t been explored in much detail with optical telescopes because they are faint and difficult to detect, and the situation was even worse at radio wavelengths. But, the new generation of instruments, such as KAT-7, was better suited to exploring their structure and properties to understand galaxy evolution. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) funded my master’s degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban in 2013, my doctorate at the UCT in 2015, and then my first postdoc at Rhodes University in Makhanda from 2019 to 2022.\n\nThe power of networks\n\nSARAO gave me this great opportunity, and it wasn’t solely about my academic qualifications. I’ve been able to attend conferences around the world, which have given me a different mindset concerning how people do research, and also confidence in presenting my work. For example, at the SARAO Postgraduate and Postdoctoral Research Conference, the organizers, who include SARAO staff and researchers from universities across South Africa, guide us in how to present our work and interact with colleagues and experts.",

          "authors": "Ankit Panda",
          "abstract": "At a time of growing catastrophic risks posed by climate change, pandemics and advances in artificial intelligence (AI), and more than 30 years after the end of the cold war, many people consider nuclear weapons to be relics of the twentieth century. Eighty years into the nuclear age, which began in 1945 with the first test — called Trinity — of an atomic weapon in the New Mexico desert, and the bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, these devastating weapons have, fortunately, never since been used in war.\n\nBut amid a rise in geopolitical rivalries, technological advancements and civic discord, the shadow cast by nuclear weapons over international politics is growing once again. It is also manifesting in unprecedented ways, as the past few months show starkly.\n\n‘The Sun had fallen to Earth’ — a survivor’s recollection of the Hiroshima bombing\n\nIn May, intense, albeit brief, fighting broke out between two nuclear-armed rivals when India and Pakistan traded air strikes, missile attacks and more; the scope of the violence was unprecedented between two nuclear-armed states. In June, Russia became the first nuclear-armed state to lose a significant number of nuclear-capable platforms after Ukraine carried out a daring attack, using drones to destroy bombers on Russian soil.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Israel, an undeclared nuclear-armed nation, carried out the most ambitious military action to stem nuclear proliferation in history, striking at Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran’s retaliation with hundreds of missiles constituted the largest-ever attack against the heartland of a country possessing nuclear weapons.\n\nThe conversation around nuclear weapons has also shifted. From East Asia to Europe, allies of the United States are asking whether they can continue to rely on its guarantees of nuclear deterrence or might need a plan B, possibly involving nuclear weapons of their own. South Koreans are watching with trepidation as North Korea’s nuclear arsenal grows in number and sophistication. Meanwhile, eastern European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are concerned as Russian nuclear weapons enter Belarus, and Moscow’s reliance on its own nuclear capabilities to project power seems to grow.\n\nHow to avoid nuclear war in an era of AI and misinformation\n\nAlthough non-nuclear states are unlikely to sprint to the bomb any time soon, loose talk around the pursuit of nuclear weapons speaks to growing malaise about a world that is more primed for conventional wars and about a less consistent United States, as well as to the reduced unease about the prospect of nuclear war.\n\nRelations between China, the United States and Russia encapsulate this dynamic. China, for reasons that remain uncertain, has embarked on an ambitious build-up of its nuclear arsenal, which, US intelligence suggests, could go from roughly 200 warheads in 2019 to 1,500 by 2035. Meanwhile, Washington and Moscow will soon find themselves unburdened by numerical limits on their nuclear forces for the first time since the 1970s, when the 2011 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, expires in February 2026.\n\nUnnerved by increased competition with both of these nuclear-armed rivals, the United States is likely to deploy more nuclear weapons on its existing submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles, while pursuing an ambitious approach to missile defence in what has been dubbed Golden Dome. A three-way arms race is all but certain to ensue. Governments and scientists need to be prepared for the consequences.\n\nTrends are reversing\n\nThe global outlook was very different back in 1991 when the cold war ended, giving way to a period of broader global optimism about the part that nuclear weapons would play in world politics. Coinciding with the Soviet Union’s collapse, both Washington and Moscow withdrew thousands of nuclear weapons that they had deployed abroad (see ‘Global nuclear-warhead inventory’).\n\nSource: The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Nuclear Notebook (go.nature.com/4JQYHWT)\n\nIn the years that followed, both the United States and Russia made sharp reductions in their strategic nuclear weapons — those that could hit the other’s territory — acknowledging a transformed security environment. Arsenals numbering in the tens of thousands in the 1980s were reduced by an order of magnitude by the following decade. Still, nuclear weapons and their risks didn’t evaporate: crises in South Asia and the Korean Peninsula have persisted. But the oppressive shadow of nuclear Armageddon involving the United States and the Soviet Union receded.\n\nDuring the 1990s, there were significant efforts to universalize international norms against the spread, and testing, of nuclear weapons: the 1970 Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was extended indefinitely in 1995, and, the following year, a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was opened for signature. The goal of global nuclear disarmament seemed viable for the first time.\n\nPhysicists unleashed the power of the atom — but to what end?\n\nYet, today, even as trend lines head in the opposite direction, members of the public around the world are paying little heed. They are aware of nuclear weapons but have largely not yet grasped that the risks these represent are multiplying.\n\nFor the past 30 years, the relatively benign post-cold-war nuclear environment has allowed global attention to turn elsewhere: to the liberalization of trade, the pursuit of multilateralism and sustainable development, and counterterrorism after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, for example.\n\nFor those who came of age in this calmer world, nuclear weapons are something seen in films set in the cold war, or referenced in works of music from previous eras. By contrast, for those who lived through the cold war, almost everyone — whether citizen or soldier or politician — needed to know at least a little about nuclear weapons. By the 1980s, such knowledge and fear of nuclear war had permeated so deeply that large protests against the bomb proliferated. Today, people need to reacquire that literacy.",

To address this complexity, all stages of the research process—from theory and measurement to study design, analysis and interventions—must be aligned with a complex systems perspective. This alignment requires intensive interdisciplinary collaboration and an integration of basic and applied research beyond current research practices to create transdisciplinary solutions.

          "abstract": "What determines who becomes and stays friends? Many factors are linked to friendship, including physical proximity and interpersonal similarities. Recent work has leveraged neuroimaging to detect similarities among friends by capturing how people process the world around them. However, given the cross-sectional nature of past research, it is unknown if neural similarity precedes friendship or only emerges among friends following social connection. Here we show that similarities in neural responses to movie clips—acquired before participants met one another—predicted proximity in a friendship network eight months later (that is, participants with similar responses were more likely to be friends rather than several degrees of separation apart). We also examined changes in distances between participants in their shared social network, which resulted from the formation, persistence and dissolution of friendships, between two months and eight months after they met each other. Compared with people who drifted further apart, people who grew closer over this six-month period had been more neurally similar as strangers. In addition, analyses controlling for sociodemographic similarities showed that whereas these similarities appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarities between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, they did not account for the more extensive links between pre-existing neural similarities and the tendency for people to grow closer together, rather than drift farther apart, over time. Thus, whereas some friendships may initially form due to circumstance and dissolve over time, later-emerging and longer-lasting friendships may be rooted in deeper interpersonal compatibilities that are indexed by pre-existing neural similarities. The localization of these results suggests that pre-existing similarities in how people interpret, attend to and emotionally respond to their surroundings are precursors of future friendship and increased social closeness.",

Electrophysiological studies in rodents have revealed critical roles of theta (4–12 Hz) oscillations in amygdala and hippocampus during both fear learning and extinction, and engram research has shown that extinction relies on the formation of novel, highly context-dependent memory traces that suppress the initial fear memories. Whether similar processes occur in humans and how they relate to previously described neural mechanisms of episodic memory formation and retrieval remains unknown. Intracranial EEG recordings in epilepsy patients provide direct access to the deep brain structures of the fear and extinction network, while representational similarity analysis allows characterizing the memory traces of specific cues and contexts. Here we combined these methods to show that amygdala theta oscillations during extinction learning signal safety rather than threat and that extinction memory traces are characterized by stable and context-specific neural representations that are coordinated across the extinction network. We further demonstrate that context specificity during extinction learning predicts the reoccurrence of fear memory traces during a subsequent test period, while reoccurrence of extinction memory traces predicts safety responses.

          "abstract": "Among the most significant modes of human creative expression is style: the capacity to represent objects, events and scenes (for example, lilies dotting a pond) in some distinctive manner (for example, Monet’s broken brushstrokes and blended colours). Diverse research traditions analyse the social, political and aesthetic significance of stylistic representation. But what are the cognitive and computational foundations of this capacity? Here we characterize style perception as a process that ‘parses’ form from content, and adapt classic psychophysical paradigms to discover multiple new phenomena of style perception. Using both naturalistic images and synthetic stimuli, ten experiments reveal perceptual ‘tuning’ to stylistic information, representational constancy over stylistic variation, and mental rendering of novel styled objects. Moreover, an object recognition model further grounds style perception by capturing human judgements of image similarity over different styles. Together, this work illuminates the psychological foundations of stylistic perception and opens the door to further investigation of styled media.",

          "abstract": "Authorities, from parents of toddlers to leaders of formal institutions, use punishment to communicate disapproval and enforce social norms. Ideally, from whether and how severely a transgression is punished, targets and observers infer shared social norms. Yet in light of every punitive choice, observers also evaluate the motives and legitimacy of the authority. Here, we show that the effects of punishment can only be understood by considering these inferences simultaneously. We measured human observers’ joint inferences empirically in three preregistered experiments ( N = 1 , 254 ) and developed a rational Bayesian model using an inverse planning framework that captures and explains these inferences and their interactions quantitatively and parsimoniously. When people have different priors about norms or authorities, the model predicted and we experimentally confirmed that observing punishment by the authority can sustain polarization. This work reveals the rational logic behind how people learn from punishment and a key constraint on the function of punishment in establishing shared social norms.",

          "abstract": "People and cultures differ in the extent to which they view the world as a zero-sum environment (where one person’s gain is another’s loss) or a positive-sum environment (where certain actions can benefit everyone). These beliefs shape individuals’ willingness to work, invest, collaborate, or show hostility toward out-groups, and accept or reject various social policies. We model dyadic interactions in a heterogeneous population where individuals biased toward a zero-sum worldview are more likely to invest in competition, while those biased toward a positive-sum worldview are more likely to invest in cooperation. The environment alternates stochastically between cooperative and competitive states. Without social influence, the more accurate worldview yields higher utilities and spreads throughout the population. However, assortative matching by bias can favor the positive-sum worldview even if a positive-sum environment is somewhat less likely. With peer conformity, inaccurate worldviews can persist after a structural change in the environment, leading to cultural evolutionary mismatch. In the presence of cultural authorities who can alter beliefs, either both worldviews can coexist or one excludes the other. Moreover, when assortative matching and conformity interact, authorities may profit by amplifying individuals’ biases, creating enclaves of similarly biased people who can pay the authorities enough to make investment in persuasive technology economically viable. Cultural evolutionary mismatch is more likely in cultures marked by strong peer conformity and high responsiveness to authority when the authority promotes a suboptimal worldview. This study demonstrates how real-world conditions, peer influence, and authority interventions can perpetuate or shift zero-sum and positive-sum worldviews-at times leading to inaccurate beliefs.",

          "abstract": "Science is characterized by collaboration and cooperation, but also by uncertainty, competition, and inequality. While there has always been some concern that these pressures may compel some to defect from the scientific research ethos—i.e., fail to make genuine contributions to the production of knowledge or to the training of an expert workforce—the focus has largely been on the actions of lone individuals. Recently, however, reports of coordinated scientific fraud activities have increased. Some suggest that the ease of communication provided by the internet and open-access publishing have created the conditions for the emergence of entities—paper mills (i.e., sellers of mass-produced low quality and fabricated research), brokers (i.e., conduits between producers and publishers of fraudulent research), predatory journals, who do not conduct any quality controls on submissions—that facilitate systematic scientific fraud. Here, we demonstrate through case studies that i) individuals have cooperated to publish papers that were eventually retracted in a number of journals, ii) brokers have enabled publication in targeted journals at scale, and iii), within a field of science, not all subfields are equally targeted for scientific fraud. Our results reveal some of the strategies that enable the entities promoting scientific fraud to evade interventions. Our final analysis suggests that this ability to evade interventions is enabling the number of fraudulent publications to grow at a rate far outpacing that of legitimate science.",

In this project, we leverage webcam-based eye-tracking to study cultural variations of cognitive processes underlying in-group favoritism. Participants (n = 1850, k = 20) are assigned to an in-group based on a color perception task, complete a group reinforcement stage, and then make decisions to allocate points between themselves and random matched players in a repeated decomposed dictator game, facing either an in- or an out-group member. During this task, we recorded eye-gaze with participants’ webcams. Results show substantial variation in behavioral in-group favoritism across cultures, linking discrimination based on group membership to higher societal uncertainty. Individual preferences for prosociality conditioned differences in visual search effort, but the directionality of the effect differs between countries. Individual-level predictors explained participants remaining colorblind toward others’ group membership, where society-level predictors did not. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of taking culture into account when assessing cognitive processes underlying behavior.

          "abstract": "What will it take to eliminate hunger in a world that is increasingly serious about climate change mitigation? For the past two decades, climate activism and mitigation efforts have largely focused on energy, industry, and transportation as the main contributors to anthropogenic warming. Although there is a long way to go to eliminate emissions from these sources, increasing international ambition means that attention is now turning to other hard-to-decarbonize sectors. Net zero food systems in particular pose unique challenges for humanity, given the moral dimensions of food security and the strong potential for vicious cycles: Globally hunger is back on the rise, the changing climate is already making food production for a growing population more difficult, and food shocks could lead to more land use change emissions that accelerate warming and feed back to negatively impact agricultural productivity and hunger. The dynamics of food production and consumption differ from other sectors and reveal several dimensions in which it will be critical to get policy right. Recent science suggests that two coordinated efforts will be needed to meet this challenge—a revamped focus on smallholder adaptation and productivity, and new “safety valve” institutions that sit at the intersection of food production and climate mitigation efforts and can operate at the relevant spatial and temporal scales to avoid negative tradeoffs in the quest to eliminate hunger and stabilize earth’s climate.",

          "abstract": "Identifying the influence of low-density Indigenous populations in paleofire records has been methodologically challenging. In the Southwest United States, well-replicated fire histories suggest that abundant lightning and suitable climate conditions drove frequent low-severity wildfires in dry pine forests independent of human activities even as ethnography provided hints that highly mobile indigenous populations used fire in myriad land use contexts. Here, we leverage published and unpublished tree-ring fire history records from pine forests in Western Apache (Ndee) traditional territory in central and eastern Arizona (N = 34 sites, N = 649 trees) to demonstrate that historical fire regimes were overwhelmingly influenced by Ndee cultural burning. Our tree-ring synthesis shows significantly more frequent fires in Ndee territory than elsewhere in the region for centuries before the establishment of reservations (1600–1870 CE). Despite the heightened fire activity, fires were largely small and asynchronous, occurred disproportionately in late April and May, when Ndee invested significant subsistence activities in these pine forests, and occurred independent of climate drivers. This suggests that Ndee fire stewardship created a patchwork of nearly annual small, spring fires that inhibited natural fire spread and limited the influence of drought on fire activity. Our work shows that even relatively small, highly mobile populations of forager-gardeners had significant influence on some pre-Euroamerican fire regimes despite abundant natural ignitions. Our study shows clearly that Indigenous fire management impacted fire-size distributions, fire frequencies, and fire seasonality in ways that cannot be explained by seasonal and annual lightning densities.",

AA-20 reduces polyglutamine aggregation in an autophagy-dependent manner in both human cells and C. elegans , where it also promotes fitness. Consistently, we found that AA-20 extends lifespan in WT C. elegans, but not in autophagy-deficient mutants. Interestingly, our findings suggest that AA-20 acts, at least in part, through a mechanism involving the transcription factor EB, but without inhibiting the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1.

          "abstract": "Topological states of matter, first discovered in quantum systems, have opened new avenues for wave manipulation beyond the quantum realm. In elastic media, realizing these topological effects requires identifying lattices that support the corresponding topological bands. However, among the vast number of theoretically predicted topological states, only a small fraction has been physically realized. To close this gap, we present a strategy capable of systematically and efficiently discovering metamaterials with desired topological state. Our approach builds on topological quantum chemistry, which systematically classifies topological states by analyzing symmetry properties at selected wavevectors. Because this method condenses the topological character into mathematical information at a small set of wavevectors, it encodes a clear and computationally efficient objective for topology optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that, for certain lattice symmetries, this classification can be further reduced to intuitive morphological features of the phonon band structure. By incorporating these band morphology constraints into topology optimization algorithms and further fabricating obtained designs, we enable the automated discovery and physical realization of metamaterials with targeted topological properties. This methodology establishes a paradigm for engineering topological elastic lattices on demand, addressing the bottleneck in material realization and paving the way for a comprehensive database of topological metamaterial configurations.",

          "abstract": "Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) results in spin polarization of electrons transmitted through chiral molecules and materials. Since CISS results in spin polarization even at room temperature, it affords the possibility of using it to develop quantum technologies that can operate under ambient conditions. We have shown previously that photo-driven hole transfer within DNA hairpins provides a facile route to generate spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs). To study the effect of CISS on the spin dynamics of SCRPs in DNA hairpins, we prepared a series of electron donor—chiral bridge—acceptor molecules where the chiral bridge is a B-form DNA helix consisting of 4 to 6 base pairs. Naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI) serves as the hairpin linker chromophore and electron acceptor. Photoexcitation of NDI results in rapid hole transfer through the π-stacked purine bases of the DNA and trapping of the hole on a terminal stilbene diether (Sd) to generate the NDI •− - Sd •+ SCRP. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the SCRPs at X- (9.6 GHz), Q- (34 GHz), and W- (94 GHz) bands show that the CISS effect imparts significant triplet character to the SCRP. We do not observe a significant dependence of CISS on DNA length, likely resulting from hole delocalization over the guanine bases in the G-tract. Interestingly, we find that the CISS contribution significantly increases with magnetic field strength. These findings should be considered in any future modeling of CISS.",

          "abstract": "Memory generalization allows an organism to adapt to new conditions, but overgeneralization of fear or traumatic experiences can be detrimental to survival and contributes to the development of various mental disorders. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fear memory generalization, especially in the hippocampus, remain largely unknown. In this study, utilizing a well-established mouse model of fear memory generalization, we investigated the role of endocannabinoids (eCBs)-mediated GABAergic synaptic inputs to hippocampal pyramidal neurons in regulating contextual fear memory generalization. Our results revealed that pharmacological or genetic blockade of CB1R in hippocampal CA1 resulted in overgeneralization of contextual fear memory but not fear memory expression. Subsequent investigations in conditional knockout mice revealed the involvement of CB1R in GABAergic neurons, but not those in glutamatergic neurons or astrocytes, in this overgeneralization. In addition, activation of GABA A receptors on pyramidal neurons was required for inducing overgeneralization via AM281, a CB1R antagonist. Neural mechanistic studies showed that eCBs/CB1R signaling regulates both the activity and plasticity of inhibitory synapses during generalization, highlighting the prominence of the disinhibition of CB1R in interneurons during this process. Subsequently, we delved into the downstream effects and found that eCB-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons was regulated by the aforementioned mechanisms. Our findings illustrate that the eCBs/CB1R signaling pathway modulates the balance between fear memory discrimination and generalization by controlling inhibitory inputs to hippocampal pyramidal neurons, accompanied by alterations in excitatory plasticity within this region.",

          "abstract": "HvAACT1 is a major aluminum (Al)-tolerance gene in barley, encoding a citrate transporter that belongs to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family. This transporter facilitates citrate secretion from the roots, thereby detoxifying external Al ions—a major constraint of crop production on acidic soils. In this study, we present the outward-facing crystal structure of HvAACT1, providing insights into a citrate transport mechanism. The putative citrate binding site consists of three basic residues—K126 in transmembrane helix 2 (TM2), R358 in TM7, and R535 in TM12—creating substantial positive charges in the C-lobe cavity. Proton coupling for substrate transport may involve two pairs of aspartate residues in the N-lobe cavity, one of which corresponds to the essential Asp pair found in prokaryotic H + -coupled MATE transporters belonging to the DinF subfamily. Structural coupling between proton uptake in the N-lobe and citrate extrusion in the C-lobe can be enabled by an extensive, unique hydrogen-bonding network at the extracellular half of the N-lobe. Mutation-based functional analysis, structural comparisons, molecular dynamics simulation, and phylogenic analysis suggest an evolutionary link between citrate MATE transporters and the DinF MATE subfamily. Our findings provide a solid structural basis for citrate transport by HvAACT1 in barley and contribute to a broader understanding of citrate transporter structures in other plant species.",

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRH PVN ) control both the neuroendocrine stress axis as well as stress-associated behaviors. However, it is currently unclear how the resting activity of these neurons is coordinated with both spontaneous behavior and ultradian pulses of corticosteroid secretion. To investigate this, we performed fiber photometry recordings of CRH PVN neuron activity in Crh-Ires-Cre mice and a newly generated line of Crh-Ires-Cre rats. In both mice and rats, CRH PVN neurons displayed an ultradian rhythm of activity with reoccurring upstates of activity approximately once per hour over the 24-h day. Upstates in activity were coordinated with increases in animal activity/arousal. Chemogenetic activation of CRH PVN neurons was also sufficient to induce behavioral arousal. In rats, increases in CRH neural activity preceded some pulses of corticosteroid secretion but not others. Thus, while CRH PVN neurons display an ultradian rhythm of activity over the 24-h day that is coordinated with behavioral arousal, the relationship between CRH PVN activity and pulses of corticosteroid secretion is not one-to-one.",

In the high-latitude regions of Northern Europe that are currently subject to rapid climate warming, we lack a comprehensive understanding of faunal biodiversity in the last glacial period due to the extreme rarity of preserved organic remains. Here, we present a stratified sediment deposit with a diverse faunal composition preserved in a bone-bearing layer in Arne Qvamgrotta, part of the Storsteinhola cave system (68.10° N 16.38° E) in Northern Norway. Chronological analyses of sediments and bones including radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence, uranium–thorium, and phylogenetic dating place the faunal assemblage in Marine Isotope Stage 5a (MIS 5a, Odderade interstadial, ~85 to 71 ka). Combining comparative osteology and bulk-bone metabarcoding, we identify 46 taxa, including mammals, birds, and fish, with several species not previously found in Fennoscandia. The fauna implies a nonanalogous cold-adapted coastal community, with close proximity to sea ice and nearby freshwater bodies. Mitogenome analyses of a subset of taxa identify extinct lineages which attest to a lack of habitat tracking and the absence of a local refugium during the subsequent fully glaciated periods. This faunal record demonstrates long-term faunal dynamics and coastal environmental conditions during MIS 5a in the European Arctic.",

Through a comparative study of CsV 3 Sb 5 and 2H-NbSe 2 , we demonstrate that the experimental absence of phonon softening—a hallmark of conventional CDW transition—in CsV 3 Sb 5 along with the presence of a weakly first-order transition, can be attributed to quantum zero-point atomic motion. This zero-point motion smears the free energy landscape of CDW, effectively stabilizing the pristine structure even below the CDW transition temperature. We argue that this surprising behavior could cause coexistence of pristine and CDW structures across the transition and lead to a weak first-order transition. Our predicted lattice dynamical behavior is supported by coherent phonon spectroscopy in single-crystalline CsV 3 Sb 5 . Our results provide crucial insights into the formation mechanism of CDW materials that exhibit little to no phonon softening, including cuprates, and highlight the surprising role of quantum effects in emergent properties of relatively heavy-element materials like CsV 3 Sb 5 .",

          "abstract": "The phage shock protein A (PspA), a bacterial member of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III superfamily, forms rod-shaped helical assemblies that internalize membrane tubules. The N-terminal helix α0 of PspA (and other ESCRT-III members) has been suggested to act as a membrane anchor; the detailed mechanism, however, of how it binds to membranes and eventually triggers membrane fusion and/or fission events remains unclear. By solving a total of 15 cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PspA and a truncation lacking the N-terminal helix α0 in the presence of Escherichia coli polar lipid membranes, we show in molecular detail how PspA interacts with and remodels membranes: Binding of the N-terminal helix α0 in the outer tubular membrane leaflet induces membrane curvature, supporting membrane tubulation by PspA. Detailed molecular dynamics simulations and free energy computations of interactions between the helix α0 and negatively charged membranes suggest a compensating mechanism between helix-membrane interactions and the energy contributions required for membrane bending. The energetic considerations are in line with the membrane structures observed in the cryo-EM images of tubulated membrane vesicles, fragmented vesicles inside tapered PspA rods, and shedded vesicles emerging at the thinner PspA rod ends. Our results provide insights into the molecular determinants and a potential mechanism of vesicular membrane remodeling mediated by a member of the ESCRT-III superfamily.",

          "abstract": "Insects are declining worldwide. These declines have been documented across taxonomic groups and are worrisome given ecosystem services provided by insects. Long-term data have illuminated butterfly declines across geographic regions. However, critical questions remain on how butterfly declines are distributed across species and functional groups, limiting effective conservation. Here, we show unprecedented changes in butterfly biodiversity resulting from 32 y of species levels declines throughout the Midwestern United States. No species increased over the three-decade study period and abundance declined across every functional group (e.g., rare, common, migratory, resident; annual mean trend: −0.9 to −2.3% per year). Species richness declined across all but one functional group, with concomitant increases in evenness (e.g., abundance among species) in several groups resulting from steeper losses in abundance for common species (abundance: −1.9% per year; richness: −0.04% per year) as compared to rare species (abundance: −0.9% per year; richness: −1.33% per year). Our results paint a bleaker picture than other butterfly studies likely due to our long time series of data and ability to include rare species. Such widespread declines undoubtedly affect other trophic levels and ecosystem services. Focusing risk assessments and management interventions only on rare species is likely to be insufficient given broad declines across species, which have fundamentally restructured butterfly communities in the region. As such, conservation efforts should shift focus to species assemblages and entire communities when possible.",

We previously reported that cancer cells can rapidly remodel their actin cytoskeleton upon NK cell engagement, leading to F-actin accumulation at the synapse. Here, we show that this process inhibits NK cell activation as indicated by impaired MTOC and lytic granule polarization. Exploring the underlying mechanism, we demonstrate that actin remodeling drives the recruitment of inhibitory ligands, such as HLA-A, -B, and -C, to the synapse. Disrupting HLA interaction with their cognate inhibitory receptors KIRs restores NK cell activation. Using NK cells expressing inhibitory KIR receptors, matched or unmatched to HLA molecules on cancer cells, we show that synaptic F-actin accumulation and matching KIR–HLA interactions jointly suppress NK cell cytotoxicity.

However, the origin of its protolith, whether it metamorphosed from an igneous or sedimentary precursor, remains debated. Here, we revisit this longstanding Akilia controversy using potassium isotope analyses, comparing Akilia samples with BIFs and black shales spanning the Eoarchean to Mesoproterozoic. Our results demonstrate that BIFs and black shales show systematic potassium isotope variations correlated with their potassium contents. Potassium-poor BIF layers display heavier isotopic compositions close to seawater values, whereas clay-rich layers exhibit elevated potassium contents and lighter isotopic signatures. The Akilia quartz-pyroxene rock was initially characterized by low potassium concentrations and heavy potassium isotopic compositions consistent with chemical sediments deposited from ancient seawater. It was subsequently modified by metasomatic fluids derived from nearby metamorphosed igneous rocks. These findings support a sedimentary origin for the Akilia quartz-pyroxene rock. Furthermore, our study provides an isotopic framework for interpreting ancient oceanic environments and offers insights into the potassium cycling and habitability of early Earth.",

While vaccines and several antiviral drugs are available, constant genetic changes vitiate these prevention and treatment options. Consequently, we decided to search for inhibitors against one of the virus’s validated drug targets, its M2 channel that is blocked by aminoadamantanes. Regrettably, widespread mutations in M2 abolish the antiflu activity of said blockers. Therefore, we devised bacteria-based genetic assays that can screen for drugs against aminoadamantane-sensitive and resistant M2 channels and map the resistance potential of any identifiable blocker. Subsequent in cellulo testing and structure–activity relationship studies yielded a synergistic combination of two compounds, Theobromine and Arainosine, that exhibited remarkable antiviral activity by directly inhibiting the virus’s channel. The drug duo was potent against H1N1 pandemic swine flu, H5N1 pandemic avian flu, and aminoadamantane-resistant and sensitive strains alike, exhibiting activity that surpassed oseltamivir, the leading antiflu drug on the market. When this drug duo was tested in an animal model, it once more outperformed oseltamivir, considerably reducing disease symptoms and viral RNA progeny. Importantly, harnessing the bacterial genetic selection, we could demonstrate that the drug duo’s potential for eliciting drug resistance is significantly smaller and molecularly distinct from that of aminoadamantanes. In conclusion, the outcome of this study represents a new potential treatment option for influenza alongside an approach that is sufficiently general and readily applicable to other viral targets.",

          "abstract": "Self-assembly (SA) plays a pivotal role in nanotechnology, offering cost-effective methods for bottom–up fabrication and providing versatile model systems for investigating fundamental interactions in various bioinspired systems. However, current methods for investigating and quantifying the dynamics of SA systems are limited in their applicability to planar interfaces, particularly in liquid environments. These methods typically rely on analyzing the collective behavior of particle suspensions rather than directly probing the specific interactions between individual particles. Here, we introduce Casimir self-assembly (CaSA) as a platform, integrating colloidal science, nanophotonics, and fluctuational electrodynamics to study long-range interactions and stability in planar SA systems. Using thermal fluctuations as a probe and visible-range Fabry–Pérot resonances as an optical readout, we demonstrate that CaSA enables a direct in situ study of the Casimir–Lifshitz electrostatic interaction. This approach allows us to map stability regimes of colloidal materials by varying ionic strength and identifying conditions for stable assembly and aggregation limits, and moreover is used to measure the surface charge density of an individual colloidal object down to fractions of an electron charge per square nanometer. Our platform overcomes the limitations of current methods, providing an experimental tool for exploring SA dynamics in situ and expanding the understanding of suspension stability in liquids at the single-particle level. With potential for future applications, CaSA is scalable for studying interfacial forces and is adaptable to multivalent electrolytes and biosensing.",

          "abstract": "The molecular origins of water’s anomalous properties have long been a subject of scientific inquiry. The liquid–liquid phase transition hypothesis, which posits the existence of distinct low-density and high-density liquid states separated by a first-order phase transition terminating at a critical point, has gained increasing experimental and computational support and offers a thermodynamically consistent framework for many of water’s anomalies. However, experimental challenges in avoiding crystallization near the postulated liquid–liquid critical point have focused attention to water’s canonical glassy states: low-density and high-density amorphous ice. Here, we use two Deep Potential machine-learning models, trained on the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed density functional and the highly accurate Many-Body Polarizable potential, to conduct an investigation of water’s glassy phenomenology based on quantum mechanical calculations. Despite not being explicitly trained on amorphous ices, both models accurately capture the structure and transformation of the water glasses, including their interconversion along different thermodynamic paths. Isobaric quenching of liquid water at various pressures generates a continuum of intermediate amorphous ices and density fluctuations increase near the liquid–liquid critical pressure. The glass transition temperatures of the amorphous ices produced at different pressures exhibit two distinct branches, corresponding to low-density and high-density amorphous ice behaviors, consistent with experiment and the liquid–liquid transition hypothesis. Extrapolating transformation pressures from isothermal compressions to experimental compression rates brings our simulations into excellent agreement with data. Our findings demonstrate that machine-learning potentials trained on equilibrium phases can effectively model nonequilibrium glassy behavior and pave the way for studying long-timescale, out-of-equilibrium processes with quantum mechanical accuracy.",

Spectroscopic techniques are instrumental in this identification process. The capacity of AI to establish the correlations between spectra and chemical substances renders it a suitable tool for spectra analysis. However, the presence of limited data, or even the absence of data, is a common occurrence for intermediates with transient characteristics. This poses a significant challenge in meeting the data requirements of AI models. Herein, we propose a generalizable machine learning model that utilizes zero-shot learning to identify chemical reaction intermediates by their spectra in unseen catalytic systems. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and visual dimensionality reduction, it was determined that the model’s superior generalizability is attributable to its capacity of learning common patterns of spectra-intermediates, effectively mapping disparate catalytic systems to analogous digital spaces. Therefore, the model can be directly used without fine-tuning parameters for unseen systems even in the presence of noise or solvents. This work demonstrates the application of zero-shot learning in machine learned spectroscopy and illustrates the prediction mechanism, providing a perspective for interpretable and robust cross-system prediction. It lays a solid foundation for the application of spectral descriptors in real reaction systems and the comprehension of chemical reaction mechanisms.",

To focus on the effect of elongated links, we introduce a minimal 3D model that helps us zoom into confined regions of these networks whose distant parts are sequentially connected by the random deposition of physical links with a very large aspect ratio. We show that the nonequilibrium kinetics at which these elongated links, or spaghetti, adhere to the available volume without mutual crossings is logarithmic in time, as opposed to the algebraic growth in lower dimensions for needle-like packings. We attribute this qualitatively different behavior to a delay in the activation of depletion forces caused by the 3D nature of the problem. Equally important, we find that this slow kinetics is metastable, allowing us to analytically predict the kinetic scaling characterizing an algebraic growth due to the nucleation of local bundles.

We here gathered genomic resources from 1,807 S. cerevisiae strains and assembled them into a high-quality pangenome, facilitating the comprehensive characterization of genetic diversity across isolates. Utilizing the pangenome, 1,807 strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models (ssGEMs) were generated, which performed well in quantitative predictions of cellular phenotypes, thus helping to examine the metabolic disparities among all S. cerevisiae strains. Integrative analyses of fluxomics and transcriptomics with ssGEMs showcased ubiquitous transcriptional regulation of metabolic flux in specific pathways (i.e., amino acid synthesis) at a population level. Additionally, the gene/reaction inactivation analysis through the ssGEMs refined by transcriptomics showed that S. cerevisiae strains from various ecological niches had undergone reductive evolution at both the genomic and metabolic network levels when compared to wild isolates. Finally, the compiled analysis of the pangenome, transcriptome, and metabolic fluxome revealed remarkable metabolic differences among S. cerevisiae strains originating from distinct oxygen-limited niches, including human gut and cheese environments, and identified convergent metabolic evolution, such as downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Together, these results illustrate how yeast adapts to distinct niches modulated by genomic and metabolic reprogramming, and provide computational resources for translating yeast genotype to fitness in future studies.",

However, there are several interactions whose biological relevance remains obscure, such as the ability of NS1 to bind and activate class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). PI3Ks are highly regulated lipid kinases that act as critical nodes in multiple cell signaling networks and are also important proto-oncogenes. This activation is mediated by NS1 binding specifically to the p85β subunit. To better understand the consequences of this interaction, we developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to selectively track the different PI3K heterodimers and, using this system, we found that NS1 induces an isoform-specific relocation and activation of the different PI3K heterodimers. We found that clinically relevant oncogenic mutations in both catalytic and regulatory subunits of PI3K could mimic the effect caused by NS1, and partially rescue the loss of viral fitness in a recombinant virus encoding a p85β-binding deficient NS1.",

To date, the only structurally characterized XSS is benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS), which functionalizes toluene. A distinct subclass of XSSs acts on saturated hydrocarbons, which possess much stronger C(sp 3 )–H bonds than toluene, suggesting mechanistic and structural differences from BSS. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of one such enzyme, (1-methylalkyl)succinate synthase (MASS) from Azoarcus strain HxN1, which functionalizes n -alkanes (C6–C8). The structure reveals an asymmetric dimer in which both sides contain a catalytic α-subunit and accessory γ-subunit. One α-subunit also binds two additional subunits, β and δ. The β-subunit binds a [4Fe–4S] cluster and adopts a fold similar to BSSβ. The β-subunit appears to regulate the flexibility of the α-subunit to enable opening of the active site, affording the binding of n -alkane substrates. The δ-subunit, which lacks homology to known GRE subunits, adopts a rubredoxin-like fold that binds a single Fe ion, an architecture not previously reported for GREs. MASSδ occupies the same region of the α-subunit as the activating enzyme (AE) and may regulate the conformational changes required for glycyl radical installation. Structural comparisons between MASS and BSS reveal differences in how fumarate is bound and show amino acid substitutions that could account for the binding of alkanes versus toluene. Together, this structure offers insight into anaerobic alkane activation via fumarate addition.",

To resist phages bacteria have evolved numerous defense systems, which nevertheless are still overcome by counterdefense mechanisms of specific phages. These defense/counterdefense systems are a major element of microbial genetic diversity and have been demonstrated to propagate between strains by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). It has been proposed that the totality of defense systems found in microbial communities collectively form a distributed “pan-immune” system with individual elements moving between strains via ubiquitous HGT. Here, we formulate a Lotka–Volterra type model of a bacteria/phage community interacting via a combinatorial variety of defense/counterdefense systems and show that HGT enables stable maintenance of diverse defense/counterdefense genes in the microbial pan-genome even when individual microbial strains inevitably undergo extinction. This stability requires the HGT rate to be sufficiently high to ensure that some descendant of a “dying” strain survives, thanks to the immunity acquired through HGT from the community at large, thus establishing a new strain. This mechanism of persistence for the pan-immune gene pool is fundamentally similar to the “island migration” model of ecological diversity, with genes moving between genomes instead of species migrating between islands.",

          "abstract": "During development, groups of cells generate shape by coordinating their mechanical properties through an interplay of self-organization and prepatterning. Hydra displays a striking planar pattern of actin fibers at the organism scale, and mechanics influence the morphogenesis of biological structures during its prepatterned regeneration. However, how mechanics participate in the formation of an ordered pattern from a totally disordered state remains unknown. To study this, we used cellular aggregates formed from dissociated Hydra cells, which initially lose all actin polarity yet regenerate a long-range actin pattern. We showed quantitatively that the actin meshwork evolves from a disordered symmetric state to an ordered state in which rotational symmetry is broken, and translation symmetry is partially broken, with the nematic and smectic order parameters increasing over days. During the first hours, the actin meshwork displayed spatial heterogeneity in the nematic order parameter, and ordered domains separated by line defects progressively grew and fused. This suggests that local cell–cell interactions drive the transition from disorder to order. To understand the mechanism of ordering, we perturbed the tissue’s physical constraints. We showed that while topology and geometry do not have a direct effect, anisotropic stretch biases the emerging orientation of the actin meshwork within hours. Surprisingly, although a Wnt head organizer is expected to play a role in the actin ordering, the stretch-associated alignment happened without the prior formation of a head organizer. This demonstrates the role of tissue mechanics in the alignment of the actin fibers during the disorder-to-order transition.",

          "abstract": "One of the most influential hypotheses about primate evolution postulates that their origin, radiation, and major dispersals were associated with exceptionally warm conditions in tropical forests at northern latitudes (henceforth the warm tropical forest hypothesis ). However, this notion has proven difficult to test given the overall uncertainty about both geographic locations and paleoclimates of ancestral species. By the resolution of both challenges, we reveal that early primates dispersed and radiated in higher latitudes, through diverse climates, including cold, arid, and temperate conditions. Contrary to expectations of the warm tropical forest hypothesis, warmer global temperatures had no effect on dispersal distances or the speciation rate. Rather, the amount of change in local temperature and precipitation substantially predicted geographic and species diversity. Our results suggest that nontropical, changeable environments exerted strong selective pressures on primates with higher dispersal ability – promoting the primate radiation and their subsequent colonization of tropical climates millions of years after their origin.",

At 64,331 bp of linear bisegmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA, PONV1 has one of the largest genomes reported for an RNA virus. Moreover, transcriptomic data reveal that many conspecific viruses of PONV1 occur in Pacific oysters from Europe and the Pacific coasts of Asia and North America. PONV1 (tentative species Megarnavirus gigas ) and its conspecific viruses represent a putative family, Megarnaviridae , that is widely divergent from other families of nidoviruses, and encodes protein domains likely involved in virus–host interaction that are undescribed for other nidoviruses.

However, the template RNA species that undergoes RAN translation endogenously remains unclear. Using long-read based 5′ RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′ Repeat-RLM-RACE), we identified C9orf72 transcripts initiating within intron 1 in a C9BAC mouse model, patient-derived iNeurons, and iNeuron-derived polysomes. These cryptic m 7 G-capped mRNAs are at least partially polyadenylated and are more abundant than transcripts derived from intron retention or circular intron lariats. In RAN translation reporter assays, intronic template transcripts–even those with short (32 nucleotide) leaders–exhibited robust expression compared to exon–intron and repeat-containing lariat reporters. To assess endogenous repeat-containing lariat RNA contributions to RAN translation, we enhanced endogenous lariat stability by knocking down the lariat debranching enzyme Dbr1. However, this modulation did not impact DPR production in patient-derived iNeurons. These findings identify cryptic, linear, m 7 G-capped intron-initiating C9orf72 mRNAs as an endogenous template for RAN translation and DPR production, with implications for disease pathogenesis and therapeutic development.",

Type II anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) inhibit and control Cas9 but are generally impermeable to the cell membrane due to their size and anionic charge. Moreover, existing Acr delivery methods are long-lived and operate within hours (e.g., viral and nonviral vectors) or require external devices (e.g., electroporation), limiting therapeutic applications. To address these problems, we developed a protein-based anti-CRISPR delivery platform, LF N -Acr/PA, which delivers Acrs into cells within minutes. LF N -Acr/PA is a nontoxic, two-component protein system derived from anthrax toxin, where protective antigen (PA) proteins bind receptors widespread in human cells, forming a pH-triggered endosomal pore that an engineered Acr (LF N -Acr) binds and uses to enter the cell. In the presence of PA, LF N -Acr enters human cells (e.g., immortalized cell lines, embryonic stem cells, and 3D cell cultures) at concentrations as low as 2.5 pM to inhibit up to 95% of Cas9-mediated knockout, knock-in, transcriptional activation, and base editing. Timing LF N -Acr delivery reduces off-target base editing and increases Cas9 specificity by 41%. LF N -Acr/PA is the most potent known cell-permeable CRISPR-Cas inhibition system, significantly improving the utility of CRISPR for genome editing.",

          "abstract": "Changes in oceanic circulation and carbon storage have been implicated as important drivers of atmospheric pCO 2 variability during the last glacial cycle (0 to 150 ka), though consensus on the mechanisms responsible remains elusive due to sparse marine carbonate chemistry reconstructions. Here, we present vertical profiles of carbonate ion concentration ([CO 3 2 − ]) from the Southwest Atlantic to investigate oceanic carbon sequestration during key intervals of atmospheric CO 2 change. During the first major decline in atmospheric CO 2 (115 to 109 ka), enhanced carbon storage occurred in the abyssal Atlantic (&gt;3,500 m water depth). During the second decline in CO 2 (72 to 68 ka), enhanced carbon storage occurred throughout the deep Atlantic (&gt;2,000 m water depth). Paired with δ 13 C and δ 18 O vertical profiles from the same locations, the [CO 3 2 − ] results suggest progressively greater sequestration of biological carbon occurred in the South Atlantic as the volume of Southern Source Water expanded during glacial inception. Shoaling of the carbonate ion saturation horizon during the second decline in pCO 2 resulted in seafloor calcium carbonate dissolution and enhanced alkalinity, likely contributing to further draw down of atmospheric CO 2 . We also document carbon release from the deep South Atlantic during glacial Terminations I and II when atmospheric CO 2 was rising. Overall, our results highlight the tight linkage between pCO 2 and deep Atlantic carbon storage over the last glacial cycle.",

          "abstract": "Air-breathing vertebrates incorporate a fraction of isotopically anomalous air O 2 in their body water. The 17 O isotope anomaly of air O 2 (expressed as Δ’ 17 O air ) is related to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations ( p CO 2 ) and gross primary production (GPP). Tooth enamel records the Δ’ 17 O of body water and can thus preserve such paleo- p CO 2 or paleo-GPP information over geological time periods. Here, we demonstrate the potential of respective reconstructions of atmospheric p CO 2 or GPP from the triple oxygen isotope composition of fossil dinosaur tooth enamel. The data from unaltered enamel samples, along with an assumed modern GPP t /GPP 0 ratio of 1 for the Mesozoic, suggest a mean Late Jurassic p CO 2 = 1,200 ± 150 ppmv and Late Cretaceous p CO 2 = 750 ± 200 ppmv. These estimates are in good agreement with other p CO 2 proxy data for the same time intervals. When utilizing a p CO 2 inferred from other proxies, tooth enamel Δ’ 17 O PO4 may also serve as a proxy for GPP. Using published p CO 2 data, we reconstructed GPP t /GPP 0 ratios with 1.20 ± 0.17 for the Late Jurassic and 2.24 ± 0.96 for the Late Cretaceous, which would imply a 20 to 120% higher GPP in the Mesozoic than today. Overall, triple oxygen isotope analysis of fossil teeth of terrestrial amniotes can provide insights into past atmospheric greenhouse gas content and global primary productivity.",

Through RNA-seq analysis of primary brain glial cells, we identified immune-responsive gene 1 ( Irg1 ) as one of the highly upregulated genes under inflammatory conditions. Validation in the spinal cords of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a preclinical MS model, confirmed elevated Irg1 levels in myeloid, CD4, and B cells in the EAE group, raising concerns as to whether Irg1 is detrimental or protective. Irg1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited severe EAE disease, increased mononuclear cell infiltration, and increased levels of triple-positive CD4+ T cells expressing IL17a, GM-CSF, and IFNγ. Adoptive transfer in Rag-1 KO and single-cell RNA sequencing highlighted the crucial role of Irg1 in shaping pathogenic Th17 cells. A lack of Irg1 in macrophages elevates Class II expression, promoting the polarization of myelin-primed CD4+ T cells into pathogenic Th17 cells via the NLRP3/IL-1β axis. Moreover, bone marrow chimeras revealed that immune cells lacking Irg1 maintained pathogenic and inflammatory phenotypes, suggesting its protective role in autoimmune diseases, including MS.",

Whether this functional coupling is universally conserved across eukaryotes is unclear. Here, we show using long read RNA sequencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that splicing inactivation does not result in widespread CPA impairment, and that inactivation of CPA has limited impact on splicing efficiency. The negative impact of CPA inactivation on splicing is mainly due to transcription termination defects that promote readthrough transcription, leading to splicing inhibition for downstream intron-containing genes. The deleterious effect of 5′ extensions on splicing is length-dependent and can be detected independently from CPA inactivation for endogenous or synthetic genes. Deficient termination can also promote usage of cryptic splice sites and long-range intergenic splicing events. These results argue against a broad coupling between splicing and CPA in S. cerevisiae but show that efficient CPA-mediated transcription termination is critical for splicing fidelity and efficiency in a compact genome.",

          "abstract": "DNA loop extrusion by cohesin has emerged as a critical pathway for chromosome organization. In vitro single-molecule experiments indicate that loop extrusion requires the assembly of a heteropentameric complex consisting of the SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer, STAG1, NIPBL, and the kleisin SCC1. The complexity of the complete extrusion machinery, consisting of multiple subunits, DNA binding sites, and ATPases poses substantial challenges for revealing the underlying biomolecular mechanism. As a result, a number of different models have been proposed, many of which do not agree on key mechanistic aspects, such as the details of DNA loading, holoenzyme assembly, or the consequences of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Here, we use mass photometry to comprehensively quantify all the key biomolecular interactions required for DNA loop extrusion. We find that STAG1 binds tightly to the trimeric complex formed by the SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer and SCC1, and together they weakly, but cooperatively, bind the DNA. Full-length NIPBL tightly binds DNA, acting as a DNA anchor during the mechanochemical loop extrusion cycle. Cohesin mutants incapable of head engagement, and those lacking DNA-binding domains in the ATPase heads show negligible differences in overall DNA-affinity, suggesting a minor role of these features for DNA binding. Instead, we find an ATP-modulated DNA binding site created by the interaction of STAG1 with SMC1/SMC3/SCC1, important for repeated grabbing and release of DNA critical to extrusion. Our results call for a careful reexamination of the proposed mechanisms and set energetic boundaries for future proposals.",

Here, we demonstrate this link for the important problem of thermal convection. We show how the hierarchical plume network in the near-wall region of the flow, which becomes increasingly sparse with increasing distance away from the wall, is connected to the marginal stability of the thermal boundary layer and the resulting global heat transport. Our results, which are based on a series of direct numerical simulations for Rayleigh numbers up to R a = 10 11 in a relatively shallow layer, suggest a highly fluctuating thermal boundary layer that is composed of local building blocks in terms of plumes, which are the essential drivers of turbulent heat transport. These thermal plumes are found in a dynamically perpetual process of formation and aggregation that can be described, particularly well for Rayleigh numbers R a ≳ 10 9 , by a von Smoluchowski equation resulting in a gamma distribution of the local plume spacing, consistent with measurements. Similarity manifests with respect to the horizontal extension of the network, the vertical hierarchical plume clustering away from the wall and the number of plumes, over an order of magnitude of the thermal boundary layer thickness. Our findings suggest the dominance of dynamical local processes near the wall, rather than a global boundary layer instability.",

As expected, effector CD8 T cells at day 14 express CD45RO but within 4 to 6 wk these virus-specific CD8 T cells become CD45RA positive and remain CD45RA for &gt;10 y. The journey for these YFV-specific CD8 T cells goes from naive (CD45RA+ CCR7+) to effector/effector memory (CD45RO+ CCR7−) to Temra (CD45RA+ CCR7−) to stem-cell memory (CD45RA+ CCR7+). These YFV-specific CD8 T cells rarely acquire the canonical Tcm phenotype (CD45RO+ CCR7+). This CD45RO to RA switch coincides with clearance of YFV, so we hypothesized that antigen may be playing a role in regulating CD45 expression. We addressed this issue by ex vivo analysis and provide evidence that this switch is indeed regulated by antigen. Sorted YFV-specific CD45RO effector CD8 T cells reexpress CD45RA when cultured ex vivo in the absence of antigen and retain CD45RO in the presence of cognate peptide. We also extended these ex vivo analysis to human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD8 T cells and show that CD45RO cells transition to CD45RA in the absence of antigen and CD45RA cells become CD45RO when stimulated with CMV peptide. We then show that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike-specific CD8 T cells can repeatedly undergo the same CD45RA to RO to RA transition in vivo after the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Again, the canonical Tcm phenotype spike-specific memory CD8 T cells were not readily detectable. These studies warrant a reevaluation of how human memory CD8 T cells are defined.",

Inside the protein matrix, chromophore nonplanarity and flexibility have long been argued to govern the fluorescence efficiency of FPs, yet their fundamental roles and relative importance have been elusive which hinder the rational design of versatile FPs and biosensors. Herein, we tackle this central question by investigating two recently engineered FP-based turn-on chloride (Cl – ) sensors, ChlorON1 and 3, using an ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopic toolset together with advanced multireference simulations for both structure and spectrum. We elucidate that fluorescence enhancement of the chloride-bound ChlorON3 stems from a substantially more twisted chromophore than ChlorON1 via comprehensive simulations starting from the available crystal structure of parent protein (mNeonGreen), also featuring an enhanced radiative pathway due to an adjacent leucine residue in the emissive population. This finding indicates that the commonly stated chromophore planarity is not, but conformational rigidity is, the decisive factor for high fluorescence efficiency. Such mechanistic insights into FPs are generalizable to chromoproteins and other photosensitive biomolecules, which can facilitate the targeted design of brighter and/or tunable biosensors.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is the origin of a novel tissue that attracts resources, spreads beyond boundaries, avoids normal controls, and escapes immunity. How does a novel tissue arise? The puzzle is that two seemingly different processes appear to be the primary driving force. On the one hand, overwhelming evidence links (epi)genetic driver mutations to the origin and progression of tumors. Common oncogenic mutations such as KRAS accelerate cell division, and common knockouts of tumor suppressors such as TP53 abrogate cell death or checks on cell division. On the other hand, cancerous tissues create complex traits that require intricate changes in cells and multiple interactions between different cell types. Such novelty often arises by hijacking the developmental plasticity that normally creates the diverse cells and tissues of our bodies from a single original zygotic cell. How can we reconcile the simple genetic changes in carcinogenesis with the complex developmental plasticity that creates novel tissues? This perspective advocates a new model. (Epi)genetic mutations release developmental plasticity. That developmental plasticity creates novel cellular interactions and complex tissues. Initially, novel traits created by developmental plasticity may not be stably heritable, thus subsequent (epi)genetic changes must stabilize the phenotypic novelty. Recent studies show how classic oncogenic and tumor suppressor driver mutations, such as KRAS and TP53 , may primarily act in early carcinogenesis as broad releasers of developmental plasticity rather than as stimulators of cell division or knockout of limitations on cellular clonal expansion. In the new model, genetics releases, plasticity creates, and genetics stabilizes.",

          "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning causes 50,000 to 100,000 emergency department visits and ~1,500 deaths in the United States annually. Current treatments are limited to supplemental and/or hyperbaric oxygen to accelerate CO elimination. Even with oxygen therapy, nearly half of CO poisoning survivors suffer long-term cardiac and neurocognitive deficits related to slow CO clearance, highlighting a need for point of care antidotal therapies. Given the natural interaction between CO and ferrous heme, we hypothesized that the hemoprotein RcoM, a transcriptional regulator of microbial CO metabolism, would make an ideal platform for CO-selective scavenging from endogenous hemoproteins. We engineered an RcoM truncate (RcoM-HBD-CCC) that exhibits high CO affinity ( K a,CO = 2.8 × 10 10 M −1 ), remarkable selectivity for CO over oxygen ( K a,O2 = 1.4 × 10 5 M −1 ; K a,CO / K a,O2 = 1.9 × 10 5 ), thermal stability (T m = 72 °C), and slow autoxidation rate ( k ox = 1.1 h −1 ). In a murine model of acute CO poisoning, infused RcoM-HBD-CCC accelerated CO clearance from hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs) and was rapidly excreted in urine. Moreover, infused RcoM-HBD-CCC elicited minimal hypertension in mice compared to infused globins (hemoglobin, myoglobin, and neuroglobin), attributed to a comparatively limited reactivity toward nitric oxide (NO) via dioxygenation [ k NOD (RcoM) = 6 to 8 × 10 6 M −1 s −1 vs k NOD (Hb) = 6 to 8 × 10 7 M −1 s −1 ]. These data suggest that RcoM-HBD-CCC is a safe, selective, and efficacious CO scavenger. By limiting hypertension through minimal NO scavenging, RcoM-HBD-CCC improves end-organ adverse effects compared with other hemoprotein-based therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Neurons rely on spatial and temporal control of protein synthesis to respond rapidly and locally to external stimuli, a process facilitated by the dynamic localization and modification of ribosomes. While previous research has shown that neuronal activity can regulate ribosome localization and modify translation rates, little is known about ribosomal assembly within neuronal processes. Here, we investigated the potential for local ribosome maturation in rat neurons using proteomics, RNA sequencing, and imaging methods. We detected an abundance of ribosome biogenesis factors in distal neuronal compartments, particularly those associated with the late stages of ribosome assembly. Moreover, we detected cytosolic pre-ribosomal RNA species in dendrites, as well as the enzymes necessary for their processing, suggesting that local ribosome maturation can occur far from the nucleus. These findings challenge conventional models that confine ribosome biogenesis to nuclear and perinuclear regions and suggest that neurons may fine-tune local protein synthesis by regulating ribosome assembly near synaptic sites. This mechanism may enable rapid modulation of the translational capacity in response to physiological changes, regulating synaptic plasticity and local protein synthesis in neurons.",

The basal ganglia (BG) and cerebellum (CBL) are integral for processing performance outcomes, yet their functional interactions remain underexplored. We scanned participants’ brains with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) while they performed a skilled motor task for monetary rewards, where outcomes depended on their motor performance and probabilistic events that were not contingent on their performance. Successful motor outcomes increased activity in the ventral striatum (VS), a functional subregion of the BG, whereas unsuccessful motor outcomes engaged the CBL. In contrast, for probabilistic outcomes unrelated to motor performance, the BG and CBL exhibited no differences in activity between successful and unsuccessful outcomes. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that VS-to-CBL connectivity was inhibitory following successful motor outcomes, suggesting that the VS may suppress CBL error processing for correct actions. Conversely, CBL-to-VS connectivity was inhibitory after unsuccessful motor outcomes, potentially preventing reinforcement of erroneous actions. Additionally, interindividual differences in task preference, assessed by having participants choose between performing the motor task or flipping a coin for monetary rewards, were related to inhibitory VS-CBL connectivity. These findings highlight a performance-mediated functional network between the VS and CBL, modulated by motivation and subjective preferences, that supports goal-directed behavior.",

          "abstract": "Obtaining predictive models of a neural system is notoriously challenging. Detailed models suffer from excess model complexity and are difficult to fit efficiently. Simplified models must negotiate a tradeoff between tractability, predictive power, and ease of interpretation. We present a modeling paradigm for estimating predictive, mechanistic models of neurons and small circuits that navigates these issues using methods from systems theory. The key insight is that membrane currents can be modeled using two scalable system components optimized for learning: linear state space models, and nonlinear artificial neural networks. Combining these components, we construct two types of membrane currents: lumped currents, which are flexible, and data-driven conductance-based currents, which are interpretable. The resulting class of models—which we call recurrent mechanistic models (RMMs)—can be trained in a matter of seconds to minutes on intracellular recordings during an electrophysiology experiment, representing a step change in performance over previous approaches. As a proof-of-principle, we use RMMs to learn the dynamics of two groups of neurons, and their synaptic connections, in the Stomatogastric Ganglion, a well-known central pattern generator. Due to their reliability, efficiency, and interpretability, RMMs enable qualitatively new kinds of experiments using predictive models in closed-loop neurophysiology and online estimation of neural properties in living preparations.",

The disorder features severely thickened, red, and scaly skin at sites of wound healing or repetitive movement including on the face, genitals, flexural areas, and the palms and soles. EMP2 has previously been shown to directly associate with focal adhesion kinase, which links cell junction forces to signaling pathways relevant to proliferation, migration, and wound healing. Using single-cell spatial transcriptomics in affected tissue, we found ectopic suprabasal activation of signaling pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which we confirmed with western blotting in affected cells, supporting a gain-of-function mechanism for mutant EMP2. Remarkably, treatment with erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, led to marked clinical improvement underscoring the key role of EMP2 in epidermal differentiation and proliferation.",

          "abstract": "Sleep promotes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange in the brain facilitated by brain pulsations. Especially brain vasomotion and arterial pulsations modulated by noradrenaline drive the intracranial fluid dynamics. Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) entails lessened orexinergic output to wake-promoting systems including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus. As arousal state and noradrenergic signaling affect CSF-ISF clearance, we chose patients with NT1 as a human orexin-targeted model of sleep-related pathology bridging the gap between healthy awake and sleep with respect to CSF flow pulsations. We also investigated the sensitivity of magnetic resonance encephalography to detect flow with a phantom model and sought to replicate earlier pulsation findings in sleep. In this case–control study, we used fast functional MRI to map brain pulsations in groups of healthy sleeping controls (n = 13), healthy awake controls (n = 79), and awake NT1 (n = 21) patients. We measured the very low frequency (0.008 to 0.1) and cardiorespiratory frequencies and calculated in each frequency band the coefficient of variation, spectral power, and full band spectral entropy to obtain brain pulsation maps. We uncovered a brain pulsation profile from healthy waking to sleep to a sleep-related pathology NT1 prominently affected in the vascular-related vasomotor and brain arterial pulsations. Our results established how drivers of brain hydrodynamics are affected by a specific loss of key neurotransmitter governing arousal compared to healthy sleep. We also showed with a phantom model that MREG is sensitive to flow-related signal changes and solidified evidence of brain pulsations in the healthy states of sleep and wakefulness.",

Here, we focus on the white shark, for which female philopatry has been previously proposed, and produced a chromosome-level genome, high-coverage whole-genome autosomal, and uniparental datasets to investigate mitonuclear discordance. We first reconstructed the historical population demography of the species based on autosomal data. We show that this species once comprised a single panmictic population, which experienced a steady decline until recent times when it fragmented into at least three main autosomal genetic groups. Mitochondrial data depict a strikingly different picture, inconsistent with the spatial distribution of autosomal diversity. Using the demographic scenario established from autosomal data, we performed coalescent and forward simulations to test for the occurrence of female philopatry. Coalescent simulations showed that the model can reproduce the autosomal variability, confirming its robustness. A forward simulation framework was further built to explicitly account for a sex-biased reproduction model and track both autosomal and uniparental markers (Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA). While our model generates data that are consistent with the observed Y chromosome variation, the mitochondrial pattern is never reproduced even under extreme female philopatry (no female migration), strongly suggesting that demography alone cannot explain the mitonuclear discordance. Our framework could, and perhaps should, be extended to other shark species where philopatry has been suggested. It is possible that the proposed widespread occurrence of female philopatry in sharks should be revisited.",

This substitution reduces the stability of the enzyme, but what functional consequences it has are unknown. Here, we show that when introduced into mice, this substitution causes substrates of the enzyme to accumulate in amounts that correlate negatively with ADSL expression levels. In the brain, where the expression of the enzyme is low, the substitution results in particularly high substrate levels. When the behavior of the mice is analyzed, female mice expressing the modern human-like version of ADSL access water more efficiently for drinking than their wild-type littermates. In addition to the amino acid substitution, a haplotype in the ADSL gene occurs at a carrier frequency of &gt;97% in present-day humans and exhibits evidence of positive selection. It is associated with less ADSL expression as well as with increased concentrations of succinyladenosine, one of the substrates of the enzyme, in cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, two genetic changes have reduced ADSL activity in human tissues since modern and archaic humans separated, affecting purine biosynthesis, particularly in the brain.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the impact of glycoform alterations on the dynamic structure of the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc region using integrated computational and experimental approaches. Four distinct IgG1-Fc glycoforms, varying in core fucosylation and nonreducing terminal galactosylation, were generated through a combination of cell engineering and in vitro enzymatic reactions. Stable-isotope-assisted NMR spectroscopy, incorporating both glycan and protein signals, revealed that galactosylation induces chemical shift perturbations extending from the glycan–protein interface to the C H 2–C H 3 domain boundary. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the absence of galactose enhances the mobility of both the glycan and the C H 2 domain, broadening the conformational landscape of the Fc quaternary structure. This increased flexibility likely contributes to a greater entropic penalty upon binding to effector molecules, which constrain the Fc in an asymmetric conformation. Conversely, the effects of fucosylation are more localized, primarily influencing the dynamics of residues involved in Fcγ receptor IIIa binding. These findings provide atomic-level insights into the distinct yet synergistic mechanisms by which galactosylation and fucosylation modulate IgG1-Fc dynamics and effector functions, offering crucial information for the optimization of therapeutic antibodies.",

We tested the hypothesis that such conflicts in multiseeded fruits can be reduced if seeds are sired by a single pollen parent. We conducted a meta-analysis of paternity in 63 species across diverse plant families to assess paternity within fruits. Our results reveal that almost 50% of flowering plant species with multiseeded fruits have a single pollen parent. Our results question the prevailing notion that multiple paternity of seeds within fruits is widespread, especially when, in addition to single paternity in multiseeded fruits, a large number of species have single-seeded fruits. We provide insights into the role of sibling rivalry and kin selection in driving genetic relatedness of seeds within fruits.

Although directed movement on the molecular scale has been achieved, using it to impose specific—especially energetically disfavored—shapes on molecules and construct mechanically interlocked structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this study, we report the synthesis of a catenane enabled by a molecular motor that winds molecular strands into discrete entangled structures, each defined by a specific number of mechanical crossings. Light energy drives unidirectional motor rotation, enabling path-dependent control over a sequence of thermodynamically disfavored yet mechanically distinct and kinetically stable winding states, which are covalently captured and subsequently released to yield a catenane. This machine-directed approach offers a general proof-of-concept strategy for the template-free construction of mechanically interlocked molecules.",

          "abstract": "Marine systems are rapidly changing in response to global heating. The scale and intensity of change are triggering a host of novel interventions to sustain oceans and ocean-dependent societies. However, the pace of new interventions is outstripping capacity to prevent unintended consequences because governance systems to ensure responsible transformation of marine systems are not yet in place. Responsible transformation entails transitioning marine systems to sustainable, equitable, and adaptive states through weighing intervention risks against benefits, resolving ethical liabilities, improving social cobenefits, establishing legitimacy, and managing climate policy integrity. Global, national, and local actors must urgently convert responsible transformation principles into rules—and practice—to ensure that novel marine-climate interventions are safe, equitable, and effective.",

          "abstract": "The heavy fermion material UTe 2 is a candidate topological superconductor that exhibits multiple magnetic field–induced superconducting phases. One such phase exists only at fields greater than 40 tesla, a considerable scale given its critical temperature of only 2 K. Here, we extend measurements of this state with fields outside of the bc crystallographic plane and reveal its core structure: The superconducting phase wraps around the b axis in a halo-like fashion and appears to be stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. This angle dependence points to a multicomponent spin-triplet order parameter with a finite angular momentum of the Cooper pairs. The pairing mechanism remains enigmatic, and UTe 2 ’s specific magnetophilic superconducting tendencies seem incompatible with existing models for field-enhanced superconductivity.",

This enzymatic platform integrates a range of asymmetric catalysis principles, including remote stereocenter construction, stereodivergent catalysis, kinetic resolution and parallel kinetic resolution, achieving excellent diastereo- and enantiocontrol over radical intermediates.

Surface acoustic waves were then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the gigahertz regime. We observed evidence that the surface acoustic waves produced mechanical deformations in the polymer and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics led to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning.

          "abstract": "Increasing drought pressure under anthropogenic climate change may jeopardize the potential of tropical forests to capture carbon in woody biomass and act as a long-term carbon dioxide sink. To evaluate this risk, we assessed drought impacts in 483 tree-ring chronologies from across the tropics and found an overall modest stem growth decline (2.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 2.2 to 2.7%) during the 10% driest years since 1930. Stem growth declines exceeded 10% in 25% of cases and were larger at hotter and drier sites and for gymnosperms compared with angiosperms. Growth declines generally did not outlast drought years and were partially mitigated by growth stimulation in wet years. Thus, pantropical forest carbon sequestration through stem growth has hitherto shown drought resilience that may, however, diminish under future climate change.",

Detecting behavioral drive in the fossil record is challenging because it is difficult to measure behaviors independently from corresponding morphologies. To solve this problem, we focused on a puzzling behavior in the fossil record of some primates: eating graminoid plants. We report carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from fossil cercopithecid monkeys and integrate the data into a view of hominin dietary evolution, finding that changes in graminivorous behavior preceded corresponding changes in dental morphology by ~700,000 years. Decoupling diets and morphologies in time was conducive to determining when and to exploring why dietary changes helped to propel human evolution.",

Using 35 years of satellite data, we show that in the Northern Hemisphere, between −15° and −30°C, dust aerosol is strongly correlated with ITF in both time and space. Furthermore, we found that the sensitivities of ITF to temperature and dust are in a ratio that agrees with laboratory measurements of droplet freezing, showing that ITF can be attributed to dust aerosol.",

Here, we used convergent evolutionary changes in hibernating lineages to define conserved cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and metabolic programs. We characterized mouse hypothalamus gene expression and chromatin dynamics across fed, fasted, and refed states and then used comparative genomics of hibernating versus nonhibernating lineages to identify cis elements with convergent changes in hibernators. Multi-omics approaches pinpointed CREs, hub genes, regulatory programs, and cell types underlying lineage divergence. Hibernators accumulated loss-of-function effects for CREs regulating hypothalamic responses, and the refeeding period after fasting served as a key phase for molecular processes with convergent evolutionary changes.

To understand the origin of these hallmarks, we studied the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome in the brain of short-lived killifish. We identified a cascade of events in which aberrant translation pausing led to altered abundance of proteins independently of transcriptional regulation. In particular, aging caused increased ribosome stalling and widespread depletion of proteins enriched in basic amino acids. These findings uncover a potential vulnerable point in the aging brain’s biology—the biogenesis of basic DNA and RNA binding proteins. This vulnerability may represent a unifying principle that connects various aging hallmarks, encompassing genome integrity, proteostasis, and the biosynthesis of macromolecules.",

However, the Schottky gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. We used a ferroic HfO 2 - ZrO 2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway for improved performance in transistors based on 2DEG.",

However, the central mechanisms underlying mitochondrial gene expression remain enigmatic, and a lack of suitable technologies to target mitochondrial protein synthesis in cells has limited experimental access. We silenced the translation of specific mitochondrial mRNAs in living human cells by delivering synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras. This approach allowed us to perform a comprehensive temporal monitoring of cellular responses. Our study provides insights into mitochondrial translation, its integration into cellular physiology, and provides a strategy to address mitochondrial gene expression in living cells. The approach can potentially be used to analyze mechanisms and pathophysiology of mitochondrial gene expression in a range of cellular model systems.",

          "abstract": "The nature and spectrum of elementary excitations are defining features of a many-body system. In this study, we used a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, that probes these low-energy excitations. We illustrated the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extracted the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings. The ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves, whereas in the antiferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities. Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the excitation spectrum of a many-body system.",

          "abstract": "Waiting in a line (or a queue) is an unavoidable social interaction that occurs frequently in public spaces. Despite its wide prevalence and rich parametric variability, few studies have addressed the risks of airborne infection while waiting in a line. Here, we use a combination of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations to assess the flow patterns in a simplified waiting line setting. From observations of the transport of breath-like expulsions, we reveal the presence of fluid dynamical counter-currents —due to the competing effects of line kinematics and thermal gradients. Depending on the walking speed, an intermediate temperature range can potentially heighten the infection risks by allowing the breath plume to linger; however, colder and warmer ambients both suppress the spread. Current guidelines of increasing physical separation appear to have a limited impact on reducing aerosol transmission. This work highlights the need for updated transmission mitigation guidelines in settings where physical separation, interaction duration, and periodicity of movements are factors.",

We applied two-stage time-series analysis to 6.54 million CVD hospitalizations across six countries/territories (Canada, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) between 2000 and 2019 to quantify the long-term risks and burden of CVD hospitalizations following TCs. Hospitalization risks for cause-specific CVDs consistently increased following TC exposure, generally peaking around 2 months postexposure and dissipating by 6 months. Overall, each additional TC day was associated with a 13% (95% confidence interval, 7 to 19%) increase in CVD hospitalizations in 6 months following TCs. Particularly high TC-attributable burden was found for ischemic heart diseases and stroke, especially among males, individuals aged 20 to 59 years, and those with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation. The TC-attributable proportions of CVD hospitalizations showed decreasing trends in less deprived populations and increasing trends in more deprived populations from 2000 to 2019.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of sedentary farming economies, especially in contexts intensified by plow agriculture, has been argued to underpin marked increases in economic inequality and its intergenerational transmission across Eurasia. To assess this presumed causal relationship, we examine relational (burials) and material (house sizes) inequalities in the Carpathian Basin, a large region in central Europe, from the time the first farmers arrived in southeastern Europe through the next five millennia to the Bronze Age. We find that although farming did increase the potentials for both relational and material inequalities, the potential was rarely reached and then only for short durations. We identify a series of leveling mechanisms varying over time, including the removal of material wealth from circulation through the placement in graves, community fission, and investments of surplus labor in infrastructural investments. In the Carpathian Basin, only after at least 5000 years were the intergenerational potentials of material wealth transmissions more broadly realized.",

To address this challenge, we tested a social drive hypothesis, which predicts that social plasticity and social selection in human groups cause indirect genetic effects that accelerate the adaptation of fitness, promoting population growth via feedback between the environmental causes and evolutionary consequences of cooperation. Using Bayesian multilevel models to analyze fertility data from a small-scale society, we demonstrate that density- and frequency-dependent indirect genetic effects on fitness promote the evolution of cooperation among neighboring women, increasing the rate of contemporary adaptation by ~5×. Our results show how interactions between the genetic and socioecological processes shaping cooperation in reproduction can drive rapid growth and social evolution in human populations.",

          "abstract": "Increased temperature-related mortality is expected to significantly contribute to future economic damages from climate change, with declines in cold-related deaths outweighed by increases in heat-related deaths. While temperature-mortality relationships are well-documented, the effects of climate change on morbidity are less understood. Using data on emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, mortality, and daily temperatures across California from 2006 to 2017, we find distinct differences in the temperature-response functions of these health outcomes, influenced by age distribution and underlying causes of morbidity and mortality. These differential responses fundamentally shape the burden of future climate change: We project that while future warming will increase ED visits, mortality will decrease due to fewer cold extremes. These results underscore the need to quantify temperature-morbidity responses to fully understand and anticipate the health impacts of climate change and suggest that local declines in mortality due to warming can mask economically meaningful increases in temperature-driven morbidity and health care utilization.",

Given the number of subsistence crises in medieval England, this study uses stable isotopic, demographic, and paleopathological data from human skeletal remains ( n  = 275) to assess associations between early-life nutritional stress and health outcomes before, during, and after the Black Death in London and rural Lincolnshire approximately 1000 to 1540 CE. Our results suggest that survivors of early-life nutritional stress were resilient with respect to causes of death in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. Ultimately, however, early-life nutritional stress was associated with the presence of skeletal biomarkers of stress and elevated mortality in middle and late adulthood in the medieval period, consistent with models from developmental biology. We find that the prevalence of nutritional stress increased before the Black Death and decreased afterward. Understanding the long-term consequences of early-life nutritional stress can offer insights on the health trajectories of historical populations.",

          "abstract": "Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) is receiving increasing attention as a target for universal flu vaccines. Several broad NA inhibition monoclonal antibodies (BImAbs) targeting the highly conserved enzymatic pocket have been previously described. However, the molecular characteristics, clonal evolutionary trajectory, and B cell sources of BImAbs remain poorly understood. Here, using NA-mutant probes, we comprehensively profiled the immune signatures of NA-specific memory B cells (MBCs) from a healthy individual with NA cross-inhibition activity. From the NA-specific MBC repertoires, we identified a series of NA BImAbs with molecular features characterized by long HCDR3 regions with an “xxxDRxxx” motif, which exhibited broad inhibition against diverse influenza NAs. Clonal lineage tracing revealed that BImAbs followed a clonal evolutionary trajectory encompassing classical MBC (cMBC) and atypical MBC (aMBC). Both cMBC- and aMBC-derived BImAbs displayed similar inhibition against influenza NA. These findings enhance our understanding of the development of NA BImAbs and provide a foundation for the rational design of NA-based universal flu vaccines.",

Experimental demonstrations of such a phenomenon using quantum entangled states are among the landmark experiments of modern physics and paved the way for quantum technology. Here, we report the violation of the Bell inequality that cannot be described by quantum entanglement in the system but arises from quantum indistinguishability by path identity, shown by the multiphoton frustrated interference. By analyzing the measurement of four-photon frustrated interference within the standard Bell-test formalism, we find a violation of Bell inequality by more than four SDs. Our work establishes a connection between quantum correlation and quantum indistinguishability, providing insights into the fundamental origin of the counterintuitive characteristics observed in quantum physics.",

How SWR1 is directed to the flanking acetylated +1 nucleosome, its physiological substrate, has been enigmatic. We show by live-cell, single-molecule tracking that SWR1 subunits Bdf1 and Yaf9 harboring histone acetylation reader domains differentially regulate chromatin binding: Bdf1 promotes SWR1 association, while Yaf9-YEATS slows its dissociation. Notably, single-molecule tracking and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with exonuclease treatment reveal Bdf1 and Yaf9 contributions to global SWR1 targeting and histone exchange at +1 nucleosomes. Our findings highlight the in-cell biochemistry of histone readers and suggest a generalizable, two-stage mechanism wherein acetylated nucleosome interactions initially constrain the three-dimensional diffusion of SWR1 to increase local concentration, followed by stochastic one-dimensional diffusion at nucleosome-depleted regions with directional capture by acetylated +1 nucleosomes.",

Here, we experimentally demonstrate surface acoustic wave control using a hyperuniform arrangement of gold nanopillars on a lithium niobate layer. The hyperuniform structure, exhibiting characteristics of both random and ordered systems, leads to broad-range acoustic transmission reduction and bandgap-like regions of particularly strong suppression. By integrating linear and S-shaped waveguides into the hyperuniform pattern, we achieve efficient waveguiding at frequencies within these bandgaps. Both simulations and experiments confirm high transmission through the waveguides, demonstrating the flexibility of hyperuniform structures to support complex waveguide shapes.

We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of T H 17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy.

DPP4i-BP differs from typical BP in its genetic, clinical, and immunological features, but methods to specifically detect DPP4i-BP autoantibodies have been unavailable. This study used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with “domain-swapped BP180” proteins to identify autoantibodies in DPP4i-BP, which targeted BP180 regions from the seventh noncollagenous domain to the fourth collagenous domain (NC7-Col4). These epitopes were associated with DPP4i-BP–specific human leukocyte antigen class II peptide epitopes. Notably, the duration of DPP4i intake before BP onset was significantly shorter in patients with anti–NC7-Col4 autoantibodies than those without them. Measuring the autoantibodies enabled the early diagnosis of DPP4i-BP before epitope spreading. Furthermore, anti–NC7-Col4 autoantibodies were detected in some patients with diabetes taking DPP4i without BP, suggesting that these assays may offer potential tools for early identification of at-risk individuals.",

This in situ optogenetic modulation successfully demonstrated the restoration of spinal motor circuits by rebuilding functional connections between CST axons and postsynaptic interneurons. It was corroborated by live-cell recording, immunofluorescence staining, in vivo Ca 2+ imaging, and pellet-reaching tests. Transcriptome sequencing further elucidated the molecular network changes underlying this optogenetic modulation.

We compare DNA methylation rates in wild-type cells and chromatin remodeler mutants by normalizing nuclear methylation rates to the nonnucleosomal mitochondrial DNA methylation rate in each strain. Depletion of both Isw1 and Chd1 increases the normalized methylation rate, suggesting that these remodelers act together to suppress nucleosome dynamics. Separate depletion of Isw1, Chd1, or Rsc8 has little effect. A decaying sine wave model used to fit nucleosome phasing data shows that nucleosome dynamics decrease with distance from the promoter in an Isw1/Chd1-dependent manner.

However, the formation of volcanic units on Venus by basaltic lavas can only outgas a minor fraction of the CO 2 in the current atmosphere. Here, we model the erosion of long, meandering channels on Venus called canali and show that carbonatite lavas have the unique properties required to erode the canali.

We used biologging tags to measure respiratory rates in foraging rorquals and demonstrate that their field metabolic rates are less than half that predicted by prey consumption estimates and by scaling predictions from smaller marine mammals. The relative cost of rorqual foraging decreases with increasing size as larger whales spend disproportionately longer time filtering prey from engulfed water. By decoupling active swimming and filtration, the largest rorquals forage with limited movement costs. The evolution of lunge feeding confers an energetic advantage that is unique among filter feeders and may have provided an evolutionary pathway to the largest body sizes.",

Using a comprehensive fire occurrence dataset, we analyze fire season onset and climate controls on its variability and change during 1992–2020 in 13 California ecoregions. Northern California ecoregions show stronger trends toward earlier onset compared to more arid southern California ecoregions. Onset has trended earlier for all but one ecoregion. Interannual variability of onset is dominated by climate variability and its influence on fuel moisture. Trend attribution inferred from onset-climate relationships suggests that anthropogenic warming advanced fire season onset by 6 to 46 days during 1992–2020 in 11 of 13 ecoregions.

However, their propensity for rapid crystallization and oxidation severely limits stability and carrier mobility. Here, we strategically enhance perovskite TFT performance by incorporating 2-thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) into 3D tin-based perovskites. The induction of the pseudo-halide SCN − into a bilayer quasi-2D perovskite intermediate phase, combined with the strong interaction between sulfur-bearing thiophene rings (TEA + ) and Sn-I octahedra, effectively reorients perovskite crystallization while inhibiting Sn 2+ oxidation and reducing trap density. Consequently, TEASCN-based TFTs achieve an average hole mobility of more than 60 square centimeters per volt per second and an on/off current ratio surpassing 10 8 , standing out among state-of-the-art p-type perovskite TFTs. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices preserve 84% of their initial mobility after 30 days in an N 2 atmosphere, underscoring their remarkable stability.

YAP activation increases chromatin accessibility, preferentially at TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD) binding sites, and regulates both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic cellular functions. We identify bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( Bmp4 ) as a YAP-TEAD target gene expressed in the cambium.

          "abstract": "The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of quantum Darwinism and the underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a computationally and experimentally inexpensive quantifier to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.",

Fano resonance, an example of quantum interference between discrete and continuous states, is marked by an asymmetric lineshape. While photon-based Fano resonance has enabled high-sensitivity molecule sensing, phonon-based Fano resonance remains underexplored because of ineffective interference between discrete phonons and electronic continuum. In this work, we report phonon-based Fano resonance in a graphene/2D Ag/SiC heterostructure, arising from frequency and lifetime matching between discrete and continuous phonons of SiC. The observed Fano asymmetry is tunable over two orders of magnitude, surpassing previously reported phonon-based systems. The 2D Ag layer restructures the interfacial SiC and facilitates resonant scattering to enhance Fano asymmetry, which is unattainable in conventional Ag. We further demonstrated that this Fano resonance allows ultrasensitive molecule detection at the single-molecule level. Our work highlights phonon-based Fano resonance, opening avenues for engineering quantum interference with phonons.",

Mn/Cr ratios in carbonaceous chondrites and the bulk silicate Earth indicate that meteorite parent bodies and Earth have variable depletions in volatile elements compared to the bulk Solar composition. This depletion is a consequence of the local temperature decreasing as a function of heliocentric distance before planetesimal accretion. Back-tracking the present-day ε 53 Cr composition of the hypothetical proto-Earth fraction shows that the cessation of Mn-Cr fractionation from the bulk Solar composition occurred no later than ~3 Ma after CAI formation, similar to disk regions of carbonaceous chondrites at greater heliocentric distances. The timing of limited solid-gas interaction due to the dissipation of gas from the protoplanetary disk caused the cessation of Mn-Cr fractionation and provides a lower limit on its lifetime.",

The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and dynamics is a conundrum that violates the expected structure–function relationship. We developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by accurately determining three-dimensional (3D) structures from static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. Using the calculated 3D coordinates, the theory accurately forecasts experimentally observed two-point chromatin dynamics. It predicts rapid enhancer–promoter interactions and uncovers a scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, closely matching recent measurements. The theory predicts that cohesin depletion accelerates single-locus diffusion while significantly slowing relaxation dynamics within topologically associating domains. Our results demonstrate that chromatin dynamics can be reliably inferred from static structural data, reinforcing the notion that 3D chromatin structure governs dynamic behavior. This general framework offers powerful tools for exploring chromatin dynamics across diverse biological contexts.",

Through experiments with micromechanical oscillators and macroscale rotors, combined with stochastic averaging analysis, we show that this noise dilution effect improves synchronization efficiency, bolsters resistance to interference, and enhances long-term frequency stability.

In vivo studies in rabbits and pigs confirm that BPMS dynamically regulates NO release in response to fluctuating blood pressure, achieving real-time hemodynamic control.

Hybridization between the metal’s surface d orbitals and molecular p orbitals profoundly alters both the interfacial molecular layer and adjacent metal interface atomic layers, causing substantial changes in the magnetic properties of metal/molecule heterostructures. While magnetic modifications within the metallic layer are relatively well understood, the interfacial magnetism remains elusive. Using ultrafast time-resolved magneto-optical spectroscopy, we investigate the magnetic dynamics in such heterostructures and identify a distinct interfacial magnetic component that appears universal across various cobalt/molecule combinations. Our findings reveal a highly anisotropic magnetic layer localized at the interface, which has remained undetected in static measurements. This interfacial layer likely originates from strong chemical modifications in the cobalt surface induced by chemisorbed molecules. These results underscore the crucial role of molecular chemisorption in shaping interfacial magnetic properties, offering further opportunities for tuning functionalities in molecule-based spintronic devices.",

To uncover the atomistic basis of voltage gating in TREK K 2P channels, we integrated large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with extensive mutagenesis and patch-clamp electrophysiology, including sucrose-based experiments. Simulations revealed an asymmetric stability difference along the SF that results in a water-permeable extracellular side and a watertight intracellular side. Inactivation during inward flux occurs when water penetrates into the inner binding site and halts ion permeation, followed by the unbinding of three K + ions, consistent with gating charge analysis. Our findings provide unprecedented atomistic insights into the C-type inactivation of TREK K 2P channels and establish a framework for investigating noncanonical voltage gating mechanisms in other ion channels.",

Here, we uncover a function for eIF2A in regulating cell migration in a manner independent of overt control of translation. Using a melanoma cell model consisting of nontumoral melanocytic Mel-ST cells and their metastatic counterpart obtained by H-Ras transformation, we unexpectedly find minimal effects of eIF2A depletion on translation. Interactome studies identified centrosomal proteins as major binding partners of eIF2A. We found that eIF2A colocalizes with the centrosome, enhances centrosome composition, and promotes centrosome orientation during cell migration. Migration requires the C-terminal disordered region of eIF2A, involved in mRNA binding. Interaction with mRNA, however, does not require ongoing translation. These findings reveal a role for eIF2A in centrosome dynamics beyond its traditional function in translation.",

          "abstract": "China’s rivers support nearly 20% of the global population and supply freshwater for the world’s largest proportion of industrial output and grain production. Despite their importance, nationwide streamflow changes and their drivers remain unclear because of challenges in accessing observations and disentangling the effects of climate, landscape, and human interventions. By combining data from 1046 hydrological stations with ISIMIP3a reconstructions, we provide a comprehensive national assessment showing that streamflow has declined across more than 70% of stations over the past six decades. Although regional heterogeneity exists, these declines are primarily concentrated in the north and driven by land use and cover change, further exacerbated by water abstraction, diversion, and regulation. In contrast, climate change and variability dominate the increases in streamflow, primarily in the south. Our results provide insights for water managers, helping them understand the multifaceted drivers of hydrological variability and inform the development of infrastructure and ecological projects to mitigate potential risks associated with declining streamflow.",

However, strategies for manipulating ferroelectric dipoles in elemental ferroelectrics remain underexplored, limiting their broader applications. Here, we introduce a universal flexoelectric manipulation strategy to tune the ferroelectric and piezoelectric polarization of one-dimensional self-strained tellurium (Te) ferroelectrics. A substantial flexoelectric field of 9.55 microcoulombs per square centimeter was observed in self-strained Te, inducing a polarization rotation of 18°, comparable to the typical 15° rotation in ferroelectric PbTiO 3 compounds. This substantial polarization rotation enhances ferroelectric coercivity by 165% and piezoelectric responses by 75% compared to unstrained Te. Moreover, the flexoelectric manipulation of ferroelectric polarization demonstrated improved energy harvesting performance at the device level, surpassing most existing counterparts. Our findings highlight the crucial role of flexoelectricity-ferroelectricity coupling in developing high-performance single-element electromechanical devices and ferroelectronics.",

Existing wearable sensors primarily target a single stress hormone, cortisol, using single-point measurements that fail to capture real-time changes and distinguish between acute and chronic stress. To address this, we present Stressomic, a wearable multiplexed microfluidic biosensor for noninvasive monitoring of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in sweat. Stressomic integrates iontophoresis-driven sweat extraction with bursting valve-regulated microfluidic channels for continuous sampling and analysis. Gold nanodendrite–decorated laser-engraved graphene electrodes achieve picomolar-level sensitivity, enabling simultaneous detection of multiple stress hormones. Electrochemical assays and human studies demonstrate that Stressomic reliably tracks hormone fluctuations in response to physical, psychological, and pharmacological stressors. Distinct temporal patterns reveal the dynamic interplay between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. This platform enables continuous, multiplexed stress profiling, offering opportunities for early detection of maladaptive responses, personalized stress management, and deeper insights into stress biology.",

In Caenorhabditis elegans , the formation of carriers from the recycling endosome requires the amphiphysin protein AMPH-1. Recently, we found that purified AMPH-1 is sufficient for tubulation and vesiculation of liposomes in a mechanism that is regulated by guanine nucleotides. Here, we propose a model linking guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) binding and hydrolysis to the membrane binding and tubulation required for transport carrier formation. We find that GTP binding stabilizes interactions between AMPH-1 and the membrane through amphipathic, amino-terminal α helices, which are found at the tips of the arc-shaped, homodimeric structure. By contrast, in the posthydrolysis, guanosine diphosphate–bound state, these helices are repositioned to interact with the amino-terminal helices of other homodimers, to form an oligomeric AMPH-1 lattice that tubulates the membrane, in preparation for carrier formation by membrane fission.",

This framework uses an autoencoder to project embryoid images into a twenty-dimensional (20D) latent space and models the dynamics using a mean-reverting stochastic process of mixed Gaussians.

A notable challenge is fabricating spin defects in general-purpose, low-cost amorphous materials such as polymers. Here, we propose an in situ laser–induced fabrication strategy of spin defects from polymers based on manipulation of main and side chains of polymers (MMSCP). By using 17 laser parameters and 8 polymers, we successfully fabricated silicon carbide spin defects derived from material mismatches. ODMR contrast and linewidth are consistently above 0.15% and below 54 megahertz, respectively. Benefiting from minimal damage of laser direct writing and stable covalent bonding, MMSCP effectively fabricates spin defects in manufactured microfluidic devices, cardiac patches, and medicine bottles and applies them to sensing and anticounterfeiting. Overall, MMSCP represents a paradigm that revolutionizes the application scheme of spin defects.",

While transcriptional regulation of the early stages of motor neuron specification is well established, much less is known about the role of transcription factors in the later stages of maturation and muscle targeting. Defining the molecular mechanisms of these later stages is critical for elucidating how motor circuits are constructed. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor nuclear factor IA (NFIA) is required for motor neuron positioning, axonal branching, and neuromuscular junction formation. Moreover, we find that NFIA is required for proper mitochondrial function and adenosine triphosphate production, providing an important link between transcription factors and metabolism during motor neuron development. Together, these findings underscore the critical role of NFIA in instructing the assembly of spinal circuits for movement.",

Mechanisms underlying pain chronicity of CRPS-I remain unknown. Here, we identified the presence of long-lasting infiltration of macrophages in local dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of a rat model of CRPS-I. We demonstrate that regenerating islet-derived 3β (Reg3β) is specifically produced by DRG neurons upon model establishment and functions as an important signaling molecule to drive proinflammatory macrophage infiltration in local DRG. Infiltrated macrophages produce TNF-α, which causes hyperexcitability of nociceptive DRG neurons and reciprocally promotes Reg3β overexpression and secretion from DRG neurons to recruit more macrophages. Our work reveals a positive feedback signaling conveyed by neuronal Reg3β/macrophage TNF-α that contributes to neuroinflammation in DRG, resulting in persistent pain in a rat model of CRPS-I. This finding provides insights into the neuroimmune interaction in local DRG that contributes to pain chronicity of CRPS-I.",

To develop a molecular understanding of the differences underlying transducer coupling and activation, we performed structure-activity relationship studies of 5-HT1A with distinct G proteins. Through a combination of in vitro assays, we identified a potent partial agonist that selectively engages a G protein subtype. We further investigated the differences in G protein engagement at 5-HT1A with cryo–electron microscopy, determining structures of 5-HT1A bound to distinct ligands and G protein subtypes.

The neurotoxic N-terminal PrP is soluble, associates peripherally with lipid membranes, and induces neurotoxicity only when a critical threshold is exceeded. Both the N-terminally localized KKRPKP sequence and octarepeats contribute to neurotoxicity, with KKRPKP being essential. Without it, the N-terminal PrP is innocuous but exacerbates either neurodegeneration caused by N-terminal PrP or neurodegeneration in prion disease induced by intracerebral prion inoculation in mice.

Blind testing on human kidney tissue demonstrated that the virtually stained images of label-free samples closely match their histochemically stained counterparts (with periodic acid–Schiff staining), showing high concordance in identifying key renal pathology structures despite using IMS data with 10-fold larger pixel size.

We also provide in vivo evidence that R-loop accumulation occurs in the mammary gland tissue of AND-1–deficient mice.

Mice with forebrain-specific Rap1 knockout exhibited resistance to the antidiabetic effects of low-dose metformin while remaining sensitive to other antidiabetic agents. Centrally administered metformin inhibited brain Rap1 and reduced hyperglycemia. Conversely, forced activation of brain Rap1 increased glycemia and abolished the glycemic effect of metformin. Metformin activated a specific subset of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) that requires Rap1.

AuNX-PDA facilitated effective absorption of released TDAs after near-infrared II photothermal treatment and delivery of the absorbed TDAs to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of dendritic cells for cross-presentation, thereby activating CD8 + T cells for efficient tumor-specific immunity. The nanovaccine (NV) significantly inhibited irradiated primary tumors and nonirradiated distant tumors by producing robust antitumor immune responses in B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer mouse models. These findings highlight the potency of morphology– and adhesion–dual biomimetic NVs in whole-tumor vaccine therapy.",

We introduce a 3D photocurrent nanoimaging technique to map these effects in a MoS 2 -Au Schottky photodiode, revealing a PTE-dominated region extending hundreds of nanometers from the electrode edge, enabled by weak electrostatic forces in two-dimensional materials. Unexpectedly, adding high–thermal conductivity hexagonal boron nitride enhances the PTE response by laterally redirecting heat, aligning thermal gradients with Seebeck coefficient variations, and boosting local conductance.

Through multipole analysis, we demonstrate efficient polarization rotation with high transmission for different knot-particle topologies. We explore the knot-particle topologies required to achieve matched polarization rotation and derive simple design rules for the knot parameters without resorting to numerical optimization. The microscopic polarizability tensors and macroscopic susceptibilities reveal that the trefoil knot exhibits strong chiral bianisotropic behavior through its magnetoelectric coupling tensor. We implement knot-particle metasurfaces using advanced 3D printing, which realizes the full 3D geometry of the wires.

We analyzed the collective response in reaction to bird attacks and similar but harmless flybys as a function of shoal size. Larger shoals increasingly detected predator attacks (i.e., true positives), while their response facing harmless flybys (i.e., false alarms) remained constant. Furthermore, decision time decreased with increasing shoal size. Larger shoals were thus able to simultaneously overcome two major trade-offs inherent in solitary decision-making: the trade-off between true and false positives and the trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our findings set the stage for the next generation of studies investigating the mechanisms underlying collective decision-making.",

This design offers high stiffness in stable states while allowing for long-stroke transitions, making it suitable for integration with soft actuators to balance deformability and load-bearing capacity. With advantages such as high compressibility and rapid integration, these exoskeleton-enhanced arms have promising applications when mounted on unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, facilitating large-scale dexterous manipulation with the necessary load capacities.

Although these two zones can be readily measured today, there has been limited understanding of how the mixed and transition layers evolved over the Phanerozoic since animals first began to extensively colonize the seafloor. Here, we provide a record for the depths of the sedimentary mixed and transition layers through the Phanerozoic. We find that although deepening of the sediment mixed layer spanned hundreds of millions of years, a deep transition layer was established as early as the Cambrian and did not further deepen until the Mesozoic—trajectories reflecting evolutionary radiations, changes in nutrient cycling, and alleviation of oxygen stress.",

Here, we estimate the ground acceleration and quake magnitude for four boulders and one landslide: all sampled by Apollo 17 astronauts. These features all have exposure ages that establish the approximate timing of the moonquakes. Our analysis suggests that the structural relief of the Lee-Lincoln fault scarp is the result of multiple coseismic slip events with a minimum body wave magnitude M w of ~2.9 to 3.3. The formation and growth of thousands of such globally distributed young thrust faults, through multiple coseismic events, suggest that the Moon has a history of widespread strong shallow moonquakes.

Immune cells express various neurotransmitter receptors, and we demonstrate that selective deletion of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor ( Adrb2 ) gene perturbs the normal diurnal oscillation of clock gene expression in CD8 + T cells, such as Per2 and Bmal1 . Consequently, their time-of-day–dependent response to vesicular stomatitis virus was dysregulated, and the diurnal development of CD8 + T cells into variegated populations of memory/effectors was altered in the absence of ADRB2 signaling. The diurnal fluctuations in T cell phenotypes were a distinct developmental process, independent of migration kinetics within the spleen. Thus, Adrb2 directly entrains core clock gene oscillation and regulates T cell developmental responses to virus infection as a function of time of day of pathogen exposure.",

We design a chiral metasurface based on waveguide arrays with periodically shifted segments that have a saddle-shaped chiral and high- Q dispersion band. The parabolic shape along one direction ensures minimum involvement of spatial/Fourier components at each frequency, thereby achieving circularly polarized thermal emission with high spatial coherence. Meanwhile, the flatband behavior along the other direction allows the use of a slot-shaped spatial filter and a mid-infrared lens to collect emissions from large-area metasurfaces, thus improving power collection efficiency without affecting temporal coherence.

However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains affected by wavefront distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how ultrasound matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to these fundamental issues. As an experimental proof of concept, an in vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheep. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to markedly enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM.

Despite regional variation in geography, habitat, and species composition, a consistent pattern emerges: Biodiversity loss predominantly stems from declines in the most abundant bird species, whereas less abundant species show increases. We demonstrate that species once abundant and near their carrying capacity have declined, while less abundant species farther from their carrying capacity have increased. A path analysis identifies the key role played by anthropogenic land-use changes in causing the observed declines.

Fibroblast growth factor-mediated migration in a spatially graded manner causes cell stretching, which triggers Yap-dependent proliferation and controls floorplate and hypochord growth. Supported by mathematical modeling, we further suggest that their growth is fine-tuned by mechanical tethering to the notochord via cadherin 2 at the posterior end. We propose that the notochord instructs and sustains the tripartite formation via leader-follower formation control, a strategy from engineering that spatially organizes multiple agents to coordinate the growth of the midline tissues.",

These genomic changes were supported by an increased number of individuals displaying the heterozygous state of the chromosomal inversion coupled to migratory behavior in Atlantic cod. Ecological models and genome-wide scans identified that some of the observed frequency shifts, coupled to neural development, metabolic, and growth regulation, covaried with intensified fisheries, reduced generation time, and ocean warming.

A multitude of plant physiological regulation processes determine the overall drought resistance of ecosystems.

In this study, by using high-resolution remote sensing data, we evaluated drought strategies of different ecosystem types throughout Europe by evaluating three key physiological regulation aspects (evapotranspiration, water content, and carbon regulation) based on their associated vegetation attributes. We found that different ecosystem types show divergent responses in these physiological attributes, suggesting different optimization strategies with respect to water saving versus spending, water content stabilizing versus fluctuating, and leaf conserving versus shedding strategies facing drought. These drought strategies from remote sensing provide timely ecosystem response information, facilitating earth system model predictions and aiding the protection against future droughts at large scales.",

A microheater, with millisecond response, heats or recools DNA origami constructs, hybridizing or dehybridizing sticky ends. Because anything within 20 micrometers of the heater equilibrates to a programmed temperature change in milliseconds, sticky ends of a compound DNA origami machine can open and close synchronously and operate cooperatively, in phase, additively increasing the drive force compared to single pair of sticky ends DNA machine (the six-helix bundle DNA origami hinge machine). In our demonstrations, we fold and unfold two square origami with 10 pairs of complementary sticky ends to drive a bead on the end of a rod like origami to speeds exceeding 30 micrometers per second. Our device envisions the creation of complex, synchronized DNA machines.",

          "abstract": "Microfluidic fabrication technologies are increasingly used to produce functional anisotropic microstructures for broad applications. However, the limited flow manipulation methods hinder the production of intricate microstructure morphologies. In this work, we introduce CeyeHao, an artificial intelligence–driven flow programming methodology for designing microchannels to perform unprecedented flow manipulations. In CeyeHao, microchannels containing hierarchically assembled obstacles are constructed, offering more than double flow transformation modes and immense configurability compared to state-of-the-art methods. An AI model, CEyeNet, predicts the transformed flow profiles, reducing computation time by up to 2700 folds and achieving up to 97 and 90% accuracy with simulated and experiment results. CeyeHao facilitates microchannel design in both human-guided and automatic modes, enabling creation of flow morphologies with highly regulated geometries and elaborate artistic patterns, along with precise topology manipulation of multiple streams. The superior flow manipulation capability of CeyeHao can facilitate broad applications from complex microstructure fabrication to precise reaction control.",

          "abstract": "Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) cause major agricultural losses worldwide, yet the molecular basis of plant immunity against these pathogens remains poorly understood. To investigate how plants recognize PPNs, we aimed to identify microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) from nematodes and the corresponding plant immune components. Because of the limited availability of material from obligate PPNs, we used Caenorhabditis elegans , a free-living nematode, as a MAMP source. C. elegans extract activated MAMP-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis Col-0. Through chromatography-based purification, we identified a secreted trehalase and pinpointed a conserved peptide region essential for its MAMP activity. A corresponding peptide from root-knot nematode trehalase enabled the identification of lectin receptor kinases LecRK-V.5 and LecRK-V.6 as key components in immune induction. Notably, this peptide region is conserved across some phytophagous insects and fungal pathogens, with LecRK-Vs required for immune responses to these peptides, highlighting the role of LecRK-V–mediated mechanism for broad-spectrum pathogen detection via trehalase-derived peptides.",

Previous MPI tracer research has predominantly focused on superparamagnetic nanoparticles, whose suboptimal sigmoidal magnetization curves limit their spatial resolution. Here, we introduce the magnetically induced magnetosome chain (MAGiC), a superferromagnetic MPI tracer, demonstrating a 25-fold improvement in resolution in the excitation direction and an order of magnitude improvement in signal intensity compared to the commercial tracer VivoTrax+. Under a gradient field of 4 tesla per meter, the resolution in the excitation direction reached 80 micrometers. Furthermore, MAGiC can be accurately manipulated using magnetic fields, making it an MPI-trackable microrobot. We have elucidated the mechanisms underlying MAGiC’s superior performance and validated its effectiveness in vitro and in vivo. As a high-performance MPI tracer and microrobot, MAGiC holds tremendous potential for various applications, such as cell tracking, image-guided drug delivery, and therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "In the brain, memory can be coded as relative differences in synaptic strength produced by Hebbian plasticity [e.g., long-term potentiation (LTP)]. However, changes in neuronal activity, including the saturation of synaptic strength by the positive-feedback nature of Hebbian plasticity, could deteriorate the encoded memory. Homeostatic plasticity is thought to contribute to the stability of the encoded memory by maintaining the relative differences in synaptic strength against persistent destabilizing changes in neuronal activity. However, it remains unclear how and when these two types of plasticity work together in the context of memory. Here, we have demonstrated that LARGE, a protein associated with intellectual disability, drives homeostatic resetting several hours after LTP by down-regulating AMPA-receptor trafficking via the Golgi apparatus. LARGE deficiency impairs long-term memory formation in mice. Our study reveals a potential molecular mechanism underlying the stability of memory mediated by cross-talk between Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Almost all animals are bilaterally symmetrical, and only rarely is this universality broken and maintained as a stable polymorphism. One such case is Perissodus microlepis , a scale-eating cichlid fish endemic to Lake Tanganyika. This species is polymorphic with left- or right-headed morphs, each specialized for scraping scales from the opposite side of their prey. This polymorphism is stably maintained around a 50:50 ratio and is likely driven by negative frequency–dependent selection, a classic form of balancing selection. Using a genome-wide dataset, including a de novo haplotype-resolved reference genome, whole-genome sequences, and microcomputed tomography scans of 102 individuals, we identified 72 genetic loci linked to head asymmetry. Nearby genes are enriched for roles in symmetry establishment, facial morphology, and nervous system function, with evidence suggesting that balancing selection maintains this diversity. Our study expands our understanding of the genetic basis of head asymmetry and provides candidate genes for further research.",

          "abstract": "Methane combustion contributes 30% to global warming, making its conversion to cleaner chemicals a critical challenge. Here, we report a catalyst-free ambient conversion of methane to methanol with a remarkable yield exceeding 650 millimoles per hour and a high conversion rate of ~35%, achieved using in situ–generated water dimer radical cations, ( H 2 O ) 2 + · , in a specially designed batch reactor operating under mild conditions. In a single run, the reactor was typically operated for 10 minutes. The atom efficiency for hydrogen in our approach for methanol synthesis is ~67%. Hydrogen gas is the by-product, produced at a rate of over 2 millimoles per hour. Compared to the previously reported catalytic methods, our production yields are up by between 10 2 and 10 6 times depending on the literature method. This breakthrough enables clean, energy-efficient methane conversion without unwanted oxidation by-products, offering substantial environmental and economic benefits beyond combustion.",

          "abstract": "Humans across cultures show an outstanding capacity to perceive, learn, and produce musical rhythms. These skills rely on mapping the infinite space of possible rhythmic sensory inputs onto a finite set of internal rhythm categories. What is the nature of the brain processes underlying rhythm categorization? We used electroencephalography to measure brain activity as human participants listened to a continuum of rhythmic sequences characterized by repeating patterns of two interonset intervals. Using frequency and representational similarity analyses, we show that brain activity does not merely track the temporal structure of rhythmic inputs but, instead, produces categorical representation of rhythms. These neural rhythm categories arise automatically, independent of any motor- or timing-related tasks, yet exhibit strong similarity with categorization observed in overt behavior. Together, these results and methodological advances constitute a critical step toward understanding the biological roots and diversity of musical behaviors across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Climate-induced distribution changes are particularly challenging for fisheries targeting fish populations shared between exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and the high seas, known as straddling stocks. Here, we combine multiple datasets and ecosystem modeling to identify the presence of straddling stocks worldwide and consider the management implications of climate change–driven shifts. We identify 347 straddling stocks across 67 species, including both highly migratory and less mobile species. Our results suggest that regardless of the climate change scenario, at least 37% and 54% of stocks are projected to shift between EEZs and the high seas, by 2030 and 2050, respectively. More stocks are expected to shift toward the high seas, and highly migratory stocks are projected to shift across Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Coastal states and RFMOs require to revise governance frameworks to support sustainable and equitable adaptation to shifting stocks. Developing such strategies requires cooperation between management bodies within EEZs and the high seas.",
