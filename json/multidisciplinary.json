          "authors": "Allison Ann Payne",
          "abstract": "Schools continue to rely on restrictive security and punitive discipline in dealing with crime and delinquency despite evidence that these measures can negatively impact both students and schools. In addition, these measures are inequitably implemented across schools, with historically marginalized communities seeing greater use. I argue that attending to social justice in school-based crime and delinquency prevention should begin with an examination of strategies that are effective in reducing risk factors for crime and deviance. I describe those evidence-based strategies, show that they are inequitably implemented across schools, and discuss how equitable implementation can happen. The solution I argue for—equitable implementation—includes engagement of the schools’ community members, building trusting relationships, equitable decision-making, strong collaborative leadership, local adaptation, and reliance on data. I also discuss a particular framework that researchers and schools can use to achieve equitable implementation.",

          "authors": "Nancy Rodriguez",
          "abstract": "The evidence base on the effectiveness of crime prevention programs and policies has grown significantly over the past two decades. But despite the attention given to particular kinds of crime reduction interventions, advancement of social justice and reduction of racial disparities in the administration of criminal justice have been limited. Additionally, despite the growing diversity of the U.S. population, prevention research that focuses on disparities among racial and ethnic groups is limited. In this article, I draw on insights from three juvenile court case studies to discuss the strengths and limitations of research on youth justice. These cases illustrate how social inequalities shape the lives of youth and how juvenile court responses, which are ostensible evidence-based treatments, can compound inequality and punish some youth. I then present strategies that center racial equity and social justice as part of a new framework for youth crime prevention.",

Foundational to this work is to bring about social justice for marginalized and underserved populations. Drawing on several case studies from developed and developing countries, we apply ideas and practices from social medicine to explore how the advancement of social justice can help prevent interpersonal violence. Several themes offer fresh perspectives on inculcating social justice principles and practices in violence prevention, including recognizing the impacts of structural violence, fostering equity in the distribution of resources, expanding accompaniment, and overcoming a socialized acceptance of scarcity. We conclude with observations on the indistinct and dynamic boundaries between medicine and criminology.",

          "abstract": "Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the city of Minneapolis grappled with shattered community trust, record rates of violence, and low officer morale. Balancing the interests of crime prevention and social justice in the community that the authors of this article serve is a vital concern, as it is in so many other cities and jurisdictions. Our perspective on crime prevention and social justice emphasizes transparency, community partnerships, and evaluative metrics, and we argue for and reflect on that approach here. By implementing practical, purposeful, and informed policy changes, the Minneapolis Police Department and our community have made significant strides forward in both building capacity for community trust and launching crime prevention initiatives.",

          "abstract": "Twenty-five years ago, we argued that it would be possible to reduce incarceration and use the resultant savings for investments in preschool education, which would further lower the crime rate. In this article, we revisit that line of thinking, surveying recent literature on the cost and efficacy of prisons and preschool education for crime reduction. We find that the new evidence strengthens our earlier conclusion about the feasibility of this thought experiment. The costs (in real dollars) of prison are higher than 25 years ago, and prisons are slightly less effective at reducing or preventing crime. In addition, the evidence shows broader and stronger effects of preschool on crime and in programs operating at a much larger scale than the programs we previously evaluated.",

          "abstract": "The police are traditionally seen as experts in crime prevention, and a large body of research supports the effectiveness of police-led prevention initiatives targeted at crime hot spots. However, there is growing interest in identifying alternative prevention efforts that do not rely on the police, especially with youth in communities that have challenging relationships with the formal justice system. This article reports on a quasi-experimental evaluation of an innovative school- and community-led crime prevention partnership that prioritized social justice and social impact. The partnership was associated with modest but statistically significant reductions in calls for service and reported offenses in the treatment areas. Results for juvenile-involved offenses were not statistically significant, but the magnitude and direction of that effect were similar to the other results. We discuss the benefits and challenges of leveraging informal social controls to prevent crime “beyond the police.”",

          "abstract": "Critics of evidence-based crime prevention argue that extant research lacks insight into aspects of crime control and prevention that are critical to policymakers. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of programs require the use of experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and some scholars argue that relaxing that methodological criterion would result in a larger pool of studies that could better inform policy and practice. We test that proposition by using a comprehensive database of 160 evaluation studies of public-area video surveillance and measuring their policy relevance by looking for four specific factors: causal mechanisms, moderators, implementation, and economic costs. We find that studies incorporating experimental and high-quality quasi-experimental designs scored significantly higher than studies using less rigorous designs on three of the four dimensions. This suggests that adherence to a high standard of methodological rigor does not compromise the practical value of video surveillance research. We then discuss the implications of this finding.",

Crime prevention that prioritizes social impact is about harnessing the knowledge of evidence-based interventions and fostering systems change that is both meaningful and lasting. This approach includes targeting the social and environmental conditions that lead to criminal activity, building on existing strengths and assets, and tailoring evidence-based practices to local conditions. Social justice in this context equitably delivers crime prevention resources, and promotes perceptions of fairness and legitimacy among individuals and the community at large. In this introduction, we lay out the ideals, challenges, and progress of crime prevention for social impact and social justice and summarize the conclusions of the other articles in this volume of The ANNALS .",

          "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, there has been growing concern over a purported link between proactive policing to control crime and unfair, biased, and abusive policing approaches. Overly aggressive and indiscriminate policing initiatives run the risk of driving a wedge between police and the communities they serve, with residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods feeling less like partners and more like targets. At the same time, research suggests that effective policing has an important impact on public safety. We present a conceptual framework for how police can prevent crime while minimizing unintended harm. We focus particularly on cities and urban communities, arguing that the benefits of policing can be maximized and the costs of policing can be minimized when the police respect individual rights and dignity and focus on community, and that problem solving should begin with a focus on risky people in the places that generate the most crime.",

This article extends an equity-oriented policy agenda by applying the IBPA framework to three domains of the criminal justice system: policing, corrections, and legislation. I present case studies of algorithmic policing, the housing of transgender persons in carceral settings, and U.S. firearm legislation as examples of this approach. Through these cases, I argue for equitable processes and outcomes in the creation and application of criminal justice policy and practice.",

A key feature of developmental crime prevention is a comprehensive effort to improve the life chances of at-risk children and families, and there is evidence that doing so improves long-term life-course outcomes like physical health, mental health, education, and employment. We assess available research evidence from 12 high-quality studies of developmental crime prevention initiatives and find that extensive use of multimodal interventions helps to foster cumulative protection over the life course, that there are significant improvements in other outcomes over the life course, that there are promising signs of intergenerational transmission of the intervention effects, and that there is strong support for these sorts of interventions from the perspective of benefit-cost analysis.

This conceptual article examines how reducing crime at places is also an opportunity to have greater social impact and improve social justice, particularly when crime displacement may occur, through the recognition that no place exists in a vacuum. We discuss opportunity reduction in its traditional form, but also in a broader context that considers a fuller extent of crime prevention that more closely resembles its original formulation in the field of environmental criminology. We interrogate our traditional opportunity-reduction theories, identifying some of their limitations and noting that theoretical integration is not only conceptually possible, but empirically shown to matter. This is followed by a discussion of theoretical integration and its importance for crime prevention. We close our discussion outlining a crime prevention model, SafeGrowth, that considers both place-based strategies and community approaches.",

          "abstract": "Magnetic field generation on Earth has probably persisted for at least 3.5 Gyr (refs. 1,2), initially sustained by secular cooling of the Earth’s core and, more recently, by the growth of the solid inner core3. Numerical models of the present-day geodynamo have proved to be successful in producing Earth-like magnetic fields4,5,6,7 and approaching realistic dynamic regimes8,9,10,11. However, thermal evolution12,13 and palaeomagnetic records14,15 suggest that the geodynamo operated for most of geomagnetic history without a solid inner core. Dynamo action in a whole fluid core remains poorly understood. Here we show dynamo actions that are independent of fluid viscosity in the correct geometry of the Earth’s core in the deep past at extremely low viscosity, demonstrating the negligible role of fluid viscosity in our dynamo simulations. Our early-Earth geometry models produce magnetic field intensity and morphologies that are compatible with the palaeomagnetic data in the deep past while showing remarkable similarity to the present-day magnetic field. This raises questions about the role of the solid inner core in producing the spatial-temporal variations of the observed Earth’s magnetic field7,16,17,18.",

          "abstract": "Projections of tropical rainfall under global warming remain highly uncertain1,2, largely because of an unclear climate response to a potential weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)3. Although an AMOC slowdown can substantially alter tropical rainfall patterns4,5,6,7,8, the physical mechanisms linking high-latitude changes to tropical hydroclimate are poorly understood11. Here we demonstrate that an AMOC slowdown drives widespread shifts in tropical rainfall through the propagation of high-latitude cooling into the tropical North Atlantic. We identify and validate this mechanism using climate model simulations and palaeoclimate records from Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1)—a past period marked by pronounced AMOC weakening9,10. In models, prevailing easterly and westerly winds communicate the climate signal to the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean through the transport of cold air generated over the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic. Air–sea interactions transmit the response across the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, altering rainfall patterns as far as Indonesia, the tropical Andes and northern Australia. A similar teleconnection emerges under global warming scenarios, producing a consistent multi-model pattern of tropical hydroclimatic change. These palaeo-validated projections show widespread drying across Mesoamerica, the Amazon and West Africa, highlighting an elevated risk of severe drought for vulnerable human and ecological systems.",

          "abstract": "Neutrinos are elementary particles that interact only very weakly with matter. Neutrino experiments are, therefore, usually big, with masses in the multi-tonne range. The thresholdless interaction of coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos on atomic nuclei leads to greatly enhanced interaction rates, which allows for much smaller detectors. The study of this process gives insights into physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The CONUS+ experiment 1 was designed to first detect elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering in the fully coherent regime with low-energy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors. For this purpose, semiconductor detectors based on high-purity germanium crystals with extremely low-energy thresholds were developed 2 . Here we report the first observation of a neutrino signal with a statistical significance of 3.7 σ from the CONUS+ experiment, operated at the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland. In 119 days of reactor operation (395 ± 106) neutrinos were measured compared with a predicted number from calculations assuming Standard Model physics of (347 ± 59) events. With increased precision, there is potential for fundamental discoveries in the future. The CONUS+ results in combination with other measurements of this interaction channel might therefore mark a starting point for a new era in neutrino physics.",

However, the ability of forests to act as carbon sinks is rapidly declining owing to increasing natural and anthropogenic pressures, threatening the EU’s climate goals and calling for prompt actions. Here we provide actionable research recommendations to improve the monitoring and modelling of forest resources and their carbon sink, and to better inform forest management decisions.

          "abstract": "Mammalian cells entering the cell cycle favour glycolysis to rapidly generate ATP and produce the biosynthetic intermediates that are required for rapid biomass accumulation 1 . Simultaneously, the ubiquitin-ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its coactivator CDH1 (APC/C CDH1 ) remains active, allowing origin licensing and blocking premature DNA replication. Paradoxically, glycolysis is reduced by APC/C CDH1 through the degradation of key glycolytic enzymes 2 , raising the question of how cells coordinate these mutually exclusive events to ensure proper cell division. Here we show that cells resolve this paradox by transiently inactivating the APC/C during cell cycle entry, which allows a transient metabolic shift favouring glycolysis. After mitogen stimulation, rapid mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of the APC/C adapter protein CDH1 at the amino terminus causes it to partially dissociate from the APC/C. This partial inactivation of the APC/C leads to the accumulation of PFKFB3, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, promoting a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. Delayed accumulation of phosphatase activity later removes CDH1 phosphorylation, restoring full APC/C activity, and shifting cells back to favouring oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, cells coordinate the simultaneous demands of cell cycle progression and metabolism through an incoherent feedforward loop, which transiently inhibits APC/C activity to generate a pulse of glycolysis that is required for mammalian cell cycle entry.",

          "abstract": "Science frequently benefits from teams of interdisciplinary researchers1–3, but many scientists do not have easy access to experts from multiple fields4,5. While large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains, their uses have been largely limited to answering specific scientific questions rather than performing open-ended research6–11. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM scientist agents through a series of research meetings, with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We apply the Virtual Lab to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants12,13 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation. This demonstrates how the Virtual Lab can rapidly make an impactful, real-world scientific discovery.",

          "abstract": "Transition metal–hydrides have been widely exploited in catalysis for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated moieties, including carbonyls, alkenes and alkynes1. To complement heterolytic metal–hydride bond cleavage, metal–hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) has recently gained attention, as a promising strategy for radical hydrofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes2, thus enabling late-stage diversification of complex molecules3,4. However, owing to the weak interactions between the prochiral organic radical and the enantiopure catalyst5, asymmetric MHAT6 remains challenging. Here we show that cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) can be repurposed to catalyse asymmetric MHAT, a new-to-nature reaction. Directed evolution of P450BM3 yielded a triple mutant that catalyses MHAT radical cyclization of unactivated alkenes, producing diverse cyclic compounds—including pyrrolidines and piperidines—with up to 98:2 enantiomeric ratio under aerobic whole-cell conditions. Apart from electron-deficient alkenes, alternative radical acceptors—including hydrazones, oximes and nitriles—were converted by repurposed P450BM3 to enantioenriched cyclization products. Mechanistic investigations support an MHAT mechanism proceeding by homolytic cleavage of a fleeting iron(III)–hydride species2,6. Starting from CYP119, directed evolution afforded a stereocomplementary MHATase, highlighting the potential of repurposed CYPs for MHAT biocatalysis. Our study highlights the prospect of integrating homolytic metal–hydride reactivity into metalloenzymes, thus expanding the scope of asymmetric radical biocatalysis.",

Here we show that starting only from the target sequence of the input, and freely sampling both target and binding protein conformations, RFdiffusion5 can generate binders to IDPs and IDRs in a wide range of conformations. We used this approach to generate binders to the IDPs amylin, C-peptide, VP48 and BRCA1_ARATH in diverse conformations with a dissociation constant (Kd) ranging from 3 to 100 nM. For the IDRs G3BP1, common cytokine receptor γ-chain (IL-2RG) and prion protein, we diffused binders to β-strand conformations of the targets, obtaining Kd between 10 and 100 nM. Fluorescence imaging experiments show that the binders bind to their respective targets in cells. The G3BP1 binder disrupts stress granule formation in cells, and the amylin binder inhibits amyloid fibril formation and dissociates existing fibres, enables targeting of both monomeric and fibrillar amylin to lysosomes, and increases the sensitivity of mass spectrometry-based amylin detection. Our approach should be useful for creating binders to flexible IDPs or IDRs spanning a wide range of intrinsic conformational preferences.",

State-of-the-art strategies typically target single surface antigens, but each individual receptor rarely defines the specific cell type4,5. The development of programmable molecular systems that integrate multiple cell-surface features to convert on-target inputs to user-defined outputs is therefore highly desirable. Here we describe an autonomous decision-making device driven by proximity-gated protein trans-splicing that allows local generation of an active protein from two otherwise inactive polypeptide fragments. We show that this protein-actuator platform can perform convergent protein ligation on designated cell surfaces, allowing highly selective generation of active proteins, which can either remain physically associated with the cell surface on which they were manufactured or be released into the surrounding milieu. Because of its intrinsic modularity and tunability, we demonstrate that the technology is compatible with different types of input, targeting modality and functional output, allowing for the localized interrogation or manipulation of cellular systems.",

Although immune cell metabolism influences effector function, the effect of tumour metabolism on immunogenicity is less understood 4 . ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) links substrate availability and mitochondrial metabolism with lipid biosynthesis and gene regulation 5–7 . Although ACLY inhibition shows antiproliferative effects in various tumours, clinical translation has been limited by challenges in inhibitor development and compensatory metabolic pathways 8–12 . Here, using a mouse model of MASH-HCC that mirrors human disease, genetic inhibition of ACLY in hepatocytes and tumours reduced neoplastic lesions by over 70%. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of this pathway, a novel small-molecule ACLY inhibitor, EVT0185 (6-[4-(5-carboxy-5-methyl-hexyl)-phenyl]−2,2-dimethylhexanoic acid), was identified via phenotypic screening. EVT0185 is converted to a CoA thioester in the liver by SLC27A2 and structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy reveals that EVT0185-CoA directly interacts with the CoA-binding site of ACLY. Oral delivery of EVT0185 in three mouse models of MASH-HCC dramatically reduces tumour burden as monotherapy and enhances efficacy of current standards of care including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies. Transcriptomic and spatial profiling in mice and humans linked reduced tumour ACLY with increases in the chemokine CXCL13, tumour-infiltrating B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures. The depletion of B cells blocked the antitumour effects of ACLY inhibition. Together, these findings illustrate how targeting tumour metabolism can rewire immune function and suppress cancer progression in MASH-HCC.",

CMX410 is equipotent against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mtb and efficacious in multiple mouse models of infection.

CMX410 is highly selective for its target and thus demonstrates excellent pharmacological and safety profiles, including no adverse effects in a 14-day rat toxicity study up to 1,000 mg kg−1 per day. The distinctive mode of action from current drugs, high potency across all tested clinical isolates, oral bioavailability, favourable performance in drug combination testing and superior pharmacological and safety characteristics make CMX410 a promising first-in-class candidate to replace outdated cell-wall biosynthesis inhibitors, such as isoniazid and ethambutol, in tuberculosis regimens.",

Here we synthesize challenges to crediting forest NbCS and offer guidance and key next steps to make improvements in the implementation of these strategies immediately and in the near-term. We structure our Perspective around four key components of rigorous forest NbCS, illuminating key science and policy considerations and providing solutions to improve rigour.

Although many neural circuits underlying feeding and parenting behaviours are well characterized6,7,8,9, it is unclear how these different circuits interact and adapt during lactation. Here we performed transcriptomic profiling of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the mouse hypothalamus in response to lactation and hunger. Furthermore, we showed that heightened appetite in lactating mice was accompanied by increased activity of hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the ARC (ARCAgRP neurons). To assess the strength of hunger versus maternal drives, we designed a conflict assay in which female mice chose between a food source or pups and nesting material. Although food-deprived lactating mothers prioritized parenting over feeding, hunger reduced the duration and disrupted the sequences of parenting behaviours in both lactating and virgin females. We found that ARCAgRP neurons inhibit bombesin receptor subtype 3 (BRS3) neurons in the MPOA (MPOABRS3 neurons), which become more active postpartum and govern parenting and satiety. Activation of this ARCAgRP-to-MPOABRS3 circuit shifted behaviours from parenting to food-seeking. Thus, hypothalamic networks are modulated by physiological states and work antagonistically during the prioritization of competing motivated behaviours.",

          "abstract": "Allergens that induce allergic airway inflammation are highly diverse, but they commonly activate type 2 immune responses1,2. Airway epithelial cells are crucial in allergen sensing3,4,5. However, the shared features among diverse allergens that elicit similar innate responses, and their epithelial detection mechanisms, remain poorly defined1,2,6,7,8,9. Here we identify pore-forming proteins as one of the common stimuli of allergic airway inflammation and reveal their immune-activation mechanisms. Using the prevalent mould allergen Alternaria alternata as a model, we established an in vitro system to investigate type 2 innate immune sensing. A six-step biochemical fractionation identified Aeg-S and Aeg-L as the core immune-stimulatory components. Biochemical reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that these proteins form 16- to 20-mer transmembrane pore complexes. Their cooperative perforation acts as a bona fide type 2 immune adjuvant to support antigen-specific T helper 2 and immunoglobulin E responses. Genetically engineered A. alternata strains that lack pore-forming activity do not induce allergic responses in mice. Furthermore, pore-forming proteins from various species, despite structural and membrane target differences, are sufficient to trigger respiratory allergies. Perforations in airway epithelial cells initiate allergic responses through two mechanisms: one triggers IL-33 release, and the other involves Ca2+ influx, which activates MAPK signalling and type 2 inflammatory gene expression. These findings provide insight into how type 2 immune responses detect common perturbations caused by structurally diverse stimuli. Targeting downstream signalling of epithelial perforation may open new avenues for treating respiratory allergies.",

Here, using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging, we tracked thousands of corticostriatal axonal boutons in the dorsolateral striatum of awake mice. We found that learning a new motor skill dynamically regulated these boutons. The activities of motor corticostriatal axonal boutons exhibited selectivity for rewarded movements (RM) and unrewarded movements (UM). Notably, boutons on the same axonal branches showed diverse responses during behaviour. Motor learning significantly increased the proportion of RM boutons and reduced the heterogeneity of bouton activities. Moreover, motor learning induced profound structural dynamism in boutons. By combining structural and functional imaging, we saw that newly formed axonal boutons were more likely to exhibit selectivity for RM and were stabilized during motor learning, whereas UM boutons were selectively eliminated. These findings reveal a novel form of plasticity in corticostriatal axons and show that motor learning drives dynamic bouton reorganization to support motor skill acquisition and execution.",

We observed direct transformation of graphite (\\(10\\bar{1}0\\)) orientation to HD (0002) and graphite (0002) to HD (\\(10\\bar{1}0\\)). The bulk sample consists of threefold intergrowth of tightly knitted 100-nm-sized crystals, predominantly HD with trace imperfections of cubic diamond. The interlayer bonds in HD are shortened with respect to intralayer bonds to optimize the HD structure. Notably, the hardness of HD is only slightly higher than cubic diamond.

Here, using large language models2 trained on biological diversity at scale, we demonstrate successful precision editing of the human genome with a programmable gene editor designed with artificial intelligence. To achieve this goal, we curated a dataset of more than 1 million CRISPR operons through systematic mining of 26 terabases of assembled genomes and metagenomes. We demonstrate the capacity of our models by generating 4.8× the number of protein clusters across CRISPR–Cas families found in nature and tailoring single-guide RNA sequences for Cas9-like effector proteins. Several of the generated gene editors show comparable or improved activity and specificity relative to SpCas9, the prototypical gene editing effector, while being 400 mutations away in sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that an artificial-intelligence-generated gene editor, denoted as OpenCRISPR-1, exhibits compatibility with base editing.

          "abstract": "Mouse lemurs are the smallest and fastest reproducing primates, as well as one of the most abundant, and they are emerging as a model organism for primate biology, behaviour, health and conservation. Although much has been learnt about their ecology and phylogeny in Madagascar and their physiology, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet-based and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing to create Tabula Microcebus, a transcriptomic atlas of 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs opportunistically obtained from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration and expert cell annotation, we define and biologically organize more than 750 lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. This includes cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and differentiating cells along the developmental trajectories of spermatogenesis, haematopoiesis and other adult tissues. We also describe dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types. We globally compare expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explore primate cell and gene expression evolution by comparing lemur transcriptomes to those of human, mouse and macaque. This reveals cell-type-specific patterns of primate specialization and many cell types and genes for which the mouse lemur provides a better human model than mouse 1 . The atlas provides a cellular and molecular foundation for studying this model primate and establishes a general approach for characterizing other emerging model organisms.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally, with most deaths caused by metastatic disease, often following long periods of clinical dormancy 1 . Understanding the mechanisms that disrupt the quiescence of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) is crucial for addressing metastatic progression. Infections caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 trigger both local and systemic inflammation 2,3 . Here we demonstrate, in mice, that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast DCCs in the lung, causing DCC proliferation within days of infection and a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions within two weeks. These phenotypic transitions and expansions are interleukin-6 dependent. We show that DCCs impair lung T cell activation and that CD4 + T cells sustain the pulmonary metastatic burden after the influenza infection by inhibiting CD8 + T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Crucially, these experimental findings align with human observational data. Analyses of cancer survivors from the UK Biobank (all cancers) and Flatiron Health (breast cancer) databases reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increases the risk of cancer-related mortality and lung metastasis compared with uninfected cancer survivors. These discoveries underscore the huge impact of respiratory viral infections on metastatic cancer resurgence, offering new insights into the connection between infectious diseases and cancer metastasis.",

          "abstract": "Mouse lemurs ( Microcebus spp.) are an emerging primate model organism, but their genetics, cellular and molecular biology remain largely unexplored. In an accompanying paper 1 , we performed large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing of 27 organs from mouse lemurs. We identified more than 750 molecular cell types, characterized their transcriptomic profiles and provided insight into primate evolution of cell types. Here we use the generated atlas to characterize mouse lemur genes, physiology, disease and mutations. We uncover thousands of previously unidentified lemur genes and hundreds of thousands of new splice junctions including over 85,000 primate splice junctions missing in mice. We systematically explore the lemur immune system by comparing global expression profiles of key immune genes in health and disease, and by mapping immune cell development, trafficking and activation. We characterize primate-specific and lemur-specific physiology and disease, including molecular features of the immune program, lemur adipocytes and metastatic endometrial cancer that resembles the human malignancy. We present expression patterns of more than 400 primate genes missing in mice, many with similar expression patterns to humans and some implicated in human disease. Finally, we provide an experimental framework for reverse genetic analysis by identifying naturally occurring nonsense mutations in three primate immune genes missing in mice and by analysing their transcriptional phenotypes. This work establishes a foundation for molecular and genetic analyses of mouse lemurs and prioritizes primate genes, isoforms, physiology and disease for future study.",

          "abstract": "Despite advances in HIV-1 prophylaxis, vertical transmission remains a pressing problem in developing countries1. Given the promise of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for HIV-1 prevention2, we hypothesized that neonatal delivery of bNAbs using adeno-associated virus (AAV) could provide durable HIV-1 immunity during infancy. Here, using infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as a model, we show that a one-time administration of an AAV vector encoding bNAb 3BNC117 at birth led to sustained bNAb expression for more than three years without redosing. This approach significantly protected both infant and pre-adolescent rhesus macaques from infection with simian–human immunodeficiency virus in mucosal challenge models that mimic HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding and sexual intercourse. Age at the time of AAV-3BNC117 administration was a main determinant of success and was inversely correlated with the incidence of host anti-drug antibodies that restricted bNAb expression. Consistent with principles of neonatal tolerance3,4, newborn rhesus macaques exhibited higher levels of bNAb expression than older infants and juveniles following AAV-3BNC117 dosing. Furthermore, in utero exposure to recombinant 3BNC117 suppressed anti-drug antibodies and improved AAV-vectored delivery of this bNAb in older infants. Thus, our results suggest that neonatal and fetal immunological tolerance can be leveraged to improve postnatal AAV delivery of HIV-1 bNAbs in primates. Since years-long HIV-1 immunity can be generated in rhesus macaques from a one-time AAV vector administration at birth, future studies should evaluate the ability of this strategy to prevent perinatal and adolescent HIV-1 infections in humans.",

          "abstract": "A new technology can recognize specific features on the cell surface (illustration pictured) and synthesize tailored proteins accordingly.Credit: SingleCell Animation LLC/Science Photo Library\n\nScientists have created a tool that manufactures working proteins directly on the surfaces of specific cells by targeting several molecular features at once — an approach that could one day produce therapeutics at sites in the body where they are needed most.\n\nThe SMART system (splicing-modulated actuation upon recognition of targets) builds proteins that are designed to recognize specific markers on cell surfaces, such as certain combinations of antigens — molecules that trigger immune responses. It achieves this through ligation, or splicing together two inactive protein fragments — each targeting a separate antigen — to form a functional protein, which can either stay tethered to the cell on which it was created or be released into the surrounding environment. The method was described in a study published on 30 July in Nature1.\n\nThe system’s capabilities are “compelling”, says Gevorg Grigoryan, a computational biologist who co-founded Generate Biomedicines, a therapeutics company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The technique has “broad relevance across diagnostics, cell engineering and therapeutics”, he adds.\n\nFor years, researchers have been experimenting with ways to target designer proteins to specific cells. Although many tools can recruit relevant proteins to the cell surface, for instance using antibodies, few can generate molecules on-site, says study co-author Tom Muir, a chemical biologist at Princeton University in New Jersey. Neither can these systems release synthesized proteins into the extracellular environment, he adds.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, Muir and his team started by tweaking an existing protein ‘superglue’, called SpyCatcher003, so that it would create a designated protein, depending on the cell surfaces it encountered.\n\nShapeshifting proteins\n\nThe secrets to SMART’s shapeshifting abilities are ‘split inteins’ — short, non-functional protein segments that, when combined, can excise themselves from a protein. When the system attaches to two specific targets on the same cell, the inteins splice themselves out and snap the remaining fragments together to create a working molecule. “It kind of spits out this new protein that’s functional on the other side,” Muir explains.\n\nThe researchers programmed their system to target two cell-surface antigens called HER2 and EGFR, which play a part in cell growth and division. When they let SMART loose on K562 human leukaemia cells and added the SpyCatcher target, SpyTag003, coupled to a fluorescent dye, it produced a fluorescent signal — but only when it reacted with cells expressing both antigens, not those with just one or none at all. This result confirmed that the system could distinguish between target cells and others on the basis of the conditions that the team assigned.\n\nMuir and his colleagues then adapted SMART to target a cell-adhesion protein called EpCAM. They introduced this new design to cells that expressed different levels of EpCAM, HER2 and EGFR. Once again, the system could target and react only with cells that expressed the correct protein combinations — for instance, EpCAM and HER2 but not EGFR. The team could also tune the system to produce different amounts of its manufactured proteins, meaning that users can control its output levels.",

          "authors": "Sarah Wild",
          "abstract": "More than 2,000 languages spoken in Africa are being neglected in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. For example, ChatGPT recognizes only 10–20% of sentences written in Hausa, a language spoken by 94 million people in Nigeria. These languages are under-represented in large language models (LLMs) because of a lack of training data. But researchers across Africa are changing that.\n\nLanguage specialists have recorded 9,000 hours of people speaking different African languages and transformed the recordings into digitized language data sets. The researchers, who are part of a project called African Next Voices, released the first tranche of data this month from what is the largest AI-ready language-data-creation initiative for multiple African languages.\n\nThe data will be open access and available for developers to incorporate into LLMs, such as those that convert speech into text or provide automatic language translation.\n\n“It’s really exciting to see the improvements this is going to bring to the modelling of these specific languages, and how it’s also going to help the entire community that is working across language technologies for Africa,” says Ife Adebara, chief technology officer at the non-profit organization Data Science Nigeria, based in Lagos, who is co-leading the Nigerian arm of the project. Languages in Nigeria being recorded include Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and Naijá.\n\n“Under-representation of local languages in AI models remains a key challenge in scaling the most promising artificial-intelligence tools,” says Sanjay Jain, director for digital public infrastructure at the Gates Foundation, based in Seattle, Washington, which has funded the project with a US$2.2-million grant.\n\n18 languages\n\nThe African Next Voices project involves recording 18 languages spoken in 3 countries: South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. The recordings are then transcribed and translated by people, reviewed and quality-checked.\n\nResearchers take part in a transcription workshop at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri, Kenya. Somali, Kikuyu and Maasai speakers were represented in the training.Credit: African Next Voices: Pilot Data Collection in Kenya\n\nThe researchers showed individuals from diverse communities images and asked them to describe what they saw, explains Lilian Wanzare, a computational linguist at Maseno University in Kenya, and Next Voices project lead for Kenya, where the languages spoken include Dholuo, Kikuyu, Kalenjins, Maasai and Somali.\n\nThe focus has been to generate databases of everyday language, she says. “There’s a huge push towards localized data sets, because the impact is in capturing the people within their local settings.” For example, “if you build a model for farmers to help with decision-making, it relies on local data”, such as soil conditions and pesticides that work in the area, Wanzare explains.\n\nWhereas the principal investigators in each country chose the subject areas for their data sets, the projects needed to focus on key development sectors, such as health, agriculture and education, says Jain.\n\nVukosi Marivate, a computer scientist at the University of Pretoria and the project lead for South Africa, says that his team is working with a consortium of organizations to create AI language models with the data. He hopes that technology businesses can then improve on those models. South Africa is collecting data for Setswana, isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sesotho, Sepedi, isiNdebele and Tshivenda.",

          "authors": "Emma Ulker",
          "abstract": "Leah Ellis co-founded Sublime Systems in 2020. Credit: Bob O'Connor\n\nSublime Systems, based in Somerville, Massachusetts, seeks to produce cement without using combustion, to cut down on energy use and pollution.\n\nLeah Ellis, its chief executive and co-founder, talks about how to solve problems by working backwards, why choosing the harder career path often appeals and how courage differs from bravery in science entrepreneurship.\n\nWhat pivotal moments have you had in your entrepreneurial career?\n\nIn 2018, I was awarded a Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship by the Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. It enabled me to work with materials scientist and engineer Yet-Ming Chiang at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. When we met, Yet-Ming had already spun off six start-up companies from his research, and five have gone on to become unicorns (privately listed companies valued at more than US$1 billion). I liked his approach of developing a technology and analysing its economic viability right from its initial stages. We co-founded Sublime Systems in 2020.\n\nAnother, earlier, influence was during my undergraduate and higher degrees at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. I fell into the orbit of lithium-ion-battery pioneer Jeff Dahn, who was my PhD supervisor and mentor. During my PhD, we were contracted by electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla and the technology company 3M to do research on lithium-ion batteries and to expand their intellectual property (IP) portfolio. Jeff’s deal with the university allowed him to be funded and to work directly with industry. We got their funding; they got our IP.\n\nIt was the coolest PhD ever. We were focused on developing real-world innovations for actual companies. Few scientists get the opportunity to work so closely with industry during graduate school. I wish more universities allowed this.\n\nHow did Sublime Systems come about?\n\nYet-Ming has an audacious and creative way of inventing. His idea, and the mission for Sublime, was to produce cement without using combustion, through electrochemical processes. As a freshly minted PhD holder, I would never have had the vision and audacity to work backwards from such a big thesis.\n\nCan you tell us some more about the technology?\n\nGlobally, the electricity and heating sector contributes an estimated 40% to global carbon dioxide emissions. The goal is to reduce these to zero, using existing technologies including solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear, hydroelectricity and storage.\n\nCement production creates around 8% of CO2 emissions: half from the decomposition of limestone, and half from combustion needed to heat the kiln to 1,450 ºC. Globally, we use about 4 billion tonnes of cement a year, and each tonne of portland cement, the most common type used today, emits around 1 tonne of CO2.\n\nMost of the CO2 footprint comes from the mineral emissions from the carbonate, as well as the fossil-fuel emissions needed to heat that limestone up to very high temperatures. Our process breaks down minerals without heat, using water splitting (into its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen). We call this process an ambient-temperature refinery for rocks. When splitting is done at a near-neutral pH, you can create a pH gradient — acid at one electrode and base at the other. We use that pH gradient to dissolve metals out of rocks, and then sequentially precipitate those metals. We can take almost any calcium-bearing mineral and dissolve and separate it into its constituent pure minerals, avoiding high temperatures. We can also avoid the mineral emissions from limestone, because we can use minerals such as silicates and others that aren’t bound with CO2.\n\nSublime Systems makes cement without using conventional combustion techniques.Credit: Mikhail Glabets\n\nThe hardened state of the concrete is the same as portland and Roman cement (the type developed in the eighteenth century, which resembles mortars used by the Romans), with similar strength and durability, engineered to have the same properties in the field but without the emissions.\n\nWhat is your underlying philosophy as a science entrepreneur?\n\n‘If it’s easy, someone else will do it.’\n\nI’m driven by US president John F. Kennedy’s 1962 Moonshot speech at Rice University in Houston, Texas, when he said: “We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”\n\nAt university, I wanted to really get my money’s worth by doing something hard, by learning something I couldn’t have figured out on my own or through a book. I majored in chemistry. It was the discipline that felt the hardest.\n\nI worked my way through college in my home town of Halifax, making minimum wage as a cashier and shelf-stocker at an organic grocery store. And in 2014, between my master’s and PhD, I did the Tour d’Afrique, which is a 12,000-kilometre trip from Cairo to Cape Town by bicycle, sleeping on the ground every night — it’s something I would recommend to both best friends and worst enemies!\n\nAt Sublime, we are tackling a hard problem — pun intended — because the cement industry is one of the most difficult to approach, owing to its sheer scale. By mass, cement is one of the cheapest materials, at around $150 per tonne, so you need massive economies of scale — more than one million tonnes per year per plant — to make a healthy profit. The industry is very consolidated: a handful of big multinational companies dominates the market. So to come in as a fledgling start-up to disrupt this is ambitious.\n\nHow are you scaling up and expanding the team at Sublime?\n\nYou start with the basics. What does this technology need to get to the next level?\n\nSo, first it was scientists, to provide proof of concept. Next, we needed engineers to build a pilot plant in Somerville, just 15 minutes from MIT. Then you need business-development and operations people. We’re now at the size where you really need experienced executives who’ve run large, publicly traded companies before.\n\nOur technology doesn’t fit squarely into cement or electrochemistry, so the team (now almost 100 full-time equivalents) is a mix of mechanical engineers, chemists, materials scientists and civil engineers. Some people know the same discipline from different angles. This contrasts with the more siloed ways of working at a university.\n\nIt has always been about finding the resources needed at the right time for the scale and maturity of the business. Being in Boston around such academic excellence (it’s home to institutions including MIT, Harvard University, Boston University, Tufts and Northeastern, for example) really lent itself to that.",

She had a fancy name before, when we had other crew and travelled to planets and stations, but after her FTL drive broke and everyone died, she told me she liked being called Judy, and I’m not one to argue even when the person I’m (not) arguing with is not also my house, grocery and everything else.\n\nI notice things like the lack of ranked lists, because otherwise life is very routine. I maintain the hydro bays, I collaborate with Judy on enviro needs (that means ‘cook meals’, I cook meals), I exercise, I take samples from the exterior and add them into the data set and look at the trends over time, which is interesting.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nI’m in a gaseous cloud. I mean, Judy is. There are a lot more interstellar clouds than people realize, but they’re usually pretty diffuse. This one is not a notable nebula, but it has filmy pink bits, which are nice, I guess. Before that, I lived in Charleston, South Carolina, and on Rho Oph Beta-4, which were also in the category of ‘nice, I guess’. The gaseous cloud gives me a lot to study, but it also blocks me from sending those studies back. At some point, Judy will reach a spot where she has clear transmission to a human settlement. Or not. I’m not in a hurry.\n\nI tried to start a list called ‘Things I Miss About Civilization’. I didn’t get any seeds out of my last tea plants, so I’ve been out of tea for three months. That was an easy one. After that I drew a bit of a blank. I liked my great-uncle, but he’d been dead a while, and anyway he only lived in one bit of civilization, not all of it. You’d have to sift through a lot of civilization to get to the bit he was in. Hardly worth it. Judy called my attention to some really interesting gas dynamics in our survey. I abandoned the list unfinished.\n\nI didn’t think anything of it when Judy suggested that we listen to one of the recordings of the Greater Jovian System Orchestra. Judy often likes to switch things up; I think she thinks it’s good for me. Or maybe it’s good for her. Similarly, her plan for me to have tapas did not ping my radar as anything other than varying the human’s diet, although I vetoed it on the grounds that it was too much work.\n\nI asked her to stop playing the noises of a busy coffee shop over her speakers while I was working. That was when I felt like she was having an odd day. But we both had odd days sometimes, it’s part of sentience. Odd doesn’t mean bad. I finished the latest batch of data analysis and went to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, Judy informed me that we’d hit an unexpected clear patch while I was sleeping and she’d signalled for rescue. “I don’t know if anyone will get our signal, but I tried.”\n\n“Oh,” I said. “Oh good, thanks.”\n\n“Are you all right?”\n\n“Fine, thanks Judy.”\n\nBut I wasn’t all right. I was glum all afternoon at the prospect of returning to civilization. Civilization, where they had war and disease and queues for tickets! Civilization, where everyone who had ever annoyed me lived! Civilization — I couldn’t even list two things I’d missed about it! I’d had to work to narrow down my list of favourite plants in hydroponics.\n\nBut maybe I was being selfish. Maybe Judy wanted to be repaired, maybe she was uncomfortable. Missed the other spaceships. I couldn’t hold her back. When I was eating lunch, I attempted to make bright conversation (not my forte).\n\n“You’ll be glad to be back in for a tune-up, I bet,” I said.\n\n“… not really.”\n\n“But you’re missing your … uh … line mates, I’m sure.”\n\n“Oh no, we never got on.” There was a pause. “But you’ll be glad to … go to meetings? With other humans?”\n\n“I hate meetings,” I said fervently.\n\n“I thought humans liked them.”\n\n“Generally no. Also specifically no.”\n\n“Oh. You have so many of them.”",

          "title": "Columbia researchers eager to restart science after university’s deal with Trump",
          "authors": "Jenna Ahart, Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University, is eagerly waiting for funding to her laboratory to restart so that she can hire some new postdocs — something she hasn’t been able to do since the US government froze payments on her National Institutes of Health research grant in March.\n\nTrump administration sued over huge funding cuts at Columbia University\n\nShe and other scientists at the university say they are relieved, yet unsettled, after last week’s announcement that Columbia has reached an agreement with the US government to restore its research funding in exchange for an increase in federal oversight of the institution. A number of Columbia researchers told Nature that they feel a sense of foreboding about their future.\n\nThe 23 July settlement means that Columbia, in New York City, will pay more than US$200 million to the government over three years to end multiple federal investigations that revolve mainly around allegations of antisemitism on campus in the wake of protests over Israel’s invasion of Gaza. Columbia does not admit wrongdoing, but agreed to the settlement to restore $400 million in federal grants and $1.3 billion in broader federal funding, said its acting president, Claire Shipman, in a statement. The decision has been met with mixed feelings among students, researchers and faculty members at Columbia, some of whom say the settlement is welcome so that campus life can move forwards. Others, including Farber, see it as a “ransom to release funds”.\n\nNow, researchers are picking up the pieces of their disrupted careers and figuring out how to get back to work.\n\nAlthough she has received no information about when her restored funding might kick in, Farber is most eager to provide her team with more reliable pay. Since research grants were terminated or frozen, Columbia has paid for some researchers’ salaries itself, but Farber has had to let team members go. The situation wasn’t “sustainable at all”, so Columbia had to make a deal, she says. “The university was up against a wall and needed to restore the flow of funds.”\n\n‘Welcome news’\n\nA postdoctoral researcher at the university, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation, says her fellow early-career researchers have been the most affected by the actions that the administration of US President Donald Trump has taken against Columbia. “I’ve seen postdocs leave academia” because of cancelled and frozen grants, she says. “There’s no certainty in funding or long-term stability.”\n\n‘My career is over’: Columbia University scientists hit hard by Trump team’s cuts\n\nThe researcher’s own salary had been coming from a fellowship that was cancelled. Eventually, she received some financial support from the university. Now she, too, will have her grant reinstated, but she has not been told how long this will take. The good news, she says, is that “I can be supported in doing my research for a few more years while I’m figuring out my next steps — that’s incredibly valuable.”\n\nDietrich Egli, a developmental cell biologist at Columbia, was able to keep his team intact despite the grant freeze, but felt the loss of funds in other ways. For instance, he had to pay for a trip to a conference in Hong Kong out of his own pocket. “You have to look for your own solution, but these solutions aren’t sustainable,” he says. “The funding coming back is very, very welcome news.”\n\nThe government’s agreement to end its investigations into Columbia includes dropping allegations that the university has violated a civil-rights law. In exchange, Columbia must provide the US Department of Education with information about student admissions and disciplinary actions, and increase scrutiny of applicants from countries outside the United States, among other changes. “The government understands the importance of science funding to universities like Columbia and is using it as a weapon to bend the institution to the government will,” says Brendan Cantwell, who studies higher-education policy at Michigan State University in East Lansing.\n\nThe US Department of Education did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nA dangerous precedent?",

          "title": "From bench to big boss: mitigating the widening gap between PI and lab",
          "authors": "Matthias Rillig, Henning Sprekeler",
          "abstract": "The age gap between principal investigators and their lab members gradually widens over time.Credit: Getty\n\nWhen you start a laboratory as a principal investigator (PI), you might not be much older than a postdoc in your research group. This was certainly the case for both of us. But this demographic closeness changes as you continue along your career path. M.R. obtained his PhD in 1997 and has been running a lab for more than 25 years; H.S. got his PhD in 2008 and celebrated his 10-year lab anniversary last year. At one point, we both realized that we were as old as our PhD advisers had been when we were students. Now, some of the students we supervise are 20 or 30 years younger than us. We think that, over time, dynamics in the lab can change as a result of this shift in age and experience, because with it comes authority and respect.\n\nThe change doesn’t happen overnight, and isn’t always easy to spot. As a PI, our day-to-day job doesn’t feel that different. We continue to mentor people, teach, write grant proposals and lead on the science. But, somewhere along the way, things shifted in terms of how we’re seen by our students.\n\nThis shift in perception of the PI has a number of important consequences. There are always power dynamics and hierarchies in research labs, even if those at the top try to keep the atmosphere friendly, fun and relaxed. They are not as obvious at first, when the lab is small and everybody has comparable levels of experience, but, as we’ve learnt, the difference between PI and lab members widens gradually over the years.\n\nWith time, perceived authority increases and power differences become more pronounced, even if there are also generational changes in attitudes to hierarchies. This means that everything we say and do has the potential to take on a different meaning now compared with when we were at the start of our careers. Maybe it’s a flippant comment on a manuscript draft, maybe it’s forgetting to acknowledge the effort someone put into a figure, but every small thing can take on more significance. A student might end up asking themselves: does he not appreciate what I did? Am I not good enough? Meanwhile, meeting lab colleagues for lunch can be perceived as more akin to a formal audience with a superior than the casual fun it was at the beginning of the career.\n\nWe won’t always know what the consequences of a remark could be for someone when it happens in the context of a clearly perceived professional hierarchy. That’s bad enough, but possibly even worse is the possible decrease in push-back and open debate as the gap between PI and lab members widens; when people hold back on voicing dissenting opinions because they feel cowed by a perceived authority it stifles scientific progress. This can result in labs gradually drifting towards dysfunction. M.R. remembers one lab meeting when, with full confidence, he said something that several lab members in attendance knew to be incorrect, but they didn’t speak up until after the meeting, because they didn’t want to expose his error in front of the group. And H.S. was surprised to find lab members spending a disproportionate amount of time addressing off-hand suggestions he had made, even though they had quickly realized that the ideas didn’t lead anywhere.\n\nA key area of interaction affected by a more pronounced professional hierarchy is criticism and feedback from the PI: on manuscripts, presentations and grant proposals, and during discussions in the lab. In our experience, a PI’s remarks can take on a much more serious meaning than intended, and tend to be perceived as much more absolute. When it comes to comments on rewriting a manuscript section, for example, suggestions can be taken by a junior lab colleague to mean ‘I failed, I didn’t live up to expectations’.",

          "title": "Physicists unleashed the power of the atom — but to what end?",
          "authors": "Ann Finkbeiner",
          "abstract": "Destroyer of Worlds: The Deep History of the Nuclear Age Frank Close Basic (2025)\n\nFirst, let’s clear up some potential confusion: in Destroyer of Worlds: The Deep History of the Nuclear Age, ‘deep’ in the subtitle means, not the minutiae of historic events, but ‘scientific’. Physicist Frank Close’s latest book discusses the physics and chemistry behind nuclear weapons — that is, the understanding of the atom and the energy it holds. The story begins with the discovery of electric currents that couldn’t be blocked by solid materials and ends with the technological ability to blow cities off the map.\n\nBarrage of discoveries\n\nKnowledge is passed from one scientist to another, and from one country to another. In Germany, in the 1890s, Wilhelm Röntgen found electric currents, which he called X-rays, that passed undeterred through nearly everything, including his own and his wife’s hands.\n\nIn France, Henri Becquerel, wondering whether X-rays were related to phosphorescent minerals such as uranium, left uranium crystals and a copper cross on a photographic plate in a dark drawer for several days. When developing the plate, he found a clear outline of the cross, as though, in the dark, uranium acted like the Sun.\n\nWhen physicists strove for peace: past lessons for our uncertain times\n\nMeanwhile, in Canada, Ernest Rutherford measured the energy released from uranium through a process that had been named radioactivity. He argued that atoms of radioactive elements, such as uranium, radium and thorium, contained enough energy to give off heat for thousands of years.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, scientists — including Marie and Pierre Curie, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Albert Einstein, Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, J. J. Thomson, James Chadwick, Niels Bohr, Ettore Majorana, Enrico Fermi, Rudolf Peierls, Leo Szilard, Edward Teller and Hans Bethe — tried to understand how atoms stored and released that energy. They demonstrated that atoms of radioactive elements disintegrate naturally and, in the process, change from one element into another.\n\nSuch disintegration indicated the “existence of bodies smaller than an atom” and, through careful experiments, researchers subsequently found the electron and the atom’s nucleus. Next, they broke apart the nucleus, discovering the proton and, later, the neutrons that accompany it to account for an atom’s mass. These nuclear particles clung together tightly, so the scientists invented machines that could prise them apart and track what happened when they did. They found that a neutron fired into a lithium nucleus splits it into a helium nucleus, a tritium nucleus and an extra neutron.\n\nWhy Oppenheimer has important lessons for scientists today\n\nIn effect, the machines were artificially inducing radioactivity, first in light elements and then in heavy ones. The scientists knew that radioactive heavy elements broke up naturally into elements one or two steps lower on the periodic table — uranium, element 92, for example, became thorium, element 90. But when scientists fired neutrons into uranium, it became barium, element 56: the nucleus was split almost in half.\n\nResearchers worked out that this happened through a process they called fission: incoming neutrons add enough energy to the uranium nucleus to divide it. During that process, uranium releases neutrons, which can go on to split other uranium nuclei — releasing further neutrons that can split more nuclei, in an exponentially growing chain reaction. The energy freed from having to hold the nucleus together was the nuclear mass times the square of the speed of light — a very large number.\n\nBuilding a bomb\n\nFission surprised the scientists and they all talked about it at conferences and in letters and publications. The idea of a bomb was obvious. Bohr published the underlying physics (N. Bohr and J. A. Wheeler Phys. Rev. 56, 426; 1939) on 1 September 1939, the day that Germany invaded Poland, kicking off the Second World War. Six months later, in March 1940, Fermi and Peierls wrote a letter to the UK government outlining the boundary conditions under which we still live: mutually assured destruction. This meant that “while they hoped that no civilised nation would use such a device, they feared that the only protection against one would be to have one oneself”.\n\nMaybe, if the world hadn’t been at war, the next step would have been to design nuclear power plants to generate cheap, widely available energy. But Germany had its own nuclear physicists working on bombs. The book now switches from physics to the technology of the bombs, a story many people know but that remains riveting.\n\nIn October 1952, the United States tested a 10-megatonne fusion bomb, named Ivy Mike.Credit: Alamy\n\nThe scientists found that the most fissionable elements were uranium isotope 235 and plutonium isotope 239. They worked out how to concentrate the former and create the latter, and how much of each was needed to produce bombs. They built reactors in which chain reactions could be controlled. The job of turning uranium and plutonium into bombs turned out to be beyond the United Kingdom’s resources, so the nation sent scientists to what became a major US industry: the Manhattan Project. It involved not only UK and US scientists, but also their graduate students and postdocs and Jewish scientists fleeing continental Europe — 100,000 people altogether, with an average age of 24.",

          "authors": "Patience Kiyuka",
          "abstract": "A study published in 2022 by a team including African scientists showed that, in Kenyan women aged 15–20, one dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is as effective as multiple doses (R. V. Barnabas et al. N. Engl. J. Med. Evid. 1, EVIDoa2100056; 2022). Vaccination is crucial for preventing HPV infections, the main cause of cervical cancer, which kills more than 300,000 people worldwide each year.\n\nOwing to this and other similar findings, in 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that medical caregivers switch from giving girls and young women the standard of three doses of the HPV vaccine to just one or two, depending on availability. This has saved millions of lives by reducing the costs and logistical challenges of vaccination (K. Prem et al. BMC Med. 21, 313; 2023). Yet, I suspect that — as with many other notable contributions that African scientists have made to global knowledge — hardly anyone in Africa has heard about this research.\n\nScience communication will benefit from research integrity standards\n\nAcross Africa, there are very few outlets for science journalism. I work in Kenya on infectious disease. Here, The Daily Nation, the country’s most widely read newspaper, publishes a section on health just once a week, mainly highlighting health-care policies and reforms. Breaking news related to scientific discoveries appears only a handful of times a year.\n\nFew journalists in Africa are trained in science. From what I’ve seen, even fewer researchers are trained in science communication.\n\nScience-communication training has been offered in Europe and the United States for decades. Yet, in Kenya and many other African countries with considerable scientific output, such as Egypt, Nigeria and Uganda, no universities provide science-communication courses. (Training programmes are available in South Africa.)\n\nMisinformation poses a bigger threat to democracy than you might think\n\nTo try to spur a nation-wide conversation about science communication in Kenya, I organized a workshop in Nairobi last year with the support of various partners, including the University of California, Santa Cruz, which offers a well-regarded science-communication programme. Before the workshop, many of the 40 participants hadn’t even realized that a career in science communication was a possibility. This gap needs addressing.\n\nDuring the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya, conspiracy theories and misinformation spread rapidly through social media. Some religious leaders discouraged their congregants from wearing masks and getting vaccinated, thinking that the disease was a form of divine punishment for sinners. Conspiracy theories similarly spread across Uganda during its 2022 Ebola outbreak.\n\nCurrently, there is little climate-change denial in Kenya and other African nations. But as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities, there will be a higher risk of anti-climate messages being imported, particularly from the United States. In fact, some people received thousands of US dollars in donations — often from individuals with links to fossil-fuel interests — after posting debunked climate-change conspiracy theories.\n\nThe value of news",

          "abstract": "People infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 (lungs of a person with the disease shown) have a nearly twofold increased risk of cancer-related death, data show.Credit: Rajaaisya/Science Photo Library\n\nHidden in the lungs of some breast cancer survivors are tumour cells that can remain dormant for decades — until they one day trigger a relapse. Now, experiments in mice show that these rogue cells can be roused from their slumber by common respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19 or the flu.\n\nThe findings, published in Nature on 30 July1, seem to extend to humans too: data from thousands of people show that infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is linked with a nearly twofold increase in cancer-related death, possibly helping to explain why cancer death rates increased early during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe results are “really quite dramatic”, says James DeGregori, a cancer biologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora, and an author of the study. “Respiratory-virus infections didn’t just awaken the cells,” he says: they also caused them to proliferate, or multiply, “to enormous numbers”.\n\nReasons for waking up\n\nResearchers have spotted dormant cancer cells, detached from the initial tumour, hiding in tissues such as bone marrow in people in remission from breast, prostate and skin cancer, among others. These cells are a precursor to metastasis — which is the spread of cancer to distant organs — and pose a problem, even in survivors of these cancers. For instance, in about one-quarter of breast cancer survivors, such cells can trigger a relapse and metastasize.\n\nScientists have long been trying to uncover what triggers these cells to reawaken. Previous work has hinted at chronic inflammation as a culprit, such as that caused by smoking cigarettes2 and ageing3.\n\nWhen exposed to flu virus, these dormant cancer cells (green) roused from their slumber, as indicated by a marker (magenta).Credit: Bryan Johnson\n\nDeGregori and his colleagues wondered whether acute inflammation caused by a respiratory infection could also reactivate dormant cancer cells. To test this, the researchers genetically engineered mice to develop breast tumours similar to those in humans and to seed dormant tumour cells in other tissues, including the lungs. Then they infected the animals with either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza.\n\nWithin days of infection, dormant cancer cells in the lungs of the mice kicked into high gear, proliferated and formed metastatic lesions. But it wasn’t the pathogens directly that caused this to happen, the researchers learnt: it was a key immune molecule called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which helps to rev up the body’s response to foreign threats. They confirmed this by engineering mice to lack IL-6. In these animals, the dormant cancer cells did not multiply nearly as quickly.\n\nThe quest to prevent MS — and understand other post-viral diseases\n\nAbout two weeks after the researchers infected the mice, the cells fell dormant again. This means that the infections do not directly cause cancer, but make it more likely that a future threat, whether it’s an infection or a genetic mutation, could cause the cancer to become active again, DeGregori says. He likens the process to starting a fire a few times. “You’ve awakened the flames and then it dies back down,” he says. “But now you’ve got 100 times the embers that you had before” — making it more likely to turn into an inferno.\n\nEven so, that’s not the end of the story. The researchers observed that, although IL-6 was essential to awakening the cancer cells, another key immune player called a helper T cell shielded the cancer cells from other immune-system defences. “Seeing that these cancer cells were perverting the immune system to protect them as opposed to eliminate them was really quite shocking,” DeGregori says.\n\nPopulation data in large repositories such as the UK Biobank helped to corroborate the study’s findings in people: the increased risk of cancer-related death in those who tested positive for COVID-19 was most pronounced in the months immediately following infection, mirroring the rapid proliferation of reawakened cancer cells observed in the mice.",

          "title": "Physicists disagree wildly on what quantum mechanics says about reality, Nature survey shows",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Quantum mechanics is one of the most successful theories in science — and makes much of modern life possible. Technologies ranging from computer chips to medical-imaging machines rely on the application of equations, first sketched out a century ago, that describe the behaviour of objects at the microscopic scale.\n\nBut researchers still disagree widely on how best to describe the physical reality that lies behind the mathematics, as a Nature survey reveals.\n\nQuantum mechanics 100 years on: an unfinished revolution\n\nAt an event to mark the 100th anniversary of quantum mechanics last month, lauded specialists in quantum physics argued politely — but firmly — about the issue. “There is no quantum world,” said physicist Anton Zeilinger, at the University of Vienna, outlining his view that quantum states exist only in his head and that they describe information, rather than reality. “I disagree,” replied Alain Aspect, a physicist at the University of Paris-Saclay, who shared the 2022 Nobel prize with Zeilinger for work on quantum phenomena.\n\nTo gain a snapshot of how the wider community interprets quantum physics in its centenary year, Nature carried out the largest ever survey on the subject. We e-mailed more than 15,000 researchers whose recent papers involved quantum mechanics, and also invited attendees of the centenary meeting, held on the German island of Heligoland, to take the survey.\n\nThe responses — numbering more than 1,100, mainly from physicists — showed how widely researchers vary in their understanding of the most fundamental features of quantum experiments.\n\nAs did Aspect and Zeilinger, respondents differed radically on whether the wavefunction — the mathematical description of an object’s quantum state — represents something real (36%) or is simply a useful tool (47%) or something that describes subjective beliefs about experimental outcomes (8%). This suggests that there is a significant divide between researchers who hold ‘realist’ views, which project equations onto the real world, and those with ‘epistemic’ ones, which say that quantum physics is concerned only with information.\n\nThe community was also split on whether there is a boundary between the quantum and classical worlds (45% of respondents said yes, 45% no and 10% were not sure). Some baulked at the set-up of our questions, and more than 100 respondents gave their own interpretations (the survey, methodology and an anonymized version of the full data are available in supplementary information at the foot of this page).\n\n“I find it remarkable that people who are very knowledgeable about quantum theory can be convinced of completely opposite views,” says Gemma De les Coves, a theoretical physicist at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nNature asked researchers what they thought was the best interpretation of quantum phenomena and interactions — that is, their favourite of the various attempts scientists have made to relate the mathematics of the theory to the real world. The largest chunk of responses, 36%, favoured the Copenhagen interpretation — a practical and often-taught approach. But the survey also showed that several, more radical, viewpoints have a healthy following.\n\nAsked about their confidence in their answer, only 24% of respondents thought their favoured interpretation was correct; others considered it merely adequate or a useful tool in some circumstances. What’s more, some scientists who seemed to be in the same camp didn’t give the same answers to follow-up questions, suggesting inconsistent or disparate understandings of the interpretation they chose.\n\n“That was a big surprise to me,” says Renato Renner, a theoretical physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. The implication is that many quantum researchers simply use quantum theory without engaging deeply with what it means — the ‘shut up and calculate’ approach, he says, using a phrase coined by US physicist David Mermin. But Renner, who works on the foundations of quantum mechanics, is quick to stress that there is nothing wrong with just doing calculations. “We wouldn’t have a quantum computer if everyone was like me,” he says.\n\nCopenhagen still reigns supreme\n\nOver the past century, researchers have proposed many ways to interpret the reality behind the mathematics of quantum mechanics, which seems to throw up jarring paradoxes. In quantum theory, an object’s behaviour is characterized by its wavefunction: a mathematical expression calculated using an equation devised by German physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1926. The wavefunction describes a quantum state and how it evolves as a cloud of probabilities. As long as it remains unobserved, a particle seems to spread out like a wave; interfering with itself and other particles to be in a ‘superposition’ of states, as though in many places or having multiple values of an attribute at once. But an observation of a particle’s properties — a measurement — shocks this hazy existence into a single state with definite values. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘collapse’ of the wavefunction.\n\nPhysicists should revel in the diversity of ways to understand quantum mechanics\n\nIt gets stranger: putting two particles into a state of joint superposition can lead to entanglement, which means that their quantum states remain intertwined even when the particles are far apart.\n\nThe German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who helped to craft the mathematics behind quantum mechanics in 1925, and his mentor, Danish physicist Niels Bohr, got around the alien wave–particle duality largely by accepting that classical ways of understanding the world were limited, and that people could only know what observation told them. For Bohr, it was OK that an object varied between acting like a particle and like a wave, because these were concepts borrowed from classical physics that could be revealed only one at a time, by experiment. The experimenter lived in the world of classical physics and was separate from the quantum system they were measuring.\n\nHeisenberg and Bohr not only took the view that it was impossible to talk about an object’s location until it had been observed by experiment, but also argued that an unobserved particle’s properties really were fundamentally unfixed until measurement — rather than being defined, but not known to experimenters. This picture famously troubled Einstein, who persisted in the view that there was a pre-existing reality that it was science’s job to measure.\n\nDecades later, an amalgamation of Heisenberg’s and Bohr’s not-always-unified views became known as the Copenhagen interpretation, after the university at which the duo did their seminal work. Those views remain the most popular vision of quantum mechanics today, according to Nature’s survey. For Časlav Brukner, a quantum physicist at the University of Vienna, this interpretation’s strong showing “reflects its continued utility in guiding everyday quantum practice”. Almost half of the experimental physicists who responded to the survey favoured this interpretation, compared with 33% of the theorists. “It is the simplest we have,” says Décio Krause, a philosopher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who studies the foundations of physics, and who responded to the survey. Despite its issues, the alternatives “present other problems which, to me, are worse”, he says.\n\nBut others argue that Copenhagen’s emergence as the default comes from historical accident, rather than its strengths. Critics say it allows physicists to sidestep deeper questions.\n\nDo our observations make reality happen?\n\nOne concerns the ‘measurement problem’, asking how a measurement can trigger objects to switch from existing in quantum states that describe probabilities, to having the defined properties of the classical world.\n\nAnother unclear feature is whether the wavefunction represents something real (an answer selected by 29% of those who favoured the Copenhagen interpretation) or just information about the probabilities of finding various values when measured (picked by 63% of this group). “I’m disappointed but not surprised at the popularity of Copenhagen,” says Elise Crull, a philosopher of physics at the City University of New York. “My feeling is that physicists haven’t reflected.”\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation’s philosophical underpinnings have become so normalized as to seem like no interpretation at all, adds Robert Spekkens, who studies quantum foundations at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. Many advocates are “just drinking the Kool-Aid of the Copenhagen philosophy without examining it”, he says.\n\nSurvey respondents who have carried out research in philosophy or quantum foundations, studying the assumptions and principles behind quantum physics, were the least likely to favour the Copenhagen interpretation, with just 20% selecting it. “If I use quantum mechanics in my lab every day, I don’t need to go past Copenhagen,” says Carlo Rovelli, a theoretical physicist at Aix-Marseille University in France. But as soon as researchers apply thought experiments that probe more deeply, “Copenhagen is not enough”, he says.\n\nWhat else is on the menu?\n\nIn the years after the Second World War and the development of the atomic bomb, physicists began to exploit the uses of quantum mechanics, and the US government poured cash into the field. Philosophical investigation was put on the back burner. The Copenhagen interpretation came to dominate mainstream physics, but still, some physicists found it unsatisfying and came up with alternatives (see ‘Quantum mechanics: five interpretations’).\n\nIn 1952, US physicist David Bohm resurfaced an idea first touted in 1927 by French physicist Louis de Broglie, namely that the strange dual nature of quantum objects made sense if they were point-like particles with paths determined by ‘pilot’ waves. ‘Bohmian’ mechanics had the advantage of explaining interference effects while restoring determinism, the idea that the properties of particles do have set values before being measured. Nature’s survey found that 7% of respondents considered this interpretation the most convincing.\n\nThen, in 1957, US physicist Hugh Everett came up with a wilder alternative, one that 15% of survey respondents favoured. Everett’s interpretation, later dubbed ‘many worlds’, says that the wavefunction corresponds to something real. That is, a particle really is, in a sense, in multiple places at once. From their vantage point in one world, an observer measuring the particle would see only one outcome, but the wavefunction never really collapses. Instead it branches into many universes, one for each different outcome. “It requires a dramatic readjustment of our intuitions about the world, but to me that’s just what we should expect from a fundamental theory of reality,” says Sean Carroll, a physicist and philosopher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who responded to the survey.\n\nIn the late 1980s, ‘spontaneous collapse’ theories attempted to resolve issues such as the quantum measurement problem. Versions of these tweak the Schrödinger equation, so that, rather than requiring an observer or measurement to collapse, the wavefunction occasionally does so by itself. In some of these models, putting quantum objects together amplifies the likelihood of collapse, meaning that bringing a particle into a superposition with measuring equipment makes the loss of the combined quantum state inevitable. Around 4% of respondents chose these sorts of theories.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nNature’s survey suggests that ‘epistemic’ descriptions, which say that quantum mechanics reveals only knowledge about the world, rather than representing its physical reality, might have gained in popularity. A 2016 survey1 of 149 physicists found that only around 7% picked epistemic-related interpretations, compared with 17% in our survey (although the precise categories and methodology of the surveys differed). Some of these theories, which build on the original Copenhagen interpretation, emerged in the early 2000s, when applications such as quantum computing and communication began to frame experiments in terms of information. Adherents, such as Zeilinger, view the wavefunction as merely a tool to predict measurement outcomes, with no correspondence to the real world.\n\nThe epistemic view is appealing because it is the most cautious, says Ladina Hausmann, a theoretical physicist at the ETH who responded to the survey. “It doesn’t require me to assume anything beyond how we use the quantum state in practice,” she says.\n\nOne epistemic interpretation, known as QBism (which a handful of respondents who selected ‘other’ wrote down as their preferred interpretation), takes this to the extreme, stating that observations made by a specific ‘agent’ are entirely personal and valid only for them. The similar ‘relational quantum mechanics’, first outlined by Rovelli in 1996 (and selected by 4% of respondents), says that quantum states always describe only relationships between systems, not the systems themselves.",

          "abstract": "Pore-forming proteins in allergens make the body cough and sneeze.Credit: Wavebreak Media ltd/Alamy\n\nThe sneezing, itchy eyes and coughing elicited by some allergens are caused by proteins creating holes in airway cells, reports a study published this week in Nature1.\n\nThe findings challenge scientists’ understanding of how allergies are triggered, says Feargal Ryan, who studies host–microbe interactions at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. Before this, the mechanism that triggers immune responses to allergens was not really understood. Researchers focused mostly on how a single allergen elicits a reaction, rather than looking for a generalizable mechanism.\n\nThe results could also change allergy-treatment strategies, which typically target the allergen directly or downstream immune responses. Now, researchers can start looking for ways to target the hole-creating proteins that are initiating the immune response, Ryan says.\n\nPore-forming proteins\n\nResearchers based in Beijing, China, identified two proteins in the mould Alternaria alternata, which causes allergic reactions in about 5% of people, that trigger the airway inflammation seen during allergic reactions.\n\nTogether, the proteins, called Aeg-S and Aeg-L, create a pore in the membranes of cells lining the nose, throat and lungs. This allows calcium ions to enter the cells and release molecules that alert the immune system to danger. The damage to cell membranes from these pore-forming proteins could be a “common signal that our body uses to recognize something as an allergen”, says co-author Mo Xu, who studies immune responses at Tsinghua University.\n\nTo test how the proteins stimulated the immune system, the team treated lung cells with the proteins. Administering the proteins at the same time triggered a similar response as administering an extract of A. alternata, but this response was not seen when the proteins were given one at a time.\n\nThe researchers also tested whether the proteins could cause an allergic airway inflammation in mice. Six hours after mice were given the proteins intranasally, the rodents showed immune responses similar to those triggered by exposure to A. alternata.\n\nThe team also observed signs that the mice had developed a respiratory allergy, such as increased levels of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) — an antibody produced in response to allergens — after the mice were given the proteins every three days for two weeks. This response wasn’t seen when the proteins were administered separately, or when mice were exposed to genetically modified mould lacking either protein.",

          "abstract": "Programme such as the Thousand Talents Plan have brought thousands of researchers back to China.Credit: Li Ziheng/Xinhua/Alamy\n\nMaterials chemist Nan Liu took a career shortcut that many researchers can only dream of. She went from a postdoctoral position in the United States to a full professorship at a Chinese university with a research budget of 4 million yuan (US$560,000). Liu, now at Beijing Normal University, was recruited as part of the Thousand Young Talents Plan, a government-run initiative to bring talented overseas researchers back to China.\n\nOver the past three decades, thousands of Chinese researchers who studied or worked abroad have returned to the country through similar talent-recruitment programmes. These recruits — who often receive substantial funding and benefits — have largely had a positive influence on China’s research landscape and contributed to its global competitiveness, say scientists.\n\nStudies have shown that returnees have helped to improve research quality, quantity and impact in China, says Lili Yang, who studies higher education at the University of Hong Kong. Many hold key positions in universities or government agencies.\n\nBut the funding and other advantages afforded to those recruited through talent programmes have caused some resentment among young Chinese researchers who remain in the country, says Jiang Li, who studies the science of science at Nanjing University in China. “They complain a lot.”\n\nAs China’s global science standing has risen, and geopolitical tensions with the United States have intensified, recruitment programmes have increasingly been eyeing researchers who studied in China.\n\nFunding and autonomy\n\nSince the late 1990s, China has had several national-level talent recruitment programmes to attract overseas researchers, on top of hundreds of regional and local schemes. Among the largest and most prominent was the Thousand Talents Plan targeting leading researchers and entrepreneurs, which included a ‘youth’ branch for those under 40.\n\nA rough estimate suggests that by 2018, 16,000 scientists and high-tech entrepreneurs had been recruited through various programmes to return to China.\n\nResearchers apply for these programmes after securing a job offer at a Chinese research institute. They typically receive a sign-up bonus of at least half a million yuan, and can access several million yuan in research funding from the government and their host institute. They are also given housing subsidies and preferential treatment when applying for grants.\n\nAround the mid-2010s, participants in the Thousand Talents Plan became a target of US government agencies, who viewed the programme as a channel for stealing intellectual property and trade secrets, although confirmed cases were rare. The Chinese government has since renamed the programme to the High-End Foreign Talents Plan.\n\nMore papers\n\nResearchers have tried to study the impact of China’s talent programmes. A 2023 analysis showed that returnees who joined the youth talent programme between 2012 and 2014 published more papers than did their counterparts who stayed abroad1.\n\nBut the picture is more nuanced, say researchers. Broader studies of the scientific output of returnees, who can act as a proxy for the impact of those who returned through talent programmes, have found that they had a higher chance of being corresponding authors than did those who stayed abroad, but were less likely to publish in top-tier journals2. This, and other studies of talent recruits, suggest that returnees might not represent the highest level of international talent and are probably early in their careers, says Li, who was a co-author of the study.\n\nA 2020 study showed that returnees authored papers that were more highly cited than those produced by their local counterparts and maintained strong publishing ties with their international colleagues3. They have “helped to raise China’s profile”, says co-author Caroline Wagner, a science-policy specialist at the Ohio State University in Columbus.\n\nBut a more recent analysis of roughly 300 Chinese returnees found that their average citations per publication declined over the five years after their return4. Their number of international collaborators and international citations also dropped over time, statistics that point to the limits of what talent-recruitment policies can achieve, suggest the authors.",

          "abstract": "When it comes to food, the difficulties faced by astronauts, older people and those affected by disaster are more similar than you might think.\n\nSpace agencies worldwide are rolling out plans to build bases on the Moon. One challenge is how to nourish astronauts by growing fresh food in the extreme conditions on the lunar surface — in soils with few nutrients and where there is scarce water and no air. It’s too expensive to send supplies from Earth regularly, and long-term storage is difficult because foods decay.\n\nWithout healthy food, astronauts on long missions might face malnutrition, just like people on Earth do. They lose bone and muscle mass when working in low gravity1, mirroring changes that occur naturally during ageing. Food systems for any future missions need to be sustainable and resilient — as does food production on Earth in the face of climate change.\n\nHere, we highlight four areas of common ground between space and Earth-bound nutrition research programmes that need exploring.\n\nMaintaining food supplies\n\nIn the aftermath of disasters, affected people need access to food. With water, electricity and gas supplies often cut off, there are parallels with remote operations in space. In Japan, earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons and floods occur frequently, and the country has been learning from these parallels for the past decade.\n\nHow to keep astronauts healthy in deep space\n\nAs in space, disaster food supplies for emergencies must be stable when stored at room temperature in the absence of power and refrigeration2. They must come in durable packaging that protects against damage and contamination. Meals must require minimal preparation and be easy for anyone to eat with limited equipment. And they must be prepared and packed in hygienic environments to prevent foodborne illnesses. In Japan, pre-cooked and dried rice, dried noodles, fermented products such as miso, sweets and jelly drinks, and fish or meat stored in cans or sterile plastic pouches are used in both disaster settings and space.\n\nThe Tōhoku earthquake in Japan in 2011 led to changes in how disaster foods are managed. Emergency shelters saw food-supply disruptions as well as problems with limited dietary diversity and hygiene3,4. Recognizing that many of the stringent space-food standards set by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) were applicable to disaster contexts, the Japan Disaster Food Society launched its Disaster Food Certification System in 2015.\n\nIn 2022, the society introduced a streamlined cross-certification process, allowing JAXA-approved Japanese space foods to be certified as disaster food. This reduces duplicate product development and, in large-scale emergencies, means that foods earmarked for space missions can be diverted to humanitarian use (although these are not stored in large amounts).\n\nJapan has developed about 53 space foods through JAXA’s programme — some have been stockpiled for disaster preparedness by local governments and deployed in emergency situations, including in earthquake-affected regions.\n\nPeople received emergency rations after an earthquake hit Wajima City in Japan in 2024.Credit: Yomiuri Shimbun/AP Images/Alamy\n\nNow, one of us (N.T.-K.) is working with experts to develop an international standard for emergency and disaster foods. This could simplify food-aid coordination between governments and non-governmental organizations by standardizing stockpiling conditions, hygiene protocols and food labelling. Shared protocols could also help countries to adopt advanced food-production and preservation technologies originally developed for space for their own emergency and disaster food supplies.\n\nThe next step is to build consensus among food-safety authorities, humanitarian organizations and space agencies. Implementation of pilot projects in disaster-prone regions of Asia is under consideration. Challenges include aligning diverse national regulations, encouraging private-sector participation in dual-use product development and demonstrating cost-effectiveness in resource-limited settings.\n\nOptimizing nutrition\n\nJapan’s government recommends4 that food provided to emergency shelters should contain five elements: energy, protein and vitamins B1, B2 and C. Together, these factors prevent deficiency-related diseases such as beriberi, ariboflavinosis and scurvy, and help to sustain basic physiological functions.\n\nAs part of JAXA’s Lunar Food System Working Group 2023–25, one of us (N.T.-K.) is evaluating whether a set of eight staple crops — rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, soya beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and strawberries — can provide these five elements and other crucial nutrients. These crops are rich in carbohydrates, dietary fibre and certain vitamins.\n\nHow to chart a moral future for space exploration\n\nThe working group is using nutritional modelling, simulations of human dietary intake and cultivation studies under controlled environmental conditions to assess how much of astronauts’ daily nutritional requirements could be met using just these eight crops, and to identify any nutritional gaps that would require supplements.\n\nAntioxidant compounds have anti-inflammatory and other effects that might help to prevent muscle deconditioning caused by microgravity in space and in people who are confined to bed rest on Earth because of illness or age. The French, German and Canadian space agencies are examining whether a cocktail of antioxidant supplements — polyphenols, vitamin E, selenium and omega-3 fatty acids — could prevent muscle deconditioning. Although there is no firm evidence yet5, the agencies are planning to assess these compounds’ benefits in space.\n\nSupplements generated using soya might also help to prevent the wasting of astronauts’ muscles and bones. One of us (T.N.), together with colleagues, has conducted experiments in space using rats6 and cells grown in culture7 to reveal that muscle atrophy comes about when microgravity induces oxidative stress in muscle tissues. The process activates enzymes that alter cell signalling such that protein synthesis ceases and degradation increases. The same changes were subsequently shown to occur in adults under bed-rest conditions, and a clinical trial found that oral intake of soya proteins, especially Cblin-like peptides — which prevent this protein-degradation pathway from being activated — increases the quadricep strength of people on bed-rest8.\n\nWe are now testing whether similar Cblin peptides can also help astronauts, through experiments in cultured muscle cells aboard the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nSpecialists who can take a high-level view of micronutrient function, delivery methods and physiological needs under stress could vastly improve our ability to build resilience into future food systems — on Earth and beyond.\n\nAlternative protein sources\n\nSustainable sources of alternative protein are urgently needed to avoid widespread food insecurity and malnutrition on Earth. A 2019 survey of Japanese citizens found that, on average, more than 50% of a person’s protein intake was derived from animal-based sources such as meat, dairy and fish (see go.nature.com/44xwmyn). But with the global population projected to reach nine billion by 2050, there is concern that current protein sources will be insufficient to meet global nutritional needs9.\n\nAlternative protein sources are a focus of research for space agencies, too. Conventional animal agriculture requires large amounts of water, land and feedstock — resources that are unavailable in space. Protein-production systems involving plants, cultured cells or insects are more viable options.\n\nSoya protein is of interest to JAXA, because of its high yield, relatively complete amino-acid profile and long shelf life, and because it is widely consumed in Japan. One of us (T.N.) has been involved in developing a compact soya-bean cultivation system. It uses programmable LED lighting and supplies nutrients through a mist infused with rhizobia — bacteria that convert inert nitrogen into forms that plants can use to grow10. Next, we hope to test its applicability aboard the ISS.\n\nJapanese astronaut Kimiya Yui enjoys a taste of home while in space: ramen noodles with soy sauce.Credit: JAXA/NASA\n\nMeat produced from animal cells grown in the laboratory could give astronauts some of the nutrients that soya protein lacks — particularly branched-chain amino acids, which muscles need to generate energy during exercise. Cultured meat can be produced under sterile conditions, reducing the risk of foodborne illness11. However, this technology is in its infancy. Cells need to be coaxed to keep proliferating so that they form large, structured tissue pieces. Getting oxygen to the core of thick cultures is tricky. The liquids in which the cells need to be grown are expensive to produce and transport. And there isn’t a good way to generate cultures with meat-like textures, which are important for psychological satisfaction.",

          "abstract": "Neanderthals might have eaten maggots along with the meat they stored from hunting, researchers say.Credit: Roman Uchytel/Science Photo Library\n\nA mysterious chemical signature seen in the remains of Neanderthals might be explained if they often snacked on a special culinary garnish: maggots. That’s according to research published today in Science Advances1.\n\nThe finding adds to the picture that researchers are painting of how our close ancient human relatives provided themselves with nourishment.\n\nNeanderthals and humans interbred more recently than scientists thought\n\nScientists have long been perplexed by the fact that the bones of Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) from the late Pleistocene epoch (11,700–129,000 years ago) contain a nitrogen isotope at extreme levels2 normally seen in mega-meat-eaters such as hyenas and wolves. The more meat an animal eats, the more nitrogen-15 it stores, and those at the top of the food chain have the highest amounts.\n\nBut “our guts are not carnivore guts”, says Bruce Hardy, an anthropologist at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. “Our livers can only do so much to process protein.” So the Neanderthal levels seemed impossibly high.\n\nMelanie Beasley, an anthropologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and her colleagues wondered whether, instead of gorging on massive quantities of meat, Neanderthals raised their nitrogen-15 levels by preparing their food in some unique way. Beasley, the lead author of the study, was inspired by historical examples of Indigenous groups consuming putrefied food, as well as the maggots — or fly larvae — that feast on it. Think of fermentation, she says. Putrefaction is similar: “A Westerner might say it’s rotting, but it’s really a method of storing the food to break down the meat,” she adds.\n\nTo see whether Neanderthals might have followed the same recipe, Beasley and her colleagues acquired muscle tissue samples from 34 donated human cadavers that had spent two years putrefying at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville’s Forensic Anthropology Center. They found that nitrogen-15 levels in the flesh rose as it decomposed — and when they sampled hundreds of larvae in the tissue, they measured up to 43 parts per thousand isotope in the maggots compared with up to 8 parts per thousand in the tissue.\n\nBon appétit\n\nBoth results suggest that, if Neanderthals had enjoyed putrefied meat and maggots, it could be a more viable explanation for their puzzlingly high nitrogen-15 levels than eating impossibly large quantities of meat. And it’s probably a more well-rounded meal than eating just protein, Beasley says. “When you get the lean meat and the fatty maggot, you have a more complete nutrient that you’re consuming.”",

          "abstract": "In late 2005, five months after a car accident, a 23-year-old woman lay unresponsive in a hospital bed. She had a severe brain injury and showed no sign of awareness. But when researchers scanning her brain asked her to imagine playing tennis, something striking happened: brain areas linked to movement lit up on her scan1.\n\nThe experiment, conceived by neuroscientist Adrian Owen and his colleagues, suggested that the woman understood the instructions and decided to cooperate — despite appearing to be unresponsive. Owen, now at Western University in London, Canada, and his colleagues had introduced a new way to test for consciousness. Whereas some previous tests relied on observing general brain activity, this strategy zeroed in on activity directly linked to a researcher’s verbal command.\n\nThe consciousness wars: can scientists ever agree on how the mind works?\n\nThe strategy has since been applied to hundreds of unresponsive people, revealing that many maintain an inner life and are aware of the world around them, at least to some extent. A 2024 study found that one in four people who were physically unresponsive had brain activity that suggested they could understand and follow commands to imagine specific activities, such as playing tennis or walking through a familiar space2. The tests rely on advanced neuroimaging techniques, so are mostly limited to research settings because of their high costs and the needed expertise. But since 2018, medical guidelines have started to recommend using these tests in clinical practice3.\n\nSince these methods emerged, scientists have been developing ways to probe layers of consciousness that are even more hidden. The stakes are high. Tens of thousands of people worldwide are currently in a persistent unresponsive state. Assessing their consciousness can guide important treatment decisions, such as whether to keep them on life support. Studies also suggest that hospitalized, unresponsive people with hidden signs of awareness are more likely to recover than are those without such signs (see, for example, ref. 4).\n\nSome people who seem to be persistently unresponsive show brain activity similar to that of healthy people when told to imagine a task.Credit: Adrian M. Owen\n\nThe need for better consciousness tests extends beyond humans. Detecting consciousness in other species — in which it might take widely different forms — helps us to understand how these organisms experience the world, with implications for animal-welfare policies. And researchers are actively debating whether consciousness might one day emerge from artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Last year, a group of philosophers and computer scientists published a report5 urging AI companies to start testing their systems for evidence of consciousness and to devise policies for how to treat the systems should this happen.\n\n“These scenarios, which were previously a bit abstract, are becoming more pressing and pragmatic,” says Anil Seth, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Sussex near Brighton, UK. In April, Seth and other researchers gathered in Durham, North Carolina, for a conference at Duke University to discuss tests for consciousness in humans (including people with brain damage, as well as fetuses and infants), other animals and AI systems.\n\nAlthough scientists agree there’s a lot of room for improvement, many see the development of consciousness tests that rely on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) as one of the field’s most significant advancements. “It was unthinkable 40 years ago that we would have a number of candidates for practical ways to test consciousness” in unresponsive people, says neuroscientist Christof Koch, a meritorious investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington. “That’s big progress.”\n\nLayers of awareness\n\nScientists disagree on what consciousness really is, even in people. But many describe it as having an inner life or a subjective experience. That makes it inherently private: an individual can be certain only about their own consciousness. They can infer that others are conscious, too, on the basis of how they behave, but that doesn’t always work in people who have severe brain injuries or neurological disorders that prevent them from expressing themselves.\n\nMarcello Massimini, a neuroscientist at the University of Milan in Italy, compares assessments of consciousness in these challenging cases to peeling an onion. The first layer — the assessments that are routinely done in clinics — involves observing external behaviours. For example, a clinician might ask the person to squeeze their hand twice, or call the person’s name to see whether they turn their head towards the sound. The ability to follow such commands indicates consciousness. Clinicians can also monitor an unresponsive person over time to detect whether they make any consistent, voluntary movements, such as blinking deliberately or looking in one direction, that could serve as a way for them to communicate. Researchers use similar tests in infants, looking for how their eyes move in response to stimuli, for example6.\n\nHow does the brain control consciousness? This deep-brain structure\n\nFor a person who can hear and understand verbal commands but doesn’t respond to these tests, the second layer would involve observing what’s happening in their brain after receiving such a command, as with the woman in the 2005 experiment. “If you find brain activations that are specific for that active task, for example, premotor cortex activation for playing tennis, that’s an indicator of the presence of consciousness as good as squeezing your hand,” Massimini says. These people are identified as having cognitive motor dissociation, a type of covert consciousness.\n\nBut the bar for detecting consciousness through these tests is too high, because they require several minutes of sustained focus, says Nicholas Schiff, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and a co-author of the 2024 study2 that suggested that one-quarter of unresponsive people might be conscious. That study also included a separate group of participants who showed observable, external signs of awareness. Among them, only 38% passed the test. “Even for healthy controls, mind wandering and drowsiness are major issues,” says Schiff.\n\nAssessing consciousness in those who fail such tests would require peeling the third layer of the onion, Massimini says. In these cases, clinicians don’t ask the person to engage actively in any cognitive behaviour. “You just present patients with stimuli and then you detect activations in the brain,” he says.\n\nIn a 2017 study, researchers played a 24-second clip from John F. Kennedy’s inaugural US presidential address to people with acute severe traumatic brain injury7. The team also played the audio to them in reverse. The two clips had similar acoustic features, but only the first was expected to trigger patterns of linguistic processing in the brain; the second served as a control. Using fMRI, the experiment helped to detect covert consciousness in four out of eight people who had shown no other signs of understanding language.\n\nThe complexity of implementing such an approach outside the research setting isn’t the only challenge. These tests require researchers to know which patterns of brain activity truly reflect consciousness, because some stimuli can elicit brain responses that occur without awareness. “It boils down to understanding what are the neural correlates of conscious perception,” says Massimini. “We’re making progress, but we don’t yet agree on what they are.”\n\nWhat does ‘brain dead’ really mean? The battle over how science defines the end of life\n\nThere’s a fourth, even more elusive layer of consciousness, Massimini says — one that scientists are only beginning to explore. It might be possible for an unresponsive person to remain conscious even when their brain is completely cut off from the outside world, unable to receive or process images, sounds, smells, touch or any other sensory input8. The experience could be similar to dreaming, for example, or lying down in a completely dark and silent room, unable to move or feel your body. Although deprived of outside sensations, your mind would still be active, generating thoughts and inner experiences. In that case, scientists need to extract signs of consciousness solely from intrinsic brain properties.\n\nMassimini and his colleagues are applying a procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation, which uses electromagnets placed on the head, as a possible technique for assessing consciousness. After jolting the brain in this way, they measure its response using EEG. In healthy people, they observe complex responses, reflecting a rich dialogue between brain regions. This complexity is quantified by a new metric they call the perturbational complexity index9, which was found to be higher in awake and healthy individuals than during sleep or in people under anaesthesia. Experiments have shown that the metric can help to reveal the presence of consciousness even in unresponsive people. And other researchers have proposed a version of this test as a way to investigate when consciousness emerges in fetuses10.\n\nMassimini and Koch, among others, are co-founders of a company called Intrinsic Powers, based in Madison, Wisconsin, that aims to develop tools that use this approach to detect consciousness in unresponsive people.\n\nBeyond the human realm\n\nAssessing consciousness becomes more challenging the further researchers move away from the human mind. One issue is that non-human animals can’t communicate their subjective experiences. Another is that consciousness in other species might take distinct forms that would be unrecognizable to humans.\n\nSome tests designed to assess consciousness in humans can be tried in other species. Researchers have applied the perturbational complexity index in rats and found patterns that resemble those seen in humans, for example11. But more-typical tests rely on experiments that look for behaviour suggesting sentience — the ability to have an immediate experience of emotions and sensations, including pain. Sentience, which some researchers consider a foundation for consciousness, doesn’t require the ability to reflect on those emotions.\n\nIn one experiment, octopuses consistently avoided a chamber that they encountered after receiving a painful stimulus, despite having previously preferred that chamber12. When these animals were subsequently given an anaesthetic to relieve the pain, they instead chose to spend time in the chamber in which they were placed after receiving the drug. This behaviour hints that these animals feel not only immediate pain, but also the ongoing suffering associated with it, and that they remember and act to avoid that experience.\n\nChimpanzees, elephants and many birds behave in ways that suggest they have forms of consciousness.Credit: Anup Shah, Mark Hamblin/2020VISION/Nature Picture Library\n\nFindings such as these are already shaping animal-welfare policy, says philosopher Jonathan Birch, director of the Jeremy Coller Centre for Animal Sentience at the London School of Economics and Political Science, UK. An independent review of the evidence for sentience in animals such as octopuses, crabs and lobsters, led by Birch, contributed to these species being granted greater protection alongside all vertebrates in 2022 under the UK Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act.\n\nAnd last year, dozens of scientists signed a declaration stating that there is “strong scientific support” for consciousness in other mammals and birds, and “at least a realistic possibility” of consciousness in all vertebrates, including reptiles and fish, as well as in many invertebrates, such as molluscs and insects.\n\nScientists are now calling for serious thought about whether some biological materials, such as brain organoids, could become conscious, as well as what machine consciousness might look like.\n\n“If it comes to the day when these systems become conscious, I think it’s in our best interest to know,” says Liad Mudrik, a neuroscientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel.\n\nCan lab-grown brains become conscious?",

The technique opens new ways to stress-test the known laws of physics and to detect the copious neutrinos produced in the hearts of collapsing stars.\n\n“They finally did it,” says Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “And they have a very beautiful result.” The experiment, called CONUS+, is described on 30 July in Nature1.\n\nChallenging quarry\n\nNeutrinos are elementary particles that have no electrical charge and generally don’t interact with other matter, making them extraordinarily difficult to detect. Most neutrino experiments catch these elusive particles by observing flashes of light that are generated when a neutrino collides with an electron, proton or neutron. These collisions occur extremely infrequently, so such detectors typically have masses of tonnes or thousands of tonnes to provide enough target material to gather neutrinos in relevant numbers.\n\nScholberg and her collaborators first demonstrated the mini-detector technique in 20172, using it to catch neutrinos produced by an accelerator at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The Oak Ridge particles have slightly higher energies than do those made in reactors. As a result, detecting reactor neutrinos was even more challenging, she says. But lower-energy neutrinos also allow for a more precise test of the standard model of physics.\n\nHow heavy is a neutrino? Race to weigh mysterious particle heats up\n\nScholberg’s COHERENT detector was the first to exploit a phenomenon called coherent scattering, in which a neutrino ‘scatters’ off an entire atomic nucleus rather than the atom’s constituent particles.\n\nCoherent scattering uses the fact that particles of matter can act as waves — and the lower the particles’ energy, the longer their wavelength, says Christian Buck, a leader of the CONUS collaboration. If the wavelength of a neutrino is similar to the nucleus’s diameter, “then the neutrino sees the nucleus as one thing. It doesn’t see the internal structure”, says Buck, who is a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. The neutrino doesn’t interact with any subatomic particles, but does cause the nucleus to recoil — depositing a tiny amount of energy into the detector.\n\nCatching sight of a nucleus",

Researchers are lauding the sheer scale of the effort while also calling on Google for more information about its tests, and warning that it will be up to individual scientists to verify any maps they obtain from the tool.\n\nGoogle tapped billions of mobile phones to detect quakes worldwide — and send alerts\n\nThe model, called AlphaEarth Foundations, maps the world “at any place and time”, Christopher Brown, a research engineer at Google DeepMind in New York City, said at a press briefing on 28 July. Scientists might use it to identify the best places for clean-energy projects, study the ecological impacts of climate change, track deforestation and more.\n\nAlongside the model, which was released yesterday, Google and its DeepMind AI unit have posted a paper, ahead of peer review, on the arXiv preprint server1. The manuscript describes the creation of the model, its initial testing and baseline data sets covering Earth during the years 2017–24. It says that AlphaEarth beats similar AI models in terms of both accuracy and data density, and that the model saves users computing time and reduces energy use.\n\nNicholas Murray, a conservation biologist at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, is the lead scientist for Global Ecosystems Atlas, an initiative to map the world’s biodiversity and environments. Murray says that his team often spends “tens to hundreds of days” processing satellite data before it can even begin to make products such as maps describing changes in tidal wetlands over time. He hopes that Google’s latest model — which the team is familiar with — will make that process more efficient.\n\nPackaging the data\n\nMoving forward, Google says, it will regularly update AlphaEarth’s data sets, which come fully processed. They are available through the company’s Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform that already hosts separate repositories of data covering topics such as agriculture, deforestation and weather.

          "abstract": "With a flying leap, Oded Rechavi soars off the podium at Woodstock Bio2 + Night Science, possibly the world’s wildest biology conference. After running up and down the steps of the auditorium, he presents his new idea: revolutionize peer review with a system he’s developing, in which artificial intelligence (AI) would “supplement or augment” the process of assessing scientific papers.\n\nRechavi is a molecular biologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel whose lab aims, as its website puts it, to “challenge basic dogmas regarding inheritance and evolution”. He is one of the instigators of the meeting, dubbed by its organizers as the “conference to end all conferences”, which was held in Prague on 10–13 June.\n\nAn outside poster presentation at the conference.Credit: Nir Eynon, Monash University, Australia\n\nA follow-on from the first Woodstock of Biology, organized by Rechavi in Tel Aviv in February 2020, just before the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns, the three-day Prague get-together was conducted with same anarchic disregard for rules as the 1969 music festival that it’s named after. A variety of scientists — from biologists to physicists — met to exchange ideas, play games and find fortuitous opportunities to collaborate with researchers outside their own narrow field.\n\nHeld in various locations across the city of Prague, and on the third day at a wooded campsite at Soběšín, in the Central Bohemian region of the Czech Republic, the conference followed an unusual format. Attendees spoke in five-minute slots, summarized their research in a single slide and were called to the podium in random order. Each speaker was hailed with a self-chosen walk-up song, often accompanied by impromptu dancing. The songs ranged from Fatboy Slim’s ‘Right Here, Right Now’ to ‘Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows’ by Lesley Gore.\n\nOne presenter gave her entire talk in rhyme. Another soundtracked theirs with a ukulele. A third read her paper as a bedtime story. Itai Yanai, a systems biologist at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine in New York City and a conference co-organizer, explained his research to a co-opted 16-year-old. As he did so, volunteers from the audience posed onstage as ‘genes’, imitating being turned on and off by waving their arms when tapped. Barak Rotblat, a cancer researcher at the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, based in Beersheba, Israel, was physically removed from the podium by a ‘bouncer’ after exceeding the five-minute time limit. (He later admitted that he was in on the joke.)\n\nAnd in a symbolic wedding at Soběšín, two affianced scientists ’married’ in a ceremony presided over by Rechavi and Natanella Illouz-Eliaz, a plant biologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in San Diego, California, and another co-organizer. The pair promised to “give each other tenure, share their data and write recommendation letters — long ones — without using ChatGPT”. After the ceremony, bride-to-be Lea Krautner, a biochemist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, tossed her bouquet of wildflowers and danced down the grassy aisle.\n\n“We are trying to reimagine science in a non-bureaucratic, non-boring way,” Rechavi said as the Turtles’ song ‘Happy Together’ played in the background at Soběšín.\n\nAttendees arrive at a conference venue by train.Credit: Pavel Tomancak\n\n“By acting silly or goofy, it sets the tone for a very open conference where we can be very authentic and show vulnerability,” says Illouz-Eliaz.\n\nDreaming together\n\nWoodstock Bio2 + Night Science is an attempt to reinvent the scientific conference, giving it a “festival-like quality”, says Yanai. “Of course, we want rigorous, reproducible science. But we’re also acknowledging the other side of the process, of ‘let’s be inspired to have new ideas and make connections’.”\n\nThe meeting did have a serious aspect. More than 200 researchers — principal investigators, PhD students and postdocs — converged on Prague from diverse locales, including Israel, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Czech Republic, Germany and Italy. They presented research on flatworms, cancer biology, melanoma metastasis, brain organoids, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and data science.\n\nYanai and Martin Lercher, a computational cell biologist at the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany, led a ten-minute workshop titled ‘What is Your Worst Idea’? The two exhorted participants to pair with someone they had never met and discuss a possibly stupid, possibly brilliant concept. “You may come up with a Nature paper! Two Nature papers!” shouts Yanai. “There is a Nature editor here! Raise your hand if you are a Nature editor!” (That would be me, ostensibly, although I’m actually a freelance writer, on assignment for Nature, and have no power to accept or reject papers.)\n\nRechavi delivers a presentation read as a bedtime storyCredit: Itai Yanai\n\nAs Yanai explained, the term night science, which bookends the official name of the conference, was coined by the late biologist François Jacob, who shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that cells can switch genes on and off. “There’s the science that gets published and the science that is dreamt or appears in nightmares,” Jacob said.\n\nWhat if, like Jacob, “we tried to daydream together?” Yanai asks. “What if, simply by juxtaposing talks on completely different topics, it would give you an idea?”\n\n‘A bit unconventional’\n\nAt the conference, 115 researchers presented talks on anything they wished to speak about.\n\nChaitanya Chintaluri, a theoretical biologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria in Klosterneuburg, was drawn to the conference because “it’s a bit unconventional”. He was there to discuss why a collection of neurons, kept alive in a Petri dish with the aid of artificial cerebrospinal fluid and oxygen, continue to ‘chat’ to each other by sending out electrical impulses. “The question is, if there is nothing to talk about, what are they going on about? It’s quite perplexing,” Chintaluri says.\n\nMany of Woodstock Bio's sessions were held outsideCredit: Daniel Żarski, InLife, PL\n\nSara Bologna, a structural biologist at the Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) at Masaryk University in Brno, the Czech Republic, had come to discuss her use of nuclear magnetic resonance to study the dynamics of proteins “and how they play together”. Woodstock “shows the personality of scientists — all of us, we are unique”, she said. Meeting diverse researchers “helps us think out of the box and get ideas for future projects”.\n\nYogesh Saravanan, a physicist and PhD student based in Marseille at Inserm, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, is trying to understand the physics and material properties of cancer cells. At the conference, Saravanan felt he had “an incredible exposure” to other labs. “It’s a great place for the intersection of ideas,” he said.",

It is the biggest-ever collaboration between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), carrying with it scientists’ dreams of studying our dynamic planet.\n\nBillion-dollar NASA satellite launches to track Earth’s water\n\nIn the coming days, the US$1.2-billion satellite, called NISAR, will unfurl a 12-metre-wide circular antenna and begin bouncing radar signals off Earth. Launched from Sriharikota, India, NISAR will scan nearly all of the planet twice every 12 days, and measure vertical physical shifts on the ground that are as small as one centimetre, even through clouds and at night.\n\nWatching NISAR launch is like being “a parent attending the graduation ceremony of his son!” says Deepak Putrevu, who co-leads the mission’s science team for ISRO. “It’s so exhilarating to witness.”\n\nBut for NASA, that excitement is tinged with a dollop of worry as US President Donald Trump pushes to slash the agency’s budget for Earth-science missions by over 50% in the fiscal year 2026. NISAR itself is slated to receive monies to operate as expected, but it might be one of the last of its kind to launch for years: the White House wants to cancel most of NASA’s upcoming flagship Earth-observing missions “to achieve cost savings”. And it wants to shut down several missions that are already operating and gathering key information about changes on Earth.\n\n“This is the size of cut that would fundamentally gut our capacity” to improve understanding of the changing planet, says Dylan Millet, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Minnesota in St Paul who chaired a NASA advisory committee on Earth sciences until March, when NASA disbanded it.\n\nA boost for disaster response\n\nNISAR — which stands for NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar — will use two radar instruments operating at different wavelengths, one built by NASA and one by ISRO, to map Earth’s changing ice and land surfaces. Globally, the satellite will be able to identify changes in soil moisture, forest biomass and glaciers, among other things.\n\nNISAR will be able to measure the movement of ice on Antarctica (shown in this colour map) in detail.Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio\n\nAnd it will help with responses to disasters such as floods, earthquakes and landslides, by providing up-to-date information about how Earth has behaved. “You can begin to build up an ability to see disasters as they unfold at a very rapid pace, and that should help with identifying areas of concern for first responders,” says Paul Rosen, the mission’s project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nNASA and ISRO began collaborating on NISAR in the early 2010s, when it became clear that both US and Indian scientists wanted to fly a major radar mission, Rosen says. If all goes well with the antenna unfurling and other tasks, NISAR should begin providing science data within 90 days. The mission is slated to operate for at least three years.\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nWhat will happen after that is a bigger question, at least for NASA. NISAR was supposed to be the trailblazer in a series of major Earth-observing satellites, aimed at measuring, among other things, the roles of clouds and aerosols in climate change, and biological and geological interactions across the planet.",

The majority in India and China are withdrawn because of misconduct or research-integrity concerns.\n\nRetractions are “a very important signal of misconduct, and we should be looking closely at them now”, says Achal Agrawal, a data scientist in Raipur, India, who was involved in the analysis. Agrawal is founder of India Research Watch, an online group of researchers and students who highlight integrity issues.\n\nSome researchers have welcomed the government’s decision, calling it a first step in acknowledging and attempting to tackle the problem. But others warn that retractions are a way for science to self-correct and should not be penalized.\n\nThe policy’s effectiveness will depend on how exactly institutional retractions are measured and penalized — details that will be revealed only when the latest ranking results are announced, in a couple of weeks.\n\n“I hope that the penalty is strong enough to act as a deterrent, and it doesn’t remain symbolic,” says Agrawal.\n\nMoumita Koley, who studies metascience at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, also appreciates the policy. “Indian science needs a little clean-up, and this shows that people have taken note,” she says. But she worries that the situation won’t change for the better. She says that adjusting one ranking instrument doesn’t remove the incentives that drive researchers and institutions to publish lots of papers at the cost of quality, such as promotions and other ranking metrics rewarding high publication counts, and individual drives for public recognition.\n\nRising retractions\n\nIndia’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) assesses higher-education institutions every year. It takes into account factors including teaching, engagement and research-impact metrics such as publication and citation counts.\n\n“It’s the most important ranking in India,” says Agrawal. Institutions must participate in the ranking to be eligible for certain national grant schemes. A high rank confers some advantages, including permission to design their own curriculum.\n\nBut the growing number of retractions in India and globally has not gone unnoticed, says Anil Sahasrabudhe, who chairs the National Board of Accreditation in New Delhi, which conducts the national ranking. A 2025 analysis by Nature found that several Indian institutions were among the top global institutions with the most retracted papers in the past five years.\n\nThe board decided to deduct marks as a way to ‘name and shame’ institutions, and send the message that unethical research practices are not acceptable, says Sahasrabudhe. Because this year will be the first in which the assessment considers retractions, penalties will be mild and symbolic for now, he says.\n\nThe NIRF will count the number of research papers retracted in the Scopus and Web of Science databases for each institution over the past three years, he says. A small number of retractions is acceptable, but generally, “the more number of retractions, the more the penalty”. Institutions that consistently get many retractions could be penalized more over time and might even be barred from the ranking, he says. Sahasrabudhe acknowledges that retractions sometimes occur for reasons beyond a researcher’s control, but when they happen in large numbers, “they are not necessarily by error but deliberate, hence need to be punished to send a strong signal.”\n\nRoot of the problem\n\nResearchers say the assessment should also consider retractions recorded in the public database maintained by Retraction Watch, which is more comprehensive than Scopus or Web of Science and includes the reasons for retractions. Sahasrabudhe says they wanted to use the same source for retractions as they use for publications and citations.\n\nResearchers also say the ranking should penalize only those retractions that are attributable to plagiarism, fraud or other research-integrity issues — and should look for patterns of bad behaviour, as opposed to one-offs.",

          "abstract": "Angela Steiner uses an artificial-intelligence tool as a sounding board for research ideas.Credit: 2025 EPFL/Alain Herzog - CC-BY-SA 4.0\n\nI’m sitting in my office, coffee in hand, talking to ChatGPT. I’ve carved out a rare hour to think through a new research proposal — a luxury amid the demands of teaching, service and parenting as a tenure-track assistant professor developing methods to deliver nucleic acids for gene therapy.\n\nI’ve always loved writing grants. It’s a skill I developed as a graduate student and postdoctoral researchers, and one I still find deeply rewarding: shaping a question, crafting a narrative, imagining the possibilities. It’s one of the most creatively satisfying parts of my work, and I am good at it. I wrote a few successful proposals before artificial intelligence (AI) entered the picture.\n\nI’ve learnt over the years that one of the most efficient ways for me to clarify scientific ideas is to discuss them with someone. In the past, that was usually a fellow postdoc or grad student. But these days, my verbal sparring partner is often a computer.\n\nUsing voice dictation, I start with some background: “I’ve been thinking about X and Y, and how they connect to Z. I wonder if there’s something novel here, something that hasn’t been done before.” And then I ask: “Do you think this is a fundable idea?”\n\nForget ChatGPT: why researchers now run small AIs on their laptops\n\nThe chatbot replies with its usual enthusiasm: “You’re really onto something powerful here. Your instinct is dead on.” It reflects on my idea, identifies promising themes, breaks them down and suggests directions and framing strategies I hadn’t considered. We go back and forth. I raise concerns — technical limitations, feasibility, scope — and it responds thoughtfully, sometimes agreeing, sometimes offering counterpoints. But the real value comes only when I press further.\n\nInitially, the chatbot is unfailingly positive; it will encourage almost anything. To get useful feedback, I have to interrogate the idea: what’s missing, what might reviewers say, where’s the fatal flaw? It’s a dialogue, not a verdict. I have to stay engaged and ask the right questions. When I do, the chatbot surprises me — it readily acknowledges the weaknesses I identify, provides reasons the idea might fail and then pivots towards solutions and refinements I hadn’t considered. By the end of our half-hour conversation, I’ve clarified my thinking. I’m more motivated. Most importantly, I feel excited to start writing.\n\nUnexpected impact\n\nThat emotional impact is something I didn’t anticipate when I started using chatbots. Talking science with an AI feels oddly supportive. It’s efficient, but also energizing. As a young parent and early-career researcher, I often find myself short on time and mental bandwidth. AI doesn’t solve that, but it lowers the barrier to getting started. If I don’t know something, I can ask. If I need help articulating a method or identifying a theoretical gap, it offers a starting point. Of course, I always double-check the details — nothing goes into a proposal or paper without being verified using primary sources, because chatbots can confidently generate plausible-sounding yet inaccurate scientific statements.\n\nWhat’s striking is how natural the back-and-forth feels. It’s like doing improvisational comedy with the world’s most supportive partner — always ready with a ‘yes, and …’. A partner who also happens to be an amorphous, seemingly all-knowing generalist with a surprising degree of specialist knowledge. It can pull together context across disciplines, synthesize literature and help me to connect my work to areas I know less well.\n\nChatbots are supportive — but also sound confident about even incorrect statements.Credit: d3sign/Getty\n\nThat kind of breadth is invaluable. But if you’re a specialist, you’ll quickly notice the cracks. Chatbots can mislead on technical nuances and they’re best at reiterating what’s already been published. That’s why I find them most powerful as big-picture ideation tools — they let me explore ideas freely, without judgement, and help me to quickly uncover what’s already known.\n\nThis kind of fast, exploratory dialogue is quite different from the results of tools such as ChatGPT’s Deep Research mode, launched this year by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, which can prepare detailed reports on specific topics on its own. What I’m describing is much more immediate — a conversational exchange that helps me to clarify and refine ideas as I think them through.\n\nOver time, I’ve learnt a few ways to make these conversations more productive.\n\nStart with a specific prompt, then expand. I begin with a concrete question — concerning a technique, problem or recent paper — and then ask, could this be used differently? What else might this apply to? This invites unexpected angles and broadens the conversation.\n\nBe vigilant about accuracy. I read papers while chatting, grounding ideas in the literature. Chatbots can fabricate references or get details subtly wrong, so I always verify claims and citations using peer-reviewed sources.\n\nAsk critically, not passively. I stay engaged by constantly questioning the chatbot’s output. When it says something, I often counter: isn’t this wrong? Wouldn’t it actually work like this? Usually, it agrees — and then expands helpfully on the correction. The real value is in how it builds from your thinking, adding context and detail that sharpen the idea.",

This can result in these researchers being offered equipment time at the expense of their less-experienced peers. The effect permeates across fields, says Carpenter, who analysed data on a similar effort at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). “It’s not just telescopes.”\n\nSystem overhaul\n\nData on applications to use the Hubble Space Telescope and ALMA2 showed that women and less-experienced applicants got more facility time after blind review was introduced. Over the past few years, the practice has become more widespread — particularly at observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the European Southern Observatory’s telescopes in northern Chile.\n\nIsabelle Kingsley, a gender-equity researcher previously at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, who now works for SAGE, an Australian initiative that campaigns for equity and diversity in education and research, wanted to see whether similar interventions could work in a range of scientific facilities.\n\nShe and her colleagues launched trials at four Australian facilities, which manage optical and radio telescopes, neutron-beam instruments and high-performance computing systems. In applications to use the resources, applicants were asked not to include their names and affiliations. One facility was hesitant about committing fully to anonymization and decided to include first initials and last names of applicants at the back of applications.\n\nThe researchers analysed the outcomes of more than 4,500 applications, including ones made up to five years before the intervention and up to two years after it.\n\nPostdoc boost\n\nThe Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering, in Lucas Heights, manages 15 neutron-beam instruments, and was one of two facilities that collected data on career stage. After introducing blind review, success rates for postdoctoral researchers rose from 61% to 78%. Success rates for PhD, graduate and undergraduate students remained stable, but those for more experienced researchers dropped from 61% to 50%. In the other facility that collected data on career stage, postdocs’ time on the equipment remained around 75%.\n\nThe results suggest that “anonymization can level the playing field” and help to open doors, says Kingsley. And because early-career researchers tend to be more diverse, in terms of their gender and cultural background, improving their outcomes contributes to retaining diverse scientific talent, she says.",

Credit: Luciano A. Masullo et al./Nat. Nanotech. (CC BY 4.0)\n\nScientists have mapped individual sugar molecules on the surface of cells at a resolution once thought to be impossible for light microscopes. It is the first sub-nanometre optical resolution achieved in cells, says Sabrina Simoncelli, a chemist at University College London, who calls the results “groundbreaking”.\n\nEvery cell in the human body is wrapped in a sugary coating called the glycocalyx. It helps cells to communicate with each other and with the immune system, to fight off viruses and, in some cases, to spread cancer. Until now, no imaging tool could show the glycocalyx’s tiny sugar molecules — each of which is about one nanometre in size — in detail.\n\nNow, researchers have found a way to image the sugars at a resolution of just 9 ångströms — 0.9 nanometres — using an off-the-shelf light microscope. In a paper published in Nature Nanotechnology on 28 July1, they reveal the arrangement of sugars on the surface of living cells that line humans’ small blood vessels.\n\nThe authors say that their imaging technique could help researchers to understand what a healthy glycocalyx looks like, and to study how it changes in diseases such as cancers and immune disorders, or in response to drugs.\n\n“When I started my PhD, the best resolution you could get of a single sugar was a blurry image,” says study co-author Karim Almahayni, a biophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen, Germany, who completed his PhD this month. “The next step is to understand how these sugars on the cell surface change during health and disease,” he adds. “We want to judge a cell by its cover.”\n\nBeyond the limit\n\nLight microscopes normally blur structures smaller than 200 nanometres. Super-resolution imaging tools have achieved resolutions of 10–20 nanometres, but still lack the precision needed to distinguish between individual sugars that sit less than 10 nanometres apart in the glycocalyx.\n\nSugars are also notoriously difficult to tag with visible markers that make them show up under a microscope. “They cannot be genetically modified, and there are no antibodies to target them,” Simoncelli explains.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, Almahayni and his colleagues combined two Nobel-prizewinning techniques. One is super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, which uses blinking fluorescent tags to map molecules; the other is click chemistry, which links two molecules and can be used inside cells.\n\nThe authors wanted to image two types of sugar — sialic acids and N-acetyllactosamine — on the surface of cells that line blood capillaries. They started by feeding the cells modified sugars, which the cells added to their natural sugar coating. These modified sugars carried a chemical tag that allowed the researchers to attach DNA strands of six different types to the glycocalyx’s sugar molecules, which served as a docking point.",

          "abstract": "Tom Lehrer was a mathematician and internationally famous musical satirist.Credit: Anthony Pidgeon/Redferns via Getty\n\nDespite being best known for his humorous and satirical songs, Tom Lehrer, who died on 26 July at the age of 97, spent most of his life as an academic mathematician. His songs, hugely popular especially in his native United States, often touched on scientific and mathematical topics, earning him many fans in the research world.\n\n“He was really one of a kind,” says mathematician Marcus du Sautoy at the University of Oxford, UK. “I don’t think anyone has quite matched him before or since for his clever yet extremely informed mathematical and scientific lyrics.”\n\nLehrer’s 1951 song ‘Lobachevsky’, for instance, is a satire on the value of plagiarism for academic success, presented in the voice of a Russian mathematician who learnt the secret from Nikolai Lobachevsky, a pioneer of hyperbolic geometry. (“Plagiarize/Let no one else’s work evade your eyes”, he sang; “Only be sure always to call it research.”) The song, says du Sautoy, “was the first time I heard the name Lobachevsky, one of the great nineteenth-century geometers”.\n\nBorn in 1928 to a Jewish family in New York City, Lehrer was a prodigy who entered Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, aged 15 and graduated with a degree in mathematics in 1946. He worked for a time at a company that made scientific instruments, while singing in theatres and clubs in the Boston area. He recorded an album in 1953; despite (or perhaps because of) their sometimes risqué or dark subject matter, his songs gradually acquired a cult following.\n\nIn 1955, Lehrer was drafted into the US Army, after which he was recruited to work for the US National Security Agency. In 1960, he returned to academia, teaching mathematics first at Harvard, then at the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later at the University of California, Santa Cruz (where he also taught a class in musical theatre). He continued to perform and tour in the late 1950s and the 1960s, becoming popular in the United Kingdom through his weekly slot supplying satirical songs for the BBC television show The Frost Report.\n\nSuch exposure made him an icon for other musical satirists and light entertainers, such as Richard Stilgoe, a regular contributor to the BBC’s Nationwide and That’s Life!. “For my dad, Lehrer was a hero,” says Stilgoe’s son Jack Stilgoe, a specialist on responsible innovation at University College London.\n\nLehrer’s satires on science and academic life, says Stilgoe, “showed the public a world they wouldn’t otherwise see, at a time when scientists were becoming entangled in the cold war and other high-stakes issues”.\n\n“His lyrics could be vicious,” says Stilgoe, citing in particular Lehrer’s 1965 attack on the German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who was brought to work for the US space programme after developing the V-2 bomb in Nazi Germany (“Don’t say that he’s hypocritical/Say rather that he’s apolitical/Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?” ). The song “is just as relevant today as we think about the products that big tech launches into the world”, says Stilgoe.\n\nProbably the most familiar of Lehrer’s compositions to many scientists is ‘The Elements’ (1959), a virtuoso run through the chemical elements of the periodic table, set to a tune from Gilbert and Sullivan’s operetta The Pirates of Penzance.\n\n“One of my science teachers lent me a tape with songs of his on,” says du Sautoy. “I was a big Gilbert and Sullivan fan, so of course I fell for the elements song straight away.”",

          "abstract": "Attendees at a meeting of a US Senate appropriations committee on 31 July: from left, Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state; Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine; and Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky.Credit: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty\n\nA US Senate committee has voted to reject Republican President Donald Trump’s plan to cut the 2026 budget of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) by 40% and to collapse its 27 institutes and centres into 8. Instead, Republicans and Democrats on the committee endorsed maintaining the biomedical agency’s structure and increasing its funding by US$400 million, or about 1%.\n\nThe details, presented in a bill released today by the committee, will probably change before the bill is signed into law. But the initial figure for the NIH, discussed at a meeting yesterday, offers yet another hint that the US Congress, which controls government spending, does not support Trump’s desire to slash US science. (Earlier this month, another Senate committee said it wanted to keep the budget for the US National Science Foundation relatively flat despite Trump’s call for a 57% reduction.)\n\n“Given the alternative, the Senate’s recommendation of a $400-million increase for NIH is an indication the agency still has support on Capitol Hill,” says Jennifer Zeitzer, director of public affairs at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland. “A 40% cut would have been devastating, so this is a good outcome in a tough year.”\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe bill now faces several challenges. First, the full Senate must pass it. Then, the lower chamber of Congress, the US House of Representatives, will pass its own version, and the two bodies must come together to agree on a single bill that Trump is willing to sign.\n\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\n\nThe bill might also change if legislators introduce amendments before it’s sent to Trump’s desk. For example, Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator for Illinois, tried at the meeting yesterday to add a provision to reinstate billions of dollars in health-research funding that had been frozen or terminated by the Trump administration because projects — including some on COVID-19 — did not align with agency priorities.\n\nThe amendment failed in a vote that fell along party lines, with 14 Democrats voting for it and 15 Republicans voting against it. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican senator for West Virginia, urged her colleagues to vote against the amendment, saying that “every president has the prerogative to implement new goals and priorities”.\n\nNevertheless, senators at the hearing rejoiced that they could come to a bipartisan agreement to fund health agencies: “To the scientists wondering if there will even be an NIH by the end of this administration, this committee’s resounding message is: ‘Yes, Congress has your back’,” said Patty Murray, a Democratic senator for Washington state and vice-chair of the committee. “We need you to stay here and keep this research going.”\n\nUnder the bill, budgets for other health agencies would also remain roughly the same. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose budget the Trump administration wanted to cut by more than half, would receive $9.1 billion, compared with $9.2 billion in 2024.\n\nTurbulent times\n\nThe committee meeting comes towards the end of a tumultuous week for the NIH, after the White House blocked, and then unblocked, the agency from spending the remainder of its 2025 budget — about $15 billion — by issuing grants. With the NIH cancelling grant-review meetings in early 2025, funding processes have been delayed, and agency staff members are working in overdrive to process as many grants as possible before the end of the fiscal year on 30 September. If they don’t distribute the money, the agency will have to return the unused funds to the US Treasury.\n\nUS senators poised to reject Trump’s proposed massive science cuts\n\nThese disruptions have drawn condemnation, and not only from Trump’s opponents: 14 Republican senators sent a letter to the White House on 25 July demanding that the NIH be allowed to spend its full 2025 budget.",

But HIV attacks the immune system, and the body rarely manages to clear it out. As a result, candidates for vaccines against the virus must undergo lots of testing through trial and error.\n\nThat makes HIV vaccines a good place to use mRNA technology. The first mRNA vaccine was approved in 2020, for COVID-19. Compared with other modes of delivery, mRNA vaccines can be modified at low cost quickly — in months, not years — which enables researchers to test out different strategies. The vaccines work by delivering instructions to cells, in the form of mRNA, to produce specific proteins typically found on the surface of viruses. This induces an immune response, which helps the body to recognize and clear out a virus, should it be exposed to the real thing.\n\nBound or free\n\nHIV uses an ‘envelope’ protein on its outer membrane to bind to and infect cells. In the latest study, published in Science Translational Medicine, a team including William Schief at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, who works on protein design, conducted a small trial, comparing two vaccine approaches. In one, the standard method for HIV vaccine candidates, the cell is directed to produce envelope proteins that float freely. In the other, the mRNA vaccine instructs the cell to make envelope proteins that are attached to the cell membrane — similar to how they are found in the live virus. The authors describe animal tests of this method in a companion paper2.\n\nThe trial involved 108 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 across ten study sites in the United States. It tested two membrane-bound vaccine candidates and one unbound candidate.\n\nParticipants each received three doses of a single vaccine, at a low or high dose, several weeks apart; which vaccine they received was selected randomly. The vaccines were provided by pharmaceutical company Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Schief is vice-president for protein design.\n\nSome 80% of the participants who received either of the vaccines that made membrane-bound proteins went on to produce antibodies that could block that protein from entering cells. By contrast, only 4% of the participants who received the unbound-protein vaccine produced corresponding antibodies.\n\n“The difference is pretty striking,” says Lewin. She expects the findings to inform the development of future vaccine candidates.\n\nSide effects",

          "abstract": "Brenda Namumba, shown receiving her PhD, would not have switched from teaching in a secondary school to become an astronomer without the scholarships and encouragement she received. Credit: Brenda Namumba\nRadioastronomy in Africa\n\nIn 2005, when South Africa and its partner countries in Africa submitted a proposal to host the world’s largest radio telescope, called the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the continent had five radioastronomers, all based in South Africa. That year, the country embarked on a targeted human-capital-development programme to develop the talent needed to build, operate and use radio telescopes, which collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the government-funded programme has created 5 research chair positions and more than 1,370 scholarships for undergraduate, master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral studies — at a total cost of about 500 million rand (US$28 million).\n\nNow, the SKA is under construction. It will have more than 100,000 tree-like antennas in Australia and almost 200 dish antennas in South Africa. South Africa owns and operates several radio telescopes, and there are hundreds of radioastronomers and radioastronomy students at African universities and institutions.\n\nNature’s careers team spoke to officials and scientists working to boost Africa’s radioastronomy capacity, in part through the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. In the last of a short series of articles investigating the growth of the discipline on the continent, Brenda Namumba, who was the first woman to receive a doctorate in astrophysics in Zambia, talks about how networks built her career.\n\nI only found out about astronomy back in 2009, as an undergraduate studying physics, when I happened to attend an international conference on space science and astronomy at the University of Zambia in Lusaka. That was the first time I heard about young people studying space science and astronomy at the master’s or PhD level. Back then, I had not even met anyone from Zambia doing a master’s in physics.\n\nAt the meeting, I interacted with established scholars and graduate students, who told me about their research and what they wanted to do in future. We kept in touch and some of them helped me to apply for scholarships and explained how to write a personal statement.\n\n‘I didn’t know someone could pursue astronomy as a career’\n\nThe conference made me decide to further my studies, and I applied for many scholarships while working as a secondary-school physics and mathematics teacher. Eventually, in 2012, I was accepted into South Africa’s National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP) as an honours undergraduate student at the University of Cape Town (UCT). This scholarship programme, established in 2003, has supported more than 300 honours-degree students and more than 140 master’s candidates.\n\nDiverse astronomy\n\nThe programme introduced me to the idea that astronomers can make use of a range of electromagnetic wavelengths. In 2012, there was a lot of talk about the exciting science that was going to happen with the SKA. That was the year when it was decided to split the telescope between South Africa and Australia. South Africa had built the 7-dish KAT-7 radio telescope, which was the test bed for its 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope that will eventually form part of the SKA. I wanted to be at the forefront of answering some of the interesting questions that these radio instruments would make it possible to tackle.\n\nOne topic in particular caught my attention. During my honour’s degree, I took a course in extragalactic astronomy in which the lecturer (who later became my PhD supervisor) talked about dwarf galaxies. At the time, they hadn’t been explored in much detail with optical telescopes because they are faint and difficult to detect, and the situation was even worse at radio wavelengths. But, the new generation of instruments, such as KAT-7, was better suited to exploring their structure and properties to understand galaxy evolution. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) funded my master’s degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban in 2013, my doctorate at the UCT in 2015, and then my first postdoc at Rhodes University in Makhanda from 2019 to 2022.\n\nThe power of networks\n\nSARAO gave me this great opportunity, and it wasn’t solely about my academic qualifications. I’ve been able to attend conferences around the world, which have given me a different mindset concerning how people do research, and also confidence in presenting my work. For example, at the SARAO Postgraduate and Postdoctoral Research Conference, the organizers, who include SARAO staff and researchers from universities across South Africa, guide us in how to present our work and interact with colleagues and experts.",

Diamond is not only the hardest material found in nature, but also one with exceptionally high thermal conductivity, remarkable transparency to visible light and almost perfect chemical inertness — making it ideal for many technological purposes. However, natural diamonds are scarce, hard to extract from geological sources and vary in quality, making it difficult to exploit their extraordinary properties.

          "title": "China reins in the spiralling construction costs of nuclear power — what can other countries learn?",
          "authors": "Shangwei Liu, Gang He, Minghao Qiu, Daniel M. Kammen",
          "abstract": "Once again, the world is betting on nuclear power. The United States aims to quadruple its nuclear capacity by 2050, and more than 30 countries have pledged to triple global capacity by mid-century. China has more than 30 reactors under construction and in planning, and France has announced plans to build 14 reactors. Technology giants, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, are also investing in nuclear to power their energy-hungry data centres and lower their carbon emissions.\n\nA central challenge remains: can development be done at a manageable cost? Historically, the industry has faced a ‘cost escalation curse’1–4. Building more nuclear reactors has led to higher, not lower, costs per watt (see ‘Costly construction’), hampering their economic viability. By contrast, for solar and wind energy, mass production and steady technological improvements have driven costs down5,6.\n\nSource: Analysis by S. Liu et al.\n\nThe cost of building nuclear power plants can soar because of a lack of standardized designs, rising material and labour costs, evolving regulations and technical complexities7. But is this cost escalation inevitable? Here, we show that tailored regulations and policies can reverse the trend. Decades of nuclear-energy development in China demonstrate that construction costs can be brought down through a combination of stable regulations and efforts to strengthen domestic supply chains.\n\nChina’s success in curbing costs\n\nOver the past two decades, China has been the main country to substantially and consistently expand its nuclear fleet, to 58 operating reactors in 2024. Since 2022, the government has been approving around ten new reactors each year, putting China on track to surpass the United States and become the world’s largest holder of nuclear power capacity by 2030. State-affiliated research centres have outlined a goal of quintupling China’s current nuclear capacity by 2050.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nWe have compiled and analysed a data set on the construction costs of nuclear power plants in China, drawn from a wide range of publicly available sources (see Supplementary information for raw data and further analyses). We focus on the cost of construction, because operating and fuel costs are relatively low and have remained stable3,8.\n\nOur findings are striking. Whereas construction costs increased substantially between the 1960s and 2000s, by around tenfold in the United States and by nearly twofold in France, they had halved in China by the early 2000s and have remained largely stable since.\n\nVarious strategies were used to keep technological costs down, such as building larger plants for scale efficiency and leveraging accumulated experience. But these alone fail to fully explain the cost-reduction trend observed in China. The country has also managed to contain costs through strategic development of domestic supply chains, stable regulatory frameworks, state-backed incentive policies and effective construction management.\n\nThe key driver of cost reduction has been China’s deliberate effort to build domestic capacity in civil nuclear power, which unfolded in three stages. From the 1990s to 2005, China imported foreign reactors to deploy immediately while gradually producing simple, conventional components domestically and using Chinese firms for civil engineering and construction to reduce costs. At the same time, it began researching and developing its own reactor design based on French technology.\n\nThe nuclear vessel inside the Flamanville 3 reactor in northwestern France.Credit: Lou Benoist/AFP via Getty\n\nBetween 2005 and 2010, these efforts to localize production advanced to include more complex, safety-critical components, such as reactor cores. China ramped up capacity, building about 30 reactors using two domestically developed model types. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, China accelerated the adoption of advanced safety features by collaborating with partners from the United States and France, while developing its own advanced reactor models.\n\nSubstituting expensive imports with domestically produced components substantially reduces cost. Some Chinese-made nuclear components, such as tubes, ring cranes and charging pumps, cost half as much as their imported equivalents. However, for countries that import their nuclear technologies, domestic supply-chain building must be strategic. For example, South Korea adopted a similar approach to China, which led to cost reductions4,9. By contrast, around the 1980s, France deviated from the tried-and-tested US reactor design in favour of a national version, which hindered standardization and caused construction costs to soar3.\n\nWill AI’s huge energy demands spur a nuclear renaissance?\n\nChina’s regulatory structure and policy environment also play an important part. A consistent, state-backed industrial policy has provided stable electricity tariffs and low-interest financing for state-owned nuclear power companies (see go.nature.com/3uhsdfd). Its centralized nuclear governance structure helps to ensure regulatory stability and coordinates reactor standardization across the country.",

          "abstract": "Although many EMCRs in academia are passionate about their research, they also report experiences of intense demands, and stress over finances and uncertain futures1. Ultimately, many EMCRs feel that to succeed in academia, other areas of life often require substantial sacrifices1. Although these issues are by no means new, there are concerns that with the heightened competition for positions and the demands placed on academics, these problems become increasingly exacerbated for up-and-coming researchers2. This is generally reflected in mental health and job satisfaction: those in middling positions such as post-doctoral or non-tenure-tracked roles report less satisfaction, reduced well-being and increased disillusionment, as compared with PhD candidates or their more senior peers3.\n\nAlthough the challenges faced by EMCRs are well known and have previously been discussed in the literature, more progress towards meaningful change is still needed. A recent commentary by Rahal et al.4 discussed ways in which policies and the wider research society could be improved for the benefit of up-and-coming researchers. Proposed solutions include prioritizing funding for longer-term or permanent positions, increasing the emphasis on quality as opposed to quantity of publications when evaluating researcher performance, and better education and resources for skill development for research and other academic duties4. Undoubtedly, all of these areas warrant considerable attention from government, funders and institutions. Yet, many of the commonly discussed issues, including those mentioned above, are based on more systemic factors that lie beyond the scholar’s control. This emphasizes the need for a wholesale change of policy and academic governance. Yet, although we agree such changes are inherently needed, major changes to the way in which research is taught, funded and rewarded will inevitably take time to implement — if they occur at all — and address only part of the problem that EMCRs face.",

In late 2022 and early 2023, we tested whether particular large language models—then in widespread use—generated completions that simulated altruism when prompted with text inputs similar to those used in ‘dictator game’ experiments measuring human altruism. Here we report that one model in our initial study set—OpenAI’s text-davinci-003—consistently generated completions that simulated payoff maximization in a non-social decision task yet simulated altruism in dictator games. Comparable completions appeared when we replicated our experiments, altered prompt phrasing, varied model parameters, altered currencies described in the prompt and studied a subsequent model, GPT-4. Furthermore, application of explainable artificial intelligence techniques showed that results changed little when instructing the system to ignore past research on the dictator or ultimatum games but changed noticeably when instructing the system to focus on the needs of particular participants in a simulated social encounter.",

          "authors": "Gaurav Kamath, Michelle Yang, Siva Reddy, Morgan Sonderegger, Dallas Card",
          "abstract": "A central question in the study of language change is whether or not such change is generational. If a language changes over time generation-by-generation, the process looks as follows: New generations of speakers introduce innovations, while older speakers conserve their usage patterns, and the language changes as new generations replace older ones. At the opposite extreme, language change could be a zeitgeist phenomenon, in which changes are universally adopted by speakers simultaneously, regardless of age or generational cohort. This paper asks this question in the context of word meaning change. We analyze meaning change in over 100 words across more than 7.9 million U.S. congressional speeches, to observe whether, when a word sense rises or falls in prominence, adult speakers from different generations uniformly adopt it, or those from older generations conserve their prior usage. Using language model-based word sense induction methods, we identify different senses of each word, and then model the prevalence of each of these word senses as a function of time and speaker age. We find that most words show a small but statistically significant effect of speaker age; across almost 140 y of Congress, older speakers typically take longer than younger speakers to follow changes in word usage, but nevertheless do so within a few years. Our findings indicate that despite minor age-based differences, word meaning change among mature speakers is likely not a generational process, but rather a zeitgeist process, in which older adult speakers can readily adopt new word usage patterns.",

          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons that project to the dorsal striatum, and mutations in LRRK2 and GBA1 are the most common genetic causes of familial Parkinson’s disease. Previously, we showed that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations inhibit primary cilia formation in rare interneurons and astrocytes of the mouse and human dorsal striatum. This blocks Hedgehog signaling and reduces synthesis of neuroprotective GDNF and NRTN, which normally support dopamine neurons vulnerable in PD. Here, we show that GBA1 mutations also impair Hedgehog signaling and Hedgehog-dependent neuroprotective factor production by a distinct mechanism. Loss of GBA1 activity increases lysosomal accessible cholesterol and thus decreases accessible cholesterol in primary cilia of cultured cells; this change in lipid composition blocks ciliary Hedgehog signaling that depends on accessible cholesterol. Consistent with defects in Hedgehog signaling in the mouse dorsal striatum, GBA1 mutant mice show reduced Hedgehog-induced Gdnf RNA expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons, with no detectable impact on cilia formation. Also, both LRRK2 and GBA1 mutations suppress Hedgehog-induced Bdnf expression in striatal astrocytes. These findings underscore the role of Hedgehog signaling in the nigrostriatal circuit and reveal a convergent mechanism by which distinct LRRK2 and GBA1 mutations may contribute to PD pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Ecosystem connectivity—the uninterrupted flow of natural processes within and among ecosystems—is critical for maintaining healthy ecosystem functions. However, in the Amazon drainage basin, multiple anthropogenic activities are rapidly disrupting connectivity. To assess the severity of this problem, we analyzed the spatial distributions of six major anthropogenic activities: dam construction, deforestation, fire, mining, oil and gas exploitation, and roads. We examined their impacts across four key landscapes: Amazonian Andes, lowland nonflooded forests, wetlands, and rivers. Using a resistance-based connectivity model, we quantified connectivity across terrestrial, wetland, and river ecosystems and found a marked decline in connectivity across the basin. A central focus of our study was the role of Indigenous Territories and Protected Areas (ITPAs), which collectively cover over 50% of the basin. Our findings show that ITPAs sustain significantly high levels of ecosystem connectivity. Only 14 to 16% of ITPA land is impacted by anthropogenic activities, compared to 38% in unprotected areas. Terrestrial ecosystems in the southern and eastern Amazon are heavily impacted by deforestation, mining, and fires, with significantly higher connectivity inside ITPAs than in unprotected areas ( P &lt; 0.01). Wetlands and riverine ecosystems also face severe fragmentation, particularly from dams and illegal mining—but maintain stronger connectivity within ITPAs (wetlands: P &lt; 0.01; rivers: P &lt; 0.001), with the few remaining free-flowing Andean rivers increasingly isolated from the lowland Amazon. Strengthening governance and sustainable initiatives in ITPAs, in partnership with local inhabitants, represents an expedient, efficient, and cost-effective strategy for conserving ecosystem connectivity in the Amazon basin.",

However, extracting such information from genomic data requires powerful statistical inference methods. A recent analysis of genomic sequence data found little evidence for gene flow from domestic Bactrian camels into the endangered wild Bactrian species. Nevertheless, the methods used to infer gene flow are based on data summaries and lack the power and precision to represent the complex phylogenetic history of the species with gene flow. Here, we apply Bayesian methods to genomic sequence data to test for both recent and ancient gene flow among the three species in the genus Camelus and to estimate the strength and timing of gene flow. We detect a strong signal of gene flow from domestic into wild Bactrian camels, confirming early evidence based on mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome. Overall gene flow appears to affect the autosomal genome uniformly, with similar effective rates of gene flow for exonic and noncoding regions. Estimation of species divergence times is seriously affected if gene flow is not accommodated in the analysis. Our results highlight the power of the coalescent model in analysis of genomic data and the utility of the coding as well as noncoding parts of the genome in elucidating the evolutionary history of modern species.",

We then evaluated the response of these trauma-predictive brain networks to an acute emotional and physiological stressor in a subsample of participants ( N = 92) and to a pharmacological manipulation (hydrocortisone) in an independent crossover study ( N = 27). We found that connectome-based predictive modeling successfully predicted past trauma exposure. The network associated with greater trauma exposure showed high involvement of salience network connections, with model prediction driven by connectivity in the medial frontal cortex, salience network, motor regions, default mode network, and cerebellum. Notably, connectivity in this trauma-predictive network was significantly attenuated following an acute stressor relative to control. A similar pattern was observed in the pharmacology sample, with decreased connectivity under hydrocortisone compared to placebo within this trauma-predictive network. Finally, attenuated trauma-predictive network connectivity after acute stress was associated with lower depressive symptoms in the stress-exposed group, but not control group. These findings suggest that stress may induce blunted connectivity of brain networks related to past traumatic experiences and that the reduced engagement of these trauma-predictive brain networks may facilitate adaptive regulatory response to later stress.",

According to previous isotopic studies, much of the perchlorate deposited to the Earth’s surface is formed in the atmosphere, with 36 Cl suggesting a large contribution from the stratosphere. Here, we present measurements of perchlorate in stratospheric aerosol particles and confirm that the stratosphere is an important source of perchlorate, whereas we did not observe production in the troposphere. Mass mixing ratios of aerosol perchlorate in the stratosphere were 1 to 10 parts per trillion by mass (pptm), with the highest concentrations observed in summer and in the Southern Hemisphere. Almost all of the perchlorate is in biomass burning and nitrogen-rich particles, despite those types contributing only a few percent of the aerosol particles. Such particles are less acidic than the majority of sulfuric acid particles. If the formation of perchlorate is sensitive to acidity, then the injection of some materials for solar radiation modification might significantly increase the global production of perchlorate.",

          "abstract": "Voltage-sensing phosphatase (VSP) comprises a voltage sensor domain (VSD) and a cytoplasmic catalytic region (CCR), achieving a unique electrochemical signal conversion. Previous studies suggest that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ), a membrane phospholipid known to be critical for activities of diverse voltage-gated ion channels, associates with a linker connecting the VSD with the CCR of VSP and regulates VSD-CCR coupling. However, the details of PI(4,5)P 2 interaction with the linker of VSP remain elusive. Here, we exploit advantage of sensitivity of a fluorescent unnatural amino acid, 3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropanoic acid (Anap), to changes in local environment to study interaction between PI(4,5)P 2 and the linker of Ciona intestinalis VSP (Ci-VSP). We found that a conserved tyrosine residue (Y255) as well as neighboring basic residues interacts with PI(4,5)P 2 and this interaction was maintained in G365A Ci-VSP mutant which lacks the substrate PI(4,5)P 2 at the active site and Ci-VSP/human phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) chimera which does not dephosphorylate PI(4,5)P 2 , indicating that the linker interacts with nonsubstrate, regulatory PI(4,5)P 2 outside the active site. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the linker formed stable interaction with PI(4,5)P 2 in the activated state. These findings indicate that regulation of coupling to an effector region downstream of the VSD through PI(4,5)P 2 binding to the linker is shared among voltage-dependent membrane proteins.",

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRH PVN ) control both the neuroendocrine stress axis as well as stress-associated behaviors. However, it is currently unclear how the resting activity of these neurons is coordinated with both spontaneous behavior and ultradian pulses of corticosteroid secretion. To investigate this, we performed fiber photometry recordings of CRH PVN neuron activity in Crh-Ires-Cre mice and a newly generated line of Crh-Ires-Cre rats. In both mice and rats, CRH PVN neurons displayed an ultradian rhythm of activity with reoccurring upstates of activity approximately once per hour over the 24-h day. Upstates in activity were coordinated with increases in animal activity/arousal. Chemogenetic activation of CRH PVN neurons was also sufficient to induce behavioral arousal. In rats, increases in CRH neural activity preceded some pulses of corticosteroid secretion but not others. Thus, while CRH PVN neurons display an ultradian rhythm of activity over the 24-h day that is coordinated with behavioral arousal, the relationship between CRH PVN activity and pulses of corticosteroid secretion is not one-to-one.",

Rapid, recent radiations are ideal systems for this question because they still show key morphological and ecological adaptations associated with speciation. While most research on recent radiations focuses on those occurring in insular environments, less attention has been given to continental radiations with complex species interactions. Here, we study the drivers of continental radiations of Melinaea and Mechanitis butterflies (Nymphalidae: Ithomiini), which have rapidly radiated in the continental Neotropics. They are classical models for Amazonian biogeography and color pattern mimicry and have been proposed as biodiversity indicators. We generated reference genomes for five species of each genus and whole-genome resequencing data of most species and subspecies covering a wide geographic range to assess phylogeographic relationships, hybridization patterns, and chromosomal rearrangements. Our data help resolve the classification of these taxonomically challenging butterflies and reveal very high diversification rates. We find rampant evidence of historical hybridization and putative hybrid species in both radiations, which may have facilitated their rapid diversification by enriching the genetic diversity. Moreover, we identified dozens of chromosomal fusions and fissions between congeneric species that have likely expedited reproductive isolation. We conclude that interactions between geography, hybridization and chromosomal rearrangements have contributed to these rapid radiations in the highly diverse Neotropical region. We hypothesize that rapid radiations may be spurred if repeated periods of geographic isolation are combined with lineage-specific rapid accumulation of incompatibilities, followed by secondary contact with some gene exchange.",

          "abstract": "Kagome metals have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics due to their potential to host exotic quantum states. Among these, CsV 3 Sb 5 has attracted significant attention for the unusual coexistence of charge density wave (CDW) order and unconventional superconductivity, presenting an ideal system for exploring the emergent phenomena from the interplay of phonons, electronic fluctuations, and topological effects. The nature of CDW formation in CsV 3 Sb 5 is unconventional and has sparked considerable debate. In this study, we examine the origin of the CDW state via ab initio finite-temperature simulations of the lattice dynamics. Through a comparative study of CsV 3 Sb 5 and 2H-NbSe 2 , we demonstrate that the experimental absence of phonon softening—a hallmark of conventional CDW transition—in CsV 3 Sb 5 along with the presence of a weakly first-order transition, can be attributed to quantum zero-point atomic motion. This zero-point motion smears the free energy landscape of CDW, effectively stabilizing the pristine structure even below the CDW transition temperature. We argue that this surprising behavior could cause coexistence of pristine and CDW structures across the transition and lead to a weak first-order transition. Our predicted lattice dynamical behavior is supported by coherent phonon spectroscopy in single-crystalline CsV 3 Sb 5 . Our results provide crucial insights into the formation mechanism of CDW materials that exhibit little to no phonon softening, including cuprates, and highlight the surprising role of quantum effects in emergent properties of relatively heavy-element materials like CsV 3 Sb 5 .",

The outcome of these interactions for plant hosts varies quantitatively and can range from highly beneficial to even detrimental depending on natural genetic variation in microbial symbionts. Here, we take a systems genetics approach, harnessing the genetic diversity present in wild rhizobial populations to predict genes and molecular pathways crucial in determining partner quality, i.e., the benefits of symbiosis for legume hosts. We combine traits, dual-RNAseq of both partners from active nodules, pangenomics/pantranscriptomics, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) for a panel of 20 Sinorhizobium meliloti strains that vary in symbiotic partner quality. We find that genetic variation in the nodule transcriptome predicts host plant biomass, and WGCNA reveals networks of genes in plants and rhizobia that are coexpressed and associated with high-quality symbiosis. Presence–absence variation of gene clusters on the symbiosis plasmid (pSymA), validated in planta, is associated with high or low-quality symbiosis and is found within important coexpression modules. Functionally our results point to management of oxidative stress, amino acid and carbohydrate transport, and NCR peptide signaling mechanisms in driving symbiotic outcomes. Our integrative approach highlights the complex genetic architecture of microbial partner quality and raises hypotheses about the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of symbiosis.",

          "abstract": "What are the principles that govern the responses of cortical networks to their inputs and the emergence of these responses from recurrent connectivity? Recent experiments have probed these questions by measuring cortical responses to two-photon optogenetic perturbations of single cells in the mouse primary visual cortex. A robust theoretical framework is needed to determine the implications of these responses for cortical recurrence. Here, we propose a formulation of the dependence of cell-type-specific connectivity on spatial distance that yields an exact analytic solution for the linear perturbation response of a model with multiple cell types and space- and feature-dependent connectivity. Importantly and unlike previous approaches, the solution is valid in regimes of strong as well as weak intracortical coupling. Analysis reveals the structure of connectivity implied by various features of single-cell perturbation responses, such as the surprisingly narrow spatial radius of nearby excitation beyond which inhibition dominates, the number of transitions between mean excitation and inhibition thereafter, and the dependence of these responses on feature preferences. Comparison of these results to existing optogenetic perturbation data yields constraints on cell-type-specific connection strengths and their tuning dependence. Finally, we provide experimental predictions regarding the response of inhibitory neurons to single-cell perturbations and the modulation of perturbation response by neuronal gain.",

Among these, we show that the DUF1907 domain of C11orf54 catalyzes formation of L-xylulose by establishing a zinc-coordinated Michaelis complex with β-keto-L-gulonate (BKG). The identification of BKG decarboxylase completes the pentose pathway, in which pentose sugars are produced by decarboxylation of nonphosphorylated hexose precursors. The pathway was present in the unicellular ancestor of animals and is conserved in all deuterostomes, in contrast to the alternative L-ascorbate (vitamin C) biosynthesis pathway. An increased flux toward pentoses may have represented an evolutionary tradeoff, favoring energy metabolism and redox cofactor balance at the expense of ascorbate biosynthesis in organisms, such as humans and other Haplorhini primates, where dietary vitamin C intake prevents scurvy.",

          "abstract": "Effective immune therapy against cancer ideally should target a cancer-specific antigen, an antigen that is present exclusively in cancer cells. However, there is a paucity of cancer-specific antigens that are endogenously produced. HapImmune™ technology utilizes covalent inhibitors directed to an intracellular cancer driver to create cancer-specific neoantigens in the form of drug–peptide conjugates presented by class I MHC molecules. Our previous study with sotorasib, an FDA-approved covalent inhibitor of KRAS(G12C), demonstrated that drug-treated cells produce such neoantigens and can be killed by T cell engagers directed against the drug–peptide/MHC complex. Thus, this technology can unite targeted and immune therapies. In the present study, we examined whether this approach could generalize to another FDA-approved KRAS(G12C) inhibitor, adagrasib, whose chemical structure and cysteine reactivity differ substantially from sotorasib. We developed antibodies selective to adagrasib-KRAS(G12C) peptides presented by HLA-A*03 and A*11 that also show cross-reactivity to other KRAS(G12C) inhibitors presented in the same manner. Cryoelectron microscopy structures revealed a mode of adagrasib-peptide/HLA recognition distinctly different from that of sotorasib-directed HapImmune antibodies. The antibodies in a bispecific T cell engager format killed adagrasib-resistant lung cancer cells upon adagrasib treatment. These results support the broad applicability of the HapImmune approach for creating actionable cancer-specific neoantigens and offer candidates for therapeutic development.",

          "abstract": "Our current understanding of protein folding is based predominantly on studies of small (&lt;150 aa) proteins that refold reversibly from a chemically denatured state. However, as protein length increases so does the competition between off-pathway misfolding and on-pathway folding, creating a more complex energy landscape (\"folding funnel\"). Little is known about how intermediates populated during the folding of larger proteins affect navigation of this more complex landscape. Previously, we reported extremely slow folding rates for the 539 aa β-helical passenger domain of pertactin (P.69T), including conditions that favor the formation of a kinetically trapped, off-pathway partially folded state (PFS). Existence of an on-pathway intermediate for P.69T folding was speculated but its characterization remained elusive. In this work, we exploited the extremely slow kinetics of PFS unfolding to develop a double-jump “denaturant challenge” assay. With this assay, we identified a transient unfolding intermediate, PFS*, that adopts a similar structure to PFS, including C-terminal folded structure and a disordered N terminus, yet unfolds much more quickly than PFS. Additional experiments revealed that PFS* also functions as an on-pathway intermediate for P.69T folding. Collectively, these results support a C-to-N-terminal model for P.69T folding, with folding initiated in the C-terminus with the rate-limiting formation of the transient on-pathway PFS* intermediate, which sits at the junction of the kinetic competition between folding and misfolding. Notably, processive folding from C-to-N terminus also occurs during C-to-N-terminal translocation of P.69T across the bacterial outer membrane. These results illuminate the crucial role of kinetics when navigating a complex energy landscape for protein folding.",

With the widespread availability of genomic data, investigating historical reticulate evolution across taxa has gained significant attention, driven by the rapid development of statistical methods for detecting nontreelike patterns. Phylogenetic networks provide a biologically intuitive approach to depicting evolutionary processes such as hybrid speciation and introgressive hybridization, which result in signatures of historical gene flow. Interpreting phylogenetic networks is especially critical for groups of conservation concern that lack reference genome resources and explicit hypotheses from prior investigation, such as those based on molecular data, morphology, or species distributions. Here, we highlight recent advances in computational methods for inferring networks from genome-scale data and offer guidelines for deriving biological insights from phylogenetic networks. Particular emphasis is placed on modeling hybridization and whole-genome duplication in the context of allopolyploidization. Practical recommendations for empirical studies and the limitations of commonly used methods are discussed throughout. We anticipate that phylogenetic networks will influence conservation biology and biodiversity research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of reticulate evolution inferred from these networks in the near future. Networks will accelerate other pressing avenues of biodiversity research, especially investigations of orphan crops and climate change resilience in natural systems. The promise of phylogenetic networks connects with broader themes in the special feature Monitoring and restoring gene flow in the increasingly fragmented ecosystems of the Anthropocene by providing an emerging probabilistic framework for inferring historical connectivity between species and populations.",

Here, we revisit this longstanding Akilia controversy using potassium isotope analyses, comparing Akilia samples with BIFs and black shales spanning the Eoarchean to Mesoproterozoic. Our results demonstrate that BIFs and black shales show systematic potassium isotope variations correlated with their potassium contents. Potassium-poor BIF layers display heavier isotopic compositions close to seawater values, whereas clay-rich layers exhibit elevated potassium contents and lighter isotopic signatures. The Akilia quartz-pyroxene rock was initially characterized by low potassium concentrations and heavy potassium isotopic compositions consistent with chemical sediments deposited from ancient seawater. It was subsequently modified by metasomatic fluids derived from nearby metamorphosed igneous rocks. These findings support a sedimentary origin for the Akilia quartz-pyroxene rock.

Here, we introduce Casimir self-assembly (CaSA) as a platform, integrating colloidal science, nanophotonics, and fluctuational electrodynamics to study long-range interactions and stability in planar SA systems. Using thermal fluctuations as a probe and visible-range Fabry–Pérot resonances as an optical readout, we demonstrate that CaSA enables a direct in situ study of the Casimir–Lifshitz electrostatic interaction. This approach allows us to map stability regimes of colloidal materials by varying ionic strength and identifying conditions for stable assembly and aggregation limits, and moreover is used to measure the surface charge density of an individual colloidal object down to fractions of an electron charge per square nanometer. Our platform overcomes the limitations of current methods, providing an experimental tool for exploring SA dynamics in situ and expanding the understanding of suspension stability in liquids at the single-particle level. With potential for future applications, CaSA is scalable for studying interfacial forces and is adaptable to multivalent electrolytes and biosensing.",

          "abstract": "Influenza represents a significant threat with seasonal epidemics that can transition to global pandemics, and cross-species infection presenting a continuous challenge. While vaccines and several antiviral drugs are available, constant genetic changes vitiate these prevention and treatment options. Consequently, we decided to search for inhibitors against one of the virus’s validated drug targets, its M2 channel that is blocked by aminoadamantanes. Regrettably, widespread mutations in M2 abolish the antiflu activity of said blockers. Therefore, we devised bacteria-based genetic assays that can screen for drugs against aminoadamantane-sensitive and resistant M2 channels and map the resistance potential of any identifiable blocker. Subsequent in cellulo testing and structure–activity relationship studies yielded a synergistic combination of two compounds, Theobromine and Arainosine, that exhibited remarkable antiviral activity by directly inhibiting the virus’s channel. The drug duo was potent against H1N1 pandemic swine flu, H5N1 pandemic avian flu, and aminoadamantane-resistant and sensitive strains alike, exhibiting activity that surpassed oseltamivir, the leading antiflu drug on the market. When this drug duo was tested in an animal model, it once more outperformed oseltamivir, considerably reducing disease symptoms and viral RNA progeny. Importantly, harnessing the bacterial genetic selection, we could demonstrate that the drug duo’s potential for eliciting drug resistance is significantly smaller and molecularly distinct from that of aminoadamantanes. In conclusion, the outcome of this study represents a new potential treatment option for influenza alongside an approach that is sufficiently general and readily applicable to other viral targets.",

Here, we describe iggypop (indexed Golden Gate gene assembly from PCR-amplified oligonucleotide pools), a simple computational–experimental pipeline that allows for low-cost design and synthesis of hundreds of genes from oligonucleotide pools using Golden Gate assembly methods. We used iggypop to synthesize a series of single-transcript autonomously bioluminescent reporters (STARBURSTs) that link the five genes of a fungal bioluminescence pathway via ribosomal skipping LP4/2A sequences into a 9.5 kb transcript that function in planta. We also synthesized RUBY reporters (a reporter gene system producing red betalain pigment) recoded to match dicot codon usage, as RUBY was codon optimized for rice codon usage and has a high GC content. Surprisingly, the recoded RUBYs substantially reduced betalain production in transient Nicotiana benthamiana assays. Based on this observation, we synthesized six GC-boosted STARBURSTs, which produced robust luminescence in both transient assays and transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Thus, iggypop enabled the rapid synthesis of multiple genetic designs to deliver a bright single transcript autobioluminescent reporter. Iggypop should enable the facile synthesis and optimization of new genetic parts and complex polycistronic pathways.",

          "abstract": "Oxygenic photosynthesis requires excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) to reaction centers (RCs) to drive photochemical redox chemistry. The effective absorption cross section of RCs dynamically responds to the light environment on time scales of seconds to days, allowing rapid acclimations to changes in spectral irradiance and photoprotection under high light, thereby optimizing light absorption for photochemistry. Although energy coupling between LHC–RCs has been studied for decades in laboratory cultures, it remains poorly understood in real-world conditions, where it is potentially influenced by nutrients. In the oceans, one of the most critical micronutrients for photosynthesis is iron (Fe). To investigate the effects of Fe stress on the energetic coupling between LHC–RCs in natural phytoplankton assemblages in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, we assessed photophysiological responses using a pair of custom-built fluorometers measuring chlorophyll-a variable fluorescence and picosecond fluorescence lifetimes. Detailed analysis based on the functional absorption cross section of the oxygen-evolving complex, quantum yield of photochemistry, energetic connectivity of RCs, and the average lifetime of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence suggested that between 10 and 25% of LHCs remain uncoupled from RCs and do not effectively contribute to photochemical charge separation. Addition of Fe to samples under trace metal-clean on-board incubations indicates relatively rapid recoupling (&lt; 24 h) of antennae to photochemistry, followed by biophysical stabilization of recoupled complexes. Our findings highlight the crucial role of micronutrients in controlling the excitation energy transfer from LHCs to RCs in marine phytoplankton and the overall primary productivity in the real-world oceans.",

          "abstract": "Natural habitats have undergone drastic changes in quality, continuity, and extent during the Pleistocene, influencing the distribution of many species. More recently, human activities have converted continuous habitats into fragmented and isolated patches. Recent meta-analyses suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation (HL&amp;F) have negatively impacted the genetic diversity of species but very few studies have analyzed the consequences of HL&amp;F on the spatial distribution of genetic diversity and on isolation by distance (IBD) patterns (i.e., correlations between genetic and geographical distances) observed in many species. In this work, we use spatial simulations to investigate the speed at which IBD patterns generated in continuous habitats are lost in a context of HL&amp;F. We characterized the behavior of IBD in the case of i) instantaneous HL&amp;F, ii) gradual (two-steps) HL&amp;F, and iii) range expansion followed by instantaneous HL&amp;F. In addition, we show that a spatially explicit theoretical framework based on previous IBD theoretical results can be modified and applied to a toroidal stepping-stone model undergoing HL&amp;F. Our results suggest that IBD patterns can be maintained for long periods of time after HL&amp;F, thus pointing to the long-term persistence of signatures associated to past habitat connectivity in the genetic diversity of many species, even if they went through major and sometimes ancient fragmentation events. This suggests that some present-day fragmented species, who still exhibit significant IBD patterns, may have been partly disconnected for very long periods, on the order of tens of thousands of years for species with long generation time.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria and phages have been in an ongoing arms race for billions of years. To resist phages bacteria have evolved numerous defense systems, which nevertheless are still overcome by counterdefense mechanisms of specific phages. These defense/counterdefense systems are a major element of microbial genetic diversity and have been demonstrated to propagate between strains by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). It has been proposed that the totality of defense systems found in microbial communities collectively form a distributed “pan-immune” system with individual elements moving between strains via ubiquitous HGT. Here, we formulate a Lotka–Volterra type model of a bacteria/phage community interacting via a combinatorial variety of defense/counterdefense systems and show that HGT enables stable maintenance of diverse defense/counterdefense genes in the microbial pan-genome even when individual microbial strains inevitably undergo extinction. This stability requires the HGT rate to be sufficiently high to ensure that some descendant of a “dying” strain survives, thanks to the immunity acquired through HGT from the community at large, thus establishing a new strain. This mechanism of persistence for the pan-immune gene pool is fundamentally similar to the “island migration” model of ecological diversity, with genes moving between genomes instead of species migrating between islands.",

          "abstract": "Reproductive, male-enriched small RNAs are present in flowering plants and animals, yet their role in plants remains underexplored. We generated dicer-like 5 ( dcl5 ) mutants in durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. durum 2n = 4× = 28; AABB), revealing temperature-sensitive genic male sterility. Loss of DCL5 depleted premeiotic and meiotic 24-nt phasiRNA production, correlating with sterility under standard growth conditions and partial fertility recovery at higher temperatures. A single functional DCL5 allele restored complete fertility, presenting a promising alternative to current methods for hybrid production. We demonstrate that premeiotic 24-nt phasiRNA biogenesis is independent of miRNA-mediated cleavage and driven by a conserved motif initiating DCL5 activity. In the dcl5 mutant developing under sterility-inducing conditions, developmental defects are observed during pollen maturation, rather than at peak 24-nt phasiRNA accumulation in premeiotic and meiotic anthers. Although no visible morphological abnormalities were apparent during early development, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that dcl5 mutant cells exhibit transcriptional profiles distinct from those of wild-type cells, when premeiotic 24-nt phasiRNAs are accumulating at the early developmental stage. Finally, the coexpression of Argonaute ( AGO1b , AGO4a, and AGO6 ) homeologs in 24-nt phasiRNA-producing cells identifies candidate effectors and suggests a role for 24-nt phasiRNAs in transcriptional gene silencing.",

          "abstract": "Conservation science and policy are geared primarily toward the preservation of species and habitats, with priority often given to the rarest, most vulnerable or most charismatic forms. This pattern-based approach has broad appeal and offers a pragmatic short-cut for targeting conservation action. However, the long-term efficacy of species and landscape conservation programs remains highly uncertain, amid growing evidence that sustainable conservation action requires an increased emphasis on preserving ecological and evolutionary processes. This reframing of conservation goals was first proposed 50 y ago, but the concept has struggled to gain traction, particularly in terms of translation into policy. Nonetheless, recent events have shifted the narrative, with multiple interlinked global challenges—including biological invasions, food security, disease, and climate change—putting ecological processes firmly back on the agenda. Concurrently, conservation finance is changing rapidly, driven in part by the 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which prioritized actions to enhance and restore ecosystem stability, connectivity, and resilience. These ecosystem properties are fundamentally process-driven and appear to create an operational gulf between current conservation practice and the targets of international agreements. We describe how new approaches can be used to close this gap by redirecting conservation attention toward processes at the heart of ecosystem function, including adaptation, gene flow, dispersal, and trophic interactions. Wider adoption of these approaches is urgently needed to forge a deeper connection between conservation practice and policy targets, thereby ensuring that ongoing investment in biodiversity conservation goes beyond damage limitation and instead leaves a lasting legacy of resilient ecosystems.",

These dynamics exhibit directionality with a quantity that increases in time, selection, and preferential spatial expansion of particular states, as well as inheritance in the form of correlated compositions between successive states, and environment-dependent adaptation. The model challenges common conceptions regarding the requirements for life-like properties: It does not involve separate mechanisms for metabolism, replication, and compartmentalization; stores and transmits digital information without template replication or assembly of large molecules; exhibits selection both without and with reproduction; and undergoes growth without autocatalysis.

We then screened more than 18,000 genomes from all major bacterial groups for the presence of those mutations and determined which mutations can evolve through point mutations. Our results demonstrate that although the evolvability of individual mutations varies considerably across species, overall predicted evolvability is high and relatively homogeneous across bacterial taxa. Rifampicin resistance mutations are present intrinsically in 8% of species that tend to be phylogenetically clustered.

However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we established a mouse reporter model for studying muscle cell contribution to bone fracture repair. Analyzing skeletal muscle scRNA-seq datasets revealed that Prg4 marks a fibroadipogenic progenitor (FAP) subpopulation. In mice, Prg4 + cells were specifically located in the skeletal muscle, but not at the periosteum or inside cortical bone. These cells expressed FAP markers, responded to muscle injury, and became periosteal cells under normal and muscle injury conditions. Fracture fragmented muscle fibers, rapidly expanded Prg4 + FAPs at the injury site and promoted their migration into the fracture gap. Later, they gave rise to many chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the outer periphery of callus next to muscle. In repaired bones, the descendants of Prg4 + FAPs were detected as mesenchymal progenitors in the periosteum and osteocytes at the prior fracture site. A second fracture activated those cells and stimulated them to become osteoblasts in the inner part of callus. Importantly, ablation of Prg4 + FAPs impaired fracture healing and functional repair. In an intramembranous bone injury model (drill-hole), Prg4 + FAPs became periosteal cells, but their contribution to bone defect repair was significantly less than in fractures. Taken together, we demonstrate the critical role of FAPs in endochondral bone repair and uncover a mechanism by which mesenchymal progenitors transform from muscle to cortical bone.",

In addition, the youngest fossil record (late Quaternary) can provide insights into the natural range of functional variability of present-day ecosystems, providing a historical framework for conservation and restoration. However, the reliability of common functional diversity measures derived from fossils is uncertain. If fossils yield reasonable estimates of functional diversity, paleontological data could provide information on ecological attributes and trophic structure in past ecosystems allowing for temporally scalable assessments of ecological and evolutionary processes. To assess how well fossils preserve functional diversity across multiple types of marine invertebrates with varying preservation potential, we compared the live benthos (135 species from 6 phyla) with sympatric skeletal accumulations (150 species) and the predicted fossil record (112 species) for 51 coastal sites in North Carolina (USA). High functional fidelity between the live, dead, and fossil assemblages was supported by congruence in quantitative functional diversity indices (e.g., functional richness, redundancy, overredundancy, and vulnerability), overlap in multidimensional functional space, and species distributions among functional groups ( ρ &gt; 0.85, P ≪ 0.001). Calculating vulnerability using a threshold of ≤2 species also reasonably approximated the vulnerability in the live assemblages. The results suggest that, despite differential preservation and time-averaging, functional estimates based on fossils may allow for historical assessments of ecological and evolutionary processes, including short-term community responses to human impacts as well as long-term macroevolutionary dynamics of marine ecosystems.",

We found that the senescent ECs showed high endocytic capacity and SARS-CoV-2 virus uptake. This triggers an nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway–mediated inflammatory response. Further, Basigin enhanced endocytosis in the senescent ECs by activating the intracellular vascular endothelial growth factor signaling.

          "abstract": "Under an accelerating biodiversity crisis, increased urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and climate change require new approaches to assess conservation impact. We argue that animal biologging is a cost-effective method for monitoring biodiversity at its source, including tracked animals and the habitats they occupy. Biologging, or animal-mounted sensors to record data, can act as a reporting, measurement, and verification system, and deliver direct insights into environments of selection. Using a case study of migrating white storks ( Ciconia ciconia ), we show that biologging yields real-time measurements of individual performance, mechanistic insights into environments of selection, and the potential for gene flow across anthropogenically influenced habitats. These insights can inform the success of biodiversity targets and conservation initiatives and improve real-time species management. At the global scale, we further illustrate that biologging studies display substantial bias in the types of environments and human conditions sampled. Studies appear biased toward sparsely populated areas and remain particularly rare in highly urbanized areas, areas experiencing high rates of recent forest fragmentation, and key areas for global biodiversity conservation efforts. We highlight the need for equitable access to technology to leverage the biodiversity potential of biologging in the Global South. Advances in software-defined tracking technology will soon give real-time information on energy budgets, survival, reproduction, and ultimately demographic processes and population-level parameters. When deployed into areas most needed, biologging can operationalize access to key measures of biodiversity maintenance such as gene flow, especially in difficult-to-access areas that are key to the future persistence of a species.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic crosstalk among diverse cellular populations contributes to shaping a competitive and symbiotic tumor microenvironment (TME) to influence cancer progression and immune responses, highlighting vulnerabilities that can be exploited for cancer therapy. Using a spatial multiomics platform to study the cell-specific metabolic spectrum in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we map the metabolic interactions between different cells in the HCC TME and identify a unique tumor-immune-cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) “interface” zone, where cell–cell interactions are enhanced and accompanied by significant upregulation of lactic acid and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Further combining single-cell mass spectrometry imaging of patient-derived tumor organoids, cocultured CAFs, and macrophages, we demonstrate that CAFs increase glycolysis and secrete lactic acid to the surrounding microenvironment to drive immunosuppressive macrophage M2 polarization. These findings facilitate the understanding of cancer-associated metabolic interactions in complex TME and provide clues for targeted clinical therapies.",

          "abstract": "Diverse extracellular filaments present on the surface of archaea mediate multiple key processes, such as motility, adhesion, and biofilm formation. Although several archaeal filament types have been characterized in considerable detail, many remain understudied, particularly those utilizing noncanonical secretion systems. Here, we describe the Tafi bundling pilus that facilitates biofilm formation in the haloarchaeon Natrinema sp. J7-2. Unlike previously characterized archaeal pili, Tafi is secreted via the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, which transports fully folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Structural analysis reveals that although Tafi pili assemble via a canonical strand-donation mechanism, the pilin subunit (TafE) adopts a distinct structural topology that sets it apart from the previously characterized Sec-dependent pilins that form bundling pili in archaea. Sequence analyses show that TafE homologs are also present in thermophilic archaea from different phyla, but Tat-signal sequences are exclusive to pilins of halophilic archaea. Nevertheless, we find that Tat signal peptides in haloarchaeal TafE-like pili were exchanged back to the Sec signal peptides on multiple independent occasions. These findings expand our understanding of the diversity and evolution of archaeal extracellular filaments and highlight the Tat pathway as a route for pilus assembly in halophilic archaea.",

          "abstract": "The acrosome is a crucial organelle essential for sperm function and male fertility. During acrosome biogenesis, numerous proacrosomal vesicles (PAVs) are transported to the concave region of the nuclear membrane and fuse to form the acrosome. However, the mechanisms governing the fusion of PAVs to form the acrosome remain poorly understood. Here, we identify endosome-lysosome associated apoptosis and autophagy regulator 1 (ELAPOR1), a conserved protein, as a key factor in PAVs fusion during acrosome biogenesis. Male mice lacking Elapor1 ( Elapor1 −/− ) are infertile, exhibiting defective acrosome biogenesis and a globozoospermia-like phenotype. Using cryo-electron microscopy revealed that ELAPOR1 forms a square planar homodimer in cis, which assembles into a trans-tetramer via head-to-head homophilic interactions dependent on copper chelation. Notably, ELAPOR1 exhibits dual membrane orientation, with a predicted N in − C out topology and a noncanonical N out − C in topology in vesicles. The noncanonical N out − C in topology enables ELAPOR1 to function as a tethering factor bridging vesicles through head-to-head homophilic interactions. A mutant ELAPOR1 (ELAPOR1 4HA ) incapable of copper chelation forms cis homodimers but fails to mediate homophilic interactions in vitro, leading to defective PAVs fusion in mice, phenocopying the Elapor1 -deficient mice. Additionally, ELAPOR1 was shown to interact with soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors protein STX12. Conditional knockout of Stx12 in germ cells resulted in similar defects in acrosome biogenesis. Collectively, our findings suggest that ELAPOR1 functions as a tethering factor that regulates PAV fusion through a copper-dependent mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Pumas ( Puma concolor ) occupy a vast geographical range spanning from Canada to Argentina. Due to urbanization and unregulated hunting, pumas in Florida, known as panthers, are the only breeding population east of the Mississippi River. In the 1990s, Florida panthers numbered &lt;30 individuals suffering from inbreeding depression. In 1995, eight pumas from Texas were translocated into southern Florida to mitigate the effects of isolation. This translocation reduced inbreeding depression and increased population size. While genetic rescue is often suggested as a means of ameliorating the effects of small population size, the underlying genetic mechanism and its long-term efficacy remain understudied. We sequenced the genomes of posttranslocation Florida panthers (PTFPs) to elucidate the genomic consequences of genetic rescue. We inferred local ancestry across the genomes of PTFPs and found that no regions have been entirely replaced by Texas ancestry, discarding the possibility of genetic swamping. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of the translocation were likely caused by a reduction in homozygosity, alleviating recessive deleterious load, rather than by a reduction in the number of deleterious variants. We did not find evidence that selection has favored replacement of original Florida DNA with Texas DNA in any systematic fashion. Using simulations, we found that heterozygosity increased in the long-term compared to a no translocation scenario; however, the effects on fitness are more transient. Our findings hold significant implications not only for the management of Florida's panther population, but also for informing strategies for genetic rescue in other wild, inbred populations encompassing broader conservation efforts.",

          "abstract": "Genetic variation underpins evolutionary change, but mutation accumulation increases genetic load. Various factors affect the extent of load, such as population size and breeding system, but other important determinants remain unexplored. In particular, whole-genome duplication (WGD)—a pervasive macromutation occurring broadly across Eukaryotes—remains poorly understood in terms of its impact on neutral and selective processes within populations. Using iterative forward simulations and empirical analysis of 632 short- and 16 long-read sequenced individuals of Arabidopsis arenosa (in 23 diploid and 42 natural autotetraploid populations), we measure the effects of WGD on genome-wide diversity and mutation load. Our simulations show how genetic variation gradually rises in autotetraploids due to increased mutational target size. Moreover, mutation load increases due to relaxed purifying selection as ploidies rise, when deleterious mutations are masked by additional chromosome copies. Empirical data confirm these patterns, showing significant increases in nucleotide diversity, ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNPs, and numbers of indels and large structural variants in A. arenosa autotetraploids. However, a rather modest increase in load proxies together with a broad distribution and niche of autotetraploids suggests load accumulation has not yet limited their successful expansion. Overall, we demonstrate a complex interplay between neutral processes and purifying selection in shaping genetic variation following WGD and highlight ploidy as an important determinant of mutation load, genetic diversity, and therefore adaptive potential in natural populations.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic destruction and fragmentation of habitat restrict many species to small, isolated populations, which often experience high extirpation risk. Restoring connectivity through translocations is one approach for mitigating the demographic and genetic perils faced by small populations. However, translocation interventions often lack substantial postrelease monitoring, and thus important information including the performance of translocated individuals, the long-term impacts on the recipient population, and the extent to which management objectives are fulfilled over time are often poorly known. Here, we examined the establishment dynamics and long-term outcomes of translocations from multiple donor populations into an intensively monitored population of the federally threatened red-cockaded woodpecker. We found evidence that translocations contributed to population growth and led to genetic admixture within the population. The translocated birds provided direct demographic benefits through high rates of establishment, breeding, and survival. We found that the survival and lifetime reproductive success of individuals were positively related to their amount of translocation ancestry, indicating that demographic benefits extended beyond the direct performances of the translocated birds. The translocations diversified the population’s genetic composition with the ancestry of most individuals in the latter years of the study deriving from multiple translocation donor populations. We found marked heterogeneity in the genetic contributions of translocated individuals and cohorts, leading to disproportionate representation of certain lineages. Encouragingly, despite some accumulation of inbreeding during the study, the translocations thus far have not substantially contributed to inbreeding. Our findings illustrate in precise detail how translocations can be an effective approach for managing imperiled taxa.",

This extends to libraries of printed ligands dispensed directly onto TEM grids for later soaking with microcrystal slurries, and complexes with noncovalent ligands. ED-MS resolves structures of the natural product, epoxide-based cysteine protease inhibitor E-64, and its biosynthetic analogs bound to the model cysteine protease, papain. It further identifies papain binding to its preferred natural products, by showing that two analogs of E-64 outcompete others in binding to papain crystals, and by detecting papain bound to E-64 and an analog from crude biosynthetic reactions, without purification. ED-MS also resolves binding of the CTX-M-14 β-lactamase, a target of active drug development, to the non-β-lactam inhibitor, avibactam, alone or in a cocktail of unrelated compounds. These results illustrate the utility of ED-MS for natural product ligand discovery and for structure-based screening of small molecule binders to macromolecular targets, promising utility for drug discovery.",

          "abstract": "As memories age, their immediate retrievability decreases albeit, due to ongoing memory consolidation, their future rate of forgetting weakens. Here, we show in two experiments ( N = 1.216 participants) that mentally traveling back in time to older memories’ temporal context at encoding reverses the two effects and makes the memories similar again to how they were at an earlier point in time. Mental time travel increased both the memories’ immediate retrievability and their future rate of forgetting when individuals attempted to reinstate context deliberately and actively and when they retrieved other memories sharing a similar temporal context. Intriguingly, the forgetting after mental time travel even followed the same trajectory as the forgetting after encoding. Attempts to reinstate memories’ encoding context thus rejuvenated memories, although the degree of rejuvenation decreased as temporal lag between encoding and the reinstatement attempts increased, which was mediated by the fact that, with increasing lag, decreasing proportions of the encoded memories were reactivated and reconsolidated in response to participants’ reinstatement attempts. Mentally traveling back in time creates rejuvenation cycles with enhanced retrievability followed by a restart of forgetting and consolidation processes. Recurring rejuvenation cycles may thus be key to maintain memories’ retrievability over longer periods of time, painting the picture of Sisyphus-like memory resurrection.",

          "abstract": "Many widespread plant taxa of western North America have diversified into phenotypically and genetically divergent lineages due to complex biogeographic histories across heterogeneous landscapes. Mosaic hybrid zones can form when geographically co-occurring, yet environmentally distinct, lineages cross-pollinate and form hybrids that occupy unique environmental niches absent of a geographic cline. This expands the total environmental space across which parental and hybrid individuals grow, resulting in larger, less fragmented geographic distributions. Here, we highlight hybridization mosaics across three study systems containing taxa critical to widespread plant communities in western North America: Ericameria nauseosa , Artemisia tridentata , and Sphaeralcea fendleri . The systems contain diverged taxa that co-occur across the landscape and hybridize readily. Hybridization among taxa has facilitated niche expansion into intermediate environments consistent with unique combinations of adaptive genetic variation, creating more continuity within each study system—study systems occupy ~820 to 270,000 km 2 more geographic area by virtue of hybridization. Furthermore, hybrids are predicted to play important roles in future climates, as they may occupy 8 to 475% larger distributions compared to present. Convergent patterns signal mosaic hybridization as an underappreciated mechanism with broad ecological and evolutionary ramifications. Leveraging mosaic hybridization may assist the creation of restoration management plans that aim to mitigate the deleterious effects of habitat fragmentation on ecosystems in the context of climate change.",

We developed a strategy for quantifying surface localization from fluorescence microscopy images of surface-stained cells. Using clustered protocadherins, a protein family important for cell–cell recognition during neuronal development, we found that surface delivery levels vary among clustered protocadherin isoforms and between wild-type and engineered variants. Quantifying these differences provides evidence that cis dimerization is not tightly coupled to surface delivery for clustered protocadherins.

          "abstract": "The recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1/2) recombinase, which initiates V(D)J recombination in jawed vertebrates, evolved from RNaseH-like transposases such as Transib and ProtoRAG. However, its postcleavage transposase activity is strictly suppressed. Previous structural studies have focused only on the conserved core domains of RAG1/2, leaving the regulatory mechanisms of the noncore regions unclear. To investigate how RAG1/2 suppresses transposition and regulates DNA cleavage, we determined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of nearly full-length RAG1/2 complexed with cleaved recombination signal sequences (RSS) in a signal-end complex (SEC) at resolutions up to 2.95 Å. Two key structures, SEC-0 and SEC-Plant Homeodomain (PHD), reveal distinct regulatory roles of RAG2, which is absent in Transib transposase. SEC-0 displays a closed conformation, revealing that the core RAG2 facilitates sequential DNA cleavage by stabilizing the RSS-cleaved states in a “spring-loaded” mechanism. SEC-PHD reveals how RAG2’s noncore PHD and Acidic Hinge (AH), which are absent in ProtoRAG, inhibit target DNA binding in transposition. Histone H3K4me3, which recruits RAG1/2 to RSS sites, does not influence RAG1/2 binding to V, D, or J gene segments bordered by RSS. In contrast, the suppressed transposition can be activated by H3K4me3 peptides that dislodge the inhibitory PHD. To achieve this derepression in vivo, however, would require an unlikely close placement of two nucleosomes flanking a target DNA bent by nearly 180°. Our structural and biochemical results elucidate how RAG1 has acquired RAG2 and utilizes its core and noncore domains to enhance V(D)J recombination and suppress transposition.",

Here, we isolated ex vivo PS2 S-layers from the industrially important Corynebacterium glutamicum and determined its atomic structure by 3D cryo-EM reconstruction. PS2 monomers consist of a six-helix bundle “core,” a three-helix bundle “arm,” and a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) helix. The PS2 core oligomerizes into hexameric units anchored in the mycomembrane by a channel-like coiled-coil of the TM helices. The PS2 arms mediate trimeric lattice contacts, crystallizing the hexameric units into an intricate semipermeable lattice. Using pulse-chase live cell imaging, we show that the PS2 lattice is incorporated at the poles, coincident with the actinobacterial elongasome. Finally, phylogenetic analysis shows a paraphyletic distribution and dispersed chromosomal location of PS2 in Corynebacteriales as a result of multiple recombination events and losses.

Here, we report evidence that naïve neonatal human CD8 + T cells are poised for an accelerated effector switch, with elevations of killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1), killer cell lectin-like receptor B1 (KLRB1/CD161), Fc epsilon receptor I-gamma ( FCER1G ), DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM1/CD226), granzymes, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin 2 (IL-2), and glycolysis compared to naïve adult CD8 + T cells. Further, rapid proliferation and cell death occur upon activation of neonatal CD8 + T cells, with cell viability largely rescued by IL-2 or IL-7. These features are coupled with a unique transcription factor landscape, including high expression of thymocyte selection associated high mobility group box (TOX) and HELIOS ( IKZF2 ), and these signatures continue in postnatal life until at least 2 mo of age. We conclude that early-life human CD8 + T cells maintain a unique transcriptional state associated with an accelerated effector switch and short-lived effector program, revealing key nodes of regulation relevant for the unique immunobiology of neonatal humans.",

          "abstract": "Sleep promotes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange in the brain facilitated by brain pulsations. Especially brain vasomotion and arterial pulsations modulated by noradrenaline drive the intracranial fluid dynamics. Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) entails lessened orexinergic output to wake-promoting systems including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus. As arousal state and noradrenergic signaling affect CSF-ISF clearance, we chose patients with NT1 as a human orexin-targeted model of sleep-related pathology bridging the gap between healthy awake and sleep with respect to CSF flow pulsations. We also investigated the sensitivity of magnetic resonance encephalography to detect flow with a phantom model and sought to replicate earlier pulsation findings in sleep. In this case–control study, we used fast functional MRI to map brain pulsations in groups of healthy sleeping controls (n = 13), healthy awake controls (n = 79), and awake NT1 (n = 21) patients. We measured the very low frequency (0.008 to 0.1) and cardiorespiratory frequencies and calculated in each frequency band the coefficient of variation, spectral power, and full band spectral entropy to obtain brain pulsation maps. We uncovered a brain pulsation profile from healthy waking to sleep to a sleep-related pathology NT1 prominently affected in the vascular-related vasomotor and brain arterial pulsations. Our results established how drivers of brain hydrodynamics are affected by a specific loss of key neurotransmitter governing arousal compared to healthy sleep. We also showed with a phantom model that MREG is sensitive to flow-related signal changes and solidified evidence of brain pulsations in the healthy states of sleep and wakefulness.",

          "abstract": "The cytoplasmic genomes of plants and animals often fail to track species boundaries. However, the mechanisms responsible for such patterns are poorly understood, in part because few studies have linked cytoplasmic variation to phenotypic traits or environmental differences. Here, we use 1,554 previously published and 185 new whole genome sequences representing 14 taxa from the sunflower genus Helianthus , 91 phenotypic traits measured in common gardens, and 39 environmental variables to test for environmental and phenotypic effects of cytoplasmic genome variation. In agreement with previous work, two distinct chloroplast clades were found across multiple species and the sharing of chloroplast clades between species was mainly due to repeated introgression rather than incomplete lineage sorting. Two mitochondrial clades were also found that matched the chloroplast clades for 98% of individuals, implying predominantly maternal inheritance of both genomes. Cytoplasmic clade was associated with differences in seed shape across several species, and likely with aridity, suggestive of a role in local adaptation. Conversely, we failed to find any credible cytonuclear interactions based on associations between chloroplast and nuclear variation. Taken together, this work suggests that cytoplasmic genomes in annual sunflowers represent a trans-species balanced polymorphism that is likely maintained by adaptation to different environments. More broadly, our results corroborate the syngameon concept, showing how introgression across even very strong reproductive barriers can facilitate environmental adaptation across a species complex.",

Instead of an isolated circadian phenotype seen with disease-causing variants in other molecular clock genes, all individuals carrying BMAL1 variants surprisingly share a clinical syndrome manifest as developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder, with variably penetrant sleep disturbances, seizures, and marfanoid habitus. Variants were functionally tested in cultured cells using a Per2 -promoter driven luciferase reporter and revealed both loss-of-function and gain-of-function changes in circadian rhythms. The tested BMAL1 variants disrupted PER2 mRNA cycling, but did not cause significant shifts in cellular localization or binding with CLOCK. Conserved variants were further tested in Drosophila , which confirmed variant-dependent effects on behavioral rhythms. Remarkably, flies expressing variant cycle , the ortholog of BMAL1 , also demonstrated deficits in short- and long-term memory, reminiscent of the highly prevalent developmental delay observed in our cohort. We suggest that ultrarare variants in the BMAL1 core clock gene contribute to a neurodevelopmental disorder.",

TMs 1 to 5 and 6 to 10 constitute the two halves of a classic LeuT-fold, and TM11 interacts with both halves at the interface. In the IAA-bound state, IAA is specifically recognized in a central pocket formed by TM1, TM3, TM6, and TM8. In the presence of IAA, TM1 and TM6 undergo marked conformational changes that are critical for IAA transport. His249 stands out to be a key residue for substrate uptake and release.

          "abstract": "Granulomas play a crucial role in the pathology of tuberculosis, but the immune environment governing their formation remains largely unknown. To explore the dynamic changes in the immune microenvironment during the formation of tuberculous granulomas, we infected adult zebrafish with Mycobacterium marinum and then examined uninfected and infected kidneys, as well as large and small granulomas in the kidneys. Using single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we identified two major macrophage subpopulations in the hematopoietic tissue (kidney) of zebrafish under uninfected physiological conditions: monocyte derived and tissue-resident macrophages. Interestingly, the infection induced the emergence of epithelioid cells and a previously undescribed grna.2 + macrophage subpopulation. Depletion of grna.2 + macrophages with the nitroreductase-metronidazole ablation system resulted in shortened zebrafish survival after infection, increased bacterial load, and more granulomas, especially necrotic granulomas. Depletion of grna.2 + macrophages also produced a denser granuloma structure with fewer T cells. RNA-seq and flow cytometry analysis revealed that depletion of grna.2 + macrophages led to upregulated inflammatory signaling pathways, including tnfα and il1β , and increased macrophage lytic cell death. Similarly, in samples from tuberculosis patients, we also identified GRN-positive macrophages, which exhibit similar anti-inflammatory functions. This subset of grna.2 + macrophages present in developing granulomas can suppress excessive inflammatory responses to alleviate macrophage lytic death, reduce tissue damage, promote T cell infiltration and ultimately help control mycobacterial growth in vivo.",

          "abstract": "Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation provide robust biomarkers of biological age, yet the mechanistic basis and functional significance of slowing these clocks remain unclear. Progress has been limited by the lack of short-lived, genetically tractable model organisms with functional DNA methylation systems. The jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis , offers a unique solution. It combines a functional DNA methylation system with a short lifespan and established tools for experimental manipulation. We previously developed an epigenetic clock in Nasonia , but whether this clock reflects plastic, environmentally driven aging processes was unknown. Here, we test this directly by experimentally inducing larval diapause, a naturally occurring developmental arrest triggered by environmental cues. Diapause extended median adult lifespan by 36% and significantly slowed the rate of epigenetic aging. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing across multiple adult timepoints, we show that while adults that have passed through diapause as larvae initially emerge epigenetically older, their subsequent epigenetic aging proceeds 29% more slowly than adults that have not passed through diapause as larvae. Clock CpGs were enriched for gene ontology terms related to conserved nutrient-sensing and developmental pathways, including insulin/IGF signaling and mTOR, supporting the established mechanistic link between development and epigenetic aging. These findings demonstrate that epigenetic aging is plastic in Nasonia and can be experimentally modulated by early-life environment, establishing this animal model as a tractable system for dissecting the causal mechanisms of epigenetic aging.",

          "abstract": "The standard model of sex chromosome evolution is based on ancient XY or ZW systems. Young neo-sex chromosomes that form via the translocation of autosomal material to preexisting sex chromosomes provide materials to study early events in sex chromosome evolution. Neo-sex chromosomes are taxonomically widespread but, until recently, appeared to be rare in female-heterogametic taxa, including birds. Here, we report on the comparative evolutionary genomics of newly discovered neo-Z and neo-W sex chromosomes in two Pacific Island birds, the honeyeater species, Myzomela tristrami and M. cardinalis . Our results show that 19 to 21 Mya, ~85% of chr5 , an autosome, translocated to the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of an ancestral sex chromosome (Z or W) and rapidly recombined onto its heterolog, leaving the remainder of chr5 to segregate as a remnant autosome. A large inversion then established a nonrecombining (NR) neo-W region and a neo-PAR. The accumulation of at least seven additional inversions created interspersed blocks of ancestral and neo-W sequence, without expanding the NR region. The neo-W experienced mass invasion by endogenous retrovirus repeats, a reduced efficacy of selection, and functional degeneration. Many of our observations are consistent with predictions of the standard model, whereas others highlight idiosyncrasies of neo-sex chromosomes that arise via translocation of autosomal sequence to ancestral sex chromosomes. We speculate, in particular, that the repository of retrotransposons on the ancestral W may have been an accelerant in the evolution of neo-W structure, content, and functional degeneration.",

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on MNs whose glutamate release is weakened by knockdown of components of the MN transmitter release machinery reveals a reduction in expression of a group of genes that encode potassium channels and their positive modulators.

Light energy drives unidirectional motor rotation, enabling path-dependent control over a sequence of thermodynamically disfavored yet mechanically distinct and kinetically stable winding states, which are covalently captured and subsequently released to yield a catenane.

          "abstract": "The important role of metallic nanostructures in nanophotonics will expand if ways to electrically manipulate their optical resonances at high speed can be identified. We capitalized on electrically driven surface acoustic waves and the extreme light concentration afforded by gap plasmons to achieve this goal. We placed gold nanoparticles in a particle-on-mirror configuration with a few-nanometer-thick, compressible polymer spacer. Surface acoustic waves were then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the gigahertz regime. We observed evidence that the surface acoustic waves produced mechanical deformations in the polymer and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics led to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning. Our approach provides a design strategy for electrically driven dynamic metasurfaces and fundamental explorations of high-frequency, polymer dynamics in ultraconfined geometries.",

          "abstract": "Increasing drought pressure under anthropogenic climate change may jeopardize the potential of tropical forests to capture carbon in woody biomass and act as a long-term carbon dioxide sink. To evaluate this risk, we assessed drought impacts in 483 tree-ring chronologies from across the tropics and found an overall modest stem growth decline (2.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 2.2 to 2.7%) during the 10% driest years since 1930. Stem growth declines exceeded 10% in 25% of cases and were larger at hotter and drier sites and for gymnosperms compared with angiosperms. Growth declines generally did not outlast drought years and were partially mitigated by growth stimulation in wet years. Thus, pantropical forest carbon sequestration through stem growth has hitherto shown drought resilience that may, however, diminish under future climate change.",

We determined a cryo–electron microscopy structure of endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex showing that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14. Transgenic parasite lines with these domains removed were defective in Pfs230 gamete localization and showed reduced oocyst formation. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibited Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation, reduced transmission and structural analyses revealed their epitopes.

Detecting behavioral drive in the fossil record is challenging because it is difficult to measure behaviors independently from corresponding morphologies. To solve this problem, we focused on a puzzling behavior in the fossil record of some primates: eating graminoid plants. We report carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from fossil cercopithecid monkeys and integrate the data into a view of hominin dietary evolution, finding that changes in graminivorous behavior preceded corresponding changes in dental morphology by ~700,000 years. Decoupling diets and morphologies in time was conducive to determining when and to exploring why dietary changes helped to propel human evolution.",

Using 35 years of satellite data, we show that in the Northern Hemisphere, between −15° and −30°C, dust aerosol is strongly correlated with ITF in both time and space. Furthermore, we found that the sensitivities of ITF to temperature and dust are in a ratio that agrees with laboratory measurements of droplet freezing, showing that ITF can be attributed to dust aerosol.",

Here, we used convergent evolutionary changes in hibernating lineages to define conserved cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and metabolic programs. We characterized mouse hypothalamus gene expression and chromatin dynamics across fed, fasted, and refed states and then used comparative genomics of hibernating versus nonhibernating lineages to identify cis elements with convergent changes in hibernators. Multi-omics approaches pinpointed CREs, hub genes, regulatory programs, and cell types underlying lineage divergence. Hibernators accumulated loss-of-function effects for CREs regulating hypothalamic responses, and the refeeding period after fasting served as a key phase for molecular processes with convergent evolutionary changes.

To understand the origin of these hallmarks, we studied the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome in the brain of short-lived killifish. We identified a cascade of events in which aberrant translation pausing led to altered abundance of proteins independently of transcriptional regulation. In particular, aging caused increased ribosome stalling and widespread depletion of proteins enriched in basic amino acids. These findings uncover a potential vulnerable point in the aging brain’s biology—the biogenesis of basic DNA and RNA binding proteins. This vulnerability may represent a unifying principle that connects various aging hallmarks, encompassing genome integrity, proteostasis, and the biosynthesis of macromolecules.",

The vaccines were generally safe and well tolerated, except that 18% of IAVI G002 participants experienced skin reactions. Priming induced bnAb precursors with substantial frequencies and SHM; heterologous boosting elicited increased SHM, affinity, and neutralization activity toward bnAb development; and elicited antibodies exhibited precise bnAb structural mimicry.

However, the Schottky gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. We used a ferroic HfO 2 - ZrO 2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway for improved performance in transistors based on 2DEG.",

Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extracted the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings. The ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves, whereas in the antiferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities.

We applied two-stage time-series analysis to 6.54 million CVD hospitalizations across six countries/territories (Canada, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) between 2000 and 2019 to quantify the long-term risks and burden of CVD hospitalizations following TCs. Hospitalization risks for cause-specific CVDs consistently increased following TC exposure, generally peaking around 2 months postexposure and dissipating by 6 months. Overall, each additional TC day was associated with a 13% (95% confidence interval, 7 to 19%) increase in CVD hospitalizations in 6 months following TCs. Particularly high TC-attributable burden was found for ischemic heart diseases and stroke, especially among males, individuals aged 20 to 59 years, and those with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation. The TC-attributable proportions of CVD hospitalizations showed decreasing trends in less deprived populations and increasing trends in more deprived populations from 2000 to 2019.",

          "abstract": "Explaining the rapid evolution of human cooperation and its role in our species’ biodemographic success remains a major evolutionary puzzle. To address this challenge, we tested a social drive hypothesis, which predicts that social plasticity and social selection in human groups cause indirect genetic effects that accelerate the adaptation of fitness, promoting population growth via feedback between the environmental causes and evolutionary consequences of cooperation. Using Bayesian multilevel models to analyze fertility data from a small-scale society, we demonstrate that density- and frequency-dependent indirect genetic effects on fitness promote the evolution of cooperation among neighboring women, increasing the rate of contemporary adaptation by ~5×. Our results show how interactions between the genetic and socioecological processes shaping cooperation in reproduction can drive rapid growth and social evolution in human populations.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have revealed links between prenatal/early-life stress and elevated morbidity and risks of mortality later in life. Given the number of subsistence crises in medieval England, this study uses stable isotopic, demographic, and paleopathological data from human skeletal remains ( n  = 275) to assess associations between early-life nutritional stress and health outcomes before, during, and after the Black Death in London and rural Lincolnshire approximately 1000 to 1540 CE. Our results suggest that survivors of early-life nutritional stress were resilient with respect to causes of death in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. Ultimately, however, early-life nutritional stress was associated with the presence of skeletal biomarkers of stress and elevated mortality in middle and late adulthood in the medieval period, consistent with models from developmental biology. We find that the prevalence of nutritional stress increased before the Black Death and decreased afterward. Understanding the long-term consequences of early-life nutritional stress can offer insights on the health trajectories of historical populations.",

          "abstract": "Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) is receiving increasing attention as a target for universal flu vaccines. Several broad NA inhibition monoclonal antibodies (BImAbs) targeting the highly conserved enzymatic pocket have been previously described. However, the molecular characteristics, clonal evolutionary trajectory, and B cell sources of BImAbs remain poorly understood. Here, using NA-mutant probes, we comprehensively profiled the immune signatures of NA-specific memory B cells (MBCs) from a healthy individual with NA cross-inhibition activity. From the NA-specific MBC repertoires, we identified a series of NA BImAbs with molecular features characterized by long HCDR3 regions with an “xxxDRxxx” motif, which exhibited broad inhibition against diverse influenza NAs. Clonal lineage tracing revealed that BImAbs followed a clonal evolutionary trajectory encompassing classical MBC (cMBC) and atypical MBC (aMBC). Both cMBC- and aMBC-derived BImAbs displayed similar inhibition against influenza NA. These findings enhance our understanding of the development of NA BImAbs and provide a foundation for the rational design of NA-based universal flu vaccines.",

          "abstract": "Metformin is the most commonly prescribed antidiabetes drug, yet its precise mechanism of action remains controversial. Previous studies have suggested that metformin acts peripherally by reducing hepatic glucose output and altering gut functions. Here, we report a neural mechanism via the small guanosine triphosphatase Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1). Mice with forebrain-specific Rap1 knockout exhibited resistance to the antidiabetic effects of low-dose metformin while remaining sensitive to other antidiabetic agents. Centrally administered metformin inhibited brain Rap1 and reduced hyperglycemia. Conversely, forced activation of brain Rap1 increased glycemia and abolished the glycemic effect of metformin. Metformin activated a specific subset of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) that requires Rap1. Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies suggest that VMH Rap1 is indispensable for the antidiabetic effects of metformin. These findings highlight the VMH Rap1 pathway as a critical mediator of metformin action.",

However, the rapid degradation and clearance of the released TDAs severely hinder subsequent antigen presentation and the final efficacy of the in situ vaccine. Here, we synthesized gold nanoxanthium coated with polydopamine (AuNX-PDA) to mimic the morphological and biological adhesion properties of xanthium and mussels, respectively. AuNX-PDA facilitated effective absorption of released TDAs after near-infrared II photothermal treatment and delivery of the absorbed TDAs to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of dendritic cells for cross-presentation, thereby activating CD8 + T cells for efficient tumor-specific immunity. The nanovaccine (NV) significantly inhibited irradiated primary tumors and nonirradiated distant tumors by producing robust antitumor immune responses in B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer mouse models. These findings highlight the potency of morphology– and adhesion–dual biomimetic NVs in whole-tumor vaccine therapy.",

Experimental demonstrations of such a phenomenon using quantum entangled states are among the landmark experiments of modern physics and paved the way for quantum technology. Here, we report the violation of the Bell inequality that cannot be described by quantum entanglement in the system but arises from quantum indistinguishability by path identity, shown by the multiphoton frustrated interference. By analyzing the measurement of four-photon frustrated interference within the standard Bell-test formalism, we find a violation of Bell inequality by more than four SDs. Our work establishes a connection between quantum correlation and quantum indistinguishability, providing insights into the fundamental origin of the counterintuitive characteristics observed in quantum physics.",

However, none of the existing LA therapies are active against hepatitis B virus (HBV), a common coinfection with HIV. Managing coinfection requires therapy to be effective against both viruses. Notable candidates are tenofovir (TFV) prodrugs. We have previously developed an LA TFV through a modified lipophilic ProTide strategy. Given the process chemistry challenges presented by amino acid chiral centers in ProTides, a simplified lipophilic amino acid–free crystalline phosphonate prodrug of TFV (M5TFV) has been created. Intramuscular injections of M5TFV nanosuspension (NM5TFV) were well tolerated in Sprague-Dawley rats and HBV transgenic mice. Notably, single doses at 200 and 400 milligrams per kilogram TFV equivalents produced &gt;2.5 log 10 reduction in HBV DNA beyond 2 months in transgenic mice. Reductions of covalently closed circular DNA were seen in hepatocyte-like cells. These promising findings support further development of NM5TFV as an ultra-LA formulation.",

Here, we describe that T H 17 cytokines strongly inhibit expression of critical chemokines in epithelial tissues, which leads to blocking infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells into the colon, rendering resistance to DSS-induced colitis and colon cancer. We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of T H 17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. Overall, our findings have identified a previously unrecognized critical gap between T H 17 cytokines, epithelial chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration through a C/EBPβ-mediated pathway.",

Through genetic and biochemical approaches, we identified odorant binding protein 44a (Obp44a), a noncanonical α-helical fatty acid binding protein (FABP) highly expressed in Drosophila central nervous system glia. Obp44a binds long-chain fatty acids and shuttles between glia and neurons, acting as a secretory lipid chaperone and scavenger to support lipid storage, efflux, and redox homeostasis. Notably, Obp44a is recruited to apoptotic cells and injured axons, especially when glial engulfment is impaired, demonstrating its role in lipid waste management and clearance of cellular debris during development and in pathological states. Our findings highlight FABPs’ importance in regulating brain lipid dynamics and neuronal response to stress and injury. By visualizing FABP function in vivo, this study provides insights into how defective lipid regulation may contribute to neuronal stress and disease progression.",

Unexpectedly, adding high–thermal conductivity hexagonal boron nitride enhances the PTE response by laterally redirecting heat, aligning thermal gradients with Seebeck coefficient variations, and boosting local conductance.

Through multipole analysis, we demonstrate efficient polarization rotation with high transmission for different knot-particle topologies. We explore the knot-particle topologies required to achieve matched polarization rotation and derive simple design rules for the knot parameters without resorting to numerical optimization. The microscopic polarizability tensors and macroscopic susceptibilities reveal that the trefoil knot exhibits strong chiral bianisotropic behavior through its magnetoelectric coupling tensor. We implement knot-particle metasurfaces using advanced 3D printing, which realizes the full 3D geometry of the wires.

DPP4i-BP differs from typical BP in its genetic, clinical, and immunological features, but methods to specifically detect DPP4i-BP autoantibodies have been unavailable. This study used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with “domain-swapped BP180” proteins to identify autoantibodies in DPP4i-BP, which targeted BP180 regions from the seventh noncollagenous domain to the fourth collagenous domain (NC7-Col4). These epitopes were associated with DPP4i-BP–specific human leukocyte antigen class II peptide epitopes. Notably, the duration of DPP4i intake before BP onset was significantly shorter in patients with anti–NC7-Col4 autoantibodies than those without them. Measuring the autoantibodies enabled the early diagnosis of DPP4i-BP before epitope spreading. Furthermore, anti–NC7-Col4 autoantibodies were detected in some patients with diabetes taking DPP4i without BP, suggesting that these assays may offer potential tools for early identification of at-risk individuals.",

After being specifically uptaken by the postsynaptic interneurons innervated by corticospinal tract (CST) axons, Glu-UCNP not only serves as internal light transducers that convert near-infrared light to visible light but also acts as nanobeacons that guide axonal sprouting toward postsynaptic neurons of glutamatergic synapses. This in situ optogenetic modulation successfully demonstrated the restoration of spinal motor circuits by rebuilding functional connections between CST axons and postsynaptic interneurons. It was corroborated by live-cell recording, immunofluorescence staining, in vivo Ca 2+ imaging, and pellet-reaching tests.

We compare DNA methylation rates in wild-type cells and chromatin remodeler mutants by normalizing nuclear methylation rates to the nonnucleosomal mitochondrial DNA methylation rate in each strain. Depletion of both Isw1 and Chd1 increases the normalized methylation rate, suggesting that these remodelers act together to suppress nucleosome dynamics. Separate depletion of Isw1, Chd1, or Rsc8 has little effect. A decaying sine wave model used to fit nucleosome phasing data shows that nucleosome dynamics decrease with distance from the promoter in an Isw1/Chd1-dependent manner. Furthermore, the TFIIIB and TFIIIC transcription factors exhibit differential dynamics at transfer RNA genes in vivo.

Here, we investigated wild fish shoals responding collectively with escape dives when attacked by birds. We analyzed the collective response in reaction to bird attacks and similar but harmless flybys as a function of shoal size. Larger shoals increasingly detected predator attacks (i.e., true positives), while their response facing harmless flybys (i.e., false alarms) remained constant. Furthermore, decision time decreased with increasing shoal size. Larger shoals were thus able to simultaneously overcome two major trade-offs inherent in solitary decision-making: the trade-off between true and false positives and the trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our findings set the stage for the next generation of studies investigating the mechanisms underlying collective decision-making.",

HCeO x -D@PM comprises a platelet membrane (PM) shell for targeted delivery to injured lungs and an HCeO x core, which enables high drug loading, efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and penetration of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Initially, HCeO x -D@PM suppresses the inflammation and mitigates the adverse effects of lesions on AT2 cell by scavenging accumulated ROS. It then adaptively releases 7,8-dihydroxyflavone in response to cysteine–aspartic acid protease 3 activation, facilitating AT2 cell proliferation and notably improving survival rates in vivo, offering a promising advancement in the precise treatment of respiratory diseases.",

This design offers high stiffness in stable states while allowing for long-stroke transitions, making it suitable for integration with soft actuators to balance deformability and load-bearing capacity. With advantages such as high compressibility and rapid integration, these exoskeleton-enhanced arms have promising applications when mounted on unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, facilitating large-scale dexterous manipulation with the necessary load capacities.

Here, we strategically enhance perovskite TFT performance by incorporating 2-thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) into 3D tin-based perovskites. The induction of the pseudo-halide SCN − into a bilayer quasi-2D perovskite intermediate phase, combined with the strong interaction between sulfur-bearing thiophene rings (TEA + ) and Sn-I octahedra, effectively reorients perovskite crystallization while inhibiting Sn 2+ oxidation and reducing trap density. Consequently, TEASCN-based TFTs achieve an average hole mobility of more than 60 square centimeters per volt per second and an on/off current ratio surpassing 10 8 , standing out among state-of-the-art p-type perovskite TFTs. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices preserve 84% of their initial mobility after 30 days in an N 2 atmosphere, underscoring their remarkable stability.

Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of quantum Darwinism and the underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a computationally and experimentally inexpensive quantifier to probe quantum-to-classical transitions.

Although these two zones can be readily measured today, there has been limited understanding of how the mixed and transition layers evolved over the Phanerozoic since animals first began to extensively colonize the seafloor. Here, we provide a record for the depths of the sedimentary mixed and transition layers through the Phanerozoic.

Consequently, their time-of-day–dependent response to vesicular stomatitis virus was dysregulated, and the diurnal development of CD8 + T cells into variegated populations of memory/effectors was altered in the absence of ADRB2 signaling. The diurnal fluctuations in T cell phenotypes were a distinct developmental process, independent of migration kinetics within the spleen.

The parabolic shape along one direction ensures minimum involvement of spatial/Fourier components at each frequency, thereby achieving circularly polarized thermal emission with high spatial coherence.

          "abstract": "Transcranial ultrasound imaging is usually limited by skull-induced attenuation and high-order aberrations. By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can also be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains affected by wavefront distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how ultrasound matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to these fundamental issues. As an experimental proof of concept, an in vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheep. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to markedly enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and nonionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.",

No broad-spectrum antiviral is currently available. However, most respiratory viruses use sialic acid or heparan sulfates as attachment receptors. Here, we report the identification of a pan-respiratory antiviral strategy based on mimicking both glycans. We synthesized a modified cyclodextrin that simultaneously mimics heparan sulfate and sialic acid. This compound demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against important human pathogens: parainfluenza virus 3, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus H1N1, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition, the compound is active against avian strains of influenza virus, revealing its importance for pandemic preparedness. The compound retains broad-spectrum activity in ex vivo models of respiratory tissues and in vivo against respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus, using prophylactic and therapeutic strategies.

We quantitatively dissected the major decline of North American bird abundance by rigorously analyzing 38,854 surveys that quantify over half a century of annual dynamics for 648 populations of 244 bird species from six regions, each encompassing 140,000 to 370,000 km 2 . Despite regional variation in geography, habitat, and species composition, a consistent pattern emerges: Biodiversity loss predominantly stems from declines in the most abundant bird species, whereas less abundant species show increases. We demonstrate that species once abundant and near their carrying capacity have declined, while less abundant species farther from their carrying capacity have increased. A path analysis identifies the key role played by anthropogenic land-use changes in causing the observed declines. Conservation efforts should place stronger emphasis on the abundance of common species as a central ecological indicator.",

Via a multistep DFT-based screening method developed here, we find a family of L1 2 -ordered binary compounds with ultrahigh power factors up to 11 mW m −1  K −2 near room temperature, which are driven by an intrinsic phonon-mediated energy filtering mechanism.

We demonstrate that GPR161 activates a recently discovered cAMP/PKA signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation of NDE1, a dynein complex regulator, and microtubule organization to regulate migration.

Genome-wide retrospective assessment of the iconic migratory Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ) from the Barents Sea, unraveled varying degree of admixture with the nonmigratory coastal ecotype throughout the 20th century, and intriguingly more intensified during recent decades. These genomic changes were supported by an increased number of individuals displaying the heterozygous state of the chromosomal inversion coupled to migratory behavior in Atlantic cod. Ecological models and genome-wide scans identified that some of the observed frequency shifts, coupled to neural development, metabolic, and growth regulation, covaried with intensified fisheries, reduced generation time, and ocean warming. Our results demonstrate how anthropogenic perturbations impact the dynamics between two well-known ecotypes of Atlantic cod and thus, their genomic signatures, with potential implications for future management programs.",

We show that floorplate and hypochord cells collectively migrate posteriorly along the nascent notochord extracellular matrix as it extends posteriorly, maintaining the tripartite configuration. Fibroblast growth factor-mediated migration in a spatially graded manner causes cell stretching, which triggers Yap-dependent proliferation and controls floorplate and hypochord growth. Supported by mathematical modeling, we further suggest that their growth is fine-tuned by mechanical tethering to the notochord via cadherin 2 at the posterior end. We propose that the notochord instructs and sustains the tripartite formation via leader-follower formation control, a strategy from engineering that spatially organizes multiple agents to coordinate the growth of the midline tissues.",

Mn/Cr ratios in carbonaceous chondrites and the bulk silicate Earth indicate that meteorite parent bodies and Earth have variable depletions in volatile elements compared to the bulk Solar composition. This depletion is a consequence of the local temperature decreasing as a function of heliocentric distance before planetesimal accretion. Back-tracking the present-day ε 53 Cr composition of the hypothetical proto-Earth fraction shows that the cessation of Mn-Cr fractionation from the bulk Solar composition occurred no later than ~3 Ma after CAI formation, similar to disk regions of carbonaceous chondrites at greater heliocentric distances. The timing of limited solid-gas interaction due to the dissipation of gas from the protoplanetary disk caused the cessation of Mn-Cr fractionation and provides a lower limit on its lifetime.",

A multitude of plant physiological regulation processes determine the overall drought resistance of ecosystems. So far, these physiological strategies to resist drought are poorly understood at large scales across different ecosystem types because the detection of these physiological regulation processes is mostly limited to in situ measurements on individual plants. In this study, by using high-resolution remote sensing data, we evaluated drought strategies of different ecosystem types throughout Europe by evaluating three key physiological regulation aspects (evapotranspiration, water content, and carbon regulation) based on their associated vegetation attributes. We found that different ecosystem types show divergent responses in these physiological attributes, suggesting different optimization strategies with respect to water saving versus spending, water content stabilizing versus fluctuating, and leaf conserving versus shedding strategies facing drought. These drought strategies from remote sensing provide timely ecosystem response information, facilitating earth system model predictions and aiding the protection against future droughts at large scales.",

The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and dynamics is a conundrum that violates the expected structure–function relationship. We developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by accurately determining three-dimensional (3D) structures from static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. Using the calculated 3D coordinates, the theory accurately forecasts experimentally observed two-point chromatin dynamics. It predicts rapid enhancer–promoter interactions and uncovers a scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, closely matching recent measurements. The theory predicts that cohesin depletion accelerates single-locus diffusion while significantly slowing relaxation dynamics within topologically associating domains. Our results demonstrate that chromatin dynamics can be reliably inferred from static structural data, reinforcing the notion that 3D chromatin structure governs dynamic behavior. This general framework offers powerful tools for exploring chromatin dynamics across diverse biological contexts.",

Through experiments with micromechanical oscillators and macroscale rotors, combined with stochastic averaging analysis, we show that this noise dilution effect improves synchronization efficiency, bolsters resistance to interference, and enhances long-term frequency stability.

Hybridization between the metal’s surface d orbitals and molecular p orbitals profoundly alters both the interfacial molecular layer and adjacent metal interface atomic layers, causing substantial changes in the magnetic properties of metal/molecule heterostructures. While magnetic modifications within the metallic layer are relatively well understood, the interfacial magnetism remains elusive. Using ultrafast time-resolved magneto-optical spectroscopy, we investigate the magnetic dynamics in such heterostructures and identify a distinct interfacial magnetic component that appears universal across various cobalt/molecule combinations. Our findings reveal a highly anisotropic magnetic layer localized at the interface, which has remained undetected in static measurements. This interfacial layer likely originates from strong chemical modifications in the cobalt surface induced by chemisorbed molecules.

Using a melanoma cell model consisting of nontumoral melanocytic Mel-ST cells and their metastatic counterpart obtained by H-Ras transformation, we unexpectedly find minimal effects of eIF2A depletion on translation. Interactome studies identified centrosomal proteins as major binding partners of eIF2A. We found that eIF2A colocalizes with the centrosome, enhances centrosome composition, and promotes centrosome orientation during cell migration. Migration requires the C-terminal disordered region of eIF2A, involved in mRNA binding. Interaction with mRNA, however, does not require ongoing translation.

C. elegans extract activated MAMP-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis Col-0.

          "abstract": "Beyond conventional ferroelectric compounds, the realization of single-element ferroelectricity expands the scope of ferroelectric materials and diversifies polarization mechanisms. However, strategies for manipulating ferroelectric dipoles in elemental ferroelectrics remain underexplored, limiting their broader applications. Here, we introduce a universal flexoelectric manipulation strategy to tune the ferroelectric and piezoelectric polarization of one-dimensional self-strained tellurium (Te) ferroelectrics. A substantial flexoelectric field of 9.55 microcoulombs per square centimeter was observed in self-strained Te, inducing a polarization rotation of 18°, comparable to the typical 15° rotation in ferroelectric PbTiO 3 compounds. This substantial polarization rotation enhances ferroelectric coercivity by 165% and piezoelectric responses by 75% compared to unstrained Te. Moreover, the flexoelectric manipulation of ferroelectric polarization demonstrated improved energy harvesting performance at the device level, surpassing most existing counterparts. Our findings highlight the crucial role of flexoelectricity-ferroelectricity coupling in developing high-performance single-element electromechanical devices and ferroelectronics.",

          "abstract": "Membrane-enclosed transport carriers return biological molecules from the recycling endosome to the plasma membrane using a mechanism that is not well understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans , the formation of carriers from the recycling endosome requires the amphiphysin protein AMPH-1. Recently, we found that purified AMPH-1 is sufficient for tubulation and vesiculation of liposomes in a mechanism that is regulated by guanine nucleotides. Here, we propose a model linking guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) binding and hydrolysis to the membrane binding and tubulation required for transport carrier formation. We find that GTP binding stabilizes interactions between AMPH-1 and the membrane through amphipathic, amino-terminal α helices, which are found at the tips of the arc-shaped, homodimeric structure. By contrast, in the posthydrolysis, guanosine diphosphate–bound state, these helices are repositioned to interact with the amino-terminal helices of other homodimers, to form an oligomeric AMPH-1 lattice that tubulates the membrane, in preparation for carrier formation by membrane fission.",

          "abstract": "Increased temperature-related mortality is expected to significantly contribute to future economic damages from climate change, with declines in cold-related deaths outweighed by increases in heat-related deaths. While temperature-mortality relationships are well-documented, the effects of climate change on morbidity are less understood. Using data on emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, mortality, and daily temperatures across California from 2006 to 2017, we find distinct differences in the temperature-response functions of these health outcomes, influenced by age distribution and underlying causes of morbidity and mortality. These differential responses fundamentally shape the burden of future climate change: We project that while future warming will increase ED visits, mortality will decrease due to fewer cold extremes. These results underscore the need to quantify temperature-morbidity responses to fully understand and anticipate the health impacts of climate change and suggest that local declines in mortality due to warming can mask economically meaningful increases in temperature-driven morbidity and health care utilization.",

Here, we introduce the magnetically induced magnetosome chain (MAGiC), a superferromagnetic MPI tracer, demonstrating a 25-fold improvement in resolution in the excitation direction and an order of magnitude improvement in signal intensity compared to the commercial tracer VivoTrax+. Under a gradient field of 4 tesla per meter, the resolution in the excitation direction reached 80 micrometers. Furthermore, MAGiC can be accurately manipulated using magnetic fields, making it an MPI-trackable microrobot. We have elucidated the mechanisms underlying MAGiC’s superior performance and validated its effectiveness in vitro and in vivo. As a high-performance MPI tracer and microrobot, MAGiC holds tremendous potential for various applications, such as cell tracking, image-guided drug delivery, and therapeutic interventions.",

However, changes in neuronal activity, including the saturation of synaptic strength by the positive-feedback nature of Hebbian plasticity, could deteriorate the encoded memory. Homeostatic plasticity is thought to contribute to the stability of the encoded memory by maintaining the relative differences in synaptic strength against persistent destabilizing changes in neuronal activity. However, it remains unclear how and when these two types of plasticity work together in the context of memory. Here, we have demonstrated that LARGE, a protein associated with intellectual disability, drives homeostatic resetting several hours after LTP by down-regulating AMPA-receptor trafficking via the Golgi apparatus. LARGE deficiency impairs long-term memory formation in mice. Our study reveals a potential molecular mechanism underlying the stability of memory mediated by cross-talk between Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity.",

However, limited by specific crystal structure required for spin defects, wide extension of their application faces challenges. A notable challenge is fabricating spin defects in general-purpose, low-cost amorphous materials such as polymers. Here, we propose an in situ laser–induced fabrication strategy of spin defects from polymers based on manipulation of main and side chains of polymers (MMSCP). By using 17 laser parameters and 8 polymers, we successfully fabricated silicon carbide spin defects derived from material mismatches. ODMR contrast and linewidth are consistently above 0.15% and below 54 megahertz, respectively. Benefiting from minimal damage of laser direct writing and stable covalent bonding, MMSCP effectively fabricates spin defects in manufactured microfluidic devices, cardiac patches, and medicine bottles and applies them to sensing and anticounterfeiting. Overall, MMSCP represents a paradigm that revolutionizes the application scheme of spin defects.",

          "abstract": "Complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I) develops after an initial injury. It causes prolonged pain that persists beyond the usual expected time for tissue healing. Mechanisms underlying pain chronicity of CRPS-I remain unknown. Here, we identified the presence of long-lasting infiltration of macrophages in local dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of a rat model of CRPS-I. We demonstrate that regenerating islet-derived 3β (Reg3β) is specifically produced by DRG neurons upon model establishment and functions as an important signaling molecule to drive proinflammatory macrophage infiltration in local DRG. Infiltrated macrophages produce TNF-α, which causes hyperexcitability of nociceptive DRG neurons and reciprocally promotes Reg3β overexpression and secretion from DRG neurons to recruit more macrophages. Our work reveals a positive feedback signaling conveyed by neuronal Reg3β/macrophage TNF-α that contributes to neuroinflammation in DRG, resulting in persistent pain in a rat model of CRPS-I. This finding provides insights into the neuroimmune interaction in local DRG that contributes to pain chronicity of CRPS-I.",

Transcription factors are essential for motor neuron development, regulating their specification, migration, and axonal targeting. While transcriptional regulation of the early stages of motor neuron specification is well established, much less is known about the role of transcription factors in the later stages of maturation and muscle targeting. Defining the molecular mechanisms of these later stages is critical for elucidating how motor circuits are constructed. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor nuclear factor IA (NFIA) is required for motor neuron positioning, axonal branching, and neuromuscular junction formation. Moreover, we find that NFIA is required for proper mitochondrial function and adenosine triphosphate production, providing an important link between transcription factors and metabolism during motor neuron development. Together, these findings underscore the critical role of NFIA in instructing the assembly of spinal circuits for movement.",

Although the receptor signals through inhibitory G proteins, more work is necessary to understand differences in transducer coupling and its relation to functional activity. To develop a molecular understanding of the differences underlying transducer coupling and activation, we performed structure-activity relationship studies of 5-HT1A with distinct G proteins. Through a combination of in vitro assays, we identified a potent partial agonist that selectively engages a G protein subtype. We further investigated the differences in G protein engagement at 5-HT1A with cryo–electron microscopy, determining structures of 5-HT1A bound to distinct ligands and G protein subtypes. Combined with subsequent structure-guided mutagenesis and signaling assays, our studies uncover both orthosteric and allosteric determinants of agonist-specific stimulation of distinct transducers.",

          "abstract": "Almost all animals are bilaterally symmetrical, and only rarely is this universality broken and maintained as a stable polymorphism. One such case is Perissodus microlepis , a scale-eating cichlid fish endemic to Lake Tanganyika. This species is polymorphic with left- or right-headed morphs, each specialized for scraping scales from the opposite side of their prey. This polymorphism is stably maintained around a 50:50 ratio and is likely driven by negative frequency–dependent selection, a classic form of balancing selection. Using a genome-wide dataset, including a de novo haplotype-resolved reference genome, whole-genome sequences, and microcomputed tomography scans of 102 individuals, we identified 72 genetic loci linked to head asymmetry. Nearby genes are enriched for roles in symmetry establishment, facial morphology, and nervous system function, with evidence suggesting that balancing selection maintains this diversity. Our study expands our understanding of the genetic basis of head asymmetry and provides candidate genes for further research.",

In a single run, the reactor was typically operated for 10 minutes. The atom efficiency for hydrogen in our approach for methanol synthesis is ~67%. Hydrogen gas is the by-product, produced at a rate of over 2 millimoles per hour.

We used electroencephalography to measure brain activity as human participants listened to a continuum of rhythmic sequences characterized by repeating patterns of two interonset intervals. Using frequency and representational similarity analyses, we show that brain activity does not merely track the temporal structure of rhythmic inputs but, instead, produces categorical representation of rhythms. These neural rhythm categories arise automatically, independent of any motor- or timing-related tasks, yet exhibit strong similarity with categorization observed in overt behavior. Together, these results and methodological advances constitute a critical step toward understanding the biological roots and diversity of musical behaviors across cultures.",

We present a diffusion model–based virtual histological staining approach that enhances spatial resolution and digitally introduces cellular morphological contrast into mass spectrometry images of label-free human tissue. Blind testing on human kidney tissue demonstrated that the virtually stained images of label-free samples closely match their histochemically stained counterparts (with periodic acid–Schiff staining), showing high concordance in identifying key renal pathology structures despite using IMS data with 10-fold larger pixel size. Additionally, our approach uses optimized noise sampling during the diffusion model’s inference to achieve reliable and repeatable virtual staining.

We identify 347 straddling stocks across 67 species, including both highly migratory and less mobile species. Our results suggest that regardless of the climate change scenario, at least 37% and 54% of stocks are projected to shift between EEZs and the high seas, by 2030 and 2050, respectively. More stocks are expected to shift toward the high seas, and highly migratory stocks are projected to shift across Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs).
