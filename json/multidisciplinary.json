          "abstract": "All-inorganic perovskites prepared by substituting the organic cations (e.g. methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+)) with inorganic cations (e.g. Cs+) are effective concepts to enhance the long-term photo- and thermal-stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs)1,2. Hence, inorganic perovskite tandem solar cells (IPTSCs) are promising candidates for breaking the efficiency bottleneck and addressing the stability issue as well3,4. However, challenges remain in fabricating 2-terminal (2T) IPTSCs due to the inferior film formation and deep trap states induced by tin cations5-7. Herein, a ligand evolution (LE) strategy with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (PTSH) is employed to regulate film formation and eliminate deep traps in inorganic narrow bandgap (NBG) perovskite, enabling the successful development of 2T IPTSCs. Accordingly, the 1.31 eV CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3:LE device delivers a record efficiency of 17.41%. Combined with the 1.92 eV CsPbI2Br top-cell, 2T IPTSCs exhibit a champion efficiency of 22.57% (certified 21.92%). Additionally, IPTSCs are engineered to deliver remarkable durability under maximum power point (MPP) tracking, maintaining 80% of the initial efficiency at 65 °C for 1510 h and at 85°C for 800 h, respectively. We elucidate that LE deliberately leverages multiple roles for inorganic NBG perovskite growth and anticipate our study provides insightful guideline for developing high-efficiency and stable IPTSCs.",

          "authors": "Marino Pagan, Vincent D. Tang, Mikio C. Aoi, Jonathan W. Pillow, Valerio Mante, David Sussillo, Carlos D. Brody",
          "abstract": "The ability to flexibly switch our response to external stimuli according to contextual information is critical for successful interactions with a complex world. Context-dependent computations are necessary across many domains1–3, yet their neural implementations remain poorly understood. Here we developed a novel behavioral task in rats to study context-dependent selection and accumulation of evidence for decision-making4−6. Under assumptions supported by both monkey and rat data, we first show mathematically that this computation can be supported by three dynamical solutions, and all networks performing the task implement a combination of these solutions. These solutions can be identified and tested directly with experimental data. We further show that existing electrophysiological and modeling data are compatible with the full variety of possible combinations of these solutions, suggesting that different individuals could use different combinations. To study variability across individual subjects, we developed automated, high-throughput methods to train rats on our task, and we trained many subjects on it. Consistent with theoretical predictions, neural and behavioral analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity across rats, despite uniformly good task performance. Our theory further predicts a specific link between behavioral and neural signatures, which was robustly supported in the data. In summary, our results provide a new experimentally-supported theoretical framework to analyze individual variability in biological and artificial systems performing flexible decision-making tasks, they open the door to cellular-resolution studies of individual variability in higher cognition, and they provide insights into neural mechanisms of context-dependent computation more generally.",

          "abstract": "People form impressions of one another in a split second from faces. However, people also infer others’ momentary mental states on the basis of context—for example, one might infer that somebody feels encouraged from the fact that they are receiving constructive feedback. How do trait judgements of faces influence these context-based mental state inferences? In this Registered Report, we asked participants to infer the mental states of unfamiliar people, identified by their neutral faces, under specific contexts. To increase generalizability, we representatively sampled all stimuli from inclusive sets using computational methods. We tested four hypotheses: that trait impressions of faces (1) are correlated with subsequent mental state inferences in a range of contexts, (2) alter the dimensional space that underlies mental state inferences, (3) are associated with specific mental state dimensions in this space and (4) causally influence mental state inferences. We found evidence in support of all hypotheses.",

          "abstract": "Market bubbles emerge when asset prices are driven unsustainably higher than asset values, and shifts in belief burst them. We demonstrate an analogous phenomenon in the case of biomedical knowledge, when promising research receives inflated attention. We introduce a diffusion index that quantifies whether research areas have been amplified within social and scientific bubbles, or have diffused and become evaluated more broadly. We illustrate the utility of our diffusion approach in tracking the trajectories of cardiac stem cell research (a bubble that collapsed) and cancer immunotherapy (which showed sustained growth). We then trace the diffusion of 28,504 subfields in biomedicine comprising nearly 1.9 M papers and more than 80 M citations to demonstrate that limited diffusion of biomedical knowledge anticipates abrupt decreases in popularity. Our analysis emphasizes that restricted diffusion, implying a socio-epistemic bubble, leads to dramatic collapses in relevance and attention accorded to scientific knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Childhood exposure to social disadvantage is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders and poor developmental, educational, and occupational outcomes, presumably because adverse exposures alter the neurodevelopmental processes that contribute to risk trajectories. Yet, given the limited social mobility in the United States and other countries, childhood social disadvantage is frequently preceded by maternal social disadvantage during pregnancy, potentially altering fetal brain development during a period of high neuroplasticity through hormonal, microbiome, epigenetic, and immune factors that cross the placenta and fetal blood–brain barrier. The current study examines prenatal social disadvantage to determine whether these exposures in utero are associated with alterations in functional brain networks as early as birth. As part of the Early Life Adversity and Biological Embedding study, mothers were recruited during pregnancy, prenatal social disadvantage was assessed across trimesters, and their healthy, full-term offspring were imaged using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging during the first weeks of life. Multivariate machine learning methods revealed that neonatal functional connectivity (FC) varied as a function of prenatal exposure to social disadvantage (n = 261, R = 0.43, R 2 = 0.18), with validation in an independent sample. Alterations in FC associated with prenatal social disadvantage occurred brain-wide and were most pronounced in association networks (fronto-parietal, ventral attention, dorsal attention) and the somatomotor network. Amygdala FC was altered at birth, with a pattern shared across subcortical structures. These findings provide critical insights into how early in development functional networks begin to diverge in the context of social disadvantage and elucidate the functional networks that are most impacted.",

          "abstract": "Reduced consumption of animal-sourced food (ASF) has been recommended for environmental and human health objectives; however, ASF can be important for food security and diet affordability. We explored country-level relationships among various metrics of food supply, socioeconomic context, food security, diet affordability, and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) to characterize how optimal inclusion ranges for ASF vary with socioeconomic factors and food system goals. Data from 2015 to 2022 for 153 countries were sourced to generate Bayesian Networks representing relationships among the studied food system metrics. Networks were used in simulations to characterize optimal ASF inclusion to achieve environmental, food security, or diet affordability goals based on individual country data. Results are most appropriately interpreted in aggregate rather than as representations of specific countries due in large part to data limitations. Across countries simulated, median total ASF inclusion in the food supply to support food security, GHGe, or affordability objectives was 18.2% ± 12.1%, 11.9% ± 6.8%, and 17.6% ± 8.5%, respectively. Joint optimization for these goals resulted in median ASF inclusion of 15.1% ± 7.2%, with notable regional differences. Although ASF increases were supported in most developing regions, decreases were supported in developed countries. The reported SD in optimal ASF inclusion were considerable, and represented between-country variation. Empirical relationships of food categories to goals consistently favored dairy and egg products over meats. These results support previous literature highlighting the environmental intensity of ASF, but also indicate that moderate ASF supplies contribute to multiple food system goals simultaneously.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to promote sustainable resource use through reduced meat consumption face challenges as global meat consumption persists. The resistance may be attributed to the lower sales price of meat compared to most plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs). Addressing this, our research delves into the pivotal question of which PBMAs resonate most with consumers and how pricing affects demand. In a hypothetical restaurant context, we conducted 2 representative studies among 2,126 individuals in the United States to scrutinize preferences for meat, analog, semi-analog, and non-analog burgers. First, in a survey, we assessed rankings of the four burgers, alongside evaluating participants’ genuine consideration of these choices to discern a diverse preference distribution. Subsequently, in an experiment, we examined the influence of prices on participants’ consideration and choice of PBMAs, thereby capturing both phases of the decision-making process. Our survey shows that meat has considerably higher utility and consumer preference than all PBMAs on average, but we also find substantial heterogeneity (i.e., some consumers prefer PBMAs over meat). In the experiment, we establish that there is a negative association between the consideration of meat and PBMA burgers, though consideration of any one PBMA is positively associated with considering other PBMAs. A noteworthy increase in consideration and choice is observed when prices of PBMAs are reduced, while changing the price of the meat burger only has minimal effect on demand. Such findings underscore the importance of affordability beyond price parity in catalyzing the shift toward plant-based diets.",

          "abstract": "A large body of research documents the barriers faced by first-generation, low-income (FGLI) students as “hidden minorities” on elite college campuses. Although existing studies show brief psychological interventions can help mitigate some of these obstacles, universities are investing in more intensive interventions that try to both shift mindsets and mitigate structural disadvantages in FGLI students’ academic preparation. In collaboration with the administrators at a highly selective university, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of a summer bridge program targeted at FGLI students. During summers between 2017 and 2019, we randomly selected 232 out of 418 first-generation or low-income students and invited them to attend an intensive, six-week-long residential summer program featuring courses for academic credit. Students randomized to the control group either interacted with online content offering no academic credit or had no summer intervention. Our preregistered analysis shows that the program encouraged FGLI students to pursue a more ambitious first-year program, increasing the proportion of nonintroductory courses by 7 percentage points. The program also increased the proportion of courses taken for a grade rather than as pass-fail by 6 percentage points. These improvements were accompanied by no discernible impact on first-year grade point averages (GPAs) and academic withdrawal. The findings show the potential to academically integrate FGLI students into selective university communities.",

          "abstract": "Arctic shorelines are vulnerable to climate change impacts as sea level rises, permafrost thaws, storms intensify, and sea ice thins. Seventy-five years of aerial and satellite observations have established coastal erosion as an increasing Arctic hazard. However, other hazards at play—for instance, the cumulative impact that sea-level rise and permafrost thaw subsidence will have on permafrost shorelines—have received less attention, preventing assessments of these processes’ impacts compared to and combined with coastal erosion. Alaska’s Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) is ideal for such assessments because of the high-density observations of topography, coastal retreat rates, and permafrost characteristics, and importance to Indigenous communities and oilfield infrastructure. Here, we produce 21st-century projections of Arctic shoreline position that include erosion, permafrost subsidence, and sea-level rise. Focusing on the ACP, we merge 5 m topography, satellite-derived coastal lake depth estimates, and empirical assessments of land subsidence due to permafrost thaw with projections of coastal erosion and sea-level rise for medium and high emissions scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s AR6 Report. We find that by 2100, erosion and inundation will together transform the ACP, leading to 6-8x more land loss than coastal erosion alone and disturbing 8-11x more organic carbon. Without mitigating measures, by 2100, coastal change could damage 40 to 65% of infrastructure in present-day ACP coastal villages and 10 to 20% of oilfield infrastructure. Our findings highlight the risks that compounding climate hazards pose to coastal communities and underscore the need for adaptive planning for Arctic coastlines in the 21st century.",

Functionalized hydrogels are ideal candidates for such materials since they are highly responsive to their environment and can be operated in water. In this work, we investigate a hybrid bonding hydrogel composed of peptide amphiphile supramolecular nanofibers covalently attached to a photoresponsive network, in which high-aspect-ratio ferromagnetic nanowires are aligned along the length of the sample, designed to swim under oscillating magnetic fields. This hybrid hydrogel swimmer can autonomously swim toward a light source by utilizing photoinduced interactions between supramolecular and covalent networks reminiscent of phototactic swimming in living systems. Using a combination of experimental techniques and a continuum model incorporating photochemistry, magnetoelasticity, and hydrodynamics, we explain the swimming mechanism and predict phototactic behavior. Our work highlights the potential role of hybrid bonding polymers, which leverage the interplay between supramolecular assemblies and covalent networks. We demonstrate how these polymers can be tailored to react dynamically to their environment, paving the way for developing intelligent and autonomous robotic systems.",

          "abstract": "The toxic effects of C9orf72-derived arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (R-DPRs) on cellular stress granules in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia remain unclear at the molecular level. Stress granules are formed through the switch of Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) by RNA from a closed inactive state to an open activated state, driving the formation of the organelle by liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). We show that R-DPRs bind G3BP1 a thousand times stronger than RNA and initiate LLPS much more effectively. Their pathogenic effect is underscored by the slow transition of R-DPR–G3BP1 droplets to aggregated, ThS-positive states that can recruit ALS-linked proteins hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2, and TDP-43. Deletion constructs and molecular simulations show that R-DPR binding and LLPS are mediated via the negatively charged intrinsically disordered region 1 (IDR1) of the protein, allosterically regulated by its positively charged IDR3. Bioinformatic analyses point to the strong mechanistic parallels of these effects with the interaction of R-DPRs with nucleolar nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) and underscore that R-DPRs interact with many other similar nucleolar and stress-granule proteins, extending the underlying mechanism of R-DPR toxicity in cells. Our results also highlight characteristic differences between the two R-DPRs, poly-GR and poly-PR, and suggest that the primary pathological target of poly-GR is not NPM1 in nucleoli, but G3BP1 in stress granules in affected cells.",

          "abstract": "Magnetotactic bacteria have evolved the remarkable capacity to biomineralize chains of magnetite [Fe(II)Fe(III) 2 O 4 ] nanoparticles that align along the geomagnetic field and optimize their navigation in the environment. Mechanisms enabling magnetite formation require the complex action of numerous proteins for iron acquisition, sequestration in dedicated magnetosome organelles, and precipitation into magnetite. The MamP protein contains c-type cytochromes called magnetochrome domains that are found exclusively in magnetotactic bacteria. Ablation of magnetochromes in MamP prevents bacteria from aligning with external magnetic fields, showing their importance to maintain this biological function. MamP has been proposed, mostly from in vitro experimentations, to regulate iron redox state and maintain an Fe(II)/Fe(III) balance compatible with magnetite formation via the iron oxidase activity of magnetochromes. To test the proposed function for MamP in vivo in the magnetotactic strain Magnetospirillum magneticum (AMB)-1, we characterized the iron species in chemical MamP-mediated magnetite syntheses as well as in bacteria unable to produce MamP using a combination of physicochemical methodologies. We show that MamP has no apparent control on the speciation and oxidation state of intracellular iron or on the Fe(II)/Fe(III) balance in magnetite. We propose that MamP promotes magnetite growth by incorporating Fe(III) into preexisting magnetite seeds and that magnetite structure and stoichiometry is maintained by further equilibration with dissolved Fe(II) in magnetosome organelles.",

          "abstract": "Reducing meat and dairy intake has been identified as a necessary strategy for mitigating the high environmental impacts food systems are currently having on climate change, biodiversity loss associated with land-use changes, and freshwater use. Having a choice of dedicated meat and milk replacements available to consumers can help in the transition toward more plant-based diets, but concerns about nutritional and health impacts and high costs can impede uptake. Here, we conduct a multicriteria assessment of 24 meat and milk alternatives that integrates nutritional, health, environmental, and cost analyses with a focus on high-income countries. Unprocessed plant-based foods such as peas, soybeans, and beans performed best in our assessment across all domains. In comparison, processed plant-based products such as veggie burgers, traditional meat replacements such as tempeh, and plant milks were associated with less climate benefits and greater costs than unprocessed foods but still offered substantial environmental, health, and nutritional benefits compared to animal products. Our findings suggest that a range of food products exist that when replacing meat and dairy in current diets would have multiple benefits, including reductions in nutritional imbalances, dietary risks and mortality, environmental resource use and pollution, and when choosing unprocessed foods over processed ones also diet costs. The findings provide support for public policies and business initiatives aimed at increasing their uptake.",

Homologous with ATP synthases, these multisubunit enzymes consist of a soluble catalytic V 1 subcomplex and a membrane-embedded proton-translocating V O subcomplex. The V 1 and V O subcomplexes can undergo reversible dissociation to regulate proton pumping, with reassociation of V 1 and V O requiring the protein complex known as RAVE (regulator of the ATPase of vacuoles and endosomes). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , RAVE consists of subunits Rav1p, Rav2p, and Skp1p. We used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a structure of yeast RAVE bound to V 1 . In the structure, RAVE is an L-shaped complex with Rav2p pointing toward the membrane and Skp1p distant from both the membrane and V 1 . Only Rav1p interacts with V 1 , binding to a region of subunit A not found in the corresponding ATP synthase subunit. When bound to RAVE, V 1 is in a rotational state suitable for binding the free V O complex, but in the structure, it is partially disrupted, missing five of its 16 subunits. Other than these missing subunits and the conformation of the inhibitory subunit H, the V 1 complex with RAVE appears poised for reassembly with V O .",

          "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a subtype of head and neck cancer that arises in the multilayered epithelia of the mouth and lips. Although inactivating mutations in CASP8 are frequently found in human OSCC their role in the disease is unknown. To investigate this, we deleted Casp8 in the oral epithelium of adult mice. Loss of Caspase-8 resulted in defects in the tongue epithelial barrier and triggered a neutrophil-rich immune infiltrate distinct from that observed on epidermal Casp8 deletion. Oral Casp8 deletion led to activation of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy partially rescued epithelial integrity in Casp8 −/− mice, while induction of autophagy in wild type mice resulted in oral barrier defects and excessive neutrophil infiltration. On treatment with the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide Casp8 −/− mice showed increased susceptibility to developing oral tumors. Depletion of neutrophils reduced tumor incidence, which correlated with a reduction in reactive oxygen species and decreased epithelial DNA damage. Our findings establish a functional link between epithelial integrity, autophagy, and the tumor immune microenvironment, placing Caspase-8 at the center of these processes.",

How this might impact immune cells is not well understood. Using multiple mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, glutamine antagonists, as well as genetic and pharmacological inhibition of glutamine utilization, we found that the number and frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) is dependent on microenvironmental glutamine levels. cDCs comprise two distinct subsets—cDC1s and cDC2s, with the former subset playing a critical role in antigen cross-presentation and tumor immunity. While both subsets show dependence on glutamine, cDC1s are particularly sensitive. Notably, glutamine antagonism did not reduce the frequency of DC precursors but decreased the proliferation and survival of cDC1s. Further studies suggest a role of the nutrient sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in this process. Taken together, these findings uncover glutamine dependence of cDC1s that is coopted by tumors to escape immune responses.",

This paper introduces an innovative strategy using the commercially available and cost-effective hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodobenzene (HTIB) as a radical initiator, enabling clean and bidirectional disulfide metathesis under biocompatible conditions. Our method facilitates efficient forward reactions by utilizing an excess of one disulfide to shift the equilibrium toward unsymmetrical disulfides, while also ensuring clean reverse reactions by the removal of low boiling point dimethyl disulfide. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular approach using a cyclic five- or eight-membered disulfide avoids the need for an excess of one disulfide, effectively yielding unsymmetrical disulfide molecules. The radical mechanism of this approach, validated through various control experiments and EPR analysis, enables selective and biocompatible modifications of carbohydrates, drugs, native amino acids, and proteins. This study represents a notable advancement in organic chemistry, with significant implications for biomedical sciences, especially in areas that require precise and gentle biomolecular manipulations, such as protein engineering and therapeutic development.",

          "abstract": "Mechanical properties of disordered materials are governed by their underlying free energy landscape. In contrast to external fields, embedding a small fraction of active particles within a disordered material generates nonequilibrium internal fields, which can help to circumvent kinetic barriers and modulate the free energy landscape. In this work, we investigate through computer simulations how the activity of active particles alters the mechanical response of deeply annealed polydisperse colloidal gels. We show that the “swim force” generated by the embedded active particles is responsible for determining the mode of mechanical failure, i.e., brittle vs. ductile. We find, and theoretically justify, that at a critical swim force the mechanical properties of the gel decrease abruptly, signaling a change in the mode of mechanical failure. The weakening of the elastic modulus above the critical swim force results from the change in gel porosity and distribution of attractive forces among gel particles, while below the critical swim force, the ductility enhancement is caused by an increase of gel structural disorder. Above the critical swim force, the gel develops a pronounced heterogeneous structure characterized by multiple pore spaces, and the mechanical response is controlled by dynamical heterogeneities. We contrast these results with those of a simulated monodisperse gel that exhibits a nonmonotonic trend of ductility modulation with increasing swim force, revealing a complex interplay between the gel energy landscape and embedded activity.",

          "abstract": "Climate warming can alleviate temperature and nutrient constraints on tree growth in boreal regions, potentially enhancing boreal productivity. However, in permafrost environments, warming also disrupts the physical foundation on which trees grow, leading to leaning trees or “drunken” forests. Tree leaning might reduce radial growth, undermining potential benefits of warming. Here, we found widespread radial growth reductions in southern latitude boreal forests since the 1980s. At mid latitudes, radial growth increased from ~1980 to ~2000 but showed recent signs of decline afterward. Increased growth was evident since the 1980 s at higher latitudes, where radial growth appears to be temperature limited. However, recent changes in permafrost stability, and the associated increased frequency of tree leaning events, emerged as a significant stressor, leading to reduced radial growth in boreal trees at the highest latitudes, where permafrost is extensive. We showed that trees growing in unstable permafrost sites allocated more nonstructural carbohydrate reserves to offset leaning which compromised radial growth and potential carbon uptake benefits of warming. This higher allocation of resources in drunken trees is needed to build the high-density reaction wood, rich in lignin, that is required to maintain a vertical position. With continued climate warming, we anticipate widespread reductions in radial growth in boreal forests, leading to lower carbon sequestration. These findings enhance our understanding of how climate warming and indirect effects, such as ground instability caused by warming permafrost, will affect boreal forest productivity in the future.",

Despite the expanding utility of ultrasound neuromodulation in the neuroscience research field and clinical applications, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which ultrasound impacts neural activity in the brain are still largely unknown. Here, we report that transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6), a mechanosensitive nonselective cation channel, is essential for ultrasound neuromodulation of mammalian neurons in vitro and in vivo. We first demonstrated that ultrasound irradiation elicited rapid and robust Ca 2+ transients mediated via extracellular Ca 2+ influx in cultured mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons. Ultrasound-induced neuronal responses were massively diminished by blocking either the generation of action potential or synaptic transmission. Importantly, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deficiency of TRPC6 almost completely abolished neuronal responses to ultrasound. Furthermore, we found that intracerebroventricular administration of a TRPC6 blocker significantly attenuated the number of neuronal firings in the cerebral cortex evoked by transcranial ultrasound irradiation in mice. Our findings indicate that TRPC6 is an indispensable molecule of ultrasound neuromodulation in intact mammalian brains, providing fundamental understanding of biophysical molecular mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation as well as insight into its future feasibility in neuroscience and translational research in humans.",

          "abstract": "Phase transition between ordered phases has garnered attention from the viewpoint of materials science as well as statistical physics. One interesting example is martensitic transformation and the resulting formation of twin structures, in which atoms or molecules that form one crystalline phase move in a concerted and diffusionless manner toward another crystalline phase. Recently martensitic transformation has been observed experimentally also in various soft materials. However, the complex internal structures involving many molecules have eluded direct investigation of the dynamical processes of martensitic transformation. Here, we carry out a direct simulation of mesoscale structural transition of a liquid crystalline blue phase (BP) of cubic symmetry, known as BP II. The dynamics is simulated by a Langevin-type equation for the orientational order parameter with thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that machine-learning-aided analysis of local structures successfully unravels the transformation process from a perfect lattice of BP II to a twinned lattice of another BP (BP I). The nucleation of BP I is initiated by the breakup of junctions of line defects (disclinations), followed by the deformation of disclination network. We further show that twinned BP I is reversibly transformed to a perfect lattice of BP II by temperature variation. Order-parameter-based simulations with machine-learning-aided local structure identification provide valuable insights into not only the martensitic transformation of soft materials but also a wider class of complex structural transitions between ordered phases.",

Specific subsets of CD8+ T cells, as well as certain innate T cells, displayed the most pronounced dysregulation in ME. We observed upregulation of key transcription factors associated with T cell exhaustion in CD8+ T cell effector memory subsets, as well as an altered chromatin landscape and metabolic reprogramming consistent with an exhausted immune cell state. To validate these observations, we analyzed expression of exhaustion markers using flow cytometry, detecting a higher frequency of exhaustion-associated factors. Together, these data identify T cell exhaustion as a component of ME, a finding which may provide a basis for future therapies, such as checkpoint blockade, metabolic interventions, or drugs that target chronic viral infections.",

Numerous studies using environmental life cycle assessments confirmed plant-based meat alternatives are more environmentally favorable than animal-derived meat. However, most missed other factors from protein extraction and concentration that contribute to environmental impact (both positive and negative). Furthermore, few studies examined the entire environmental impact because they overlooked social and nutritional life cycle assessments. Many publications assumed most environmental impact occurred in crop cultivation before high protein products are manufactured. However, industrial plant-based protein extraction, concentration, and purification require large amounts of natural resources, energy, chemicals, and highly specialized equipment seldom accurately assessed from an environmental, social, and nutritional perspective. This paper presents opinions and perspectives on additional information to consider to fully realize environmental benefits of highly proteinaceous plant-based food ingredients.

This study investigates the effectiveness of pelleted bromoform-containing seaweed ( Asparagopsis taxiformis ) (Brominata) as an enteric methane (CH 4 ) inhibitor in grazing beef cattle. The primary objective was to assess the impact of this antimethanogenic additive on enteric CH 4 emissions under real-world farm conditions. Twenty-four beef steers, crossbreeds of Wagyu and Angus, with an average liveweight of 399 ± 21.7 kg, were allocated to two treatment groups: Control and Brominata. These animals underwent regular weigh-ins every 14 d, and measurements of CH 4 , carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and hydrogen (H 2 ) emissions were conducted using the GreenFeed system. Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS 9.4, wherein the model incorporated fixed effects for treatment, time, their interaction, and a covariate, while accounting for animal variations as a random effect within each phase. Three phases of bromoform intake were identified: a 3-wk ramp-up phase, a 3-wk optimal phase, and a 2-wk decreasing phase. No differences were observed between the weekly initial and final liveweight, average daily gain, and predicted dry matter intake. During optimal and decreasing phases, average enteric CH 4 emissions were significantly reduced in steers that received Brominata supplementation compared to those without supplementation (115 vs. 185 g/d, respectively). Additionally, both groups had similar CO 2 emissions (6.8 vs. 7.2 kg/d), while H 2 emissions were lower in the control group (3.4 vs. 1.8 g/d). The findings suggest that pelleted bromoform-containing feed additive has the potential to reduce enteric CH 4 emissions from grazing beef cattle.",

We used femtosecond spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis to map out the critical elementary steps by following the dynamics of initial reactants, various intermediates, and final products. We observed initial direct ultrafast electron tunneling from the hydroquinone flavin cofactor to 6-4PP in 300 ps through an intervening adenine as a mediator, minimizing the electron bifurcation of a two-step hopping pathway bridged also by the adenine as an intermediate. The subsequent proton transfer (PT) from the neighboring histidine to anionic 6-4PP in 2 ns is critical and competes with the futile back electron transfer in 151 ps. Mutations of either of two histidines in the active site nearly abolish repair, indicating their essential role on repair reactivity and structural integrity. These results elucidate the electron-coupled PT mechanism and the repair photocycle of this bifunctional cryptochrome at the molecular level, further supporting that the hydroquinone flavin is the active state in vivo for dual functions or one of the two functions is excessive.",

          "abstract": "HIV, like other membrane-enveloped viruses, has protein spikes that include a fusion peptide (Fp) segment that binds the host cell membrane and plays a critical role in fusion (joining) viral and cell membranes. The HIV Fp is the ~23 N-terminal residues of the gp41 spike protein. Fp adopts intermolecular antiparallel β sheet structure when lipid fraction cholesterol ≈0.3, which is comparable to host cells. Rotational-echo double-resonance NMR was applied to probe the registries (alignments) of adjacent Fp molecules in membrane-bound sheets. The data were fitted to determine quantitative populations, f(t)’s, of individual antiparallel registries indexed by t, the number of residues in the registry. Both wild-type (WT) and fusion-defective V2E Fp sheets have broad but very different registry distributions, each with at least eight populated registries with f(t) &gt; 0.02, and t WT = 16.1 and ⟨t⟩ V2E = 18.5. The broad WT distribution likely improves mutational robustness for HIV, as Fp is a neutralization epitope of the immune system, and Fp mutations are required for immune evasion during chronic HIV infection. V2E fusion is reduced because longer Fp sheets increase separation between initially apposed membranes. The f(t) WT were well-fitted to free energies that were sums of contributions from sheet length, aligned leucines, and sidechain membrane insertion. The f(t) V2E ’s were similarly well-fitted except there wasn’t the insertion contribution. Relative to V2E, WT fusion is enhanced by deeper membrane insertion of Fp with accompanying greater dislocation of neighboring lipids. This study provides a rare quantitative determination of broad molecular structural distributions by experiment.",

In general, faster host motility facilitates virus transmission. However, recent ecological studies have also shown that animal host migration can reduce viral prevalence by removing infected individuals from the migratory group. Here, we use a bacteria-bacteriophage copropagation system to investigate how host motility affects viral spread during range expansion. We find that phage spread during chemotaxis-driven navigated range expansion decreases as bacterial migration speed increases. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the navigated migration leads to a spatial sorting of infected and uninfected hosts in the copropagating front of bacteria-bacteriophage, with implications for the number of cells left behind. The preferential loss of infected cells in the copropagating front inhibits viral spread. Further increase in host migration speed leads to a phase transition that eliminates the phage completely. These results illustrate that navigated range expansion of the host can promote the migratory culling of infectious diseases in the migration group.",

          "abstract": "Learning requires changing the brain. This typically occurs through experience, study, or instruction. We report an alternate route for humans to acquire visual knowledge, through the direct sculpting of activity patterns in the human brain that mirror those expected to arise through learning. We used neurofeedback from closed-loop real-time functional MRI to create new categories of visual objects in the brain, without the participants’ explicit awareness. After neural sculpting, participants exhibited behavioral and neural biases for the learned, but not for the control categories. The ability to sculpt new perceptual distinctions into the human brain offers a noninvasive research paradigm for causal testing of the link between neural representations and behavior. As such, beyond its current application to perception, our work potentially has broad relevance for advancing understanding in other domains of cognition such as decision-making, memory, and motor control.",

          "abstract": "Child undernutrition remains a widespread public health problem in the Global South, especially in Africa. Childhood stunting—meaning linear growth retardation—is a comprehensive and commonly used indicator of chronic child undernutrition and is mostly the result of insufficient nutrient intake, among other factors. Previous research showed that the consumption of animal-sourced foods (ASF), including meat, dairy, eggs, and fish, is associated with lower rates of child stunting, but reliable evidence for Africa is scant. In Africa, average ASF consumption is low. We use representative panel data from five African countries—Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda—with over 32,000 observations from children aged 0 to 5 y to show that ASF consumption increases mean child height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) by 0.30 ( P &lt; 0.01) and reduces the likelihood of stunting by 6.8 percentage points ( P &lt; 0.01), after controlling for confounding factors. The child nutritional benefits of diets containing ASF are larger than those of purely plant-based diets. Nutritious plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and legumes, can provide most of the nutrients required and also have positive effects on HAZ, but they are sometimes not available and accessible in sufficient quantities all year round, especially in rural areas. Given the large environmental footprints of livestock farming, initiatives to make food systems more sustainable often call for a strong reduction in ASF consumption. While ASF consumption should be reduced where consumption quantities are high, our results suggest that poor households’ access to ASF in Africa should be further improved to help reduce child undernutrition.",

          "abstract": "As the largest oil and gas producer in the United States, Texas confronts significant challenges in its shift toward decarbonization. This study explores the potential for green hydrogen in Texas as a substitute for current development, underscoring numerous advantages such as ample renewables, established demand, and operational infrastructure. We present an hourly-resolution, cross-sector assessment framework to optimize grid-integrated green hydrogen supply paths from managing local applications to meeting potential export opportunities. The analysis indicates that by 2030, Texas could have over 50 million tons of green hydrogen available at $1.5/kg. Even with the incrementality, deliverability, and temporal matching requirements of 45 V, green hydrogen remains more competitive than blue hydrogen. On the supply side, the grid-electrolysis integration results in synergetic benefits, including overall cost reductions, less curtailment of renewables, and enhanced operational flexibility and reliability. On the demand side, this cost-competitive hydrogen could bring the cost of hydrogen fueling and ammonia production down to $4/kg and $350/ton respectively, with a significant impact in replacing fossil fuels in transport and industry. For most of the states, green hydrogen and ammonia imported from Texas could become an affordable alternative to local supplies. Through both onshore pipelines and offshore shipments, Texas has the potential to develop as a major green fuel supplier, aiding in decarbonization efforts not only for the United States but also beyond.",

Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to explore their origin, particularly focusing on EuCd 2 P 2 . While the low-energy spectral weight royally tracks that of the resistivity anomaly near the temperature with maximum magnetoresistance ( T MR ) as expected from transport-spectroscopy correspondence, the spectra are completely incoherent and strongly suppressed with no hint of a Landau quasiparticle. Using systematic material and temperature dependence investigation complemented by theory, we attribute this nonquasiparticle caricature to the strong presence of entangled magnetic and lattice interactions, a characteristic enabled by the p - f mixing. Given the known presence of ferromagnetic clusters, this naturally points to the origin of CMR being the scattering of spin-polarized polarons at the boundaries of ferromagnetic clusters. These results are not only illuminating to investigate the strong correlations and topology in EuCd 2 X 2 family, but, in a broader view, exemplify how multiple cooperative interactions can give rise to extraordinary behaviors in condensed matter systems.",

          "abstract": "The dissolution of active atoms under operating potential will lead to a decline in their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, thus preventing the current highly active catalysts from being practically applicable in industrial water electrolysis. Here, we propose a sequential leaching strategy to utilize the dynamic restructuring and enhance the chemical bond strength for highly active and stable OER. Modeling on nickel-iron sulfides (NiFe-S), we introduced and utilized foreign Mo dopant preleaching as the sacrificial agent to alleviate the oxidation corrosion of partial M─S bonds. Operando spectroscopic reveal that foreign Mo dopant leach from the matrix and then adsorb on the surface of NiFe O(S)OH as molybdate at lower OER potential. The crystal occupation hamiltonian population analysis uncovers that the charge transfer from molybdate into NiFe O(S)OH will enhance bond energy of M─S, thus preventing further S and Fe/Ni leaching. By manipulating ion leaching, the resulting active phase achieves an ultralow overpotential of 250 mV at 400 mA cm −2 and high stability of more than 3,700 h at 100 mA cm −2 . An industrial water electrolysis equipment using our catalysts delivered ultralow energy consumption of 4.30 kWh m −3 H2 and record stability over 250 h (2,300 h lifetime by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) under a high working current of 8,000 mA.

While soy and gluten dominate the market, there is a trend to explore alternative crops for functional ingredient production. The multitude of ingredients poses challenges for food manufacturers in selecting the right protein. We investigated 61 commercially available protein ingredients from various sources, categorizing them based on their protein content into protein-rich flours (protein content less than 50%), protein concentrates (protein content between 50% and 80%), and protein isolates (protein content higher than 80%). Methionine, cysteine, and lysine were decisive for the amino acid score, which even varied between ingredients produced from the same raw material. Such differences were also observed in the protein solubility profiles, characterized by their raw material–specific protein pattern. By focusing on soy, pea, and fava bean ingredients, the broad spectra of emulsifying and foaming properties were illustrated. These ranged from non–emulsifying and non–foaming to high emulsifying capacities of 737 mL/g ingredient and foaming activities of 2,278%, accompanied by a foam stability of 100%. Additionally, we demonstrated that the functionality of ingredients obtained from different batches could vary by up to 24% relative SD. Protein solubility, powder wettability, color, and particle size were determined as key properties for the differentiation of soy, pea, and fava bean protein ingredients by principal component analysis. In our study conclusion, we propose essential measures for overcoming challenges in protein ingredient production and utilization to realize their full potential in fostering sustainable and innovative plant-based food production.",

Here, we report an unexpected function of RAD51 in the maintenance methylation of genomic DNA, a function that is separable from its role in homologous recombination. First, it acts as an inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1. Deficiency in RAD51 causes excessive ubiquitination and degradation of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, leading to the loss of global DNA methylation. Second, RAD51 helps UHRF1 to monoubiquitinate histone H3 to generate DNMT1 recruiting signal. It binds H3 directly, enabling UHRF1 to bind and ubiquitinate H3 more readily. Disrupting the interaction between RAD51 and H3 diminishes DNMT1 recruitment and the failure of maintenance methylation of genomic DNA. Thus, RAD51 dually regulates UHRF1. These results establish RAD51 as a guardian of the integrity of both the genome and the epigenome.",

          "abstract": "The high emissions intensity of terrestrial animal source food (TASF) and projected increasing demand in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have spurred interest in the development of animal-free alternatives and manufactured food items that aim to substitute for meat, milk, and eggs with the promise of reduced environmental impact of producing food. The developing world is the source of 75% of global emissions from ruminants and will house 86% of the world’s human population by 2050. The adoption of cost-effective, genetic, feed and nutrition practices, and improving livestock health in LMIC are seen as the most promising interventions to reduce emissions resulting from projected increased TASF demand though 2050. Genetic improvement is a particularly attractive approach to productivity enhancements, as such improvements are permanent and cumulative. Alternative proteins may play a role in addressing demand for affordable sources of nutrient-dense foods, however, price will be a major factor influencing adoption given 3.1 billion people globally (42%) were currently unable to afford a healthy diet in 2021. Additionally, there is currently a mismatch between the location of alternative protein companies, and both projected increased TASF demand and emissions. To date, the vast majority (&gt;81%) of these companies are based in high-income countries. The sustainability implications of replacing TASF with alternative proteins at scale needs to consider not only environmental metrics but also the wider economic and social sustainability impacts, given the essential role that livestock play in the livelihoods and food security of approximately 1.3 billion people.",

          "abstract": "The Planetary Health Diet (PHD), also known as the EAT-Lancet reference diet, was developed to optimize global dietary quality while keeping the environmental impacts of food production within sustainable planetary boundaries. We calculated current national and global adherence to the PHD using the Planetary Health Dietary Index (PHDI). In addition, we used data on diet and mortality from three large US cohorts (n = 206,404 men and women, 54,536 deaths) to estimate the total and cause-specific mortality among adults 20 y of age and older that could be prevented by shifting from current diets to the reference PHD. The PHDI varied substantially across countries, although adherence was universally far from optimal (mean PHDI = 85 out of 140). By improving the global PHDI to 120, approximately 15 million deaths (27% of total deaths) could be prevented annually. Estimates of preventable deaths due to this shift ranged from 2.5 million for cardiovascular diseases to 0.7 million for neurodegenerative diseases. Our analysis suggests that adopting healthy and sustainable diets would have major direct health benefits by reducing mortality due to multiple diseases and could contribute substantially to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. These numbers of preventable deaths are based on evidence that human biology is similar across racial and ethnic groups, but the exact numerical estimates should be interpreted with caution because some assumptions used for the calculations build on limited data. Refinement of these estimates will be possible when additional regional data on diet and mortality become available.",

Yet, it remains unclear how stem cells sense mechanical signals from their niche in vivo. In this work, we investigated the roles of PIEZO mechanosensitive channels in the intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche. We used mouse genetics and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to assess the requirement for PIEZO channels in ISC maintenance. In vivo measurement of basement membrane stiffness showed that ISCs reside in a more rigid microenvironment at the bottom of the crypt. Three-dimensional and two-dimensional organoid systems combined with bioengineered substrates and a stretching device revealed that PIEZO channels sense extracellular mechanical stimuli to modulate ISC function. This study delineates the mechanistic cascade of PIEZO activation that coordinates ISC fate decision and maintenance.",

Our panoramic analysis uncovered organ-, lineage-, and sex-specific shifts of cellular dynamics during lifespan progression. Moreover, we identify both systematic and organ-specific alterations in immune cell populations associated with aging. We further explored the regulatory roles of the immune system on aging and pinpointed specific age-related cell population expansions that are lymphocyte dependent. Our “cell-omics” strategy enhances comprehension of cellular aging and lays the groundwork for exploring the complex cellular regulatory networks in aging and aging-associated diseases.",

We have developed an eco-evolutionary metapopulation model for Acropora , an ecologically important yet highly threatened coral taxon. We find that although corals have some adaptation capacity, they will suffer severe heatwave-induced declines over the coming decades. For a future where emissions lead to ~3°C of global warming, natural selection could allow populations to persist, albeit in severely depleted states with elevated extinction risk and potential loss of ecosystem functioning. Yet, for thermally sensitive coral populations to thrive post-2050 demands rapid reductions of greenhouse gas emissions that limit global warming to 2°C.",

How substrates are released from SRP at the ER to subsequently access translocation factors is not well understood. We found that TMEM208 can engage the substrate binding domain of SRP to accelerate release of its bound cargo. Without TMEM208, slow cargo release resulted in excessive synthesis of downstream polypeptide before engaging translocation factors. Delayed access to translocation machinery caused progressive loss of insertion competence, particularly for multipass membrane proteins, resulting in their impaired biogenesis. Thus, TMEM208 facilitates prompt cargo handover from the targeting to translocation machinery to minimize biogenesis errors and maintain protein homeostasis.",

This response, typical for most mammals, safeguards against short-term water deprivation but fails in the long term. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) use the short-term response during summer, whereas during winter, they lack thirst and survive without water for months. In this work, we show that long-term thirst suppression occurs despite hormonal and behavioral signs of a substantial fluid deficit and originates from hypoactivity of neurons in the circumventricular organs, which exhibit marked functional suppression during winter that blunts their sensitivity to thirst cues. Our work reveals a notable capacity of the evolutionarily conserved brain regions that control fluid homeostasis in mammals to enable long-term survival without water.",

We explore the dynamical behavior of two anyons undergoing quantum walks and observe the anyonic Hanbury Brown–Twiss effect as well as the formation of bound states without on-site interactions. Once interactions are introduced, we observe spatially asymmetric transport in contrast to the symmetric dynamics of bosons and fermions.

In bacteria, the small ribosomal subunit (30 S ) is recruited to many mRNAs through base pairing with the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and RNA binding by ribosomal protein bS1. Translation can initiate on nascent mRNAs, and RNA polymerase (RNAP) can promote the recruitment of the pioneering 30 S . Here, we examined 30 S recruitment to nascent mRNAs using cryo–electron microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence colocalization, and in-cell cross-linking mass spectrometry. We show that bS1 delivers the mRNA to the ribosome for SD duplex formation and 30 S activation. Additionally, bS1 and RNAP stimulate translation initiation. Our work provides a mechanistic framework for how the SD duplex, ribosomal proteins, and RNAP cooperate in 30 S recruitment to mRNAs and establish transcription-translation coupling.",

We identified 1448 variants in 128 recurrently mutated genes, including drivers of antimalarial multidrug resistance. In contrast to naturally occurring variants, those selected in vitro are more likely to be missense or frameshift, involve bulky substitutions, and occur in conserved, ordered protein domains.

It contains a high density of straight, selective nanochannels, enabling the preferential transport of aromatic molecules. Compared with traditional mixed-matrix membranes with random orientations, the OMP membrane improves the pervaporation separation index for aromatic-aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures with C 6 and C 7 compounds, surpassing the performance of existing membranes by 3 to 10 times.

Chemical modifications of silk fibroin produced a pair of oppositely charged hydrogels.

Through the incorporation of poly(amino acid)s, we have demonstrated a droplet-based synthetic synapse with ionic polymer–mediated long-term plasticity.

Rationing restricted sugar intake to levels within current dietary guidelines, and consumption nearly doubled immediately after rationing ended. Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced type 2 diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35 and 20% and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years, respectively. Protection was evident with in utero exposure and increased with postnatal sugar restriction, especially after 6 months, when eating of solid foods likely began. In utero sugar rationing alone accounted for about one-third of the risk reduction.",

          "abstract": "Microplastic remediation in aquatic bodies is essential for the entire ecosystem, but is challenging to achieve with a universal and efficient strategy. Here, we developed a sustainable and environmentally adaptable adsorbent through supramolecular self-assembly of chitin and cellulose. This biomass fibrous framework (Ct-Cel) showcases an excellent adsorption performance for polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. The affinity for diverse microplastics is attributed to the transformation of multiple intermolecular interactions between different microplastics and Ct-Cel. Meanwhile, the strong resistance of Ct-Cel to multiple pollutants in water enables an enhanced adsorption when coexisting with microorganisms and Pb 2+ . Moreover, Ct-Cel can remove 98.0 to 99.9% of microplastics in four types of real water and maintains a high removal efficiency of up to 95.1 to 98.1% after five adsorption cycles. This work may open up prospects for functional biomass materials for cost-efficient remediation of microplastics in complex aquatic environments.",

Here, we identified severe limitations in cell-type annotation using unsupervised approaches and propose a more robust standard using a semi-supervised method or the TCR arrangement. We showcase the utility of a TCR-first approach through application of the STEGO.R tool for the identification of treatment-related dynamics and previously unknown public T cell clusters with potential antigen-specific properties. Thus, the paradigm shift to a TCR-first can highlight overlooked key T cell features that have the potential for improvements in immunotherapy and diagnostics.",

Here, a biocompatible nanosized covalent organic framework (nCOF)–based pyroelectric catalyst (denoted as TPAD-COF NPs) is designed for pyroelectric catalysis-activated in situ immunotherapy. TPAD-COF NPs confine organic pyroelectric molecules to rigid TPAD-COF NPs to substantially reduce aggregation and enhance biocompatibility, thus improving pyroelectrocatalytic efficiency. After tumor internalization, TPAD-COF NPs facilitate photothermal tumor ablation under near-infrared (NIR) laser exposure, resulting in effective ICD induction. In addition, TPAD-COF NPs effectively catalyze the conversion of temperature changes to pyroelectric changes, which subsequently react with adjacent O 2 to generate reactive oxygen species, thus triggering robust ICD activation. In vivo evaluation using mouse models confirmed that TPAD-COF NPs evidently inhibited the proliferation of primary and distant tumors and prevented lung metastasis under NIR laser illumination. Therefore, this study opens an avenue for designing nCOF-based catalysts for pyroelectric catalysis-activated in situ immunotherapy.",

Modeling and satellite observations show that climate refugia are created by the upwelling of cooler water to the surface through the interactions of tides and currents with dense reef structures. Here, we use a high-resolution nested regional ocean model to investigate the future status of two relatively large refugia. On the basis of model projections under a high-emission scenario, we find that the upwelling mechanisms will stay active in a warming climate, and these regions are likely to remain approximately more than 1°C cooler than surrounding waters until at least into the 2080s, providing thermal relief to corals. Identification and protection of these refugia may help facilitate reef survival and related biodiversity preservation by allowing their corals time to acclimatize and adapt and ultimately provide source populations to replenish the rest of the reef.",

The immune system is an ideal avenue to assess the effects of climate change because immune performance is sensitive to changes in temperature and immune competency can affect reproductive success. We investigate the effect of rising temperatures on a biomarker of nonspecific immune performance in a wild population of capuchin monkeys and provide compelling evidence that immune performance is associated with ambient temperature. Critically, we found that immune performance in young individuals is more sensitive to high temperatures compared to other age groups. Coupled with evidence of rising temperatures in the region, our results offer insight into how climate change will affect the immune system of wild mammals.",

          "abstract": "Berberine is an effective antimicrobial and antidiabetic alkaloid, primarily extracted from divergent botanical lineages, specifically Coptis (Ranunculales, early-diverging eudicot) and Phellodendron (Sapindales, core eudicot). In comparison with its known pathway in Coptis species, its biosynthesis in Phellodendron species remains elusive. Using chromosome-level genome assembly, coexpression matrix, and biochemical assays, we identified six key steps in berberine biosynthesis from Phellodendron amurense , including methylation, hydroxylation, and berberine bridge formation. Notably, we discovered a specific class of O -methyltransferases (NOMT) responsible for N -methylation. Structural analysis and mutagenesis of PaNOMT9 revealed its unique substrate-binding conformation. In addition, unlike the classical FAD-dependent berberine bridge formation in Ranunculales, Phellodendron uses a NAD(P)H-dependent monooxygenase (PaCYP71BG29) for berberine bridge formation, originating from the neofunctionalization of tryptamine 5-hydroxylase. Together, these findings reveal the convergence of berberine biosynthesis between Coptis and Phellodendron and signify the role of the convergent evolution in plant specialized metabolisms.",

Our study investigated the association between PM 2.5 exposure and immune response, as well as epigenetic changes using high-dimensional epigenetic landscape profiling using cytometry by time-of-flight (EpiTOF) at the single cell. We found statistically significant associations between PM 2.5 exposure and levels of certain cytokines [interleukin-1RA (IL-1RA), IL-8/CXCL8, IL-18, and IL-27)] and histone posttranslational modifications (HPTMs) in immune cells (HPTMs: H3K9ac, H3K23ac, H3K27ac, H2BK120ub, H4K20me1/3, and H3K9me1/2) among pregnant and nonpregnant women. The cord blood of neonates with high maternal PM 2.5 exposure showed lower IL-27 than those with low exposure. Furthermore, PM 2.5 exposure affects the co-modification profiles of cytokines between pregnant women and their neonates, along with HPTMs in each immune cell type between pregnant and nonpregnant women.

However, the FCC structure limits yield strength and makes the alloys unable to meet ever-increasing demands for exploring the universe. Here, we report a strategy to obtain FCC materials with outstanding mechanical properties in both ambient and cryogenic environments, via exploiting dynamic development of the interstitial-driven local chemical order (LCO). Dense laths composed of the multiscaled LCO domains evolve from planar-slip bands that form in the prior thermomechanical processing, contributing to ultrahigh yield strengths over a wide temperature range. During cryogenic tensile deformation, LCO further develops and promotes remarkable dislocation cross-slip. Together with the deformation-driven transformation and twinning, these factors lead to satisfactory work hardening. The cryogenic loading–promoted LCO, also revealed by ab initio calculations, opens an avenue for designing advanced cryogenic materials.",

          "abstract": "Converging findings have established that the endocannabinoid (eCB) system serves as a possible target for the development of new treatments as a complement to opioid-based treatments. Here, we show in male and female mice that enhancing levels of the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), through pharmacological inhibition of its catabolic enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), either systemically or in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) with JZL184, leads to a substantial attenuation of the rewarding effects of opioids in mice using conditioned place preference and self-administration paradigms, without altering their analgesic properties. These effects are driven by cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) within the VTA, as VTA CB1R conditional knockout counteracts JZL184’s effects. Using fiber photometry with fluorescent sensors for calcium and dopamine (DA), we find that enhancing 2-AG levels diminishes opioid reward–related nucleus accumbens (NAc) activity and DA neurotransmission. Together, these findings reveal that 2-AG diminishes the rewarding properties of opioids and provides a potential adjunctive therapeutic strategy for opioid-related analgesic treatments.",

Here, we unexpectedly find that knots can be efficiently generated in active polymer systems. When one end of an actively reptative polymer is anchored, it undergoes continual self-knotting as a result of intermittent giant conformation fluctuations and the outward reptative motion. Once a knot is formed, it migrates to the anchoring point due to a nonequilibrium ratchet effect. Moreover, when the active polymer is grafted on a passive polymer, it can function as a self-propelling soft needle to either transfer its own knots or directly braid knots on the passive polymer. We further show that these active needles can create intermolecular bridging knots between two passive polymers. Our finding highlights the nonequilibrium effects in modifying the dynamic pathways of polymer systems, which have potential applications in macromolecular topology engineering.",

A key effector of these changes is exaggerated airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell contraction to spasmogens. No drugs in clinical use effectively prevent ASM hyperresponsiveness in asthma across all severities. We find that N-cadherin, a membrane cell-cell adhesion protein up-regulated in ASM from patients with severe asthma, is required for the development of airway obstruction induced by allergic airway inflammation in mice. Inhibition of N-cadherin by ADH-1 reduced airway hyperresponsiveness independent of allergic inflammation, prevented bronchoconstriction, and actively promoted bronchodilation of airways ex vivo. ADH-1 inhibited ASM contraction by disrupting N-cadherin–δ-catenin interactions, which decreased intracellular actin remodeling. These data provide evidence for an intercellular communication pathway mediating ASM contraction and identify N-cadherin as a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting bronchoconstriction in asthma.",

Our results provide structural insights into PLCγ2 regulation that will facilitate future mechanistic studies to understand the entire activation process.",

Its application for renewable energy was revolutionized by the creation of the MenB deletion (Δ menB ) variant in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, in which phylloquinone is replaced by plastoquinone-9 with a low binding affinity. This permits its exchange with exogenous quinones covalently coupled to dihydrogen catalysts that bind with high affinity, thereby converting PS I into a stable solar fuel catalyst. Here, we reveal the 2.03-Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of a recent MenB variant of PS I. The quinones and their binding environment are analyzed in the context of previous biophysical data, thereby enabling a protocol to solve future PS I hybrids and constructs from this genetically tractable cyanobacterium.",

An example is the carboxysome, a bacterial microcompartment for CO 2 fixation. The carboxysome uses a polyhedral protein shell made of hexamers, pentamers, and trimers to encapsulate Rubisco, increasing CO 2 levels near Rubisco to enhance carboxylation. Despite their role in the global carbon cycle, the molecular mechanisms behind carboxysome shell assembly remain unclear. Here, we present a structural characterization of α-carboxysome shells generated from recombinant systems, which contain all shell proteins and the scaffolding protein CsoS2. Atomic-resolution cryo–electron microscopy of the shell assemblies, with a maximal size of 54 nm, unveil diverse assembly interfaces between shell proteins, detailed interactions of CsoS2 with shell proteins to drive shell assembly, and the formation of heterohexamers and heteropentamers by different shell protein paralogs, facilitating the assembly of larger empty shells. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the construction principles of α-carboxysome shells and the role of CsoS2 in governing α-carboxysome assembly and functionality.",

By combining in vivo 19 F-MR molecular imaging, we investigate the immunological effects of a single low-dose PFCE-C25 NEs in multiple murine lung cancer models, including human immune system (HIS) mouse models, and validated its immunological effects in human TDLNs. The nebulization therapy with PFCE-C25 NEs demonstrated a notable and enduring maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in TDLNs, leading to systemic immune responses, prolonged survival, the establishment of immune memory, and resistance to tumor rechallenge.

For example, surface phonon modes in quantum paraelectrics are thought to be essential in facilitating interfacial superconductivity. However, detecting these modes, especially below 1 terahertz, is challenging because of limited sampling volumes and the need for high spectroscopic resolution. Here, we report surface soft transverse optical (TO1) phonon dynamics in KTaO 3 and SrTiO 3 by surface-sensitive spintronic terahertz spectroscopy that can sense the collective modes only a few nanometers deep from the surface. In KTaO 3 , the TO1 mode softens and sharpens with decreasing temperature, leveling off at 0.7 terahertz. In contrast, this mode in SrTiO 3 broadens substantially below the quantum paraelectric crossover and coincides with the hardening of a sub–milli–electron volt phonon mode related to the antiferrodistortive transition. These observations that deviate from their bulk properties may have implications for interfacial superconductivity and ferroelectricity. The developed technique opens opportunities for sensing low-energy surface collective excitations.",

Under salt stress, cortical microtubules undergo a depolymerization-reassembly process to promote the biosynthesis of stress-adaptive cellulose, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying this process are still largely unknown. In this study, we reveal that FERONIA (FER), a potential cell wall sensor, interacts with COMPANION OF CELLULOSE SYNTHASE1 (CC1) and its closest homolog, CC2, two proteins that are required for cortical microtubule reassembly under salt stress. Biochemical data indicate that FER phosphorylates CC1 on multiple residues in its second and third hydrophobic microtubule-binding regions and that these phosphorylations modulate CC1 trafficking and affect the ability of CC1 to engage with microtubules. Furthermore, CC1 phosphorylation level is altered upon exposure to salt stress, which coincides with the changes of microtubule organization.

However, the ability to control QGP remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that QGP at the LaAlO 3 /KTaO 3 (110) interface can be efficiently modulated by the orientation of applied magnetic field: With a perpendicular field, an anomalous QGP emerges in the low-temperature regime, characterized by a decreasing critical field as temperature lowers; conversely, with a parallel field, a normal QGP arises, where the critical field increases with decreasing temperature. Such opposite characteristics stem from the controllable quantum fluctuations and conductivity corrections under distinct magnetic field orientations. Furthermore, we show the effective tuning of the phase boundary by electrostatic gating, attributed to the gate-controlled quantum fluctuations. These findings not only demonstrate how to experimentally manipulate QGP but also provide a comprehensive understanding of how quantum fluctuations can effectively modulate QGP.",

In the particular case of Cys-loop receptor channels, five short stretches of amino acids, one per subunit, link the extracellular and transmembrane domains in such a way that the ion permeability of the latter and the affinity for neurotransmitters of the former become tied to each other. Here, using direct functional approaches, we set out to understand the molecular bases of this crucial interdependence through the characterization of total loss-of-current mutations at the interface between domains. Our results indicate that domain−domain proximity plays a previously unnoticed critical role inasmuch as inserting a single residue in each linker rendered the two domains independent of each other. In marked contrast, loss-of-current mutations that leave the linkers’ length unaltered did not compromise the interdomain coupling, but rather, seemed to cause agonist-bound closed receptors to desensitize without appreciably opening.",

The impact of these interactions is to distort DNA structural conformations, and these are also revealed with atomic force microscopy. The importance of the 5′-flanking DNA is further emphasized with reporter gene assays and comparisons with canonical response elements. Overall, the study reveals the inadequacy of current definitions of the DNA hormone response element (HRE) and suggests that future descriptions of the HRE include the conserved distal DNA sequences.

We used a high-throughput microfluidic platform combined with a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify regulators of VISTA levels. Functional characterization showed that the knockdown of these hits diminished VISTA surface levels on macrophages and sustained an antitumor phenotype. Furthermore, targeting of both AhR and IRAK1 in mouse models overcame resistance to ICB treatment. Tumor immunophenotyping indicated that infiltration of cytotoxic CD8 + cells, natural killer cells, and antitumor macrophages was substantially increased in treated mice. Collectively, AhR and IRAK1 are implicated as regulators of VISTA that coordinate a multifaceted barrier to antitumor immune responses.",

With hundreds of well-recorded events, we verify that PmP is observable and develop a technique to identify and pick P-PmP differential times with high confidence.

We report a universal strategy for decoupling the stiffness and extensibility of single-network elastomers. Instead of using linear polymers as network strands, we use foldable bottlebrush polymers, which feature a collapsed backbone grafted with many linear side chains. Upon elongation, the collapsed backbone unfolds to release stored length, enabling remarkable extensibility. By contrast, the network elastic modulus is inversely proportional to network strand mass and is determined by the side chains. We validate this concept by creating single-network elastomers with nearly constant Young’s modulus (30 kilopascals) while increasing tensile breaking strain by 40-fold, from 20 to 800%. We show that this strategy applies to networks of different polymer species and topologies.

Systematic interrogation of the five E protein binding elements (EPE1–5) in the Tcf7 enhancer region showed lineage-specific utilization. Specifically, loss-of-function analysis revealed that only EPE3 plays a critical role in supporting αβ T cell development, while EPE1, 3, and 5 regulate the γδ T cell maturation and functional cell fate decision. The importance of EPE3 in supporting both lineages may stem from its unique capacity to interact with the Tcf7 transcriptional start site.

Here, we identify an essential regulator of Drosophila thoracic flight muscle development, the Hox TF Antennapedia (Antp). Correcting a long-standing belief that flight muscle development occurs without the input of Hox TFs, we show that Antp intervenes at several stages of flight muscle development, from the establishment of the progenitor pool in the embryo to myoblast differentiation in the early pupa. Furthermore, the precisely regulated clearance of Hox in the developing flight muscle fibers is required to allow for fibrillar muscle fate diversification, setting these muscles apart from all other adult tubular muscle types.",

Despite profound implications for the Arctic climate system and marine ecosystems, the primary drivers of this process remain debated. One hypothesis suggested that alternating phases of the atmospheric Arctic Dipole may have mitigated recent atlantification. Here, we use high-resolution model simulations to disentangle the main contributors to atlantification in the Arctic basin. We show that the decline in Arctic sea ice was the dominant driver, while wind variability associated with the Arctic Dipole played a minor role, contributing slightly rather than mitigating the process. The positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation also made a relatively small contribution. Although recent changes in atmospheric circulation over the Greenland Sea tended to reduce warm water inflow through the Fram Strait, this cooling effect on the Arctic Atlantic Water layer was outweighed by the warming induced by sea ice decline.",

We compiled a database of seawater MeSH concentrations, identified their statistical predictors, and produced monthly fields of global marine MeSH emissions adding to DMS emissions. Implemented into a global chemistry-climate model, MeSH emissions increase the sulfate aerosol burden by 30 to 70% over the Southern Ocean and enhance the aerosol cooling effect while depleting atmospheric oxidants and increasing DMS lifetime and transport.

It remains little understood about how proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1α/tumor necrosis factor–α/C1q (ITC), often elevated in neurodegenerative diseases, alter astrocyte-secreted signals and their effects in disease pathogenesis. By selectively isolating astrocyte exosomes (A-Exo.) and employing cell type–specific exosome reporter mice, our current study showed that ITC cytokines significantly reduced A-Exo. secretion and decreased spreading of focally labeled A-Exo. in diseased SOD1G93A mice. Our results also found that A-Exo. were minimally associated with misfolded SOD1 and elicited no toxicity to mouse spinal and human iPSC–derived motor neurons. In contrast, A-Exo. were neuroprotective against excitotoxicity, which was completely diminished by ITC cytokines and partially abolished by SOD1G93A expression. Subsequent proteomic characterization of A-Exo. and genetic analysis identified that surface expression of glial-specific HepaCAM preferentially mediates A-Exo’s axon protection effect.

          "abstract": "As versatile ligands with extraordinary coordination capabilities, RPH 2 (R = alkyl or aryl) are rarely used in constructing metal nanoclusters due to their volatility, toxicity, spontaneous flammability, and susceptibility to oxidation. In this work, we designed a primary and tertiary phosphorus-bound diphosphine chelator (2-Ph 2 PC 6 H 4 PH 2 ) to create ultrastable silver nanoclusters with metallic aromaticity. By controlling the deprotonation rate of 2-Ph 2 PC 6 H 4 PH 2 and adjusting the templates, we successfully synthesized two near-infrared emissive nanoclusters, Ag30 and Ag32 , which have analogous icosidodecahedral Ag 30 shells with an I h symmetry. Deprotonated ligand (2-Ph 2 P α C 6 H 4 P β 2− ) exhibits a coordination mode of μ 5 -η 1 (P β ),η 2 (P α ,P β ), which endows a unique metallic aromaticity to Ag30 and Ag32 . The solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes based on Ag30 achieve an external quantum efficiency of 15.1%, representing the breakthrough in application of silver nanoclusters to near-infrared–emitting devices. This work represents a special ligand system for synthesizing ligand-protected coinage metal nanoclusters and opens up horizons of creating nanoclusters with distinct geometries and metal aromaticity.",

We conducted a meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies to examine the associations between delivery mode and blood DNA methylation at birth and its persistence in early childhood. Participants were from 19 pregnancy cohorts (9833 term newborns) and 6 pediatric cohorts (2429 children aged 6 to 10 years). We identified six CpGs in cord blood associated with cesarean delivery (effect size range: 0.4 to 0.7%, P &lt; 1.0 × 10 −7 ): MAP2K2 (cg19423175), LIM2 (cg01500140), CNP (cg13917614), BLM (cg18247172), RASA3 (cg22348356), and RUNX3 (cg20674490), independent of cell proportions and other confounders. In childhood, none of these CpGs were associated with cesarean delivery, and no additional CpGs were identified. Delivery mode was associated with cell proportions at birth but not in childhood. Further research is needed to elucidate cesarean delivery’s molecular influence on offspring health.",

We compile data on contemporary fluvial suspended sediment yield (SSY) and 12 environmental proxies from 151 rivers in High Mountain Asia surrounding the Tibetan Plateau. We demonstrate that glaciers exert a first-order control on fluvial SSYs, with high precipitation nonlinearly amplifying their role, especially in high–glacier cover basins. We find a bidirectional response to vegetation’s influence on SSY in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau and Tien Shan and identify that the two interacting factors of precipitation and vegetation cover explain 54% of the variability in SSY, reflecting the divergent roles of vegetation in promoting biogenic-weathering versus slope stabilization across bioclimatic zones. The competing interactions between glaciers, ecosystems, and climate in delivering suspended sediment have important implications for predicting carbon and nutrient exports and water quality in response to future climate change.",

The pan-serotype DENV inhibitor JNJ-A07 has shown potent activity in a mouse model. It remains unknown whether an antiviral drug ingested by mosquitoes could inhibit virus replication and thus reduce transmission to other hosts. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of JNJ-A07 when administered in the blood meal to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. JNJ-A07 blocked DENV-2 transmission by the mosquitoes in both pre-exposure and post-exposure settings. In addition, JNJ-A07 remained in the mosquito bodies for 7 days after blood meal. Reductions of DENV systemic infection in the mosquitoes suggested a potential for decreased proportions of DENV outbreaks in a simulated environment when the mosquitoes ingested JNJ-A07 via the blood meal.",

          "abstract": "Peripheral inflammation is closely related to the pathogenesis of sickness behaviors and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. The circumventricular organs (CVOs) are important brain sites to perceive peripheral inflammatory signals, but few studies have reported their role in inflammation-induced anxiety or depression. Using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced inflammation, we identified a previously unreported role of the subfornical organ (SFO), one of the CVOs, in combating inflammation-induced anxiety. LPS treatment induced anxiety-like and sickness behaviors in mice. Although both the SFO and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (a CVO) neurons were activated after LPS treatment, only manipulating SFO neurons modulated LPS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Activating or inhibiting SFO neurons alleviated or aggravated LPS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. In addition, SFO exerted this effect through glutamatergic projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Manipulating SFO neurons did not affect LPS-induced sickness behaviors. Thus, we uncovered an active role of SFO neurons in counteracting peripheral inflammation-induced anxiety.",

Here, we reconstruct the history of ocean interior acidification over the industrial era on the basis of observation-based estimates of the accumulation of anthropogenic carbon. Across the top 100 meters and from 1800 to 2014, the saturation state of aragonite (Ω arag ) and pH = −log[H + ] decreased by more than 0.6 and 0.1, respectively, with nearly 50% of the progression occurring over the past 20 years. While the magnitude of the Ω arag change decreases uniformly with depth, the magnitude of the [H + ] increase exhibits a distinct maximum in the upper thermocline. Since 1800, the saturation horizon (Ω arag = 1) shoaled by more than 200 meters, approaching the euphotic zone in several regions, especially in the Southern Ocean, and exposing many organisms to corrosive conditions.",

While combination ICB has improved response rate and progression-free survival, it substantially increases toxicity. Biomarkers to distinguish patients who would benefit from combination therapy versus aPD-1 remain elusive. We analyzed whole-exome sequencing of pretreatment tumors from four cohorts ( n = 140) of ICB-naïve patients treated with aPD-1. High genomic heterogeneity and low ploidy robustly identified patients intrinsically resistant to aPD-1. To establish clinically actionable predictions, we optimized and validated a predictive model using ploidy and heterogeneity to confidently identify (90% PPV) patients with intrinsic resistance to and worse survival on aPD-1. We further observed that three of seven (43%) patients predicted to be intrinsically resistant to single-agent PD-1 ICB responded to combination ICB, suggesting that these patients may benefit disproportionately from combination ICB. These findings highlight the importance of heterogeneity and ploidy, nominating an approach toward clinical actionability.",

          "abstract": "DNA repair dysregulation is a key driver of cancer development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA repair dysregulation in cancer cells is crucial for cancer development and therapies. Here, we report that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) directly methylates poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an essential enzyme involved in DNA repair, and regulates its activity. Functionally, EZH2-catalyzed methylation represses PARP1 catalytic activity, down-regulates the recruitment of x-ray repair cross-complementing group-1 to DNA lesions and its associated DNA damage repair; on the other hand, it protects the cells from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide overconsumption upon DNA damage formation. Meanwhile, EZH2-mediated methylation regulates PARP1 transcriptional and oncogenic activity, at least in part, through impairing PARP1-E2F1 interaction and E2F1 transcription factor activity. EZH2 and PARP1 inhibitors synergistically suppress prostate cancer growth. Collectively, our findings uncover an insight of EZH2 functions in fine-tuning PARP1 activity during DNA damage repair and cancer progression, which provides a rationale for combinational targeting EZH2 and PARP1 in cancer.",

Products with opposite chirality have been both obtained using the same or closely analogous chiral catalyst in good efficiency and excellent enantioselectivity, and the enantiodivergence was mainly enabled by an achiral carboxylic acid and its silver salt. Mechanistic studies revealed the origin of the enantiodivergence ascribable to the switch of the enantiodetermining step (alkyne insertion versus protonolysis) under acid control, which constitutes a previously unidentified working mode of enantiodivergence by leveraging two elementary steps.",

Perforation morphologies observed by electron microscopy show that a much larger network region is deformed due to sp 3 bond enhanced load sharing within and between tubes, while defects introduced by the radiation induce more bond, shell, and tube damage leading to strongly enhanced energy dissipation.",
