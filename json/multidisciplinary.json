          "authors": "Valeriia Hutskalova, Christof Sparr",
          "abstract": "Aromatic compounds are used across chemistry and materials science as a result of their stability, characteristic interactions, defined molecular shape and the numerous synthetic approaches for their synthesis by a diversity of cyclization reactions1. In contrast, the cleavage of inert aromatic carbon-carbon bonds remained largely unfeasible due to the unfavourable energetics of disrupting aromaticity on ring opening. For non-aromatic structures, alkene metathesis catalysed by transition metal alkylidenes is established as one of the most versatile carbon-carbon bond-forming and breaking reactions2,3. However, despite remarkable advancements, strategies to open aromatic compounds by metathesis remained elusive4. Here, we report aromatic ring-opening metathesis (ArROM) for the cleavage of aromatic rings, including tetraphene, naphthalene, indole, benzofuran and phenanthrene by employing Schrock-Hoveyda molybdenum catalysts. The reactions for each of the ring systems proceed through unique alkylidene intermediates. We further show the possibility for stereoselective aromatic ring-opening metathesis with exquisite catalyst control over the configuration of atropisomers. Aromatic ring-opening metathesis is therefore a viable and efficient approach to catalytically transform and interconvert various aromatics without the requirement for any reagents or photoexcitation.",

          "authors": "Shiheng Liu, Tiantian Su, Xian Xia, Z. Hong Zhou",
          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting leading to premature mortality1,2. Discovery of the DMD gene encoding dystrophin both revealed the cause of DMD and helped identify a family of at least ten dystrophin-associated proteins at the muscle cell membrane, collectively forming the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC)3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The DGC links the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, but, despite its importance, its molecular architecture has remained elusive. Here we determined the native cryo-electron microscopy structure of rabbit DGC and conducted biochemical analyses to reveal its intricate molecular configuration. An unexpected β-helix comprising β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan forms an extracellular platform that interacts with α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan and α-sarcoglycan, allowing α-dystroglycan to contact the extracellular matrix. In the membrane, sarcospan anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, while in the cytoplasm, β-dystroglycan’s juxtamembrane fragment binds dystrophin’s ZZ domain. Through these interactions, the DGC links laminin 2 to intracellular actin. Additionally, dystrophin’s WW domain, along with its EF-hand 1 domain, interacts with α-dystrobrevin. A disease-causing mutation mapping to the WW domain weakens this interaction, as confirmed by deletion of the WW domain in biochemical assays. Our findings rationalize more than 110 mutations affecting single residues associated with various muscular dystrophy subtypes and contribute to ongoing therapeutic developments, including protein restoration, upregulation of compensatory genes and gene replacement.",

          "authors": "Gabriel N. Santos-Durán, Rory L. Cooper, Ebrahim Jahanbakhsh, Grigorii Timin, Michel C. Milinkovitch",
          "abstract": "Amniote integumentary appendages constitute a diverse group of micro-organs, including feathers, hair and scales. These structures typically develop as genetically controlled units 1 , the spatial patterning of which emerges from a self-organized chemical Turing system 2,3 with integrated mechanical feedback 4,5 . The seemingly purely mechanical patterning of polygonal crocodile head scales provides an exception to this paradigm 6 . However, the nature and origin of the mechanical stress field driving this patterning remain unclear. Here, using precise in ovo intravenous injections of epidermal growth factor protein, we generate Nile crocodile embryos with substantially convoluted head skin, as well as hatchlings with smaller polygonal head scales resembling those of caimans. We then use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to quantify embryonic tissue-layer geometry, collagen architecture and the spatial distribution of proliferating cells. Using these data, we build a phenomenological three-dimensional mechanical growth model that recapitulates both normal and experimentally modified patterning of crocodile head scales. Our experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that crocodile head scales self-organize through compressive folding, originating from near-homogeneous skin growth with differential stiffness of the dermis versus the epidermis. Our experiments and theoretical morphospace analyses indicate that variation in embryonic growth and material properties of skin layers provides a simple evolutionary mechanism that produces a diversity of head-scale patterns among crocodilian species.",

However, the scope and purpose of this anti-commensal immune program are not well defined, limiting our ability to harness it therapeutically. Here, we show that this colonist also induces a potent, durable, and specific antibody response that is conserved in humans and non-human primates. A series of S. epidermidis cell-wall mutants revealed that the cell surface protein Aap is a predominant target. By colonizing mice with a strain of S. epidermidis in which the parallel β-helix domain of Aap is replaced by tetanus toxin fragment C, we elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response that protects mice against a lethal challenge. A similar strain of S. epidermidis expressing an Aap-SpyCatcher chimera can be conjugated with recombinant immunogens; the resulting labeled commensal elicits high antibody titers under conditions of physiologic colonization, including a robust IgA response in the nasal and pulmonary mucosa. Thus, immunity to a common skin colonist involves a coordinated T and B cell response, the latter of which can be redirected against pathogens as a novel form of topical vaccination.",

          "abstract": "The ring-shaped chaperonin T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC; also known as chaperonin containing TCP-1, CCT) is an ATP-driven protein-folding machine that is essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis 1,2 . Its dysfunction is related to cancer and neurodegenerative disease 3,4 . Despite its importance, how TRiC works in the cell remains unclear. Here we structurally analysed the architecture, conformational dynamics and spatial organization of the chaperonin TRiC in human cells using cryo-electron tomography. We resolved distinctive open, closed, substrate-bound and prefoldin-associated states of TRiC, and reconstructed its duty cycle in situ. The substrate-bound open and symmetrically closed TRiC states were equally abundant. Closed TRiC containing substrate forms distinctive clusters, indicative of spatial organization. Translation inhibition did not fundamentally change the distribution of duty cycle intermediates, but reduced substrate binding for all states as well as cluster formation. From our in-cell structures, we identified the programmed cell death protein 5 (PDCD5) as an interactor that specifically binds to almost all open but not closed TRiC, in a position that is compatible with both substrate and prefoldin binding. Our data support a model in which TRiC functions at near full occupancy to fold newly synthesized proteins inside cells. Defining the TRiC cycle and function inside cells lays the foundation to understand its dysfunction during cancer and neurodegeneration.",

          "title": "Lithium extraction from low-quality brines",
          "authors": "Sixie Yang, Yigang Wang, Hui Pan, Ping He, Haoshen Zhou",
          "abstract": "In the quest for environmental sustainability, the rising demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies has substantially increased the need for efficient lithium extraction methods. Traditional lithium production, relying on geographically concentrated hard-rock ores and salar brines, is associated with considerable energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and land disturbance, thereby posing notable environmental and supply chain challenges. On the other hand, low-quality brines—such as those found in sedimentary waters, geothermal fluids, oilfield-produced waters, seawater and some salar brines and salt lakes—hold large potential owing to their extensive reserves and widespread geographical distribution. However, extracting lithium from these sources presents technical challenges owing to low lithium concentrations and high magnesium-to-lithium ratios. This Review explores the latest advances and continuing challenges in lithium extraction from these demanding yet promising sources, covering a variety of methods, including precipitation, solvent extraction, sorption, membrane-based separation and electrochemical-based separation. Furthermore, we share perspectives on the future development of lithium extraction technologies, framed within the basic principles of separation processes. The aim is to encourage the development of innovative extraction methods capable of making use of the substantial potential of low-quality brines.",

          "abstract": "The unusual properties of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have sparked considerable research interest 1–13 . However, despite the dedication of intensive experimental efforts and the proposal of several possible pairing mechanisms 14–24 , the origin of its superconductivity remains elusive. Here, by utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometre spatial resolution, we reveal flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG, where MATBG is unaligned with its hexagonal boron nitride substrate 11 . These replicas show uniform energy spacing, approximately 150 ± 15 meV apart, indicative of strong electron–boson coupling. Strikingly, these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems, either when MATBG is aligned to hexagonal boron nitride or when TBG deviates from the magic angle. Calculations suggest that the formation of these flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG are attributed to the strong coupling between flat-band electrons and an optical phonon mode at the graphene K point, facilitated by intervalley scattering. These findings, although they do not necessarily put electron–phonon coupling as the main driving force for the superconductivity in MATBG, unravel the electronic structure inherent in superconducting MATBG, thereby providing crucial information for understanding the unusual electronic landscape from which its superconductivity is derived.",

          "abstract": "During translation initiation, mRNA molecules must be identified and activated for loading into a ribosome1,2,3. In this rate-limiting step, the heterotrimeric protein eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F must recognize and productively interact with the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA and subsequently activate the message1,2,3. Despite its fundamental, regulatory role in gene expression, the molecular events underlying cap recognition and mRNA activation remain unclear3. Here we generate a single-molecule fluorescence imaging system to examine the dynamics with which eIF4F discriminates productive and non-productive locations on full-length, native mRNA molecules. At the single-molecule level, we observe stochastic sampling of eIF4F along the length of the mRNA and identify allosteric communication between the eIF4F subunits that ultimately drive cap-recognition and subsequent activation of the message. Our experiments uncover functions for each subunit of eIF4F and we conclude by presenting a model for mRNA activation that precisely defines the composition of the activated message. This model provides a general framework for understanding how mRNA molecules may be discriminated from one another and how other RNA-binding proteins may control the efficiency of translation initiation.",

          "abstract": "Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials constructed by corner-sharing tetrahedra (SiO4 and AlO4), with many industrial applications as ion exchangers, adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts1,2,3,4. However, the presence of micropores impedes the use of zeolites in areas dealing with bulky substrates. Introducing extrinsic mesopores, that is, intercrystal/intracrystal mesopores, in zeolites is a solution to overcome the diffusion barrier5,6,7,8. Still, those extrinsic mesopores are generally disordered and non-uniform; moreover, acidity and crystallinity are always, to some extent, impaired9. Thus, synthesizing thermally stable zeolites with intrinsic mesopores that are of uniform size and crystallographically connected with micropores, denoted here as intrinsic mesoporous zeolite, is highly desired but still not achieved. Here we report ZMQ-1 (Zeolitic Materials, Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, no. 1), an aluminosilicate zeolite with an intersecting intrinsic meso-microporous channel system delimited by 28 × 10 × 10-rings, in which the 28-ring has a free diameter of 22.76 Å × 11.83 Å, which reaches the mesopore domain. ZMQ-1 has high thermal and hydrothermal stability with tunable framework Si/Al molar ratios. ZMQ-1 is the first aluminosilicate zeolite with an intrinsic meso-microporous channel system. The Brønsted acidity of ZMQ-1 imparts high activity and unique selectivity in the catalytic cracking of heavy oil. The position of the organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) used for ZMQ-1 synthesis was determined from three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) data, which shows the unique structure-directing role of the OSDA in the formation of the intrinsic meso-microporous zeolite. This provides an incentive for preparing other stable mesopore-containing zeolites.",

They synthesize polypeptides using peptidyl carrier proteins that shuttle each amino acid through modular loading, modification and elongation2 steps, and remain challenging to structurally characterize, owing in part to the inherent dynamics of their multi-domain and multi-modular architectures3. Here we have developed site-selective crosslinking probes to conformationally constrain and resolve the interactions between carrier proteins and their partner enzymatic domains4,5. We apply tetrazine click chemistry to trap the condensation of two carrier protein substrates within the active site of the condensation domain that unites the first two modules of tyrocidine biosynthesis and report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this complex. Together with the X-ray crystal structure of the first carrier protein crosslinked to its epimerization domain, these structures highlight captured intermodular recognition events and define the processive movement of a carrier protein from one catalytic step to the next. Characterization of these structural relationships remains central to understanding the molecular details of these unique synthetases and critically informs future synthetic biology design of these pathways.",

          "abstract": "Natural tissues are composed of diverse cells and extracellular materials whose arrangements across several length scales—from subcellular lengths1 (micrometre) to the organ scale2 (centimetre)—regulate biological functions. Tissue-fabrication methods have progressed to large constructs, for example, through stereolithography3 and nozzle-based bioprinting4,5, and subcellular resolution through subtractive photoablation6,7,8. However, additive bioprinting struggles with sub-nozzle/voxel features9 and photoablation is restricted to small volumes by prohibitive heat generation and time10. Building across several length scales with temperature-sensitive, water-based soft biological matter has emerged as a critical challenge, leaving large classes of biological motifs—such as multiscalar vascular trees with varying calibres—inaccessible with present technologies11,12. Here we use gallium-based engineered sacrificial capillary pumps for evacuation (ESCAPE) during moulding to generate multiscalar structures in soft natural hydrogels, achieving both cellular-scale (<10 µm) and millimetre-scale features. Decoupling the biomaterial of interest from the process of constructing the geometry allows non-biocompatible tools to create the initial geometry. As an exemplar, we fabricated branched, cell-laden vascular trees in collagen, spanning approximately 300-µm arterioles down to the microvasculature (roughly ten times smaller). The same approach can micropattern the inner surface of vascular walls with topographical cues to orient cells in 3D and engineer fine structures such as vascular malformations. ESCAPE moulding enables the fabrication of multiscalar forms in soft biomaterials, paving the way for a wide range of tissue architectures that were previously inaccessible in vitro.",

However, due to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size-frequency distribution —which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth—varies significantly among models10−14. Here, we report 138 detections of the smallest asteroids (⪆ 10 m) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST’s infrared capabilities covering the asteroids’ emission peaks15 and synthetic tracking techniques16−18. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the objects’ distances and phase angles using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes via radiometric techniques. Their size-frequency distribution exhibits a break at ~ 100 m (debiased cumulative slopes of q = − 2.66 ± 0.60 and − 0.97 ± 0.14 for diameters smaller and larger than ~ 100 m, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from multiple asteroid families —most likely Nysa, Polana and Massalia— according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through additional long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decameter-scale asteroids across the sky, probing individual asteroid families19 and the source regions of meteorites13,14 “in-situ”.",

As with all scientific endeavors, we advocate for rigorous experimental designs tailored to explicit scientific questions, and transparent methodologies and data sharing, to provide useful knowledge for both current research practices and for developing regulatory standards.",

          "abstract": "Quantum error correction [1, 2, 3, 4] provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here, we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code, and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of \\(\\varLambda \\mathrm{=2.14}\\pm 0.02\\) when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143% ± 0.003% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit’s lifetime by a factor of \\(2.4\\pm 0.3\\). Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 μs at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 μs. We also run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or \\(3\\)\\(\\times \\)\\({10}^{9}\\) cycles. Our results present device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Nanoscale detection and control of the magnetic order underpins a spectrum of condensed-matter research and device functionalities involving magnetism. The key principle involved is the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, which in ferromagnets is generated by an internal magnetization. However, the presence of a net magnetization limits device scalability and compatibility with phases, such as superconductors and topological insulators. Recently, altermagnetism has been proposed as a solution to these restrictions, as it shares the enabling time-reversal-symmetry-breaking characteristic of ferromagnetism, combined with the antiferromagnetic-like vanishing net magnetization 1–4 . So far, altermagnetic ordering has been inferred from spatially averaged probes 4–19 . Here we demonstrate nanoscale imaging of altermagnetic states from 100-nanometre-scale vortices and domain walls to 10-micrometre - scale single-domain states in manganese telluride (MnTe) 2,7,9,14–16,18,20,21 . We combine the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking sensitivity of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism 12 with magnetic linear dichroism and photoemission electron microscopy to achieve maps of the local altermagnetic ordering vector. A variety of spin configurations are imposed using microstructure patterning and thermal cycling in magnetic fields. The demonstrated detection and controlled formation of altermagnetic spin configurations paves the way for future experimental studies across the theoretically predicted research landscape of altermagnetism, including unconventional spin-polarization phenomena, the interplay of altermagnetism with superconducting and topological phases, and highly scalable digital and neuromorphic spintronic devices 3,14,22–24 .",

          "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies with antibodies blocking immune checkpoint molecules are clinically active across multiple cancer entities and have markedly improved cancer treatment1. Yet, response rates are still limited, and tumour progression commonly occurs2. Soluble and cell-bound factors in the tumour microenvironment negatively affect cancer immunity. Recently, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a cytokine that is abundantly produced by many cancer types, was shown to interfere with antitumour immune response. In preclinical cancer models, GDF-15 blockade synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1-mediated checkpoint inhibition3. In a first-in-human phase 1–2a study (GDFATHER-1/2a trial, NCT04725474), patients with advanced cancers refractory to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (termed generally as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractoriness) were treated with the neutralizing anti-GDF-15 antibody visugromab (CTL-002) in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Here we show that durable and deep responses were achieved in some patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancer, two cancer entities identified as frequently immunosuppressed by GDF-15 in an in silico screening of approximately 10,000 tumour samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Increased levels of tumour infiltration, proliferation, interferon-γ-related signalling and granzyme B expression by cytotoxic T cells were observed in response to treatment. Neutralizing GDF-15 holds promise in overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer.",

          "abstract": "The complete blood count (CBC) is an important screening tool for healthy adults and a common test at periodic exams. However, results are usually interpreted relative to one-size-fits-all reference intervals1,2, undermining the precision medicine goal to tailor care for patients on the basis of their unique characteristics3,4. Here we study thousands of diverse patients at an academic medical centre and show that routine CBC indices fluctuate around stable values or setpoints5, and setpoints are patient-specific, with the typical healthy adult’s nine CBC setpoints distinguishable as a group from those of 98% of other healthy adults, and setpoint differences persist for at least 20 years. Haematological setpoints reflect a deep physiologic phenotype enabling investigation of acquired and genetic determinants of haematological regulation and its variation among healthy adults. Setpoints in apparently healthy adults were associated with significant variation in clinical risk: absolute risk of some common diseases and morbidities varied by more than 2% (heart attack and stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, osteoporosis), and absolute risk of all-cause 10 year mortality varied by more than 5%. Setpoints also define patient-specific reference intervals and personalize the interpretation of subsequent test results. In retrospective analysis, setpoints improved sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of some common conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction, iron deficiency and myeloproliferative neoplasms. This study shows CBC setpoints are sufficiently stable and patient-specific to help realize the promise of precision medicine for healthy adults.",

However, it remains uncertain how changes in daily rainfall variability are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis and growth3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we use several satellite-based vegetation indices and field observations indicative of photosynthesis and growth, and find that global annual-scale vegetation indices are sensitive to the daily frequency and intensity of rainfall, independent of the total amount of rainfall per year. Specifically, we find that satellite-based vegetation indices are sensitive to daily rainfall variability across 42 per cent of the vegetated land surfaces. On average, the sensitivity of vegetation to daily rainfall variability is almost as large (95 per cent) as the sensitivity of vegetation to annual rainfall totals. Moreover, we find that wet-day frequency and intensity are projected to change with similar magnitudes and spatial extents as annual rainfall changes. Overall, our findings suggest that daily rainfall variability and its trends are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis, with potential implications for the carbon cycle and food security.",

Disruptive acceleration of this molecule-building strategy broadly unlocks its functional potential and requires the integration of many new assembly chemistries. Although recent advances in high-throughput chemistry4,5,6 can speed up the development of appropriate synthetic methods, for example, in selecting appropriate chemical reaction conditions from the vast range of potential options, equivalent high-throughput analytical methods are needed. Here we report a streamlined approach for the rapid, quantitative analysis of chemical reactions by mass spectrometry. The intrinsic fragmentation features of chemical building blocks generalize the analyses of chemical reactions, allowing sub-second readouts of reaction outcomes. Central to this advance was identifying that starting material fragmentation patterns function as universal barcodes for downstream product analysis by mass spectrometry. Combining these features with acoustic droplet ejection mass spectrometry7,8 we could eliminate slow chromatographic steps and continuously evaluate chemical reactions in multiplexed formats. This enabled the assignment of reaction conditions to molecules derived from ultrahigh-throughput chemical synthesis experiments. More generally, these results indicate that fragmentation features inherent to chemical synthesis can empower rapid data-rich experimentation.",

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that encode various structural and non-structural proteins, including those critical for viral RNA replication and evasion from innate immunity5. Here we report the discovery and development of a first-in-class non-covalent small-molecule inhibitor of the viral guanine-N7 methyltransferase (MTase) NSP14. High-throughput screening identified RU-0415529, which inhibited SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 by forming a unique ternary S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)-bound complex. Hit-to-lead optimization of RU-0415529 resulted in TDI-015051 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 61 pM and a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 11 nM, inhibiting virus infection in a cell-based system. TDI-015051 also inhibited viral replication in primary small airway epithelial cells and in a transgenic mouse model of SARS CoV-2 infection with an efficacy comparable with the FDA-approved reversible covalent protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir6.

          "abstract": "Pre-eclampsia is a placental disorder that affects 3–5% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity worldwide1,2. With no drug available to slow disease progression, engineering ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for extrahepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery to the placenta is an attractive therapeutic option for pre-eclampsia. Here we use high-throughput screening to evaluate a library of 98 LNP formulations in vivo and identify a placenta-tropic LNP (LNP 55) that mediates more than 100-fold greater mRNA delivery to the placenta in pregnant mice than a formulation based on the Food and Drug Administration-approved Onpattro LNP (DLin-MC3-DMA)3. We propose an endogenous targeting mechanism based on β2-glycoprotein I adsorption that enables LNP delivery to the placenta. In both inflammation- and hypoxia-induced models of pre-eclampsia, a single administration of LNP 55 encapsulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA resolves maternal hypertension until the end of gestation. In addition, with our VEGF mRNA LNP 55 therapeutic, we demonstrate improvements in fetal health and partially restore placental vasculature, the local and systemic immune landscape and serum levels of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, a clinical biomarker of pre-eclampsia1. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of this mRNA LNP platform for treating placental disorders such as pre-eclampsia.",

          "abstract": "The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) has a crucial role in maintaining cell membrane stability and integrity by connecting the intracellular cytoskeleton with the surrounding extracellular matrix1,2,3. Dysfunction of dystrophin and its associated proteins results in muscular dystrophy, a disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration4,5. Despite the important roles of the DGC in physiology and pathology, its structural details remain largely unknown, hindering a comprehensive understanding of its assembly and function. Here we isolated the native DGC from mouse skeletal muscle and obtained its high-resolution structure. Our findings unveil a markedly divergent structure from the previous model of DGC assembly. Specifically, on the extracellular side, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycans co-fold to form a specialized, extracellular tower-like structure, which has a central role in complex assembly by providing binding sites for α-sarcoglycan and dystroglycan. In the transmembrane region, sarcoglycans and sarcospan flank and stabilize the single transmembrane helix of dystroglycan, rather than forming a subcomplex as previously proposed6,7,8. On the intracellular side, sarcoglycans and dystroglycan engage in assembly with the dystrophin–dystrobrevin subcomplex through extensive interaction with the ZZ domain of dystrophin. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of the structural linkage across the cell membrane and provide a foundation for the molecular interpretation of many muscular dystrophy-related mutations.",

          "abstract": "Tailored light–matter interactions in the strong coupling regime enable the manipulation and control of quantum systems with up to unit efficiency 1,2 , with applications ranging from quantum information to photochemistry 3–7 . Although strong light–matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation 8 , comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states 9,10 . However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, because of the lack of pulse-shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach reveals a strong dressing of the ionization continuum, otherwise elusive to experimental observables. The latter is exploited to achieve control of the total ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and soft X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to soft X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time.",

          "abstract": "Zorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system that protects bacteria from viral (phage) infections. Three Zorya subtypes have been discovered, each containing predicted membrane-embedded ZorAB complexes paired with soluble subunits that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD in type I Zorya systems1,2. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of Zorya defense using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics, and functional studies. We present cryo-EM structures of ZorAB and show that it shares stoichiometry and features of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. The ZorA5B2 complex contains a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan binding domain and a pentameric α-helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 70 nm into the cytoplasm. We also characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components, ZorC and ZorD, finding that they harbour DNA binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrate that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We provide evidence that ZorAB operates as a proton-driven motor that becomes activated upon sensing of phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to recruit and activate the soluble ZorC and ZorD effectors, which facilitate degradation of the phage DNA. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function as an anti-phage defense system.",

Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) combined with magnification from gravitational lensing, these low-mass galaxies can not only be detected but also be studied in detail. Here we present JWST observations of a strongly lensed galaxy at z spec = 8.296 ± 0.001, showing massive star clusters (the Firefly Sparkle) cocooned in a diffuse arc in the Canadian Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS) 1 . The Firefly Sparkle exhibits traits of a young, gas-rich galaxy in its early formation stage. The mass of the galaxy is concentrated in 10 star clusters (49–57% of total mass), with individual masses ranging from 10 5 M ⊙ to 10 6 M ⊙ . These unresolved clusters have high surface densities (&gt;10 3 M ⊙ pc − 2 ), exceeding those of Milky Way globular clusters and young star clusters in nearby galaxies. The central cluster shows a nebular-dominated spectrum, low metallicity, high gas density and high electron temperature, hinting at a top-heavy initial mass function. These observations provide our first spectrophotometric view of a typical galaxy in its early stages, in a 600-million-year-old Universe.",

Limited genomic data from these early modern humans have shown that at least two genetically distinct groups inhabited Europe, represented by Zlatý kůň, Czechia3 and Bacho Kiro, Bulgaria2. Here we deepen our understanding of early modern humans by analyzing one high-coverage genome and five low-coverage genomes from ~45,000 year-old remains from Ilsenhöhle in Ranis, Germany4, and a further high-coverage genome from Zlatý kůň. We show that distant familial relationships link the Ranis and Zlatý kůň individuals and that they were part of the same small, isolated population that represents the deepest known split from the Out-of-Africa lineage. Ranis genomes harbor Neanderthal segments that originate from a single admixture event shared with all non-Africans that we date to ~45,000-49,000 years ago. This implies that ancestors of all non-Africans sequenced to-date resided in a common population at this time, and further suggests that modern human remains older than 50,000 years from outside Africa represent different non-African populations.",

Mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolaemia, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by a marked increase in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease2. The structure of apoB100 on LDL and its interaction with LDLR are poorly understood. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of apoB100 on LDL bound to the LDLR and a nanobody complex, which can form a C2-symmetric, higher-order complex. Using local refinement, we determined high-resolution structures of the interfaces between apoB100 and LDLR. One binding interface is formed between several small-ligand-binding modules of LDLR and a series of basic patches that are scattered along a β-belt formed by apoB100, encircling LDL. The other binding interface is formed between the β-propeller domain of LDLR and the N-terminal domain of apoB100. Our results reveal how both interfaces are involved in LDL dimer formation, and how LDLR cycles between LDL- and self-bound conformations. In addition, known mutations in either apoB100 or LDLR, associated with high levels of LDL-C, are located at the LDL–LDLR interface.",

Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), one of the largest proteins in the genome, is the primary structural and functional component of LDL, yet its size and complex lipid associations have posed major challenges for structural studies3. Here we present the first structure of apoB100 resolved to sub-nanometer resolution in most regions using an integrative approach of cryo-electron microscopy, AlphaFold24, and molecular dynamics-based refinement5. The structure consists of a large globular N-terminal domain and a ~61 nm long continuous amphipathic β-sheet that wraps around the LDL particle like a belt. Distributed quasi-symmetrically across the two sides of the “β-belt” are 9 strategically located inter-strand inserts that extend across the lipid surface to provide additional structural support through a network of long-range interactions. We further compare our structure to a comprehensive list of >200 intramolecular crosslinks and find close agreement between the two. These results suggest a mechanism for how the various domains of apoB100 act in concert to maintain LDL shape and cohesion across a range of particle sizes. More generally, they advance our fundamental understanding of LDL synthesis, form and function and will help accelerate the design of potential new therapeutics.",

The key chemical step in these biosyntheses is amide bond formation between aminoacyl building blocks, catalyzed by the condensation (C) domain 3. There has been much debate over the mechanism of this reaction 3-12. NRPS condensation has been difficult to fully characterize because it is one of many successive reactions in the NRPS synthetic cycle and because the canonical substrates are each attached transiently as thioesters to mobile carrier domains, which are often both contained in the same very flexible protein as the C domain. We have produced a dimodular NRPS protein in two parts, modified each with appropriate non-hydrolysable substrate analogs 13,14 assembled the two parts with protein ligation 15, and solved structures of the substrate- and product-bound states. The structures show precise orientation of the megaenzyme preparing the nucleophilic attack of its key chemical step, and allow biochemical assays and quantum mechanical simulations to precisely interrogate the reaction. These data suggest that NRPSs C domains use a concerted reaction mechanism, where the active site histidine likely serves not a as general base, but as a crucial stabilizing hydrogen bond acceptor for the developing ammonium.",

          "abstract": "Io experiences tidal deformation due to its eccentric orbit around Jupiter, which provides a primary energy source for Io’s ongoing volcanic activity and infrared emission1. The amount of tidal energy dissipated within Io is enormous and has been hypothesized to support the large-scale melting of Io’s interior and the formation of a global subsurface magma ocean. If Io has a shallow global magma ocean, its tidal deformation would be much larger than in the case of a more rigid, mostly solid interior2. Here we report the measurement of Io’s tidal deformation, quantified by the gravitational tidal Love number k2, enabled by two recent flybys of the Juno spacecraft. By combining Juno3,4 and Galileo5-7 Doppler data from the Deep Space Network and astrometric observations, we recover Re(k2) of 0.125±0.047 (1σ) and the tidal dissipation parameter Q of 11.4±3.6 (1σ). These measurements confirm that a shallow global magma ocean in Io does not exist and are consistent with Io having a mostly solid mantle2. Our results indicate that tidal forces do not universally create global magma oceans, which may be prevented from forming due to rapid melt ascent, intrusion, and eruption8,9, so even strong tidal heating – like that expected on several known exoplanets and super-Earths10 – may not guarantee the formation of magma oceans on moons or planetary bodies.",

          "abstract": "The microbiota colonizes each barrier site and broadly controls host physiology1. However, when uncontrolled, microbial colonists can also promote inflammation and induce systemic infection2. The unique strategies employed at each barrier tissue to control the coexistence of the host with its microbiota remain largely elusive. Here we uncover that, within the skin, host-microbiota symbiosis depends on the remarkable ability of the skin to act as an autonomous lymphoid organ. Notably, an encounter with a new skin commensal promotes two parallel responses, both under the control of Langerhans cells. On one hand, skin commensals induce the formation of classical germinal centers within the lymph node associated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibody responses. On the other hand, microbial colonization also leads to the development of tertiary lymphoid organs within the skin that can locally sustain IgG2b and IgG2c responses. These phenomena are supported by the ability of regulatory T cells to convert into T follicular helper cells. Skin autonomous production of antibodies is sufficient to control local microbial biomass, as well as subsequent systemic infection with the same microbe. Collectively, these results reveal a striking compartmentalization of humoral responses to the microbiota allowing for control of both microbial symbiosis and potential pathogenesis.",

These dynamic regulatory circuits that respond to extracellular cues in primary human cells remain poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in T cells, where distinct lineages must respond to diverse signals to mount effective immune responses and maintain homeostasis 4–8 . Here we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4 + T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL-2Rα, a canonical marker of T cell activation transiently expressed by pro-inflammatory effector T cells and constitutively expressed by anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells where it is required for fitness 9–11 . Approximately 90% of identified regulators of IL-2Rα had effects that varied across cell types and/or stimulation states, including a subset that even had opposite effects across conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits, we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. MED12 — a component of the Mediator complex — serves as a dynamic orchestrator of key regulators, controlling expression of distinct sets of regulators in different T cell contexts. Immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry revealed that MED12 interacts with the histone methylating COMPASS complex. MED12 was required for histone methylation and expression of genes encoding key context-specific regulators, including the rest maintenance factor KLF2 and the versatile regulator MYC. CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted the cell-state transitions between rest and activation and protected from activation-induced cell death. Overall, this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across conditions to define dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.",

However, the treatments often later stop working and tumours resume their growth. Cancers that resist these therapies also frequently become unresponsive to immunotherapies, which harness immune cells to target tumours — in a phenomenon called cross-resistance. Writing in Nature, Elewaut et al.1 use a mouse model to shed light on a mechanism that underlies cross-resistance in a type of skin cancer called melanoma2.",

One way around this problem is to study other galaxies that resemble the Milky Way. Writing in Nature, Mowla et al.3 used observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to investigate a distant galaxy with a mass that matches the expected mass of the Milky Way shortly after its formation in the early Universe.",

In the first stage of pre-eclampsia, incomplete placental development leads to compromised blood flow through the vasculature and a lack of oxygen in placental tissue. In the second stage, the placenta releases vascular toxins, such as the protein sFlt-1 — a circulating inhibitor of the signalling protein VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). These toxins cause dysfunction of the endothelial cells that line maternal blood vessels and lead to the clinical syndrome of pre-eclampsia. Levels of sFlt-1 and related biomarkers in the blood can now be measured and are routinely used for early diagnosis in women with suspected pre-eclampsia2–4.",

Yet this standard approach overlooks a crucial point — many blood measurements (biomarkers) are highly individualized and regulated around unique stable values called setpoints, which differ between people. For many people, their ‘normal’ blood values fall within a narrow range — one that is much smaller than the population-based reference range1. Writing in Nature, Foy et al.2 present evidence that underscores the importance of these personalized setpoints, analysing decades of blood-test data across nine key parameters. The authors’ findings suggest that integrating personalized reference intervals into clinical diagnostics could bring about a new level of precision medicine.",

Here, in 421,889 individuals with European ancestry from the Million Veteran Program and UK Biobank, we examine how PGS of 17 neuropsychiatric traits are related to membership in 22 broad professional categories. Overall, we find statistically significant but weak (the highest odds ratio is 1.1 per PGS standard deviation) associations between most professional categories and genetic predisposition for at least one neuropsychiatric trait. Secondary analyses in UK Biobank revealed independence of these associations from observed fluid intelligence and sex-specific effects. By leveraging aggregate population trends, we identified patterns in the public interest, such as the mediating effect of education attainment on the association of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder PGS with multiple professional categories. However, at the individual level, PGS explained less than 0.5% of the variance of professional membership, and almost none after we adjusted for education and socio-economic status.",

Court-related debt can cause continuing court involvement and incarceration, not because of new crimes, but because of unpaid financial obligations. We conducted an experiment with 606 people found guilty of misdemeanors in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. Study participants were randomly selected to receive relief from all current and prior fines and fees assessed for criminal charges in the county. Fee relief reduced jail bookings 21 mo after randomization and the effect persisted over 44 mo of follow-up. Although fee relief reduced incarceration, financial sanctions had no effect on indicators of lawbreaking. Instead, the control group (who obtained no relief from fines and fees) were rearrested at significantly higher rates because of open arrest warrants for nonpayment. These results indicate the long-term and criminalizing effects of legal debt, supporting claims that financial sanctions disproportionately harm low-income defendants while contributing little to public safety.",

          "abstract": "The curious chemistry observed in microdroplets has captivated chemists in recent years and has led to an investigation into their ability to drive seemingly impossible chemistries. One particularly interesting capability of these microdroplets is their ability to accelerate reactions by several orders of magnitude. While there have been many investigations into which reactions can be accelerated by confinement within microdroplets, no study has directly compared reaction acceleration at the liquid|liquid and gas|liquid interfaces. Here, we confine glucose oxidase, one of life’s most important enzymes, to microdroplets and monitor the turnover rate of glucose by the electroactive cofactor, hexacyanoferrate (III). We use stochastic electrochemistry to monitor the collision of single femtoliter water droplets on an ultramicroelectrode. We also develop a measurement modality to robustly quantify reaction rates for femtoliter liquid aerosol droplets, where the majority of the interface is gas|liquid. We demonstrate that the gas|liquid interface accelerates enzyme turnover by over an order of magnitude over the liquid|liquid interface. This is the first apples-to-apples comparison of reaction acceleration at two distinct interfaces that indicates that the gas|liquid interface plays a central role in driving curious chemistry.",

The entire surface of vegetative cells in exponential or stationary growth phase is covered in proteinaceous arrays called S-layers, composed of Sap or EA1 protein, respectively. The Sap S-layer represents an important virulence factor and cell envelope support structure whose paracrystalline nature is essential for its function. However, the spatial organization of Sap in its lattice state remains elusive. Here, we employed cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging to obtain a map of the Sap S-layer from tubular polymers that revealed a conformational switch between the postassembly protomers and the previously available X-ray structure of the condensed monomers. To build and validate an atomic model of the lattice within this map, we used a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, X-ray crystallography, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and biophysics in an integrative structural biology approach. The Sap lattice model produced recapitulates a close-to-physiological arrangement, reveals high-resolution details of lattice contacts, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the stability of the Sap layer.",

          "abstract": "Le Chatelier in 1887 and Powers in 1947 demonstrated that the volume of nanoscale C-S-H (calcium silicate hydrate) particles formed during hydration is smaller than the combined volume of the reactants—the anhydrous Portland cement and water. Hydration has thus been considered as contractive. An experiment shows that the opposite is true above the nanoscale. The porous skeleton of cement paste expands as the growing C-S-H particles push each other apart, similar to crystal growth pressure. This is significant for high-performance concretes (HPC) with low water-cement ratios (w/c ≤ 0.4), where chemical self-desiccation lowers pore relative humidity by 40%, compared to just 1% in traditional concretes (w/c ≈ 0.5). Standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C1608 tests, using 10 mm thick water-immersed specimens, show large shrinkage because the half-time of water ingress is many decades, unable to offset shrinkage-causing self-desiccation. The present experiment, using a laser microscopy-topography technique, proves the opposite—expansion, evidenced by measuring the length changes of water-immersed HPC shards 0.5 mm thick in which the diffusion halftime, only about one hour, allows continuous resaturation of pores, canceling self-desiccation. The faster diffusion (halftime of one hour) enables continuous pore resaturation, preventing shrinkage. When sealed with paraffin oil, the shards self-desiccate and shrink. These findings align with studies since 2015, showing that models excluding hydration expansion cannot fit test data across various specimen sizes and sealing conditions. The results suggest that standardized ASTM tests for the so-called chemical shrinkage in modern concretes with very low water-cement ratios are misleading and need revision.",

          "authors": "Timothy M. Brown, Joseph O’Connor, Martin J. Genner",
          "abstract": "Climate change has emerged as a key threat to biodiversity, leading to broad-scale shifts in distributions of marine and terrestrial species as they attempt to track thermally suitable habitat. By contrast, our understanding of climate responses of freshwater species is relatively undeveloped, limiting our knowledge of whether projected warming will lead to freshwater biodiversity loss. Here, we linked a multicontinental database of riverine fish population abundance time series collected from 1958 to 2019 to temperature data from the same period. Across the sampled localities, waters warmed by 0.21 °C per decade (annual maximum of monthly temperatures). We tested whether fish responded to this change by i) increasing abundance at the cooler poleward limit of species distributions—predicted if warming has opened new opportunities—and ii) decreasing abundance toward the equatorward limit of distributions—predicted if temperatures have exceeded tolerance thresholds. We found that observed population trends were consistent with both of these expected patterns from climatic warming and that the trends were more pronounced in time series covering the longer time periods of 30+ y. The responses consistent with climate change were most evident in species with larger body sizes, higher trophic levels, river–sea migratory behavior, and more widespread distributions. Moreover, positive abundance responses to warming were more likely at higher altitudes where conditions tend to be cooler. These findings indicate that projected future warming will likely lead to widespread shifts in riverine community structure, including abundance declines at the trailing edge of species distributions.",

          "abstract": "TMEM16A is a calcium-activated chloride channel with significant role in epithelial fluid secretion, sensory transduction, and smooth muscle contraction. Several TMEM16A inhibitors have been identified; however, their binding sites and inhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. Using magnolol and honokiol, the two regioisomeric inhibitors, as chemical probes, we have identified a drug-binding site distinct from the pore region, in TMEM16A, which is described here. With electrophysiology, unbiased molecular docking and clustering, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental validation with mutant cycle analysis, we show that magnolol and honokiol utilize different drug-binding sites, pore and nonpore pockets. The pore blocker utilizes amino acids crucial for chloride passage, whereas the nonpore blocker allosterically modulates the pore residues to hinder ion permeation. Among 17 inhibitors tested, 11 were pore blockers and 6 were nonpore blockers, indicating the importance of this nonpore pocket. Our study provides insights into drug-binding mechanism in TMEM16A together with a rationale for future drug development.",

Conventional methods used to produce these microparticle components frequently offer limited control of their structural properties or require low-throughput nanofabrication of more complex structures. Here, we employ a synthetic biology approach to produce environmentally friendly, living microlenses with tunable structural properties. We engineered Escherichia coli bacteria to display the silica biomineralization enzyme silicatein from aquatic sea sponges. Our silicatein-expressing bacteria can self-assemble a shell of polysilicate “bioglass” around themselves. Remarkably, the polysilicate-encapsulated bacteria can focus light into intense nanojets that are nearly an order of magnitude brighter than unmodified bacteria.

          "abstract": "Here, we show that vitamin E succinate (VES) acts as a degrader for the m 6 A RNA demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), thus suppressing tumor growth and resistance to immunotherapy. FTO is ubiquitinated by its E3 ligase DTX2, followed by UFD1 recruitment and subsequent degradation in the proteasome. VES binds to FTO and DTX2, leading to enhanced FTO–DTX2 interaction, FTO ubiquitination, and degradation in FTO-dependent tumor cells. VES suppressed tumor growth and enhanced antitumor immunity and response to immunotherapy in vivo in mouse models. Genetic FTO knockdown or VES treatment increased m 6 A methylation in the LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor) gene and decreased LIF mRNA decay, and thus sensitized melanoma cells to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Taken together, our findings reveal the underlying molecular mechanism for FTO protein degradation and identify a dietary degrader for FTO that inhibits tumor growth and overcomes immunotherapy resistance.",

          "abstract": "High pressure can create extreme conditions that enable the formation of novel materials and the discovery of new phenomena. However, the ability to preserve the desirable characteristics of materials obtained under high pressure has remained an elusive challenge, as the pressure-induced changes are typically reversible, except for the pressure-induced chemical reactions such as polymerization of hydrocarbons. Here, we propose the concept of “pressure aging” (PA) that enables the permanent locking-in of high-pressure structures and their associated enhanced properties in functional materials. Specifically, through the application of PA at 3.3 GPa for 24 h, the two-dimensional ferroelectric CuInP 2 S 6 exhibits a permanent change in Cu configuration after the pressure is fully released. This leads to a 2.5-fold enhancement in remanent polarization and an increase in T c from 317 K to 583 K. In contrast, the samples underwent a compression–decompression cycle but without PA showed only reversible changes in their characteristics. We elucidate the relaxation dynamics during PA using the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts function, providing valuable insights into the temporal evolution of both structural and property changes. Furthermore, the broad applicability of PA strategy has been validated across different materials, underscoring its versatility. Notably, the pressures involved are industrially attainable, and the sample sizes are scalable. Consequently, the implementation of this impactful PA approach introduces a groundbreaking unique dimension to high-pressure research, with significant potential across various scientific domains.",

For example, empirical evidence suggests that water was delivered to the Earth by hydrated planetesimals from distant regions of the Solar System. Recently, several morphologically inactive near-Earth objects were reported to experience significant nongravitational accelerations inconsistent with radiation-based effects, and possibly explained by volatile-driven outgassing. However, these “dark comets” display no evidence of comae in archival images, which are the defining feature of cometary activity. Here, we report detections of nongravitational accelerations on seven additional objects classified as inactive (doubling the population) that could also be explainable by asymmetric mass loss. A detailed search of archival survey and targeted data rendered no detection of dust activity in any of these objects in individual or stacked images. We calculate dust production limits of ∼ 10, 0.1 , and 0.1 kg s − 1 for 1998 FR 11 , 2001 ME 1 , and 2003 RM with these data, indicating little or no dust surrounding the objects during the observations. This set of dark comets reveals the delineation between two distinct populations: larger, “outer” dark comets on eccentric orbits that are end members of a continuum in activity level of comets, and smaller, “inner” dark comets on near-circular orbits that could signify a different different population. These objects may trace various stages in the life cycle of a previously undetected, but potentially numerous, volatile-rich population that may have provided essential material to the Earth.",

Existing devices detect muscular motions either indirectly from mechanoacoustic signatures on skin surface or via ultrasound waves that demand specialized skin adhesion. Here, we report a wireless wearable system, Laryngeal Health Monitor (LaHMo), designed to be conformally placed on the neck for continuously measuring movements of underlying muscles. The system uses near-infrared (NIR) light that features deep-tissue penetration and strong interaction with myoglobin to capture muscular locomotion. The incorporated inertial measurement unit sensor further decouples the superposition of signals from NIR recordings.

An adaptive model enables fast individualization without enormous data sources from the target user, facilitating its broad applicability. Long-term tests and simulations suggest the potential efficacy of the LaHMo platform for real-world applications, such as monitoring disease progression in neuromuscular disorders, evaluating treatment efficacy, and providing biofeedback for rehabilitation exercises.

Turbulent-like active flows power giant interfacial fluctuations, which exhibit pronounced asymmetry between regions of positive and negative curvature. Experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical arguments reveal how the interface breaks up the spatial symmetry of the fundamental bend instability to generate local vortical flows that lead to asymmetric interface fluctuations. The magnitude of interface deformations increases with activity: In the high activity limit, the interface self-folds invaginating passive droplets and generating a foam-like phase, where active fluid is perforated with passive droplets.

          "abstract": "Plants need to adapt to fluctuating atmospheric humidity and respond to both high and low humidity. Despite our substantial understanding of plant responses to low humidity, molecular mechanisms underlying the high humidity (HH) response are much less well understood. In this study, we investigated early responses to HH in Arabidopsis . Expression of CYP707A3 , encoding an abscisic acid (ABA) 8′-hydroxylase, is induced by HH within 10 min, which leads to a decrease in foliar ABA level. We identified that the combined action of CAMTA3 and CAMTA2 transcription factors regulate this response. This regulation requires a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain of CAMTA3. Transcriptomes of HH-regulated genes are enriched in those related to calcium signaling, including cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs). Moreover, HH induces CNGC2- and CNGC4-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations in leaves within a few minutes. We also found that CNGC2, CNGC4, and CAMTAs participate in HH-induced hyponastic movement of petioles. Taken together, our results indicate that CNGC2/CNGC4-Ca 2+ -CaM-CAMTA3/CAMTA2 acts as a primary regulatory module to trigger downstream HH responses.",

          "abstract": "The routing of blood flow throughout the brain vasculature is precisely controlled by mechanisms that serve to maintain a fine balance between local neuronal demands and vascular supply of nutrients. We recently identified two capillary endothelial cell (cEC)-based mechanisms that control cerebral blood flow in vivo: 1) electrical signaling, mediated by extracellular K + -dependent activation of strong inward rectifying K + (Kir2.1) channels, which are steeply activated by hyperpolarization and thus are capable of cell-to-cell propagation, and 2) calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling, which reflects release of Ca 2+ via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R)—a target of G q -protein-coupled receptor signaling. Notably, Ca 2+ signals were restricted to the cell in which they were initiated. Unexpectedly, we found that these two mechanisms, which were presumed to operate in distinct spatiotemporal realms, are linked such that Kir2.1-dependent hyperpolarization induces increases in the electrical driving force for Ca 2+ entry into cECs through resident TRPV4 channels. This process, termed electrocalcium (E-Ca) coupling, enhances IP 3 R-mediated Ca 2+ release via a Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ -release mechanism, and allows focally induced hyperpolarization, including that initiated by ATP-dependent K + (K ATP ) channels, to travel cell-to-cell via activation of Kir2.1 channels in adjacent cells, providing a mechanism for the “pseudopropagation” of Ca 2+ signals. Computational modeling supported the basic features of E-Ca coupling and provided insight into the intracellular processes involved. Collectively, these data provide strong support for the concept of E-Ca coupling and provide a mechanism for the spatiotemporal integration of diverse signaling pathways in the control of cerebral blood flow.",

However, the underlying elementary gas-phase processes synthesizing cyclopentadiene from acyclic hydrocarbon precursors have remained elusive. Here, by merging crossed molecular beam experiments with rate coefficient calculations and comprehensive astrochemical modeling, we afford persuasive testimony on an unconventional low-temperature cyclization pathway to cyclopentadiene from acyclic precursors through the reaction of the simplest diatomic organic radical—methylidyne (CH)—with 1,3-butadiene (C 4 H 6 ) representing main route to cyclopentadiene observed in TaurusMolecular Cloud. This facile route provides potential solution for the incorporation of the cyclopentadiene moiety in complex aromatic systems via bottom–up molecular mass growth processes and offers an entry point to the low-temperature chemistry in deep space leading eventually to nonplanar PAHs in our carbonaceous Universe.",

Given that CARD11 is physiologically expressed not only in lymphocytes but also in dendritic cells (DCs), we explored whether enforced CARD11 signaling in DCs contributes to immunopathology. We demonstrated that exclusive DC-intrinsic expression of CARD11-GOF in mice was sufficient to induce a lethal autoinflammatory syndrome that mimicked human HLH. Mechanistically, DC-intrinsic CARD11-GOF signaling triggered cell-autonomous inflammatory cytokine production via MALT1 paracaspase engagement. Genetic deletion of Malt1 in CARD11-GOF-expressing animals reversed the hyperinflammatory phenotype.

This study provides evidence indicating the practice of deep cave collective rituals in the Levant during the Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) period. It is demonstrated that these gatherings occurred within a distinct ritual compound and were centered around an engraved object in the deepest part of Manot Cave, a pivotal EUP site in southwest Asia. The ritual compound, segregated from the living areas, encompasses a large gallery partitioned by a cluster of remarkable speleothems. Within this gallery, an engraved boulder stands out, displaying geometric signs suggesting a unique representation of a tortoise. Isotopic analysis of calcite crusts on the boulder’s grooves revealed alignment with values found in speleothems from the cave dated to ~37 to 35 ka BP. Additionally, meticulous shape analysis of the grooves’ cross-section and the discernible presence of microlinear scratches on the grooves’ walls confirmed their anthropogenic origin. Examination of stalagmite laminae (36 ka BP) near the engraved boulder revealed a significant presence of wood ash particles within. This finding provides evidence for using fire to illuminate the dark, deep part of the cave during rituals. Acoustic tests conducted in various cave areas indicate that the ritual compound was well suited for communal gatherings, facilitating conversations, speeches, and hearing. Our results underscore the critical role of collective practices centered around a symbolic object in fostering a functional social network within the regional EUP communities.",

However, the extent of such high-integrity forest habitats remaining for biodiversity is unknown. Here, we quantify the amount of high-integrity tropical rainforests, as a fraction of total forest cover, within the geographic ranges of 16,396 species of terrestrial vertebrates worldwide. We found up to 90% of the humid tropical ranges of forest-dependent vertebrates was encompassed by forest cover. Concerningly, however, merely 25% of these remaining rainforests are of high integrity. Forest-dependent species that are threatened and declining and species with small geographic ranges have disproportionately low proportions of high-integrity forest habitat left. Our work brings much needed attention to the poor quality of much of the forest estate remaining for biodiversity across the humid tropics. The targeted preservation of the world’s remaining high-integrity tropical rainforests that are currently unprotected is a critical conservation priority that may help alleviate the biodiversity crisis in these hyperdiverse and irreplaceable ecosystems. Enhanced efforts worldwide to preserve tropical rainforest integrity are essential to meet the targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework which aims to achieve near zero loss of high biodiversity importance areas (including ecosystems of high integrity) by 2030.",

          "abstract": "Retinal rods and cones underlie scotopic and photopic vision, respectively. Their pigments exhibit spontaneous isomerizations (quantal noise) in darkness due to intrinsic thermal energy. This quantal noise, albeit exceedingly low in rods, dictates the light threshold for scotopic vision. The same quantal noise in cones, however, is too low to explain the much higher diurnal light threshold. Separately, a dark continuous noise is present in rods, long accepted to originate from an intrinsic random activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-phosphodiesterase enzyme mediating phototransduction downstream of the pigment. Here, we report the surprising finding that most of this rod dark continuous noise actually originates from rhodopsin itself. Importantly, we found the same continuous noise with a much higher magnitude from cone pigments. The rod and cone continuous noises are apparently both associated with a hitherto unrecognized “metastable” pigment conformational state physiologically resembling that in apo-opsin (opsin devoid of chromophore) and is intermittently active for very brief moments. The cone holopigment’s high continuous noise is expected to act as an intrinsic equivalent light and adapt the cone dramatically, accounting for a major part of the light-sensitivity difference between rods and cones in darkness.",

Multiple chaperones interact with and disaggregate amyloid fibrils, which impacts amyloid propagation and cellular phenotypes. However, it remains poorly understood whether and how site-specific binding of chaperones to amyloids facilitates the concerted disaggregation process and modulates physiological consequences in vivo. Here, we identified binding sites of Ssa1, Sis1, and Hsp104 chaperones for Sup35, the protein determinant of yeast prion [ PSI + ] yeast. Our biophysical and genetic analyses with various Sup35 deletion mutants and amyloid conformations revealed that the Ssa1-binding to the region outside amyloid core plays a key role in facilitating disaggregation and propagation of yeast prions both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we developed a reconstitution system, including the Ssa1-binding tag and the HAP/Caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) hybrid chaperones, and found that this reconstitution system successfully degraded distinct prion strain conformations. Together, these results show that the properly positioned, exposed Ssa1-binding region in amyloid fibrils influences the efficiency of amyloid disaggregation and propagation, and eventually prion strain phenotypes. More broadly, our findings provide molecular foundations for previous, puzzling observations of prion propagation in vivo, and offer insights into elimination of amyloid deposits in cells.",

          "abstract": "The formation of excited dimer states, so called excimers, is an important phenomenon in many organic molecular semiconductor solid state aggregates. In contrast to Frenkel exciton–polarons, an excimer is long-lived and energetically low-lying due to stabilization resulting from a substantial reorganization of the intermolecular geometry. Here, we show that ultrafast electron diffraction can follow the dynamics of solid-state excimer formation in polycrystalline thin films of a molecular semiconductor, revealing both the key reaction modes and the eventual structure of the emitting state. We study the prototypical organic semiconductor zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) in its crystallographic α -phase as a model excimeric system. We show that the excimer forms in a two-step process starting with a fast dimerization (approx. 0.4 ps) followed by a subsequent slow shear-twist motion (14 ps) leading to an alignment of the π -systems of the involved monomers. This structural distortion persists well beyond 300 ps. Furthermore, we show that while the same excimer geometry is present in partially fluorinated derivatives of ZnPc, the formation kinematics slow down with increasing level of fluorination.",

          "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax parasites can lie dormant in the liver as hypnozoites, activating weeks to months after sporozoite inoculation to cause relapsing malarial illness. It is not known what biological processes govern hypnozoite activation. We use longitudinal data from the most detailed cohort study ever conducted in an area where both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were endemic to fit a simple within-host mathematical model of P. vivax hypnozoite activation. 1,344 children living on the Thailand–Myanmar border were followed daily for 21 mo. There were 2,504 vivax and 1,164 falciparum malaria symptomatic episodes recorded over 1988 person-years. The model assumes that hypnozoites activate independently at a constant rate (“exponential clock model”). When this model was embedded in a stochastic framework for repeated infectious mosquito bites, with seasonality inferred from the incidence of clinical falciparum malaria episodes, it explained the observed temporal patterns of multiple (up to 13) recurrent vivax malaria episodes. Under this model, we estimate the mean dormancy period for a single hypnozoite to be 6 mo (i.e., a half-life of 4 mo). We use the calibrated within-host model to characterize population-level overdispersion in the risk of relapse, and assess the potential utility of a serological test for radical cure in low transmission settings. We show that mefloquine treatment of falciparum malaria eliminates early vivax relapses; and that there are substantially more P. vivax recurrences than expected under the model following artesunate monotherapy treatment for falciparum malaria. These results suggest that hypnozoites can be activated by symptomatic malarial illness.",

          "abstract": "Multiple hypotheses have been put forth to understand why defense chemistry in individual plants is so diverse. A major challenge has been teasing apart the importance of concentration vs. composition of defense compounds and resolving the mechanisms of diversity effects that determine plant resistance against herbivores. Accordingly, we first outline nonexclusive mechanisms by which phytochemical diversity may increase toxicity of a mixture compared to the average effect of each compound alone. We then leveraged independent in vitro, in vivo transgenic, and organismal experiments to test the effect of equimolar concentrations of purified milkweed toxins in isolation vs. mixtures on the specialist and sequestering monarch butterfly. We show that cardenolide toxin mixtures from milkweed plants enhance resistance against this herbivore compared to equal concentrations of single compounds. In mixtures, highly potent toxins dominated the inhibition of the monarch’s target enzyme (Na + /K + -ATPase) in vitro, revealing toxin-specific affinity for the adapted enzyme in the absence of other physiological adaptations of the monarch. Mixtures also caused increased mortality in CRISPR-edited adult Drosophila melanogaster with the monarch enzyme in vivo, whereas wild-type flies showed lower survival regardless of mixture type. Finally, although experimentally administered mixtures were not more toxic to monarch caterpillars than single compounds overall, increasing caterpillar sequestration from mixtures resulted in an increasing burden for growth compared to single compounds. Phytochemical diversity likely provides an economical plant defense by acting on multiple aspects of herbivore physiology and may be particularly effective against sequestering specialist herbivores.",

Epidemiological studies have reported potential carcinogenic risks of PFAS based on their widespread occurrence and population exposure. In this study, we observed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a common PFAS, functions as a mechanical regulator in lung cancer cells. PFOA exposure reduces cell stiffness, thereby decreasing cell adhesion and enhancing immune evasion, ultimately exacerbating tumor metastasis. In various lung cancer models, more aggressive tumor metastases have been observed in the PFOA exposure group. Additionally, serum PFOA levels in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than those in patients with early-stage disease. Mechanistically, the interaction between PFOA and transmembrane integrins in cancer cells triggers changes in cellular mechanical properties, leading to the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and activation of the intracellular FAK-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that in individuals with lung adenocarcinoma, PFOA can increase the risk of cancer metastasis even at daily exposure levels.",

This behavior prompted design of decapeptide DP1 (DEHGTAVMLK) as a Mn 2+ ligand, and development of a highly potent Mn 2+ -antioxidant (MDP) containing [Pi] = 25 mM, and [DP1] = 3 mM, the ratio found in the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans , with [Mn 2+ ] = 1 mM. MDP is an exceptional antioxidant, both in vitro and in vivo, and has reinvigorated the development of radiation-inactivated whole-cell vaccines. This study investigates the nature of the active Mn 2+ complex in MDP. We measure the affinity of DP1 for the substitutionally labile Mn 2+ ion using isothermal-titration calorimetry (ITC) and use changes in the Mn 2+ solution EPR spectrum to determine affinities of Mn 2+ for DP1 and for Pi, and to monitor Mn 2+ ligation while titrated with the fixed Pi/DP1 ratio of MDP, 25/3, using ENDOR/ESEEM to characterize DP1 ligation to Mn 2+ . In parallel, 1 H NMR of DP1 was used to monitor binding interactions between Pi and DP1, and DP1 binding to the diamagnetic Ca 2+ . We report: i) DP1 forms an extremely weak, dynamic Mn 2+ complex (K a ≈ 40 M −1 ) ii) Mn 2+ binds Pi much more strongly (K a ≈ 390 M −1 ) as shown previously, but iii) DP1 and Pi jointly bind to Mn 2+ in MDP to form a ternary Mn 2+ (Pi) (DP1) complex with greater formation-constant than Pi alone (K a app ≈ 670 M −1 ). It is this ternary complex that is the superb antioxidant in MDP.",

Many imaging techniques exist for mapping the distribution of medical agent-carrying nanoparticles in tissues, but they cannot capture the three-dimensional context of tissues with single nanoparticle resolution. Here, we developed 3DEM-NPD, a three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D EM) machine learning strategy to image and map single nanoparticle distributions (NPD) in tissues. 3DEM-NPD provides unbiased visualization and quantification of individual nanoparticles within organs. We applied this technique to quantify nanoparticle transport through tumor blood vessel endothelial cells. We measured the cell diameter, surface area, and volume and found that traditional 2D EM cannot accurately measure these features. We used machine learning to locate over 550,000 nanoparticles in less than 3 h with an accuracy of over 82%. The 3DEM-NPD method allowed us to establish a metric to quantify nanoparticle transport at the single nanoparticle level and to quantify the morphological features of ~2,800 vesicles. We find that on average there are only 2.4 nanoparticles per vesicle with a theoretical maximum of 158 nanoparticles per vesicle (~66x increase). These surprising results suggest the need to increase vesicle encapsulation efficiency for improved transport and they provide a benchmark for increasing nanoparticle transport and delivery. This technique may provide unique insights into the interactions between medical agents, drug carriers, emerging materials, and cells at the single-nanoparticle level throughout tissues.",

While in most cases such considerations are manifestly ingrained in the constituents, novel phenomenology can emerge when composite units associated with emergent symmetries dominate the behavior of the system. We study a generic class of active matter systems with nonreciprocal interactions and demonstrate the existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our scalar active mixture theory to the Toner–Tu theory of dry polar active matter by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that the complete effective field theory—which includes all the soft modes and the relevant nonlinear terms—belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the emergent polar long-range order in scalar nonreciprocal mixtures in two dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin–Wagner theorem.",

Production (or activation) of radical PAHs and propagation of their resulting reactions require efficient dehydrogenation, but the preferred method of hydrogen loss is not well understood. Unimolecular hydrogen ejection (i.e., direct C─H bond fission) and bimolecular radical abstraction are two main candidate pathways. We performed a computational study to characterize the role of H ejection, particularly as a driver for radical-centric hydrocarbon-growth mechanisms and particle formation. Electronic structure calculations establish that C─H bond strengths span a broad range of energies, which can be weaker than 30 kcal/mol in some C 9 and C 13 PAH radicals. At T &gt; 1200 K, calculated thermal rates for hydrogen ejection from weak C─H bonds at zigzag sites on PAH radicals are significantly larger than typical H-abstraction rates. These results are highly relevant in the context of chain reactions of radical species and soot inception under fuel-rich combustion conditions. Furthermore, calculated microcanonical rates that include the additional internal energy released by bond formation (e.g., ring closure to yield C 9 H 9 ) yield significantly higher rates than those associated with full thermalization. These microcanonical considerations are relevant to the astrochemical processes associated with hydrocarbon growth and processing in the low-density interstellar environment.",

This study employs a multiproxy approach (phytolith, starch, and fungi) to analyze microfossil remains associated with pottery vessels from the earliest phase of the Shangshan site (ca. 10,000 to 9,000 cal. BP). The results indicate that rice was consumed as a dietary staple and used for brewing fermented beverages with a qu starter containing Monascus mold and yeast as fermentation agents. The fermentation ingredients included rice, supplemented with other cereals (Job’s tears, Panicoideae, and Triticeae), acorn, and lily. This rice-fungi-based multiplant brewing method marked the earliest-known alcoholic fermentation technique in East Asia. The emergence of this fermentation technology is attributable to the early development of rice domestication and the arrival of the wet-warm Holocene climate, which was favorable for fungal growth. These alcoholic beverages likely played a pivotal role in ceremonial feasting, highlighting their ritual function as a driving factor that may have stimulated the intensive utilization and widespread cultivation of rice in Neolithic China.",

Cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry is an essential tool for elucidating protein–protein interactions (PPIs). Despite its importance, we still know surprisingly little about the principles that underlie the process of chemical cross-link formation itself and how it is influenced by different physicochemical factors. To understand the molecular details of cross-link formation, we have set up a comprehensive kinetic model and carried out simulations of protein cross-linking on large protein complexes. We dissect the contribution on the cross-link yield of parameters such as amino acid reactivity, cross-linker concentration, and hydrolysis rate. Our model can compute cross-link formation based solely on the structure of a protein complex, thereby enabling realistic predictions for a diverse set of systems. We quantitatively show how cross-links and mono-links are in direct competition and how the hydrolysis rate and abundance of cross-linker and proteins directly influence their relative formation. We show how cross-links and mono-links exist in an “all-against-all” competition due to their simultaneous formation, resulting in a nonintuitive network of interdependence. We show that this interdependence is locally confined and mainly limited to direct neighbors or residues in direct vicinity. These results enable us to identify the optimal cross-linker concentration at which the maximal number of cross-links is formed. Taken together, our study establishes a comprehensive kinetic model to quantitatively describe cross-link formation for PPIs.",

Our study reveals that the negative Δ 33 S anomalies produced by coal combustion are consistent with similar anomalies observed in present-day sulfate aerosols in Beijing, China, and the black crust sulfates formed on building stones, monument walls, and sculptures in Europe that contribute to carbonate stone deterioration and cultural heritage damage. This finding provides independent evidence for a critical role of atmospheric sulfate from coal combustion in maintaining isotopic balance and offers an effective method for tracing sulfate aerosol sources.

Here, we reconstructed the origin and evolutionary history of auxin-mediated acid growth. Comparative phylogenomic analysis showed that most core components of acid growth originated in Charophyta and then underwent subclass expansion and functional innovation during plant terrestrialization. In Charophyceae algae Chara braunii, we found that PM H + -ATPase has formed a core regulatory module with TMK and PP2C.D, which can be activated by photosynthesis-dependent phosphorylation through light rather than auxin. Despite the lack of canonical auxin receptor TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB), auxin elicits significant internodal elongation and transcriptional reprogramming in C. braunii , implying the existence of an ancient auxin-mediated growth mechanism. We propose that the evolution of acid growth represents a neofunctional adaptation to terrestrial environments, in which PM H + -ATPase in carbon concentrating for photosynthesis was utilized to acidify apoplast for cell expansion, and the core components responsible for acid growth eventually established a regulatory network in land plants by connecting with the TIR1/AFB pathway.",

Some obligate endosymbionts that experience long-term symbiosis with the insect hosts, however, have lost their key components for DNA repair. It is largely unexplored how the bacterial endosymbionts cope with the increased demand for mismatch repairs under heat stresses. Here, we showed that ibpA, a small heat shock protein encoded by Buchnera aphidicola , directly interacted with the cytoskeletal actin to prevent its aggregation in bacteriocytes, thus reinforcing the stability of bacteriocytes. However, the succession of 11 adenines in the promoter of ibpA is extremely prone to mismatching error, e.g., a single adenine deletion, which impairs the induction of ibpA under heat stress. Coinfection with a facultative endosymbiont Serratia symbiotica remarkably reduced the mutagenesis rate in the Buchnera genome and potentially prevented a single adenine deletion in ibpA promoter, thereby alleviating the heat vulnerability of aphid bacteriocytes. Furthermore, Serratia encoded mutH, a conserved core protein of prokaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR), accessed to Buchnera cells, which complemented Buchnera mutL and mutS in constituting an active MMR. Our findings imply that a full complement of a prokaryotic MMR system assembled by two bacterial endosymbionts contributes significantly to the thermostability of aphid bacteriocytes in an ibpA-dependent manner, furnishing a distinct molecular link among tripartite symbioses in shaping resilience and adaptation of their insect hosts to occupy other ecological niches.",

Intra-articular injection of BTB resulted in GPR65-dependent sensitization of knee-innervating neurons and nocifensive behaviors in mice.

More broadly, abiotic abundance might not reflect biotic abundance in the organisms in which the genetic code evolved. Here, we instead identify which protein domains date to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and then infer the order of recruitment from deviations of their ancestrally reconstructed amino acid frequencies from the still-ancient post-LUCA controls. We find that smaller amino acids were added to the code earlier, with no additional predictive power in the previous consensus order. Metal-binding (cysteine and histidine) and sulfur-containing (cysteine and methionine) amino acids were added to the genetic code much earlier than previously thought. Methionine and histidine were added to the code earlier than expected from their molecular weights and glutamine later. Early methionine availability is compatible with inferred early use of S-adenosylmethionine and early histidine with its purine-like structure and the demand for metal binding. Even more ancient protein sequences—those that had already diversified into multiple distinct copies prior to LUCA—have significantly higher frequencies of aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine) and lower frequencies of valine and glutamic acid than single-copy LUCA sequences. If at least some of these sequences predate the current code, then their distinct enrichment patterns provide hints about earlier, alternative genetic codes.",

          "abstract": "Despite 96 million years of evolution separating humans and rodents, 11 closely related reproductive tract-specific genes in humans— SPINT3 , WFDC6 , EPPIN , WFDC8 , WFDC9 , WFDC10A , WFDC11 , WFDC10B , WFDC13 , SPINT4 , and WFDC3 —and the 13 reproductive tract-specific orthologous genes in mice, form highly conserved syntenic gene clusters indicative of conserved, combined critical functions. Further, despite significant progress toward a nonhormonal male contraceptive targeting the protein encoded by one of these genes, epididymal peptidase inhibitor (EPPIN), and associations found between mutations in EPPIN and an increased risk of male infertility, neither EPPIN nor any closely related whey acidic protein four-disulfide core (WFDC) gene have been explored functionally. To clarify the involvement of WFDC genes in male fertility, we strategically used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mice lacking 13, 10, 5, or 4 genes within the cluster and demonstrated that males with deletions of 13, 10, or 4 genes (Wfdc6a, Eppin, Wfdc8, and Wfdc6a) were sterile due to an arrest in spermatogenesis, preventing formation beyond round spermatids. In contrast, the five gene knockout (KO) males (lacking Wfdc16 , Wfdc9 , Wfdc10 , Wfdc11 , and Wfdc13 ), despite normal spermatogenesis and sperm counts, were infertile due to defects in sperm motility and increased sperm death. Similarly to our previously reported Spint3 single gene KO, Wfdc3 single KO mice were fertile with no obvious reproductive phenotype. Our KO mouse studies to explore the entire WFDC locus of closely related genes have clarified the functional requirements of WFDC locus genes in different aspects of male fertility. Our research has implications for improving clinical diagnoses of male infertility and identifying additional targets for nonhormonal male contraception.",

          "abstract": "Nearly every cell of the body contains a circadian clock mechanism that is synchronized with the light-entrained clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Desynchrony between the SCN and the external environment leads to metabolic dysfunction in shift workers. Similarly, mice with markedly shortened endogenous period due to the deletion of circadian REV-ERBα/β nuclear receptors in the SCN (SCN DKO) exhibit increased sensitivity to diet-induced obesity (DIO) on a 24 h light:dark cycle while mice with REV-ERBs deleted in hepatocytes (HepDKO) display exacerbated hepatosteatosis in response to a high-fat diet. Here, we show that inducing deletion of hepatocyte REV-ERBs in SCN DKO mice (Hep-SCN DDKO) rescued the exacerbated DIO and hepatic triglyceride accumulation, without affecting the shortened behavioral period. These findings suggest that metabolic disturbances due to environmental desynchrony with the central clock are due to effects on peripheral clocks which can be mitigated by matching peripheral and central clock periods even in a desynchronous environment. Thus, maintaining synchrony within an organism, rather than between endogenous and exogenous clocks, may be a viable target for the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with circadian disruption.",

However, the mechanism of fast-charging capability degradation triggered by the dynamic evolution of non-Faraday electric fields remains unclear due to the lack of particle-scale nondestructive detection techniques. Here, we dissect the generation and elimination processes of non-Faradaic electric field in segments using the developed operando cryogenic transmission X-ray microscopy (Cryo-TXM). This method accurately tracks the ion self-balancing pathways in LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM811) post-fast-charging, elucidating the high polarization during late charging caused by exacerbated irreversible local electric field. By intermittently applying reverse potential during fast charging to alleviate the exacerbation of non-Faradaic electric field at the cathode interface, we achieved a roughly 400% reversible capacity increase of SSBs at 10 C. This insightful dynamic imaging method effectively captures and resolves the transient, opaque signals within SSBs, significantly enhancing their fast-charging performance.",

Zoonotic infections predominantly originate from ungulates and occasionally from rats, highlighting the zoonotic potential of rodent-associated hepeviruses. We conducted host genomic data mining and uncovered two genetically divergent rodent-associated hepeviruses, and two bat-associated hepeviruses genetically related to known bat-associated strains. We thus analyzed 2,565 liver specimens from 108 rodent and shrew species sampled from globally understudied regions and hosts in Africa, Asia, and Latin America during 2011-2018 for hepeviruses by RT–PCR. We detected 63 positive field samples (2.5%, 95% CI 1.9-3.1) from 14 animal species, including two coinfections with genetically divergent strains and significant variation ( X 2 , P &lt; 0.001) in detection rates between study sites. Strain-specific qRT–PCR assays showed virus concentrations between 9.2 × 10 2 and 3.2 × 10 9 copies/g. We recovered 24 near-complete hepeviral genomes from rodents, shrews, and bats, all showing three partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), some including putative late domains that may be associated with quasi-envelopment. Rodent-derived hepeviruses grouped into five clades clustering in basal sister relationship to human- (31 to 84% distance in translated ORF1-3) and rat-associated HEV. Parsimony-based analyses and cophylogenetic reconciliations revealed that rodents were predominant sources of hepeviral cross-order host shifts. Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions substantiated a direct origin of human-associated HEV in ungulates such as swine and camelids (posterior probability 0.8), whereas the nonrecent evolutionary origins of human- and ungulate-associated HEV were projected to rodent hosts (posterior probability &gt; 0.9). Our results elucidate the genealogy of human HEV and warrant increased surveillance and experimental risk assessments for rodent-associated hepeviruses.",

These structures reveal a distinct binding pose of PGD 2 and indomethacin and provide key insights into receptor activation and transducer coupling. Combining the structural data with functional studies, we uncover the molecular basis for biased signaling of indomethacin toward β-arrestin over G proteins. Notably, a phospholipid binding site was identified at the DP2–G protein interface that modulates DP2–G protein interactions. Together, our functional and structural findings provide insights into DP2 activation, biased signaling, drug interactions, and lipid regulation, enabling rational design of safer antiallergy therapeutics targeting this key immune receptor.",

Recently created large-scale marine protected areas are potentially big enough to protect highly migratory species such as tuna, possibly leading to increases in abundance (a conservation benefit) and consequent spillover near protected area boundaries (an economic benefit). Using publicly available data from nine large-scale marine protected areas across the Pacific and Indian oceans, we find that catch-per-unit-effort in tuna purse seine fisheries has increased by an average of 12 to 18% near protected area boundaries, and this increase declines with distance from the boundaries. The increase is larger for bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ) than for skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus pelamis ), in line with fisheries science simulation models.",

These operations include tasks demanding millisecond-level responses to prevent irreparable damage, such as quickly stabilizing a slipping package or halting a knife just before it cuts into a table. Although recent advances in intelligent robot control have considerably expanded—and will continue to expand—the range and complexity of tasks that robots can perform, AI, data, and control theory alone are not enough.

We unravel the genetic basis of sexually selected plumage traits to investigate their effects on reproductive isolation in barn swallows. The genetic architecture of sexual traits is characterized by 12 loci on two autosomes and the Z chromosome. Sexual trait loci exhibit signatures of divergent selection in geographic isolation and barriers to gene flow in secondary contact. Linkage disequilibrium between these genes has been maintained by selection in hybrid zones beyond what would be expected under admixture alone. Our findings reveal that selection on coupled sexual trait loci promotes reproductive isolation, providing key empirical evidence for the role of sexual selection in speciation.",

We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56,450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies &gt;10 34 erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability.

          "abstract": "The inverse design of tailored organic molecules for specific optoelectronic devices of high complexity holds an enormous potential but has not yet been realized. Current models rely on large data sets that generally do not exist for specialized research fields. We demonstrate a closed-loop workflow that combines high-throughput synthesis of organic semiconductors to create large datasets and Bayesian optimization to discover new hole-transporting materials with tailored properties for solar cell applications. The predictive models were based on molecular descriptors that allowed us to link the structure of these materials to their performance. A series of high-performance molecules were identified from minimal suggestions and achieved up to 26.2% (certified 25.9%) power conversion efficiency in perovskite solar cells.",

          "abstract": "Artificial neural networks provide a powerful paradigm for nonbiological information processing. To understand whether similar principles could enable computation within living cells, we combined de novo–designed protein heterodimers and engineered viral proteases to implement a synthetic protein circuit that performs winner-take-all neural network classification. This “perceptein” circuit combines weighted input summation through reversible binding interactions with self-activation and mutual inhibition through irreversible proteolytic cleavage. These interactions collectively generate a large repertoire of distinct protein species stemming from up to eight coexpressed starting protein species. The complete system achieves multi-output signal classification with tunable decision boundaries in mammalian cells and can be used to conditionally control cell death. These results demonstrate how engineered protein-based networks can enable programmable signal classification in living cells.",

          "abstract": "During transcription, RNA polymerase II traverses through chromatin, and post-translational modifications including histone methylations mark regions of active transcription. Histone protein H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), which is established by the histone methyltransferase SETD2, suppresses cryptic transcription, regulates splicing, and serves as a binding site for transcription elongation factors. The mechanism by which the transcription machinery coordinates the deposition of H3K36me3 is not well understood. Here we provide cryo-electron microscopy structures of mammalian RNA polymerase II-DSIF-SPT6-PAF1c-TFIIS-IWS1-SETD2-nucleosome elongation complexes, revealing that the transcription machinery regulates H3K36me3 deposition by SETD2 on downstream and upstream nucleosomes. SPT6 binds the exposed H2A–H2B dimer during transcription and the SPT6 death-like domain mediates an interaction with SETD2 bound to a nucleosome upstream of RNA polymerase II.",

          "abstract": "The advancement in semiconductor technology through the integration of more devices on a chip has reached a point where device scaling alone is no longer an efficient way to improve the device performance. One issue lies in the interconnects connecting the transistors, in which the resistivity of metals increases exponentially as their dimensions are scaled down to match those of the transistors. As a result, the total signal processing delay is dominated by the resistance-capacitance (RC) delay from the interconnects rather than the delay from the transistors’ switching speed. This bottleneck has spurred efforts both in academia and industry to explore alternative materials and disruptive device structures. Therefore, we suggest strategies to overcome the RC delay of the interconnects in both material and device aspects.",

Here, we report an antiviral mechanism of type III CRISPR-Cas-regulated ATP depletion, where ATP is converted into ITP by CRISPR-Cas-associated adenosine deaminase (CAAD) upon activation by either cA 4 or cA 6 , followed by hydrolysis into IMP by Nudix hydrolase, ultimately resulting in cell growth arrest. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of CAAD in its apo and activated forms, together with biochemical evidence, revealed how cA 4 /cA 6 binds to the CARF domain and abrogates CAAD autoinhibition, inducing substantial conformational changes that reshape the structure of CAAD and induce its deaminase activity.

These adaptations are supported in part by experience-dependent activation of immediate-early response genes, such as Npas4 (neuronal PAS domain protein 4). Here we show that a conserved long noncoding enhancer RNA (lnc-eRNA), transcribed from an activity-sensitive enhancer, produces DNA:RNA hybrid R-loop structures that support three-dimensional chromatin looping between enhancer and proximal promoter and rapid Npas4 gene induction. Furthermore, in mouse models, Npas4 lnc-eRNA and its R-loop are required for the development of behavioral adaptations produced by chronic psychosocial stress or cocaine exposure, revealing a potential role for this regulatory mechanism in the transmission of emotional experiences.",

Seabird mortalities are often observed in association with heatwaves, but population impacts are not well understood. In this work, we report the rapid mortality of approximately half of Alaska’s common murre ( Uria aalge ) population in response to an extreme marine heatwave. Between the 7-year period before (2008–2014) and after (2016–2022) the heatwave, murre numbers plummeted 52 to 78% at 13 colonies across two large marine ecosystems. We calculated a loss of 4.00 million common murres, the largest documented wildlife mortality event in the modern era. No evidence of recovery has yet been observed, suggesting that these ecosystems may no longer support historic numbers of seabird top predators.",

In this study, we discovered that phage diversity consistently outstripped the diversity of their bacterial hosts under simple experimental conditions. We assembled and passaged dozens of diverse phage communities on a single, nonevolving strain of Escherichia coli until the phage communities reached equilibrium. In all cases, we found that two or more phage species coexisted stably, despite competition for a single, clonal host population. Phage coexistence was supported through host phenotypic heterogeneity, whereby bacterial cells adopting different growth phenotypes served as niches for different phage species. Our experiments reveal that a rich community ecology of bacteriophages can emerge on a single bacterial host.",

We generated a catalog of Neanderthal ancestry segments in more than 300 genomes spanning the past 50,000 years. We examined how Neanderthal ancestry is shared among individuals over time. Our analysis revealed that the vast majority of Neanderthal gene flow is attributable to a single, shared extended period of gene flow that occurred between 50,500 to 43,500 years ago, as evidenced by ancestry correlation, colocalization of Neanderthal segments across individuals, and divergence from the sequenced Neanderthals. Most natural selection—positive and negative—on Neanderthal variants occurred rapidly after the gene flow.

We found that this “stem cell collision” generates an injury-induced tissue niche containing keratin 5 + epithelial cells and plastic Pdgfra + mesenchymal cells. Single-cell analysis revealed that the injury-induced niche is governed by mesenchymal proliferation and Notch signaling, which suppressed Wnt/Fgf signaling in the injured niche. Conversely, loss of Notch signaling rewired alveolar signaling patterns to promote functional regeneration and gas exchange. Signaling patterns in injury-induced niches can differentiate fibrotic from degenerative human lung diseases through altering the direction of Wnt/Fgf signaling. Thus, we have identified an injury-induced niche in the lung with the ability to discriminate human lung disease phenotypes.",

We have developed an eco-evolutionary metapopulation model for Acropora , an ecologically important yet thermally sensitive coral taxon. We found that, although corals have some adaptation capacity, they will suffer severe heatwave-induced declines over the coming decades. For a future in which emissions lead to ~3°C of global warming, natural selection could allow populations to persist, albeit in severely depleted states with elevated extinction risk and potential loss of ecosystem functioning. Yet, for thermally sensitive coral populations to thrive beyond 2050, there must be rapid reductions of greenhouse gas emissions that limit global warming to 2°C.",

Coherent Raman scattering integrated with microfluidics enables high-throughput cell analysis, but faces challenges with small cells (&lt;3 μm) and tissue sections. Here, we report stimulated Raman-activated cell ejection (S-RACE) that enables high-throughput single-cell sorting by integrating stimulated Raman imaging, in situ image decomposition, and laser-induced cell ejection. S-RACE allows ejection of live bacteria or fungi guided by their Raman signatures. Furthermore, S-RACE successfully sorted lipid-rich Rhodotorula glutinis cells from a cell mixture with a throughput of ~13 cells per second, and the sorting results were confirmed by downstream quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Beyond single cells, S-RACE shows high compatibility with tissue sections. Incorporating a closed-loop feedback control circuit further enables real-time SRS imaging-identification-ejection. In summary, S-RACE opens exciting opportunities for diverse single-cell sorting applications.",

First, we explore the characteristics of thin-film growth techniques with emphasis on molecular beam epitaxy. We then examine the fundamental principles and pivotal factors underlying three key approaches of creating membranes: (i) chemical lift-off, (ii) the two-dimensional layer–assisted lift-off, and (iii) spalling. We review the methods of exfoliation and transfer for each approach. Last, we provide an outlook into the future of oxide membranes, highlighting their applications and emerging properties.",

Palmitoylation and the signal peptide were not required for Wnt7a-EV secretion. Coatomer was identified as the EV-binding protein for the EBP. Analysis of cocrystal structures, binding thermodynamics, and mutagenesis found that a dilysine motif mediates EBP binding to coatomer with a conserved function across the Wnt family. We showed that EBP is required for Wnt7a bioactivity when expressed in vivo during regeneration. Overall, our study has elucidated the structural basis and singularity of Wnt secretion on EVs, alternatively to canonical secretion, opening avenues for innovative therapeutic targeting strategies and systemic protein delivery.",

Here, we demonstrate that the imaging depth for NAD(P)H can be extended to more than 700 μm in living engineered human multicellular microtissues by adopting multimode fiber-based, low repetition rate, high peak power, three-photon excitation of NAD(P)H at 1100 nm. This is achieved by having more than 0.5 megawatts peak power at the band of 1100 ± 25 nm through adaptively modulating multimodal nonlinear pulse propagation with a compact fiber shaper. Moreover, the eightfold increase in pulse energy enables faster imaging of monocyte behaviors in the living multicellular models. These results represent a substantial advance for deep and dynamic imaging of intact living biosystems. The modular design is anticipated to allow wide adoption for demanding imaging applications, including cancer research, immune responses, and tissue engineering.",

          "abstract": "Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrate notable potential for developing advanced separation membranes, contemporary COF membranes still lack controlled stacking and highly efficient sieving. Here, Turing-architecture COF membranes were constructed by engineering a reaction-diffusion assembly process via heterogeneous nucleation synthesis with tannic acid (TA). TA covalently binds with amine monomers to form a composite precursor with increased reactivity and decreased diffusivity. This altered the pathway of Schiff base reactions with aldehyde monomers, fulfilling suitable reaction-diffusion conditions, and ultimately formed the labyrinthine stripe or spot-patterned Turing COF film with controlled stacking and uniform pore structure. This endows our COF membrane with highly efficient molecule sieving ability for organic solvent nanofiltration while exhibiting a flux that is 621% greater than that of commercial membranes. Thus, this study provides a paradigm for the in situ synthesis of highly efficient COF membranes for diversely sustainable separations.",

However, most HEMs are burdened by cost-, energy-, and carbon-intensive extraction, synthesis, and manufacturing protocols. Recycling and reusing HEMs are challenging because their design relies on high fractions of expensive and limited-supply elements in massive solid solutions. Therefore, we review the basic sustainability aspects of HEMs. Solutions include using feedstock with lower carbon and energy footprints, sustainable primary synthesis routes from minerals, attenuation of the equimolar alloying rule, and a preference for scrap and dumped waste for secondary and tertiary synthesis. The high solubility, compositional flexibility, and chemical robustness of HEMs offer pathways for using higher fractions of mixed and contaminated scrap and waste feedstocks, which are not admissible for synthesizing conventional materials. We also discuss thermodynamic and kinetic design strategies to reconcile good material properties with high impurity tolerance and variable compositions.",

It can potentially be mitigated by the spectral complementarity from infrared (IR) spectroscopy. However, the vastly different optical windows make it challenging to develop such a platform. Here, we introduce in situ pump-probe IR and Raman excitation (INSPIRE) microscopy, a nascent cross-modality spectroscopic imaging approach by encoding the ultrafast Raman and the IR photothermal relaxation into a single probe beam for simultaneous detection. INSPIRE inherits the merits of complementary modalities and demonstrates high-content molecular imaging of chemicals, cells, tissues, and organisms. Furthermore, INSPIRE applies to label-free and molecular tag imaging, offering possibilities for optical sensing and imaging in biomedicine and materials science.",

          "abstract": "Dysfunction of the centrosome, the major microtubule-organizing center of the cell, is implicated in microcephaly. Haploinsufficiency of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL/KMT2A) protein causes Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS), a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with microcephaly. However, whether MLL has a function at the centrosome is not clear. Here, we show that loss of the MLL/WDR5 complex affects microtubule nucleation and regrowth. MLL/WDR5 localize to the pericentriolar material and interact with centriolar satellite protein Cep72 and γ-tubulin ring complex proteins (γ-TuRCs). MLL/WDR5 promote the localization of γ-TuRCs and structural proteins like AKAP9 to the centrosome during interphase and mitosis, a phenotype also observed in cells derived from patients with WSS. During mitosis, loss of MLL, WDR5, and Cep72 affects spindle formation and leads to misaligned chromosomes. Last, we show that MLL and WDR5 recruit Cep72 to the centrosome. Our studies provide insight into an undiscovered role of MLL at the centrosome and elucidate how centriolar satellite proteins like Cep72 can be recruited to the centrosome.",

Emerging methods using sequential rounds of staining, imaging, and signal removal can probe tens of targets but require specialized hardware and time-consuming workflows and face challenges with sample distortion and artifacts. We present a highly multiplexed fluorescence microscopy method using semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) in a single round of staining and imaging. Pdots are small, bright, and photostable fluorescent probes with a wide range of tunable Stokes shifts (20 to 450 nanometers). Multiple series of Pdots with varying excitation wavelengths allow for fast (&lt;1 minute) and single-round imaging of up to 21 targets in the brain and kidney. This method is based on a simple immunofluorescence workflow, efficient use of spectral space, standard hardware, and straightforward analysis, making it widely applicable for bioimaging laboratories.",

          "abstract": "The ability to consistently recognize an object despite variable sensory input is termed perceptual constancy. This ability is not innate; rather, it develops with experience early in life. We show that, when mice are naïve to an odor object, perceptual constancy is absent across increasing concentrations. The perceptual change coincides with a rapid reduction in activity from a single olfactory receptor channel that is most sensitive to the odor. This drop in activity is not a property of circuit interactions within the olfactory bulb; instead, it is due to a sensitivity mismatch of olfactory receptor neurons within the nose. We show that, after forming an association of this odor with food, the sensitivity of the receptor channel is matched to the odor object, preventing transmission failure and promoting perceptual stability. These data show that plasticity of the primary sensory organ enables learning of perceptual constancy.",

The observation of frozen specimens in a cryostat at a constant low temperature immediately after rapid freezing enabled the improvement of SNR and enhanced the spatial and spectral resolution.

Electrochemical measurements of dopamine release at individual cells have proven especially informative. We describe incorporation of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry for detection of dopamine release with subcellular spatial resolution and millisecond time resolution. The platform is benchmarked with standard redox probes and then applied to imaging stimulated release from subcellular locations of a coculture of dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes. Voltammetry reveals heterogeneity in release based on time, location, and neuron identity.

Here, we show that in mice, light is critical for glucose and lipid homeostasis by regulating the sympathetic nervous system, independent of circadian disruption. Light deprivation from birth elicits insulin hypersecretion, glucagon hyposecretion, lower gluconeogenesis, and reduced lipolysis by 6 to 8 weeks in male, but not female, mice. These metabolic defects are consistent with blunted sympathetic activity, and indeed, sympathetic responses to a cold stimulus are substantially attenuated in dark-reared mice. Further, long-term dark rearing leads to body weight gain, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Notably, metabolic dysfunction can be partially alleviated by 5 weeks exposure to a regular light-dark cycle. These studies provide insight into circadian-independent mechanisms by which light directly influences whole-body physiology and better understanding of metabolic disorders linked to aberrant environmental light conditions.",

Conducting organic polymers are a promising alternative because of their mechanical, chemical, and physical properties, which better match the ones of biological systems. They also can be synthesized in vivo to form bio-templated structures through biologically compatible manufacturing processes.

          "abstract": "Interfacial recombination and ion migration between perovskite and electron-transporting materials have been the persisting challenges in further improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Here, we design a series of molecularly tailorable clusters as an interlayer that can simultaneously enhance the interaction with C 60 and perovskite. These clusters have precisely controlled structures, decent charge carrier mobility, considerable solubility, suitable energy levels, and functional ligands, which can help passivate perovskite surface defects, form a uniform capping net to immobilize C 60 , and build a robust coupling between perovskite and C 60 . The target inverted PVSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.6% without the need for additional surface passivation. Crucially, the unencapsulated device displays excellent stability under light, heat, and bias, maintaining 98% of its initial PCE after 1500 hours of maximum power point tracking. These results show great promise in the development of advanced interfacial materials for highly efficient perovskite photovoltaics.",

Using nanodiamonds (ND) with fluorescent nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers as quantum sensors, rapidly flowing microdroplets containing analyte molecules are analyzed. A noise-suppressed mode of optically detected magnetic resonance is enabled by pairing controllable flow with microwave control of NV electronic spins, to detect analyte-induced signals of a few hundredths of a percent of the ND fluorescence. Using this method, paramagnetic ions in droplets are detected with low limit-of-detection using small analyte volumes, with exceptional measurement stability over &gt;10 3 s. In addition, these droplets are used as microconfinement chambers by co-encapsulating ND quantum sensors with various analytes such as single cells, suggesting wide-ranging applications including single-cell metabolomics and real-time intracellular measurements from bioreactors.

We found transcriptional conservation between all three species, within the broader neurochemical cell types. Unique dopaminoceptive and cholinergic subclusters were identified and conserved across both primate species but had no homolog in mice.

For clinical intraoperative application, compact devices are required. In this preclinical study, a cohort of 15 patients was examined with a newly developed rigid CARS/TPEF/SHG endomicroscope. To detect head and neck tumor from the multimodal data, deep learning–based semantic segmentation models were used. This preclinical study yields in a diagnostic sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 96%. To combine diagnostics with therapy, machine learning–inspired image-guided selective tissue removal was used by integrating femtosecond laser ablation into the endomicroscope.

          "abstract": "The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is implicated in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. During I/R, elevated mitochondrial Ca 2+ triggers mPTP opening, leading to necrotic cell death. Although nonessential regulators of this pore are characterized, the molecular identity of the pore-forming component remains elusive. Two of these genetically verified regulators are cyclophilin D (CypD) and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) family. We investigated the ANT/CypD relationship in mPTP dynamics and I/R injury. Despite lacking all ANT isoforms, Ca 2+ -dependent mPTP opening persisted in cardiac mitochondria but was desensitized. This desensitization conferred resistance to I/R injury in ANT-deficient mice. CypD is hypothesized to trigger mPTP opening through isomerization of ANTs at proline-62. To test this, we generated mice that expressed a P62A mutated version of ANT1. These mice showed similar mPTP dynamics and I/R sensitivity as the wild type, indicating that P62 is dispensable for CypD regulation. Together, these data indicate that the ANT family contributes to mPTP opening independently of CypD.",

Here, we detect these hypershifted spins in a frozen glycerol-water mixture doped with TEMPOL at ~1.4 K using spin diffusion enhanced saturation transfer (SPIDEST), which indirectly reveals their spectrum. Additionally, we directly observe 1 H NMR lines spanning 10 MHz. The spectrum is confirmed by simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which verify that the signals originate from intramolecular protons on TEMPOL. Using two-dimensional NMR, we demonstrate polarization transfer from hypershifted to bulk nuclei across a spin diffusion barrier. This methodology provides new insights into the structures of radicals and could aid in designing more efficient DNP polarizing agents. It also complements information on hyperfine interaction accessible by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR).",

However, drug resistance is an emerging concern in this approach. Here, we show that MRTX849, a covalent inhibitor targeting the KRAS-G12C mutation, leads to the reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in MRTX849-resistant NSCLC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. A genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter ABCC1 mediates MRTX849 resistance. Functional studies demonstrated that the transcription factor JUN drives ABCC1 expression, resulting in multidrug resistance. An unbiased drug screen identified the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib that potentiates MRTX849 efficacy by inhibiting SRC-dependent JUN activation, avoiding multidrug resistance and tumor suppression in vitro as well as in suitable preclinical mouse models and patient-derived organoids. SRC inhibitors (DGY-06-116, dasatinib, and bosutinib) also exhibit synergistic effects with MRTX849 in eliminating various tumor cell lines carrying KRAS-G12C mutations. Thus, SRC inhibitors amplify the therapeutic utility of G12Ci.",

We fabricated the immunosensors using fiber laser engraving of carbon nanotubes and CO 2 laser cutting of microfluidic channels, along with the electrochemical deposition of gold nanoparticles to conjugate with biomarker-specific aptamers and antibody. Using unsupervised clustering based on four biomarker concentrations, we predicted thrombotic events in 49 of 53 patients.

Conventional force fields have shown limitations in accurately representing water’s properties across different salt types (chaotropes and kosmotropes) and concentrations, demonstrating the need for better methods. Machine learning force field applications in computational chemistry, especially through deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD), offer a promising alternative that closely aligns with the accuracy of first-principles methods. Our research used DPMD to study how salts affect water by comparing its results with ab initio molecular dynamics, SPC/Fw, AMOEBA, and MB-Pol models. We studied water’s behavior in salt solutions by examining its spatiotemporally correlated movement. Our findings showed that each model’s accuracy in depicting water’s behavior in salt solutions is strongly connected to spatiotemporal correlation.

The resulting formula for calculating the absolute SRS signal is simple and differs from the commonly used relations by only one factor. We demonstrate the utility of this formula in a broad range of crucial applications of SRS microscopy, including stimulated Raman enhancement factor (&gt;10 8 times), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of typical imaging experiments, population saturation under high power excitation, and energy deposition during stimulated Raman photothermal microscopy.

Here, we demonstrate natural gradient polaritonic surfaces based on superlattices of solitons—localized structural deformations—in a prototypical moiré system, twisted bilayer graphene on boron nitride. We demonstrate on-off switching and continuous modulation of local polariton-soliton interactions, which results from marked modifications of topological and conventional soliton states through variation of local strain direction. Furthermore, we reveal the capability of these structures to spatially modify the near-field profile, phase, and propagation direction of polaritons in record-small footprints, enabling generation and electrical switching of directional polaritons. Our findings open up new avenues toward nanoscale manipulation of light-matter interactions and spatial polariton engineering through gradient moiré superlattices.",

To address these challenges, we present parallel ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy (PUV-PAM) with simultaneous scanning of eight optical foci to acquire histology-like images of slide-free fresh specimens, improving the ultraviolet PAM imaging speed limited by low laser repetition rates. The PUV-PAM has achieved an imaging speed of 0.4 square millimeters per second (i.e., 4.2 minutes per square centimeter) at 1.3-micrometer resolution using a 50-kilohertz laser. In addition, we demonstrated the PUV-PAM with eight needle-shaped beams for an extended depth of field, allowing fast imaging of slide-free tissues with irregular surfaces.

In particular, p53 forms liquid-like condensates in the nucleus of cells, which can bind to DNA and perform transcriptional activity. However, cancer-associated mutations promote misfolding and partially rigidify the p53 condensates with impaired DNA binding ability. Irrespective of wild-type and mutant forms, the partitioning of p53 into cytoplasm leads to the condensate formation, which subsequently undergoes rapid solidification. In vitro studies show that abundant nuclear components such as RNA and nonspecific DNA promote multicomponent phase separation of the p53 core domain and maintain their liquid-like property, whereas specific DNA promotes its dissolution into tetrameric functional p53.
