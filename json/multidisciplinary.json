          "authors": "Gemma Dipoppa, Saad Gulzar",
          "abstract": "Air pollution in South Asia is a health emergency, responsible for 2 million deaths every year1. Crop residue burning accounts for 40–60% of peak pollution during the winter harvest months2,3. Despite being illegal, this practice remains widespread4,5. Any solution to curb the problem necessitates government action at scale. Here we study whether leveraging the incentives of bureaucrats tasked with controlling burning can mitigate this phenomenon. Using a decade of wind, fire and health data from satellites and surveys from the Demographic and Health Surveys Program, we show that crop burning responds to bureaucrat incentives: fires increase by 15% when wind is most likely to direct pollution to neighbouring jurisdictions, and decrease by 14.5% when it pollutes their own. These effects intensify with stronger bureaucratic incentives and capacity. We also find that bureaucrat action against burning deters future polluters, further reducing fires by 13%. Finally, using an atmospheric model, we estimate that one log increase in in utero exposure to pollution from burning raises child mortality by 30–36 deaths per 1,000 births, underscoring the importance of bureaucrat action. Contrary to the growing beliefs that the problem of crop burning is intractable6,7, these findings highlight specific ways in which existing bureaucrats, when properly incentivized, can improve environmental management and public health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Low soil moisture and high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) cause plant water stress and lead to a variety of drought responses, including a reduction in transpiration and photosynthesis 1,2 . When soils dry below critical soil moisture thresholds, ecosystems transition from energy to water limitation as stomata close to alleviate water stress 3,4 . However, the mechanisms behind these thresholds remain poorly defined at the ecosystem scale. Here, by analysing observations of critical soil moisture thresholds globally, we show the prominent role of soil texture in modulating the onset of ecosystem water limitation through the soil hydraulic conductivity curve, whose steepness increases with sand fraction. This clarifies how ecosystem sensitivity to VPD versus soil moisture is shaped by soil texture, with ecosystems in sandy soils being relatively more sensitive to soil drying, whereas ecosystems in clayey soils are relatively more sensitive to VPD. For the same reason, plants in sandy soils have limited potential to adjust to water limitations, which has an impact on how climate change affects terrestrial ecosystems. In summary, although vegetation–atmosphere exchanges are driven by atmospheric conditions and mediated by plant adjustments, their fate is ultimately dependent on the soil.",

          "abstract": "Biobanks aim to improve our understanding of health and disease by collecting and analysing diverse biological and phenotypic information in large samples. So far, biobanks have largely pursued a population-based sampling strategy, where the individual is the unit of sampling, and familial relatedness occurs sporadically and by chance. This strategy has been remarkably efficient and successful, leading to thousands of scientific discoveries across multiple research domains, and plans for the next wave of biobanks are underway. In this Perspective, we discuss the strengths and limitations of a complementary sampling strategy for future biobanks based on oversampling of close genetic relatives. Such family-based samples facilitate research that clarifies causal relationships between putative risk factors and outcomes, particularly in estimates of genetic effects, because they enable analyses that reduce or eliminate confounding due to familial and demographic factors. Family-based biobank samples would also shed new light on fundamental questions across multiple fields that are often difficult to explore in population-based samples. Despite the potential for higher costs and greater analytical complexity, the many advantages of family-based samples should often outweigh their potential challenges.",

          "abstract": "Since 2020, there has been unprecedented global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in wild bird populations with spillover into a variety of mammalian species and sporadically humans1. In March 2024, clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) virus was first detected in dairy cattle in the U.S., with subsequent detection in numerous states2, leading to over a dozen confirmed human cases3,4. In this study, we employed the ferret model, a well-characterized species that permits concurrent investigation of viral pathogenicity and transmissibility5 in the evaluation of A/Texas/37/2024 (TX/37) A(H5N1) virus isolated from a dairy farm worker in Texas6. Here, we show that the virus has a remarkable ability for robust systemic infection in ferrets, leading to high levels of virus shedding and spread to naïve contacts. Ferrets inoculated with TX/37 rapidly exhibited a severe and fatal infection, characterized by viremia and extrapulmonary spread. The virus efficiently transmitted in a direct contact setting and was capable of indirect transmission via fomites. Airborne transmission was corroborated by the detection of infectious virus shed into the air by infected animals, albeit at lower levels compared to the highly transmissible human seasonal and swine-origin H1 subtype strains. Our results show that despite maintaining an avian-like receptor binding specificity, TX/37 displays heightened virulence, transmissibility, and airborne shedding relative to other clade 2.3.4.4b virus isolated prior to the 2024 cattle outbreaks7, underscoring the need for continued public health vigilance.",

However, the effects of underlying genetic diseases, replication stress, and aging on hematopoietic reconstitution and lineage specification remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed hematopoietic reconstitution in 53 patients treated with lentiviral-HSC-GT for diverse conditions such as metachromatic leukodystrophy2,3 (MLD), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome4,5 (WAS), and β-thalassemia6 (β-Thal) over a follow-up period of up to 8 years, using vector integration sites as markers of clonal identity. We found that long-term hematopoietic reconstitution was supported by 770 to 35,000 active HSCs. While 50% of transplanted clones demonstrated multilineage potential across all conditions, the remaining clones exhibited a disease-specific preferential lineage output and long-term commitment: myeloid for MLD, lymphoid for WAS, and erythroid for β-Thal, particularly in adult patients. Our results indicate that HSC clonogenic activity, lineage output, long-term lineage commitment, and rates of somatic mutations are influenced by the underlying disease, patient age at the time of therapy, the extent of genetic defect correction, and the hematopoietic stress imposed by the inherited disease. This suggests that HSCs adapt to the pathological condition during hematopoietic reconstitution.",

However, writing large-scale data directly into DNA sequences by de novo synthesis remains uneconomical in time and cost4. We present an alternative, parallel strategy that enables the writing of arbitrary data on DNA using premade nucleic acids. Through self-assembly guided enzymatic methylation, epigenetic modifications, as information bits, can be introduced precisely onto universal DNA templates to enact molecular movable-type printing. By programming with a finite set of 700 DNA movable types and five templates, we achieved the synthesis-free writing of approximately 275,000 bits on an automated platform with 350 bits written per reaction. The data encoded in complex epigenetic patterns were retrieved high-throughput by nanopore sequencing, and algorithms were developed to finely resolve 240 modification patterns per sequencing reaction. With the epigenetic information bits framework, distributed and bespoke DNA storage was implemented by 60 volunteers lacking professional biolab experience. Our framework presents a new modality of DNA data storage that is parallel, programmable, stable and scalable. Such an unconventional modality opens up avenues towards practical data storage and dual-mode data functions in biomolecular systems.",

          "abstract": "The ability of stony corals to thrive in the oligotrophic (low-nutrient, low-productivity) surface waters of the tropical ocean is commonly attributed to their symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates 1,2 . The evolutionary history of this symbiosis might clarify its organismal and environmental roles 3 , but its prevalence through time, and across taxa, morphologies and oceanic settings, is currently unclear 4–6 . Here we report measurements of the nitrogen isotope ( 15 N/ 14 N) ratio of coral-bound organic matter (CB-δ 15 N) in samples from Mid-Devonian reefs (Givetian, around 385 million years ago), which represent a constraint on the evolution of coral photosymbiosis. Colonial tabulate and fasciculate (dendroid) rugose corals have low CB-δ 15 N values (2.51 ± 0.97‰) in comparison with co-occurring solitary and (pseudo)colonial (cerioid or phaceloid) rugose corals (5.52 ± 1.63‰). The average of the isotopic difference per deposit (3.01 ± 0.58‰) is statistically indistinguishable from that observed between modern symbiont-barren and symbiont-bearing corals (3.38 ± 1.05‰). On the basis of this evidence, we infer that Mid-Devonian tabulate and some fasciculate (dendroid) rugose corals hosted active photosymbionts, while solitary and some (pseudo)colonial (cerioid or phaceloid) rugose corals did not. The low CB-δ 15 N values of the Devonian tabulate and fasciculate rugose corals relative to the modern range suggest that Mid-Devonian reefs formed in biogeochemical regimes analogous to the modern oligotrophic subtropical gyres. Widespread oligotrophy during the Devonian may have promoted coral photosymbiosis, the occurrence of which may explain why Devonian reefs were the most productive reef ecosystems of the Phanerozoic.",

Selection for immunity to pathogens has driven the evolution of sophisticated immunity mechanisms throughout biology, including in bacterial defence against bacteriophages 3 . Here we characterize the widely distributed anti-phage defence system CmdTAC, which provides robust defence against infection by the T-even family of phages 4 . Our results support a model in which CmdC detects infection by sensing viral capsid proteins, ultimately leading to the activation of a toxic ADP-ribosyltransferase effector protein, CmdT. We show that newly synthesized capsid protein triggers dissociation of the chaperone CmdC from the CmdTAC complex, leading to destabilization and degradation of the antitoxin CmdA, with consequent liberation of the CmdT ADP-ribosyltransferase. Notably, CmdT does not target a protein, DNA or structured RNA, the known targets of other ADP-ribosyltransferases. Instead, CmdT modifies the N6 position of adenine in GA dinucleotides within single-stranded RNAs, leading to arrest of mRNA translation and inhibition of viral replication. Our work reveals a novel mechanism of anti-viral defence and a previously unknown but broadly distributed class of ADP-ribosyltransferases that target mRNA.",

          "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a newly discovered class of extragalactic radio transients characterized by their high energy and short duration (from microseconds to milliseconds)1. The physical origin of these FRBs remains unknown and is a subject of ongoing research, with magnetars emerging as leading candidates2,3. Previous studies have used various methodologies to address the problem of FRB origin, including demographic analyses of FRB host galaxies and their local environments4,5,6, assessments of FRB rate evolution with redshift7,8,9 and searches for proposed multi-messenger FRB counterparts10. However, these studies are susceptible to substantial biases stemming from unaccounted radio and optical selection effects. Here we present empirical evidence for a substantial selection bias against detecting FRBs in galaxies with large inclination angles (edge-on) using a sample of hosts identified for FRBs discovered by untargeted surveys. This inclination-related bias probably leads to a significant underestimation (by about a factor of two) of the FRB rates reported in the literature and disfavours globular clusters as the dominant origin of FRB sources, as previously speculated6. These conclusions have important implications for FRB progenitor models and targeted FRB follow-up strategies. We further investigate the impact of this bias on the relative rate of FRBs in different host environments. Our analysis suggests that scattering in FRB hosts is probably responsible for the observed bias11,12. However, a larger sample of localized FRBs is required to robustly quantify the contribution of scattering to the inclination-related selection bias.",

          "abstract": "The brain processes an array of stimuli, enabling the selection of appropriate behavioural responses, but the neural pathways linking interoceptive inputs to outputs for feeding are poorly understood 1–3 . Here we delineate a subcortical circuit in which brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) directly connect interoceptive inputs to motor centres, controlling food consumption and jaw movements. VMH BDNF neuron inhibition increases food intake by gating motor sequences of feeding through projections to premotor areas of the jaw. When food is unavailable, VMH BDNF inhibition elicits consummatory behaviours directed at inanimate objects such as wooden blocks, and inhibition of perimesencephalic trigeminal area (pMe5) projections evokes rhythmic jaw movements. The activity of these neurons is decreased during food consumption and increases when food is in proximity but not consumed. Activity is also increased in obese animals and after leptin treatment. VMH BDNF neurons receive monosynaptic inputs from both agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and proopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc), and constitutive VMH BDNF activation blocks the orexigenic effect of AgRP activation. These data indicate an Arc → VMH BDNF → pMe5 circuit that senses the energy state of an animal and regulates consummatory behaviours in a state-dependent manner.",

          "abstract": "Allergic diseases, affecting over a quarter of individuals in industrialized countries, have become significant public health concerns1,2. The high-affinity Fc receptor for IgE (FcεRI), mainly present on mast cells and basophils, plays a crucial role in allergic diseases3-5. Monomeric IgE binding to FcεRI regulates mast cell survival, differentiation, and maturation6-8. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that, prior to IgE binding, FcεRI mostly exists as a homo-dimer on human mast cell membrane. The structure of human FcεRI confirms the dimeric organization, with each promoter comprising one α subunit, one β subunit, and two γ subunits. The transmembrane helices of the α subunits form a layered arrangement with those of the γ and β subunits. The dimeric interface is mediated by a four-helix bundle of the α and γ subunits at the intracellular juxtamembrane region. Cholesterol-like molecules embedded within the transmembrane domain may stabilize the dimeric assembly. Upon IgE binding, the dimeric FcεRI dissociates into two protomers, each binding to an IgE molecule. Importantly, this process elicits transcriptional activation of Egr1/3 and Ccl2 in rat basophils, which can be attenuated by inhibiting the FcεRI dimer-to-monomer transition. Collectively, our study unveils the mechanism of antigen-independent, IgE-mediated FcεRI activation.",

SynthID-Text does not affect LLM training and modifies only the sampling procedure; watermark detection is computationally efficient, without using the underlying LLM. To enable watermarking at scale, we develop an algorithm integrating watermarking with speculative sampling, an efficiency technique frequently used in production systems 5 . Evaluations across multiple LLMs empirically show that SynthID-Text provides improved detectability over comparable methods, and standard benchmarks and human side-by-side ratings indicate no change in LLM capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of watermarking in large-scale-production systems, we conducted a live experiment that assessed feedback from nearly 20 million Gemini 6 responses, again confirming the preservation of text quality.

          "abstract": "Complex multicellularity has emerged independently across a few eukaryotic lineages and is often associated with the rise of elaborate, tightly coordinated developmental processes 1,2 . How multicellularity and development are interconnected in evolution is a major question in biology. The hourglass model of embryonic evolution depicts how developmental processes are conserved during evolution, and predicts morphological and molecular divergence in early and late embryogenesis, bridged by a conserved mid-embryonic (phylotypic) period linked to the formation of the basic body plan 3,4 . Initially found in animal embryos 5–8 , molecular hourglass patterns have recently been proposed for land plants and fungi 9,10 . However, whether the hourglass pattern is an intrinsic feature of all complex multicellular eukaryotes remains unknown. Here we tested the presence of a molecular hourglass in the brown algae, a eukaryotic lineage that has evolved multicellularity independently from animals, fungi and plants 1,11,12 . By exploring transcriptome evolution patterns of brown algae with distinct morphological complexities, we uncovered an hourglass pattern during embryogenesis in morphologically complex species. Filamentous algae without canonical embryogenesis display transcriptome conservation in multicellular stages of the life cycle, whereas unicellular stages are more rapidly evolving. Our findings suggest that transcriptome conservation in brown algae is associated with cell differentiation stages, but is not necessarily linked to embryogenesis. Together with previous work in animals, plants and fungi, we provide further evidence for the generality of a developmental hourglass pattern across complex multicellular eukaryotes.",

However, the formation of polyhalides during electrochemical charging and the associated phase separation into X2 limits the operable state of charge (SoC), results in vaporization and self-discharge inefficiencies, and spurs complete device failure1,2,3. Here we introduce soft–hard zwitterionic trappers (SH-ZITs) as complexing agents composed of a polyhalide-complexing ‘soft’ cationic motif and a water-soluble ‘hard’ anionic motif to enable homogeneous halide cycling. More than 300 structures were designed and 13 were characterized, showcasing the ability to complex polyhalides in homogeneous aqueous solution, to deter cation-exchange membrane crossover and to alter the electrochemical electrode mechanism. In flow battery cycling at a standard catholyte SoC of 66.6 per cent (stoichiometrically X3–), an average coulombic efficiency of more than 99.9 per cent at 40 milliamperes per square centimetre with no apparent decay was observed after more than 1,000 cycles over 2 months, with stability at elevated temperatures also demonstrated. Interestingly, SH-ZITs enable homogeneous cycling of the halide catholyte up to 90 per cent SoC at 2 moles per litre (47.7 ampere-hours per litre) for bromide, revealing previously unknown polyhalide regimes to be studied. Ultimately, SH-ZIT enables ultrahigh catholyte capacity utilization up to over 120 ampere-hours per litre at 80 per cent SoC with homogeneous cycling as well as the ability to pair with a zinc anode in a hybrid flow battery.",

Despite extensive knowledge regarding CD8 T cells, how CD4 T cells contribute to this process is less well understood. Here we identified a population of PD1+TCF1+ CD4 T cells with stem-like properties that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into canonical CD4 effector cells. Primarily residing in tumour-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), these tumour-specific CD4 T cells are restricted by T regulatory (Treg) cells to a stem-like fate that predominantly generated induced Treg (iTreg) cells, limiting effector CD8 T cell responses to the tumour. By contrast, upon Treg depletion, stem-like CD4 T cells differentiated into T helper 1 (TH1) cells, and via IFNγ production induced robust effector differentiation from TCF1+ CD8 T cells in TDLNs, a state we defined as ‘active’. Notably, enforcing TBET expression in transferred stem-like CD4 T cells was sufficient to overcome the established restricted T cell state. Despite the presence of Treg cells, endogenous stem-like CD4 T cells actively generated TH1 cells, which were required to restore TDLN effector CD8 T cell differentiation, enhance tumour control and rescue response to immunotherapy. In agreement, TH1 differentiation in patients with kidney cancer predicted successful immunotherapy responses and improved progression-free survival. Together, these findings identify a stem-like CD4 T cell population that through alternative differentiation fates controls the switch between restricted and active T cell states with implications for cancer immunotherapies.",

Fatty-acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) has a key role in this process by coordinating the efficient import and trafficking of lipids that fuel mitochondrial respiration to sustain the bioenergetic requirements of protective CD8+ T cells4,5. However, the mechanisms that govern this immunometabolic axis remain unexplored. Here we report that the cytoskeletal organizer transgelin 2 (TAGLN2) is necessary for optimal fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial respiration and anticancer function in CD8+ T cells. TAGLN2 interacts with FABP5 to facilitate its cell surface localization and function in activated CD8+ T cells. Analyses of ovarian cancer specimens revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses induced by the tumour microenvironment repress TAGLN2 in infiltrating CD8+ T cells, thereby enforcing their dysfunctional state. Restoring TAGLN2 expression in ER-stressed CD8+ T cells increased their lipid uptake, mitochondrial respiration and cytotoxic capacity. Accordingly, chimeric antigen receptor T cells overexpressing TAGLN2 bypassed the detrimental effects of tumour-induced ER stress and demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in mice with metastatic ovarian cancer. Our study establishes the role of cytoskeletal TAGLN2 in T cell lipid metabolism and highlights the potential to enhance cellular immunotherapy in solid malignancies by preserving the TAGLN2–FABP5 axis.",

Here, we characterized A/Texas/37/2024 (huTX37-H5N1), a virus isolated from the eyes of an infected farm worker who developed conjunctivitis5. huTX37-H5N1 replicated efficiently in primary human alveolar epithelial cells, but less efficiently in corneal epithelial cells. Despite causing mild disease in the infected worker, huTX37-H5N1 was lethal in mice and ferrets and spread systemically with high titres in respiratory and non-respiratory organs. Importantly, in four independent experiments in ferrets, huTX37-H5N1 transmitted via respiratory droplets in 17%–33% of transmission pairs and five of six exposed ferrets that became infected died. PB2-631L (encoded by bovine isolates), promoted influenza polymerase activity in human cells, suggesting a role in mammalian adaptation like that of PB2-627K (encoded by huTX37-H5N1). Additionally, bovine HPAI H5N1 viruses were found to be susceptible to polymerase inhibitors both in vitro and in mice. Thus, HPAI H5N1 virus derived from dairy cattle transmits by respiratory droplets in mammals without prior adaptation and causes lethal disease in animal models.",

However, the development of a durable material with high capacity, fast kinetics and low regeneration temperature for CO2 capture, especially from the intricate and dynamic atmosphere, is still lacking. Here a porous, crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) with olefin linkages has been synthesized, structurally characterized and post-synthetically modified by the covalent attachment of amine initiators for producing polyamines within the pores. This COF (termed COF-999) can capture CO2 from open air. COF-999 has a capacity of 0.96 mmol g–1 under dry conditions and 2.05 mmol g–1 under 50% relative humidity, both from 400 ppm CO2. This COF was tested for more than 100 adsorption–desorption cycles in the open air of Berkeley, California, and found to fully retain its performance. COF-999 is an exceptional material for the capture of CO2 from open air as evidenced by its cycling stability, facile uptake of CO2 (reaches half capacity in 18.8 min) and low regeneration temperature (60 °C).",

Observational evidence for neutron star kicks is substantial1,2, yet is limited for black hole natal kicks, and some proposed black hole formation scenarios result in very small kicks3,4,5. Here we report that the canonical black hole low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) V404 Cygni is part of a wide hierarchical triple with a tertiary companion at least 3,500 astronomical units (au) away from the inner binary. Given the orbital configuration, the black hole probably received a sub-5 km s−1 kick to have avoided unbinding the tertiary. This discovery lends support to the idea that at least some black holes form with nearly no natal kick. Furthermore, the tertiary in this system lends credence to evolutionary models of LMXBs involving a hierarchical triple structure6. Remarkably, the tertiary is evolved, indicating that the system formed 3–5 billion years ago and that the black hole has removed at least half a solar mass of matter from its evolved secondary companion. During the event in which the black hole formed, it is required that at least half of the mass of the black hole progenitor collapsed into the black hole; it may even have undergone a complete implosion, enabling the tertiary to remain loosely bound.",

Previous studies identified two potential neural crest cell types in Ciona, sensory pigment cells and bipolar tail neurons5,6. Recent findings suggest that bipolar tail neurons are homologous to cranial sensory ganglia rather than derivatives of neural crest7,8. Here we show that the pigment cell lineage also produces neural progenitor cells that form regions of the juvenile nervous system following metamorphosis. Neural progenitors are also a major derivative of neural crest in vertebrates, suggesting that the last common ancestor of tunicates and vertebrates contained a multipotent progenitor population at the neural plate border. It would therefore appear that a key property of neural crest, multipotentiality, preceded the emergence of vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "Regulated start-codon selection has the potential to reshape the proteome through the differential production of upstream open reading frames, canonical proteins, and alternative translational isoforms1,2,3. However, conditions under which start codon selection is altered remain poorly defined. Here, using transcriptome-wide translation-initiation-site profiling4, we reveal a global increase in the stringency of start-codon selection during mammalian mitosis. Low-efficiency initiation sites are preferentially repressed in mitosis, resulting in pervasive changes in the translation of thousands of start sites and their corresponding protein products. This enhanced stringency of start-codon selection during mitosis results from increased association between the 40S ribosome and the key regulator of start-codon selection, eIF1. We find that increased eIF1–40S ribosome interaction during mitosis is mediated by the release of a nuclear pool of eIF1 upon nuclear envelope breakdown. Selectively depleting the nuclear pool of eIF1 eliminates the change to translational stringency during mitosis, resulting in altered synthesis of thousands of protein isoforms. In addition, preventing mitotic translational rewiring results in substantially increased cell death and decreased mitotic slippage in cells that experience a mitotic delay induced by anti-mitotic chemotherapies. Thus, cells globally control stringency of translation initiation, which has critical roles during the mammalian cell cycle in preserving mitotic cell physiology.",

Here we performed multiomic single-cell gene expression, epitope mapping and chromatin accessibility profiling in 45 healthy donor, acutely infarcted and chronically failing human hearts. We identified a disease-associated fibroblast trajectory that diverged into distinct populations reminiscent of myofibroblasts and matrifibrocytes, the latter expressing fibroblast activator protein (FAP) and periostin (POSTN). Genetic lineage tracing of FAP+ fibroblasts in vivo showed that they contribute to the POSTN lineage but not the myofibroblast lineage. We assessed the applicability of experimental systems to model cardiac fibroblasts and demonstrated that three different in vivo mouse models of cardiac injury were superior compared with cultured human heart and dermal fibroblasts in recapitulating the human disease phenotype. Ligand–receptor analysis and spatial transcriptomics predicted that interactions between C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) macrophages and fibroblasts mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signalling drove the emergence of FAP/POSTN fibroblasts within spatially defined niches. In vivo, we deleted the IL-1 receptor on fibroblasts and the IL-1β ligand in CCR2+ monocytes and macrophages, and inhibited IL-1β signalling using a monoclonal antibody, and showed reduced FAP/POSTN fibroblasts, diminished myocardial fibrosis and improved cardiac function.

Here we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays to design and empirically test thousands of CREs 4–8 . Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells.

In diseased organs, stress-induced gene expression changes fuel maladaptive cell state transitions1 and pathological interaction between cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction in the lungs, liver, kidneys and heart, and exacerbates many cancers2, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are poorly understood. Here we show that conditional deletion of the transcriptional co-activator Brd4 in infiltrating Cx3cr1+ macrophages ameliorates heart failure in mice and significantly reduces fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1+ cells identified a large enhancer proximal to interleukin-1β (IL-1β, encoded by Il1b), and a series of CRISPR-based deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controls Il1b expression. Secreted IL-1β activated a fibroblast RELA-dependent (also known as p65) enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL-1β neutralization improved cardiac function and tissue fibrosis in heart failure. Systemic IL-1β inhibition or targeted Il1b deletion in Cx3cr1+ cells prevented stress-induced Meox1 expression and fibroblast activation. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent cross-talk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL-1β reveals how inflammation drives profibrotic cell states and supports strategies that modulate this process in heart disease and other chronic inflammatory disorders featuring tissue remodelling.",

Daptomycin is a last-resort antibiotic for VREfm infections with a novel mode of action2, but for which resistance has been widely reported but is unexplained. Here we show that rifaximin, an unrelated antibiotic used prophylactically to prevent hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver disease3, causes cross-resistance to daptomycin in VREfm. Amino acid changes arising within the bacterial RNA polymerase in response to rifaximin exposure cause upregulation of a previously uncharacterized operon (prdRAB) that leads to cell membrane remodelling and cross-resistance to daptomycin through reduced binding of the antibiotic. VREfm with these mutations are spread globally, making this a major mechanism of resistance. Rifaximin has been considered ‘low risk’ for the development of antibiotic resistance. Our study shows that this assumption is flawed and that widespread rifaximin use, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis, may be compromising the clinical use of daptomycin, a major last-resort intervention for multidrug-resistant pathogens. These findings demonstrate how unanticipated antibiotic cross-resistance can undermine global strategies designed to preserve the clinical use of critical antibiotics.",

Here we present the results of uncrewed aerial vehicle–lidar surveys in Central Asia, conducted at two recently discovered archaeological sites in southeastern Uzbekistan: Tashbulak and Tugunbulak. Situated at around 2,000–2,200 m above sea level, these sites illustrate a newly documented geography of large, high-altitude urban centres positioned along the mountainous crossroads of Asia’s medieval Silk Routes (6th–11th century CE (Common Era)4,5. Although hidden by centuries of surface processes, our pairing of very-high-resolution surface modelling with semiautomated feature detection produces a detailed plan of monumental fortifications and architecture spanning 120 ha at Tugunbulak, thereby demonstrating one of the largest highland urban constellations in premodern Central Asia.

          "abstract": "In the region that straddles India and Pakistan, seasonal burning of leftover material from harvesting crops, known as crop residue, results in extreme air pollution. This is especially severe in the winter months, when the air quality index (AQI) reaches hazardous levels (above 300 on a scale of 0–500; anything above 150 is considered unhealthy) and occasionally levels that far surpass the top of the scale (see airquality.cpcb.gov.in/AQI_India and iqair.com/pakistan). At a time when the effects of human activities on the environment and their global implications for well-being present challenges, a study in Nature by Dipoppa and Gulzar1 sheds light on the potential for bureaucratic incentives to address sources of air pollution from crop-residue burning at the local level.",

Writing in Nature, Lotharukpong et al.1 report their studies of brown algae (also called brown seaweeds) — a newly established model system to explore multicellular development. This form of multicellularity arose independently from that found in plants and in animals. These three manifestations of multicellular life are not necessarily expected to have much in common, but if they do, the commonalities are likely to point to key underlying principles. Lotharukpong et al. report that brown algae — which include species such as Fucus serratus, Fucus distichus and those belonging to the genus Ectocarpus — show a pattern of gene expression described as an hourglass (for its egg-timer shape) during their development, resembling the one previously found in animals and in plants.",

The instructions for activating or repressing a gene are encoded in the genome, and each type of cell has its own genomic ‘language’ that is based on highly complex patterns of nucleotides that describe whether a gene will be expressed. Writing in Nature, Gosai et al.1 apply artificial intelligence (AI) methods to learn the ‘regulatory grammar’ of that language — that is, the patterns of nucleotides in the genome that relate to gene-regulatory activity — for different cell types. The authors then apply those models, along with experimental genomics techniques, to create synthetic DNA sequences that can drive gene expression in specific cell types, which has implications for targeted cell and gene therapy.",

High-altitude urban sites are extraordinarily rare in the archaeological record because of a unique set of landscape challenges and technological demands that must be overcome for people to form large communities in mountainous areas. For much of human history, areas of dense population have mainly formed in low-lying areas that are usually along rivers or coasts. Writing in Nature, Frachetti et al.1 help to re-evaluate our understanding of upland urbanization by using drones for an aerial technique called lidar to assess signs of human-generated structures in a mountainous region. This work was conducted at a site in Uzbekistan, right at the heart of the medieval network of trade and exchange known as the Silk Roads and it is the first archaeological lidar survey conducted in Central Asia.",

In ‘autologous’ HSC gene therapy, a person’s own haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are collected and genetically modified to restore normal gene function, and then transplanted back into that person to re-establish the production of blood and immune cells (haematopoiesis) in the bone marrow. But what are the dynamics of haematopoietic regeneration by gene-corrected HSPCs, and how does this process differ between diseases? Writing in Nature, Calabria et al.1 present a large-scale comparative study that tackles this question and uncovers the versatile ability of gene-corrected HSPCs to adapt to a person’s physiological needs, as determined by their disease background.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to augment humans, researchers have studied human–AI systems involving different tasks, systems and populations. Despite such a large body of work, we lack a broad conceptual understanding of when combinations of humans and AI are better than either alone. Here we addressed this question by conducting a preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis of 106 experimental studies reporting 370 effect sizes. We searched an interdisciplinary set of databases (the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, the Web of Science and the Association for Information Systems eLibrary) for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2023. Each study was required to include an original human-participants experiment that evaluated the performance of humans alone, AI alone and human–AI combinations. First, we found that, on average, human–AI combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or AI alone (Hedges’ g = −0.23; 95% confidence interval, −0.39 to −0.07). Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed AI alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when AI outperformed humans alone, we found losses. Limitations of the evidence assessed here include possible publication bias and variations in the study designs analysed. Overall, these findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human–AI collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human–AI systems.",

However, past research offers conflicting accounts of cross-national variation in the strength of—and mechanisms underpinning—the intergenerational persistence of poverty. Here the authors investigate differences in intergenerational poverty in the United States, Australia, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom using administrative- and survey-based panel datasets. Intergenerational poverty is decomposed into family background effects, mediation effects, tax and transfer insurance effects and a residual poverty penalty. The intergenerational persistence of poverty is 0.43 in the United States (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.40–0.46; P < 0.001), compared with 0.16 in the United Kingdom (95% CI = 0.07–0.25; P < 0.001) and 0.08 in Denmark (95% CI = 0.08–0.08; P < 0.001). The US disadvantage is not channelled through family background, mediators, neighbourhood effects or racial or ethnic discrimination. Instead, the United States has comparatively weak tax and transfer insurance effects and a more severe residual poverty penalty. If the United States were to adopt the tax and transfer insurance effects of its peer countries, its intergenerational poverty persistence could decrease by more than one-third.",

          "abstract": "People often rely on numeric metrics to make decisions and form judgments. Numbers can be difficult to process, leading to their underutilization, but they are also uniquely suited to making comparisons. Do people decide differently when some dimensions of a choice are quantified and others are not? We explore this question across 21 preregistered experiments (8 in the main text, N = 9,303; 13 in supplement, N = 13,936) involving managerial, policy, and consumer decisions. Participants face choices that involve tradeoffs (e.g., choosing between employees, one of whom has a higher likelihood of advancement but lower likelihood of retention), and we randomize which dimension of each tradeoff is presented numerically and which is presented qualitatively (using verbal estimates, discrete visualizations, or continuous visualizations). We show that people systematically shift their preferences toward options that dominate on tradeoff dimensions conveyed numerically—a pattern we dub “quantification fixation.” Further, we show that quantification fixation has financial consequences—it emerges in incentive-compatible hiring tasks and in charitable donation decisions. We identify one key mechanism that underlies quantification fixation and moderates its strength: When making comparative judgments, which are essential to tradeoff decisions, numeric information is more fluent than non-numeric information. Our findings suggest that when we count, we change what counts.",

But how consistent is curiosity’s conception and assessment across scientific research disciplines? We present the results of a large collaborative project assessing the correspondence between curiosity measures in personality psychology and cognitive science. A total of 820 participants completed 15 personality trait measures and 9 cognitive tasks that tested multiple aspects of information demand. We show that shared variance across the cognitive tasks was captured by a dimension reflecting directed (uncertainty-driven) versus random (stochasticity-driven) exploration and individual differences along this axis were significantly and consistently predicted by personality traits. However, the personality metrics that best predicted information demand were not the central curiosity traits of openness to experience, deprivation sensitivity, and joyous exploration, but instead included more peripheral curiosity traits (need for cognition, thrill seeking, and stress tolerance) and measures not traditionally associated with curiosity (extraversion and behavioral inhibition). The results suggest that the umbrella term “curiosity” reflects a constellation of cognitive and emotional processes, only some of which are shared between personality measures and cognitive tasks. The results reflect the distinct methods that are used in these fields, indicating a need for caution in comparing results across fields and for future interdisciplinary collaborations to strengthen our emerging understanding of curiosity.",

To disentangle causality in the wealth of covarying factors that govern social interactions, we developed an open-source video-conference platform enabling researchers to covertly manipulate the social signals produced by participants during interactions. Using this platform, we performed a speed-dating experiment where we aligned or misaligned the facial smiles of participants in real time with face transformation algorithms. Even though participants remained totally unaware that their faces were being manipulated, aligning their smiles causally enhanced the romantic attraction they felt toward each other, compared to unaligned scenarios. Manipulations also influenced how participants synchronized and vocally reacted to each other. This paradigm causally manipulates the emergence of romantic attraction in free social interactions.

          "abstract": "Do political practitioners have good intuitions about how to persuade the public? Longstanding theories that political elites’ messages have large effects on public opinion and the large sums spent to secure some practitioners’ messaging advice suggest they should. However, findings regarding the surprising limits of expert forecasts in other domains suggest they may not. In this paper, we evaluate how well political practitioners can predict which messages are most persuasive. We measured the effects of N = 172 messages about 21 political issues using a large-sample survey experiment ( N = 67 , 215 respondent-message observations). We then asked both political practitioners ( N = 1 , 524 practitioners, N = 22 , 763 predictions) and laypeople ( N = 21 , 247 respondents, N = 63 , 442 predictions) to predict the efficacy of these messages. The practitioners we surveyed ranged widely in their experience and expertise with persuasive message design. We find that: (a) political practitioners and laypeople both performed barely better than chance at predicting persuasive effects; (b) once accounting for laypeople’s inflated expectations about the average size of effects, practitioners did not predict meaningfully better than laypeople; (c) these results held even for self-identified issue experts and highly experienced practitioners; and (d) practitioners’ experience, expertise, information environment, and demographics did not meaningfully explain variation in their accuracy. Our findings have theoretical implications for understanding the conditions likely to produce meaningful elite influence on public opinion as well as practical implications for practitioners.",

          "abstract": "The biological function of membranes is closely related to their softness, which is often studied through the membranes’ thermally driven fluctuations. Typically, the analysis assumes that the relaxation rate of a pure bending deformation is determined by the competition between membrane bending rigidity and viscous dissipation in the surrounding medium. Here, we reexamine this assumption and demonstrate that viscous flows within the membrane dominate the dynamics of bending fluctuations of nonplanar membranes with a radius of curvature smaller than the Saffman–Delbrück length. Using flickering spectroscopy of giant vesicles made of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC:cholesterol mixtures and pure diblock-copolymer membranes, we experimentally detect the signature of membrane dissipation in curvature fluctuations. We show that membrane viscosity can be reliably obtained from the short time behavior of the shape time correlations. The results indicate that the DPPC:cholesterol membranes behave as a Newtonian fluid, while the polymer membranes exhibit more complex rheology. Our study provides physical insights into the time scales of curvature remodeling of biological and synthetic membranes.",

Among them, zinc-activated channel (ZAC) is a Zn 2+ -activated ion channel that is widely expressed in the human body and is conserved among eukaryotes. Due to its gating by extracellular Zn 2+ , ZAC has been considered a Zn 2+ sensor, but it has undergone minimal structural and functional characterization since its molecular cloning. Among the families in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily, only the structure of ZAC has yet to be determined. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of ZAC in the apo state and performed structure-based mutation analyses. We identified a few residues in the extracellular domain whose mutations had a mild impact on Zn 2+ sensitivity. The constriction site in the ion-conducting pore differs from the one in other Cys-loop receptor structures, and further mutational analysis identified a key residue that is important for ion selectivity. In summary, our work provides a structural framework for understanding the ion-conducting mechanism of ZAC.",

          "abstract": "Aerobic glycolysis and immune evasion are two key hallmarks of cancer. However, how these two features are mechanistically linked to promote tumor growth is not well understood. Here, we show that the glycolytic enzyme enolase-1 (ENO1) is dynamically modified with an O -linked β- N -acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation), and simultaneously regulates aerobic glycolysis and immune evasion via differential glycosylation. Glycosylation of threonine 19 (T19) on ENO1 promotes its glycolytic activity via the formation of active dimers. On the other hand, glycosylation of serine 249 (S249) on ENO1 inhibits its interaction with PD-L1, decreases association of PD-L1 with the E3 ligase STUB1, resulting in stabilization of PD-L1. Consequently, blockade of T19 glycosylation on ENO1 inhibits glycolysis, and decreases cell proliferation and tumor growth. Blockade of S249 glycosylation on ENO1 reduces PD-L1 expression and enhances T cell–mediated immunity against tumor cells. Notably, elimination of glycosylation at both sites synergizes with PD-L1 monoclonal antibody therapy to promote antitumor immune response. Clinically, ENO1 glycosylation levels are up-regulated and show a positive correlation with PD-L1 levels in human colorectal cancers. Thus, our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how O-GlcNAcylation bridges aerobic glycolysis and immune evasion to promote tumor growth, suggesting effective therapeutic opportunities.",

          "abstract": "Subduction zones play a pivotal role in the mechanics of plate tectonics by providing the driving force through slab pull and weak megathrusts that facilitate the relative motion between tectonic plates. The initiation of subduction zones is intricately linked to the accumulation of slab pull and development of weakness at plate boundaries and, by consequence, the largest changes in the energetics of mantle convection. However, the transient nature of subduction initiation accompanied by intense subsequent tectonic activity, leaves critical evidence poorly preserved and making subduction initiation difficult to constrain. We overcome these limitations through a comprehensive analysis focused on Puysegur, a well-constrained extant example of subduction initiation offshore South Island, New Zealand. Through time-dependent, three-dimensional thermo-mechanical computations and quantitative comparison to new geophysical and geological observations, including topography, stratigraphy, and seismicity, we demonstrate that subduction initiation develops with a fast strain weakening described with a small characteristic displacement ( Δ s ≈ 4 to 8 km). Potential physical mechanisms contributing to the strain weakening are explored and we find that the observed fast weakening may arise through a combination of grain-size reduction within the lower lithosphere and fluid pressurization at shallower depths. With the shared commonality in the underlying physics of tectonic processes, the rapid strain weakening constrained at Puysegur offers insights into the formation of the first subduction during early Earth and the onset of plate tectonics.",

By linking a predictive model of nutrient- and temperature-driven bottom hypoxia with observed commercial fishery harvest data from Lake Erie (United States–Canada) over the past century (1928–2022) and climate projections (2030–2099), we show how simple, yet robust models and routine monitoring data can be used to identify tradeoffs associated with nutrient management and guide decision-making in even the largest of aquatic ecosystems now and in the future. Our approach enabled us to assess planned nutrient load reduction targets designed to mitigate nutrient-driven hypoxia and show why they appear overly restrictive based on current fishery needs, indicating tradeoffs between water quality and fisheries management goals. At the same time, our temperature results show that projected climate change impacts on hypoxic extent will require more stringent nutrient regulations in the future. Beyond providing a rare example of bottom hypoxia driving changes in fishery harvests at an ecosystem scale, our study illustrates the need for adaptive ecosystem–based management, which can be informed by simple predictive models that can be readily applied over long time periods, account for tradeoffs across multiple management sectors (e.g., water quality, fisheries), and address ecosystem nonstationarity (e.g., climate change impacts on management targets). Such approaches will be critical for maintaining valued ecosystem services in the many aquatic systems worldwide that are vulnerable to multiple drivers of environmental change.",

          "abstract": "Elucidating details of biology’s selective uptake and trafficking of rare earth elements, particularly the lanthanides, has the potential to inspire sustainable biomolecular separations of these essential metals for myriad modern technologies. Here, we biochemically and structurally characterize Methylobacterium ( Methylorubrum ) extorquens LanD, a periplasmic protein from a bacterial gene cluster for lanthanide uptake. This protein provides only four ligands at its surface-exposed lanthanide-binding site, allowing for metal-centered protein dimerization that favors the largest lanthanide, La III . However, the monomer prefers Nd III and Sm III , which are disfavored lanthanides for cellular utilization. Structure-guided mutagenesis of a metal-ligand and an outer-sphere residue weakens metal binding to the LanD monomer and enhances dimerization for Pr III and Nd III by 100-fold. Selective dimerization enriches high-value Pr III and Nd III relative to low-value La III and Ce III in an all-aqueous process, achieving higher separation factors than lanmodulins and comparable or better separation factors than common industrial extractants. Finally, we show that LanD interacts with lanmodulin (LanM), a previously characterized periplasmic protein that shares LanD’s preference for Nd III and Sm III . Our results suggest that LanD’s unusual metal-binding site transfers less-desirable lanthanides to LanM to siphon them away from the pathway for cytosolic import. The properties of LanD show how relatively weak chelators can achieve high selectivity, and they form the basis for the design of protein dimers for separation of adjacent lanthanide pairs and other metal ions.",

Many contaminants have long lifetimes following partitioning to the large surface reservoirs present indoors, which leads to long exposure times to gas-phase oxidants and multiphase chemistry. Studies have shown selective multiphase oxidation of organics on indoor surfaces, but the presence of hydroxyl radicals with nonselective reactivity and evidence of multiphase OH radical reactivity toward common indoor contaminants indicates that there may be additional unknown transformation chemistry indoors. We screened genuine indoor samples for 60 OH radical oxidation products of the common plasticizer and endocrine-disrupting contaminant bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) identified in laboratory experiments using nontargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry. At least 30 and 10 of these products are observed in indoor dust and DEHP films exposed to ambient indoor conditions, respectively, indicating that multiphase OH reactions occur indoors. Using the PROTEX model and a multimedia indoor chemical fate model, we demonstrate that these products have long indoor lifetimes and cause a higher potential for human exposure than DEHP. Some of these products are more active endocrine disruptors than DEHP itself, but most have unknown toxicities. Coexposure to all oxidation products will likely have an additive effect, leading to higher human health risks from indoor organic contaminants than previously thought. Due to the nonselective reactivity of OH radicals, it is likely that most indoor contaminants follow similar chemistry, and further study is needed to understand the prevalence and human health implications of such multiphase chemistry.",

          "abstract": "Microplastic is globally regarded as an important factor impacting biogeochemical cycles, yet our understanding of such influences is limited by the uncertainties of intricate microbial processes. By multiomics analysis, coupled with soil chemodiversity characterization and microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), we investigated how microbial responses to microplastics impacted soil carbon cycling in a long-term field experiment. We showed that biodegradable microplastics promoted soil organic carbon accrual by an average of 2.47%, while nondegradable microplastics inhibited it by 17.4%, as a consequence of the virus–bacteria coadaptations to the microplastics disturbance. In the relevant functional pathways, nondegradable microplastics significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) enhanced the abundance and transcriptional activity related to complex carbohydrate metabolism, whereas biodegradable microplastics significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) promoted functions involved in amino acid metabolism and glycolysis. Accordingly, viral lysis enhanced in nondegradable microplastics treatments to introduce more complex organic compounds to soil dissolved organic matters, thus benefiting the oligotrophs with high carbon metabolic capabilities in exploitation competition. In contrast, biodegradable microplastics enriched viral auxiliary metabolic genes of carbon metabolism through “piggyback-the-winner” strategy, conferring to dominant copiotrophs, enhanced substrate utilization capabilities. These virus–host interactions were also demonstrated in the corresponding soil plastisphere, which would alter microbial resource allocation and metabolism via CUE, affecting carbon storage consequently. Overall, our results underscore the importance of viral–host interactions in understanding the microplastics-dependent carbon storage in the soil ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "The hippocampus is a brain region that is essential for the initial encoding of episodic memories. However, the consolidation of these memories is thought to occur in the neocortex, under guidance of the hippocampus, over the course of days and weeks. Communication between the hippocampus and the neocortex during hippocampal sharp wave-ripple oscillations is believed to be critical for this memory consolidation process. Yet, the synaptic and circuit basis of this communication between brain areas is largely unclear. To address this problem, we perform in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the frontal neocortex and local field potential recordings in CA1 of head-fixed mice exposed to a virtual-reality environment. In mice trained in a goal-directed spatial task, we observe a depolarization in frontal principal neurons during hippocampal ripple oscillations. Both this ripple-associated depolarization and goal-directed task performance can be disrupted by chemogenetic inactivation of somatostatin-positive (SOM + ) interneurons. In untrained mice, a ripple-associated depolarization is not observed, but it emerges when frontal parvalbumin-positive (PV + ) interneurons are inactivated. These results support a model where SOM + interneurons inhibit PV + interneurons during hippocampal activity, thereby acting as a disinhibitory gate for hippocampal inputs to neocortical principal neurons during learning.",

          "abstract": "Amino acids are present in all known life, so identifying the environmental conditions under which they can be synthesized constrains where life on Earth might have formed and where life might be found on other planetary bodies. All known abiotic amino acid syntheses require ammonia, which is only produced in reducing and neutral atmospheres. Here, we demonstrate that the Fe-bearing hydroxide mineral ferroan brucite [Fe 0.33 ,Mg 0.67 (OH) 2 ] can mediate the reaction of nitrate and glyoxylate to form glycine, the simplest amino acid used in life. Up to 97% of this glycine was detected only after acid digestion of the mineral, demonstrating that it had been strongly partitioned to the mineral. The dicarboxylic amino acid 3-hydroxy aspartate was also detected, which suggests that reactants underwent a mechanism that simultaneously produced mono- and dicarboxylic amino acids. Nitrate can be produced in both neutral and oxidizing atmospheres, so reductive amination of nitrate and glyoxylate on a ferroan brucite surface expands origins of life scenarios. First, it expands the environmental conditions in which life’s precursors could form to include oxidizing atmospheres. Second, it demonstrates the ability of ferroan brucite, an abundant, secondary mineral in serpentinizing systems where olivine is partly hydrated, to mediate reductive amination. Finally, the results demonstrate the need to consider mineral-bound products when analyzing samples for abiotic amino acid synthesis.",

Here, we present a macroecological study investigating how plant invaders and their root traits affect soil microbial communities, spanning data from 377 unique plots across the United States sampled multiple times, totaling 632 sampling events and 94 invasive plant species. We found that native and invasive plants harbor different root traits on average, with invasive plants possessing higher specific root lengths and native plants having higher root tissue density. We also show that soil microbial communities experiencing heavy plant invasions were more similar to each other in composition across ecosystem types and geographical regions than plots with higher proportions of native plants, which displayed highly variable microbial communities across the continent. Root traits of invasive plants in highly invaded plots explained two times more variation in microbial composition than native plants. This work represents an important step toward understanding macroscale and cross-scale patterns of the relationship between plant invasions, root traits, and soil microbial composition. Our findings provide insights into how invasive plants may impact ecosystem functioning at the macroscale via their homogenizing influence on microbial communities.",

Under rapid environmental changes, it is important to understand the current and future trajectories of the CO 2 budget in high-latitude ecosystems. In this study, we present the importance of anomalous wet conditions and rising [CO 2 ] on the long-term CO 2 budget based on two decades (2003–2022) of quasicontinuous measurements of CO 2 flux at a poorly drained black spruce forest on permafrost peat in interior Alaska. The long-term CO 2 budget for the black spruce forest was a small sink of −53 ± 63 g C m −2 y −1 . The CO 2 sink increased from 49 g C m −2 y −1 for the first decade to 58 g C m −2 y −1 for the second decade. The increased CO 2 sink was attributed to an 11.3% increase in gross primary productivity (GPP) among which 9% increase in GPP was explained by a recent increase in precipitation. Furthermore, a 3% increase in GPP in response to a 37-ppm increase in [CO 2 ] was estimated from the data-model fusion. Our study shows that understanding the coupling between hydrological and carbon cycles and the CO 2 fertilization effect is important for understanding the current and future carbon budgets of high-latitude ecosystems in permafrost regions.",

          "abstract": "Abscission is the programmed separation of plant organs. It is widespread in the plant kingdom with important functions in development and environmental response. In Arabidopsis, abscission of floral organs (sepals, petals, and stamens) is controlled by two receptor-like protein kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA LIKE-2 (HSL2), which orchestrate the programmed dissolution of the abscission zone connecting floral organs to the developing fruit. In this work, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the core HAE/HSL2 abscission gene expression program. We identify the MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE-1/MKP1 gene as a negative regulator of this pathway. MKP1 acts prior to activation of HAE/HSL2 signaling to establish a signaling threshold required for the initiation of abscission. Furthermore, we use single-cell data to identify genes expressed in two subpopulations of abscission zone cells: those proximal and those distal to the plane of separation. We identify INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION/IDA family genes, encoding activating ligands of HAE/HSL2, as enriched in distal abscission zone cells at the base of the abscising organs. We show how this expression pattern forms a biophysical circuit breaker whereby, when the organ is shed, the source of the IDA peptides is removed, leading to cessation of HAE/HSL2 signaling. Overall, this work provides insight into the multiple control mechanisms acting on the abscission-signaling pathway.",

          "abstract": "Sexual reproduction requires the choreographed interaction of female cells and molecules with sperm and seminal fluid. In internally fertilizing animals, these interactions are managed by specialized tissues within the female reproductive tract (FRT), such as a uterus, glands, and sperm storage organs. However, female somatic reproductive tissues remain understudied, hindering insight into the molecular interactions that support fertility. Here, we report the identification, molecular characterization, and analysis of cell types throughout the somatic FRT in the premier Drosophila melanogaster model system. We find that the uterine epithelia is composed of 11 distinct cell types with well-delineated spatial domains, likely corresponding to functionally specialized surfaces that interact with gametes and reproductive fluids. Polyploidy is pervasive: More than half of lower reproductive tract cells are ≥4C. While seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) are typically thought of as male products that are transferred to females, we find that specialized cell types in the sperm storage organs heavily invest in expressing SFP genes. Rates of amino acid divergence between closely related species indicate heterogeneous evolutionary processes acting on male-limited versus female-expressed seminal fluid genes. Together, our results emphasize that more than 40% of annotated seminal fluid genes are better described as shared components of reproductive transcriptomes, which may function cooperatively to support spermatozoa. More broadly, our work provides the molecular foundation for improved technologies to catalyze the functional characterization of the FRT.",

          "abstract": "The ability to remotely control the activity of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) with small molecules can improve the safety and efficacy of gene-modified T cells. Split ON- or OFF-switch CARs involve the dissociation of tumor–antigen binding from T cell activation (i.e., CD3ζ) on the receptor (R-) and signaling (S-) chains, respectively, that either associate or are disrupted in the presence of a small molecule. Here, we have developed an inducible (i)ON-CAR comprising the anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma protein 2 protein in the ectodomain of both chains which associate in the presence of venetoclax. We showed that inducible ON (iON)-CAR T cells respond to target tumors cells in the presence of venetoclax or the BH3 mimetic navitoclax in a dose-dependent manner, while there is no impact of the drugs on equivalent second generation-CAR T cells. Within 48 h of venetoclax withdrawal, iON-CAR T cells lose the ability to respond to target tumor cells in vitro as evaluated by Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) production, and they are reliant upon the presence of venetoclax for in vivo activity. Finally, by fusing a degron sequence to the endodomain of the iON-CAR S-chain we generated an all-in-one ON/OFF-switch CAR, the iONØ-CAR, down-regulated by lenalidomide within 4 to 6 for functionally inactive T cells (no IFNγ production) within 24 h. We propose that our remote-control CAR designs can reduce toxicity in the clinic. Moreover, the periodic rest of iON and iONØ-CAR T cells may alleviate exhaustion and hence augment persistence and long-term tumor control in patients.",

This field effect can be described by several theoretical models, each of which is intuitive to varying degrees. In this contribution, we show that a fundamental effect of electric fields is to generate electrostatic potentials that facilitate the energetic alignment of reactant frontier orbitals. We apply this model to demystify the impact of electric fields on high-valent iron–oxo heme proteins: catalases, peroxidases, and peroxygenases/monooxygenases. Specifically, we show that this model easily accounts for the observed field-induced changes to the spin distribution within peroxidase active sites and explains the transition between epoxidation and hydroxylation pathways seen in Cytochrome P450 active site models. Thus, for the intuitive interpretation of the chemical effect of the field, the strategy involves analyzing the response of the orbitals of active site fragments, and their energetic alignment. We note that the energy difference between fragment orbitals involved in charge redistribution acts as a measure for the chemical hardness/softness of the reactive complex. This measure, and its sensitivity to electric fields, offers a single parameter model from which to quantitatively assess the effects of electric fields on reactivity and selectivity. Thus, the model provides an additional perspective to describe electrostatic preorganization and offers ways for its manipulation.",

          "abstract": "Globally, ocean dumping of chemical waste is a common method of disposal and relies on the assumption that dilution, diffusion, and dispersion at ocean scales will mitigate human exposure and ecosystem impacts. In southern California, extensive dumping of agrochemical waste, particularly chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants such as DDT, via sewage outfalls and permitted offshore barging occurred for most of the last century. This study compiled a database of existing sediment and fish DDT measurements to examine how this unique legacy of regional ocean disposal translates into the contemporary contamination of the coastal ocean. We used spatiotemporal modeling to derive continuous estimates of sediment DDT contamination and show that the spatial signature of disposal (i.e., high loadings near historic dumping sites) is highly conserved in sediments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proximity of fish to areas of high sediment loadings explained over half of the variation in fish DDT concentrations. The relationship between sediment and fish contamination was mediated by ecological predictors (e.g., species, trophic ecology, habitat use), and the relative influence of each predictor was context-dependent, with habitat exhibiting greater importance in heavily contaminated areas. Thus, despite more than half a century since the cessation of industrial dumping in the region, local ecosystem contamination continues to mirror the spatial legacy of dumping, suggesting that sediment can serve as a robust predictor of fish contamination, and general ecological characteristics offer a predictive framework for unmeasured species or locations.",

          "abstract": "Electrochemical pH-swing strategies offer a promising avenue for cost-effective and energy-efficient carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture, surpassing the traditional thermally activated processes and humidity-sensitive techniques. The concept of elevating seawater’s alkalinity for scalable CO 2 capture without introducing additional chemical as reactant is particularly intriguing due to its minimal environmental impact. However, current commercial plants like chlor-alkali process or water electrolysis demand high thermodynamic voltages of 2.2 V and 1.23 V, respectively, for the production of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) from seawater. These high voltages are attributed to the asymmetric electrochemical reactions, where two completely different reactions take place at the anode and cathode. Here, we developed a symmetric electrochemical system for seawater alkalization based on a highly reversible and identical reaction taking place at the anode and cathode. We utilize hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, where the generated hydrogen is looped to the anode for hydrogen oxidation reaction. Theoretical calculations indicate an impressively low energy requirement ranging from 0.07 to 0.53 kWh/kg NaOH for established pH differences of 1.7 to 13.4. Experimentally, we achieved the alkalization with an energy consumption of 0.63 kWh/kg NaOH, which is only 38% of the theoretical energy requirements of the chlor-alkali process (1.64 kWh/kg NaOH). Further tests demonstrated the system’s potential of enduring high current densities (~20 mA/cm 2 ) and operating stability over an extended period (&gt;110 h), showing its potential for future applications. Notably, the CO 2 adsorption tests performed with alkalized seawater exhibited remarkably improved CO 2 capture dictated by the production of hydroxide compared to the pristine seawater.",

The coincidence of the initial major pulse of CAMP volcanism with the ETE points to short-lived volcanic winters albedo-induced by sulfate aerosols as a plausible key agent of the extinctions in the tropical continental realm, whereas looser correlations allow prolonged CO 2 emissions to contribute to more long-ranging effects in the marine realm via ocean acidification and longer-term warming.",

In Arabidopsis , endosomal membrane constriction and scission are uncoupled, resulting in the formation of extensive concatenated ILV networks and enhancing cargo sequestration efficiency. Here, we used a combination of electron tomography, computer simulations, and mathematical modeling to address the questions of when concatenated ILV networks evolved in plants and what drives their formation. Through morphometric analyses of tomographic reconstructions of endosomes across yeast, algae, and various land plants, we have found that ILV concatenation is widespread within plant species, but only prevalent in seed plants, especially in flowering plants. Multiple budding sites that require the formation of pores in the limiting membrane were only identified in hornworts and seed plants, suggesting that this mechanism has evolved independently in both plant lineages. To identify the conditions under which these multiple budding sites can arise, we used particle-based molecular dynamics simulations and found that changes in ESCRT filament properties, such as filament curvature and membrane binding energy, can generate the membrane shapes observed in multiple budding sites. To understand the relationship between membrane budding activity and ILV network topology, we performed computational simulations and identified a set of membrane remodeling parameters that can recapitulate our tomographic datasets.",

In this study, we investigated the role of T6SSs in Snodgrassella alvi wkB2, a core bacterial symbiont of the honey bee gut microbiota. We generated single- and double-knockout mutants targeting essential genes ( tssD and tssE ) in both T6SS-1 and T6SS-2 and assessed their colonization and competition capabilities in vivo. Our results indicate that T6SSs are nonessential for colonization of the bee gut, although T6SS-2 mutant strains exhibited significantly lower colonization levels compared to the wild-type (WT) strain. Further, a defined community experiment showed that S. alvi wkB2 T6SSs do not significantly impact interspecific competition among core gut bacteria. However, cocolonization experiments with closely related S. alvi strains demonstrated that T6SS-1 plays a role in mediating intraspecific competition. Transcriptomic analysis of bee guts monocolonized by WT or T6SS mutants revealed differential expression of host immunity-related genes relative to microbiota-deprived bees, such as upregulation of the antimicrobial peptide apidaecin in the presence of WT S. alvi and the antimicrobial peptide defensin in the presence of T6SS-2 mutant S. alvi , suggesting that T6SSs contribute to shaping host immune responses.

          "abstract": "Bacteria power rotation of an extracellular flagellar filament for swimming motility. Thousands of flagellin subunits compose the flagellar filament, which extends several microns from the bacterial surface. It is unclear whether bacteria actively control filament length. Many polarly flagellated bacteria produce shorter flagellar filaments than peritrichous bacteria, and FlaG has been reported to limit flagellar filament length in polar flagellates. However, a mechanism for how FlaG may function is unknown. We observed that deletion of flaG in the polarly flagellated pathogens Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Campylobacter jejuni caused extension of flagellar filaments to lengths comparable to peritrichous bacteria. Using C. jejuni as a model to understand how FlaG controls flagellar filament length, we found that FlaG and FliS chaperone–flagellin complexes antagonize each other for interactions with FlhA in the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) export gate. FlaG interacted with an understudied region of FlhA, and this interaction appeared to be enhanced in Δ fliS and FlhA FliS-binding mutants. Our data support that FlaG evolved in polarly flagellated bacteria as an antagonist to interfere with the ability of FliS to interact with and deliver flagellins to FlhA in the fT3SS export gate to control flagellar filament length so that these bacteria produce relatively shorter flagella than peritrichous counterparts. This mechanism is similar to how some gatekeepers in injectisome T3SSs prevent chaperones from delivering effector proteins until completion of the T3SS and host contact occurs. Thus, flagellar and injectisome T3SSs have convergently evolved protein antagonists to negatively impact respective T3SSs to secrete their major terminal substrates.",

In contrast, little is known about how arthropods sense viruses, although several innate immune pathways including Toll have antiviral functions. Large DNA viruses in the family Baculoviridae are used to control a number of pest insects. Here, we studied Spodoptera litura and Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) to test the hypothesis that one or more myeloid differentiation–like (ML) proteins and Toll family members sense baculoviruses. We identified 11 ML and 12 Toll genes in the S. litura genome. A series of experiments indicated that S. litura ML protein 11 (SlML-11) binds the budded form of AcMNPV and partners with S. litura Toll5 (SlToll5). SlML-11 also bound sphingomyelin (SPM), which is a component of the virion envelope. Disabling SlML-11 and SlToll5 increased susceptibility to infection, while priming larvae with SPM reduced susceptibility as measured by increased survival to the adult stage and clearance of AcMNPV from individuals that emerged as adults. We conclude that SPM is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecule while SlML-11 and SlToll5 interact to function as a pattern recognition receptor that senses AcMNPV.",

          "abstract": "As their statistical power grows, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified an increasing number of loci underlying quantitative traits of interest. These loci are scattered throughout the genome and are individually responsible only for small fractions of the total heritable trait variance. The recently proposed omnigenic model provides a conceptual framework to explain these observations by postulating that numerous distant loci contribute to each complex trait via effect propagation through intracellular regulatory networks. We formalize this conceptual framework by proposing the “quantitative omnigenic model” (QOM), a statistical model that combines prior knowledge of the regulatory network topology with genomic data. By applying our model to gene expression traits in yeast, we demonstrate that QOM achieves similar gene expression prediction performance to traditional GWAS with hundreds of times less parameters, while simultaneously extracting candidate causal and quantitative chains of effect propagation through the regulatory network for every individual gene. We estimate the fraction of heritable trait variance in cis- and in trans- , break the latter down by effect propagation order, assess the trans- variance not attributable to transcriptional regulation, and show that QOM correctly accounts for the low-dimensional structure of gene expression covariance. We furthermore demonstrate the relevance of QOM for systems biology, by employing it as a statistical test for the quality of regulatory network reconstructions, and linking it to the propagation of nontranscriptional (including environmental) effects.",

While prior work has elucidated the mechanisms underlying the first two processes, biomechanical processes driving the postfiltration phagocytosis of RBCs retained at interendothelial slits (IES) are still poorly understood. We present here a unique computational model of macrophages to study the role of cell biomechanics in modulating the kinetics of phagocytosis of aged and diseased RBCs retained in the spleen. After validating the macrophage model using in vitro phagocytosis experiments, we employ it to probe the mechanisms underlying the kinetics of phagocytosis of mechanically altered RBCs, such as heated RBCs and abnormal RBCs in hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and sickle cell disease (SCD). Our simulations show pronounced deformation of the flexible and healthy RBCs in contrast to minimal shape changes in altered RBCs. Simulations also show that less deformable RBCs are engulfed faster and at lower adhesive strength than flexible RBCs, consistent with our experimental measurements. This efficient sensing and engulfment by macrophages of stiff RBCs retained at IES are expected to temper splenic congestion, a common pathogenic process in malaria, HS, and SCD. Altogether, our combined computational and in vitro experimental studies suggest that mechanical alterations of retained RBCs may suffice to enhance their phagocytosis, thereby adapting the kinetics of their elimination to the kinetics of their mechanical retention, an equilibrium essential for adequately cleaning the splenic filter to preserve its function.",

          "abstract": "Historically, economic growth has been closely coupled to carbon emissions responsible for climate change, but to stabilize global mean temperature, net-zero carbon emissions are necessary. Some economies have begun to reduce emissions while continuing to grow, but this decoupling is not fast enough to achieve global climate targets. Subnational climate actions seem to be crucial for the achievement of these targets. Here, we uncover the effectiveness of subnational efforts by estimating decoupling rates and CO2 emission intensities over the last three decades for over 1,500 subnational regions, encompassing 85% of global emissions, using global data on reported economic output and gridded production-based emissions. Thirty percent of regions with available data have fully decoupled, with higher-income and historically carbon-intensive regions exhibiting higher rates of decoupling and declining emission intensity. Countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development with greater spending on subnational climate actions show higher decoupling rates, as do subnational regions in EU countries where climate policies have been implemented, highlighting the effectiveness of subnational policies. Moreover, subnational analysis reveals greater variance of decoupling rates within national boundaries than between them and that countries with weaker governance typically show higher variance of decoupling within their borders. If recent rates of production-based carbon decoupling continue, less than half of subnational regions would reach net-zero before 2050, even when accounting for observed acceleration via socioeconomic development and assuming no interregional carbon leakage.",

These feathers have been observed to deploy passively during high angle of attack maneuvers and are suggested to play an aerodynamic role. However, there have been limited attempts to capture their underlying flow physics or assess the function of multiple covert rows. Here, we first identify two flow control mechanisms associated with a single covert-inspired flap and their location sensitivity: a pressure dam mechanism and a previously unidentified shear layer interaction mechanism. We then investigate the additivity of these mechanisms by deploying multiple rows of flaps. We find that aerodynamic benefits conferred by the shear layer interaction are additive, whereas benefits conferred by the pressure dam effect are not. Nevertheless, both mechanisms can be exploited simultaneously to maximize aerodynamic benefits and mitigate stall. In addition to wind tunnel experiments, we implement multiple rows of covert-inspired flaps on a bird-scale remote-controlled aircraft. Flight tests reveal passive deployment trends similar to those observed in bird flight and comparable aerodynamic benefits to wind tunnel experiments. These results indicate that we can enhance aircraft controllability using covert-inspired flaps and form insights into the aerodynamic role of covert feathers in avian flight.",

Our understanding of the large-scale dynamics of phytoplankton biomass has greatly benefited from, and is largely based on, satellite ocean color observations from which chlorophyll-a (Chla), a commonly used proxy for carbon biomass, can be estimated. However, ocean color satellites only measure a small portion of the surface ocean, meaning that subsurface phytoplankton biomass is not directly monitored. Chla is also an imperfect proxy for carbon biomass because cellular physiology drives large variations in their ratio. The global network of Biogeochemical (BGC)-Argo floats now makes it possible to complement satellite observations by addressing both these issues at once. In our study, we use ~100,000 water-column profiles from BGC-Argo to describe Earth’s phytoplankton carbon biomass and its spatiotemporal variability. We estimate the global stock of open ocean phytoplankton biomass at ~314 Tg C, half of which is present at depths not accessible through satellite detection. We also compare the seasonal cycles of carbon biomass stocks and surface Chla visible from space and find that surface Chla does not accurately identify the timing of the peak annual biomass in two-thirds of the ocean. Our study is a demonstration of global-scale, depth-resolved monitoring of Earth’s phytoplankton, which will be crucial for understanding future climate-related changes and the effects of geoengineering interventions if implemented.",

Here, we develop a remote sensing–informed terrestrial reanalysis and assess the nonstationarity of and interconnections among global water cycle components from 2003 to 2020. We highlight 20 hotspot regions where terrestrial water storage exhibits strong nonstationarity, impacting 35% of the global population and 45% of the area covered by irrigated agriculture. Emerging long-term trends dominate the most often (48.2%), followed by seasonal shifts (32.8%) and changes in extremes (19%). Notably, in mid-latitudes, this encompasses 34% of Asia and 27% of North America. The patterns of nonstationarity and their dominant types differ across other water cycle components, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and gross primary production. These differences also manifest uniquely across hotspot regions, illustrating the intricate ways in which each component responds to climate change and human water management. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering nonstationarity when assessing water cycle information toward the development of strategies for sustainable water resource usage, enhancing resilience to extreme events, and effectively addressing other challenges associated with climate change.",

          "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites invade and multiply inside red blood cells (RBCs), the most iron-rich compartment in humans. Like all cells, P. falciparum requires nutritional iron to support essential metabolic pathways, but the critical mechanisms of iron acquisition and trafficking during RBC infection have remained obscure. Parasites internalize and liberate massive amounts of heme during large-scale digestion of RBC hemoglobin within an acidic food vacuole (FV) but lack a heme oxygenase to release porphyrin-bound iron. Although most FV heme is sequestered into inert hemozoin crystals, prior studies indicate that trace heme escapes biomineralization and is susceptible to nonenzymatic degradation within the oxidizing FV environment to release labile iron. Parasites retain a homolog of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), a known mammalian iron transporter, but its role in P. falciparum iron acquisition has not been tested. Our phylogenetic studies indicate that P. falciparum DMT1 (PfDMT1) retains conserved molecular features critical for metal transport. We localized this protein to the FV membrane and defined its orientation in an export-competent topology. Conditional knockdown of PfDMT1 expression is lethal to parasites, which display broad cellular defects in iron-dependent functions, including impaired apicoplast biogenesis and mitochondrial polarization. Parasites are selectively rescued from partial PfDMT1 knockdown by supplementation with exogenous iron, but not other metals. These results support a cellular paradigm whereby PfDMT1 is the molecular gatekeeper to essential iron acquisition by blood-stage malaria parasites and suggest that therapeutic targeting of PfDMT1 may be a potent antimalarial strategy.",

These animals are remarkable in tolerating extreme conditions, including high heat, toxic reduced sulfide, and low oxygen. Here, we test whether the extreme vent environment has selected for functionally similar species across the world’s deep ocean, despite well-established global geographic patterns of high phylogenetic distinctness. High functional redundancy in species pools within regions suggests that the extreme environments select for species with specific traits. Yet, some regions emerge as functional hotspots where species pools with distinct functional trait compositions may represent geological idiosyncrasies of the habitats. Moreover, many species are functionally unique, an outcome of low species richness in a system where the species pool is small at all scales. Given the high proportion of functionally unique species, simulated species extinctions indicate that species losses would rapidly translate to the elimination of functionally irreplaceable species and could tip vent systems to functional collapse. Ocean changes and human-induced threats are expected to significantly impact many vent species as human activities expand in the remote deep sea.

The evolution of this “retrobiome” involved a series of explosive amplifications, presumably associated with high mutation rates, interspersed with periods of silencing. A by-product of retrotransposon activity is the formation of processed pseudogenes (PPGs)—intron-less, promoter-less DNA copies of messenger RNA (mRNA). We examined the proportion of PPGs with varying degrees of deviation from their ancestor mRNAs as an indicator of the intensity of retrotranspositions at different times in the past. Our analysis revealed a high proportion of “young’’ (recently acquired) PPGs in the DNA of mice and rats, indicating significant retrobiome activity during the recent evolution of these species. The ongoing process of new PPG entries in mouse germ line DNA was confirmed by identifying diversity in PPG content within the single strain of mice, C57BL/6. In contrast, the highly abundant PPGs of the naked mole rat (NMR) exhibited substantial deviation from their mRNAs, with a near-complete lack of PPGs without mutations, indicative of the silencing of the retrobiome in the most recent evolutionary past, preceded by a period of high activity. This distinctive feature of the NMR genome was confirmed through the analysis of a broad range of mammalian species. The peculiar evolutionary dynamics of PPGs in the NMR, an organism with exceptional longevity and resistance to cancer, may reflect the role played by the retrobiome in aging and cancer.",

The increased rate of stress relaxation occurs across a wide range of polymer molecular weights (MWs), which enables the use of high MW polymer for improved mechanical stability of the hydrogel. The rate of stress relaxation in macroporous hydrogels depends on the volume fraction of pores and the concentration of bovine serum albumin, which is added to the hydrogels to stabilize the macroporous structure during gelation. Relative to cell spheroids encapsulated in bulk hydrogels, spheroids in macroporous hydrogels have a significantly larger area and smaller circularity because of increased cell migration. A computational model provides a framework for the relationship between the macroporous architecture and morphogenesis of encapsulated spheroids that is consistent with experimental observations. Taken together, these findings elucidate the relationship between macroporous hydrogel architecture and stress relaxation and help to inform the design of macroporous hydrogels for materials-based cell therapies.",

We demonstrate by use of a “categorical Jacobian” calculation that ESM-2 stores statistics of coevolving residues, analogously to simpler modeling approaches like Markov Random Fields and Multivariate Gaussian models. We further investigated how ESM-2 “stores” information needed to predict contacts by comparing sequence masking strategies, and found that providing local windows of sequence information allowed ESM-2 to best recover predicted contacts.

          "abstract": "Interactions mediated by intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) pose formidable challenges in structural characterization. IDRs are highly versatile, capable of adopting diverse structures and engagement modes. Motivated by recent strides in protein structure prediction, we embarked on exploring the extent to which AlphaFold-Multimer can faithfully reproduce the intricacies of interactions involving IDRs. To this end, we gathered multiple datasets covering the versatile spectrum of IDR binding modes and used them to probe AlphaFold-Multimer’s prediction of IDR interactions and their dynamics. Our analyses revealed that AlphaFold-Multimer is not only capable of predicting various types of bound IDR structures with high success rate, but that distinguishing true interactions from decoys, and unreliable predictions from accurate ones is achievable by appropriate use of AlphaFold-Multimer’s intrinsic scores. We found that the quality of predictions drops for more heterogeneous, fuzzy interaction types, most likely due to lower interface hydrophobicity and higher coil content. Notably though, certain AlphaFold-Multimer scores, such as the Predicted Aligned Error and residue-ipTM, are highly correlated with structural heterogeneity of the bound IDR, enabling clear distinctions between predictions of fuzzy and more homogeneous binding modes. Finally, our benchmarking revealed that predictions of IDR interactions can also be successful when using full-length proteins, but not as accurate as with cognate IDRs. To facilitate identification of the cognate IDR of a given partner, we established “minD,” which pinpoints potential interaction sites in a full-length protein. Our study demonstrates that AlphaFold-Multimer can correctly identify interacting IDRs and predict their mode of engagement with a given partner.",

In particular, Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) dephosphorylates ~80% of all ser/thr phosphorylation sites. Here, we developed a phosphatase targeting peptide (PhosTAP) that binds all PP1 isoforms and does so with a stronger affinity than any other known PP1 regulator. This PhosTAP can be used as a PP1 recruitment tool for Phosphorylation Targeting Chimera (PhosTAC)-type recruitment in in vitro and cellular experiments, as well as in phosphoproteomics experiments to identify PP1-specific substrates and phosphosites. The latter is especially important to further our understanding of cellular signaling, as the identification of substrates and especially phosphosites that are targeted by specific phosphatases lags behind that of their kinase counterparts. Using PhosTAP-based proteomics, we show that, counter to our current understanding, many PP1 regulators are also substrates, that the number of residues between regulator PP1-binding and phosphosites vary significantly, and that PP1 counteracts the activities of mitotic kinases. Finally, we also found that Haspin kinase is a direct substrate of PP1 and that its PP1-dependent dephosphorylation modulates its activity during anaphase. Together, we show that PP1-specific PhosTAPs are a powerful tool for +studying PP1 activity in vitro and in cells.",

          "abstract": "Meta-learning enables us to learn how to learn the same or similar tasks more efficiently. Decision-making literature theorizes that a prefrontal network, including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, underlies meta-learning of decision making by reinforcement learning. Recently, computationally similar meta-learning has been theorized and empirically demonstrated in motor adaptation. However, it remains unclear whether meta-learning of motor adaptation also relies on a prefrontal network. Considering hierarchical information flow from the prefrontal to motor cortices, this study explores whether meta-learning is processed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), which is situated upstream of the primary motor cortex, but downstream of the DLPFC. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to either PMd or DLPFC during a motor meta-learning task, in which human participants were trained to regulate the rate and retention of motor adaptation to maximize rewards. While motor adaptation itself was intact, TMS to PMd, but not DLPFC, attenuated meta-learning, impairing the ability to regulate motor adaptation to maximize rewards. Further analyses revealed that TMS to PMd attenuated meta-learning of memory retention. These results suggest that meta-learning of motor adaptation relies more on the premotor area than on a prefrontal network. Thus, while PMd is traditionally viewed as crucial for planning motor actions, this study suggests that PMd is also crucial for meta-learning of motor adaptation, processing goal-directed planning of how long motor memory should be retained to fit the long-term goal of motor adaptation.",

However, the growth of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and dendritic Li microstructure pose significant challenges for the long-term operation of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose the utilization of a suspension electrolyte with dispersed magnetically responsive nanosheets whose orientation can be manipulated by an external magnetic field during cell operation for realizing in situ regeneration in LMBs. The regeneration mechanism arises from the redistribution of the ion flux and the formation of an inorganic-rich SEI for uniform and compact Li deposition. With the magnetic-field-induced regeneration process, we show that a Li||Li symmetric cell stably operates for 350 h at 2 mA cm −2 and 2 mA h cm −2 , ~5 times that of the cell with the pristine electrolyte. Furthermore, the cycling stability can be significantly extended in the Li||NMC full cell of 3 mA h cm −2 , showing a capacity retention of 67% after 500 cycles at 1C. The dynamic Li metal regeneration demonstrated here could bring useful design considerations for reviving the operating cells for achieving high-energy, long-duration battery systems.",

          "abstract": "DNA repair processes modulate genotoxicity, mutagenesis, and adaption. Nucleotide excision repair removes bulky DNA damage, and in Escherichia coli , basal excision repair, carried out by UvrA, B, C, and D, with DNA PolI and DNA ligase, occurs genome-wide. In transcription-coupled repair (TCR), the Mfd protein targets template strand (TS) lesions that block RNA polymerase for accelerated repair by the basal repair enzymes. Accelerated repair is also seen with particular adducts. Notably, of the two major UV photoproducts, basal repair of (6-4) photoproducts [(6-4)PPs] is about 10× faster than repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). To better understand repair prioritization in E. coli , we used XR-seq to measure TCR of UV photoproducts genome-wide. With CPDs, we found that TCR occurred at early time points, increased with transcription level, and was Mfd dependent; later, with completion of TS repair, nontranscribed strand (NTS) repair predominated. With (6-4)PP, when analyzing all genes, TCR was not observed; in fact, among the most highly transcribed genes, slightly more repair of (6-4)PPs in the NTS was evident. Thus, the very rapid basal repair of (6-4)PP in the NTS was faster than TCR of (6-4)PPs in the TS. Overall, TCR is of limited importance in (6-4)PP repair, and TCR of CPDs is limited to the TS of more highly transcribed genes. These results are consistent with the significant role of Mfd in mutagenesis and the modest effect of mfd deletion on UV survival and bear upon the response of E. coli to bulky DNA damage.",

One of the principal challenges in solid tumor treatment is the physical barrier composed of a dense extracellular matrix, which prevents immune cells from penetrating the tissue to attack intratumoral cancer cells. Here, we improve immune cell infiltration into solid tumors by manipulating septin-7 functions in cells. Using protein allosteric design, we reprogram the three-dimensional structure of septin-7 and insert a blue light-responsive light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain 2 (LOV2), creating a light-controllable septin-7-LOV2 hybrid protein. Blue light inhibits septin-7 function in live cells, inducing extended cell protrusions and cell polarization, enhancing cell transmigration efficiency through confining spaces. We genetically edited human natural killer cell line (NK92) and mouse primary CD8 + T-cells expressing the engineered protein, and we demonstrated improved penetration and cytotoxicity against various tumor spheroid models. Our proposed strategy to enhance immune cell infiltration is compatible with other methodologies and therefore, could be used in combination to further improve cell-based immunotherapies against solid tumors.",

However, challenges such as fixed structural designs with limited adjustability, high energy consumption, and a narrow operational temperature range remain prevalent. Here, a systematic framework is introduced to achieve reconfigurable, zero-energy, and wide-temperature thermal nonreciprocity by transforming wasteful heat loss into a valuable regulatory tool. Vertical slabs composed of natural bulk materials enable asymmetric heat loss through natural convection, disrupting the inversion symmetry of thermal conduction. The reconfigurability of this system stems from the ability to modify heat loss by adjusting thermal conductivity, size, placement, and quantity of the slabs. Moreover, this structure allows for precise control of zero-energy thermal nonreciprocity across a broad temperature spectrum, utilizing solely environmental temperature gradients without additional energy consumption. This research presents a different approach to achieving nonreciprocity, broadening the potential for nonreciprocal devices such as thermal diodes and topological edge states, and inspiring further exploration of nonreciprocity in other loss-based systems.",

          "abstract": "Sleep is an essential behavior that supports lifelong brain health and cognition. Neuronal synapses are a major target for restorative sleep function and a locus of dysfunction in response to sleep deprivation (SD). Synapse density is highly dynamic during development, becoming stabilized with maturation to adulthood, suggesting sleep exerts distinct synaptic functions between development and adulthood. Importantly, problems with sleep are common in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Moreover, early life sleep disruption in animal models causes long-lasting changes in adult behavior. Divergent plasticity engaged during sleep necessarily implies that developing and adult synapses will show differential vulnerability to SD. To investigate distinct sleep functions and mechanisms of vulnerability to SD across development, we systematically examined the behavioral and molecular responses to acute SD between juvenile (P21 to P28), adolescent (P42 to P49), and adult (P70 to P100) mice of both sexes. Compared to adults, juveniles lack robust adaptations to SD, precipitating cognitive deficits in the novel object recognition task. Subcellular fractionation, combined with proteome and phosphoproteome analysis revealed the developing synapse is profoundly vulnerable to SD, whereas adults exhibit comparative resilience. SD in juveniles, and not older mice, aberrantly drives induction of synapse potentiation, synaptogenesis, and expression of perineuronal nets. Our analysis further reveals the developing synapse as a putative node of convergence between vulnerability to SD and ASD genetic risk. Together, our systematic analysis supports a distinct developmental function of sleep and reveals how sleep disruption impacts key aspects of brain development, providing insights for ASD susceptibility.",

          "abstract": "Quantum mechanics imposes limits on the statistics of certain observables. Perhaps the most famous example is the uncertainty principle. Similar trade-offs also exist for the simultaneous violation of multiple Bell inequalities. In the simplest case of three observers, it has been shown that if two observers violate a Bell inequality, then none of them can violate any Bell inequality with the third observer, a property called monogamy of Bell violations. Forms of Bell monogamy have been linked to the no-signaling principle, and the inability of simultaneous violations of all inequalities is regarded as their fundamental property. Here, we show that the Bell monogamy does not hold universally and that in fact the only monogamous situation exists for only three observers. Consequently, the nature of quantum nonlocality is truly polygamous. We present a systematic methodology for identifying quantum states, measurements, and tight Bell inequalities that do not obey the monogamy principle for any number of more than three observers. The identified polygamous inequalities enable any subset of ( N − 1 ) observers to reveal nonlocality, which is also shown experimentally by measuring Bell-type correlations of six-photon Dicke states. Our findings may be exploited for multiparty quantum key distribution as well as simultaneous self-testing of multiple nodes in quantum networks.",

          "abstract": "The rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance threatens human health. While more sophisticated strategies for antibiotic discovery are being developed, target elucidation of new chemical entities remains challenging. In the postgenomic era, expression profiling can play an important role in mechanism-of-action (MOA) prediction by reporting on the cellular response to perturbation. However, the broad application of transcriptomics has yet to fulfill its promise of transforming target elucidation due to challenges in identifying the most relevant, direct responses to target inhibition. We developed an unbiased strategy for MOA prediction, called perturbation-specific transcriptional mapping (PerSpecTM), in which large-throughput expression profiling of wild-type or hypomorphic mutants, depleted for essential targets, enables a computational strategy to address this challenge. We applied PerSpecTM to perform reference-based MOA prediction based on the principle that similar perturbations, whether chemical or genetic, will elicit similar transcriptional responses. Using this approach, we elucidated the MOAs of three molecules with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by comparing their expression profiles to those of a reference set of antimicrobial compounds with known MOAs. We also show that transcriptional responses to small-molecule inhibition resemble those resulting from genetic depletion of essential targets by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) by PerSpecTM, demonstrating proof of concept that correlations between expression profiles of small-molecule and genetic perturbations can facilitate MOA prediction when no chemical entities exist to serve as a reference. Empowered by PerSpecTM, this work lays the foundation for an unbiased, readily scalable, systematic reference-based strategy for MOA elucidation that could transform antibiotic discovery efforts.",

In this article, we address this issue by reporting on an experimental investigation of cell proliferation on all time- and length-scales of the development of a model tissue, grown on collagen-coated glass or deformable substrates. Through extensive data analysis, we demonstrate the relation between mechanoresponse and probability for cell division, as a function of the local cell density. Motivated by these results, we construct a minimal model of cell division in tissue environment that can recover the data. By parameterizing the growth and the dividing phases of the cell cycle, and introducing such a proliferation model in dissipative particle dynamics simulations, we recover the mechanoresponsive, time-dependent density profiles in 2D tissues growing to macroscopic scales. The importance of separating the cell population into growing and dividing cells, each characterized by a particular time scale, is further emphasized by calculations of density profiles based on adapted Fisher–Kolmogorov equations. Together, these results show that the mechanoresponse on the level of a constitutive cell and its proliferation results in a matrix-sensitive active pressure. The latter evokes massive cooperative displacement of cells in the invading tissue and is a key factor for developing large-scale structures in the steady state.",

          "abstract": "Guanine-rich DNA forms G-quadruplexes (G4s) that play a critical role in essential cellular processes. Previous studies have mostly focused on intramolecular G4s composed of four consecutive guanine tracts (G-tracts) from a single strand. However, this structural form has not been strictly confirmed in the genome of living eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the formation of hybrid G4s (hG4s), consisting of G-tracts from both DNA and RNA, in the genome of living yeast cells. Analysis of Okazaki fragment syntheses and two other independent G4-specific detections reveal that hG4s can efficiently form with as few as a single DNA guanine–guanine (GG) tract due to the participation of G-tracts from RNA. This finding increases the number of potential G4-forming sites in the yeast genome from 38 to 587,694, a more than 15,000-fold increase. Interestingly, hG4s readily form and even dominate at G4 sites that are theoretically capable of forming the intramolecular DNA G4s (dG4s) by themselves. Compared to dG4s, hG4s exhibit broader kinetics, higher prevalence, and greater structural diversity and stability. Most importantly, hG4 formation is tightly coupled to transcription through the involvement of RNA, allowing it to function in a transcription-dependent manner. Overall, our study establishes hG4s as the overwhelmingly dominant G4 species in the yeast genome and emphasizes a renewal of the current perception of the structural form, formation mechanism, prevalence, and functional role of G4s in eukaryotic genomes. It also establishes a sensitive and currently the only method for detecting the structural form of G4s in living cells.",

This spontaneous oscillation mode of the bubble synchronizes with that of the interfacial temperature and hydrodynamical flow. A physical mechanism is proposed, and the scaling analysis of the oscillation frequency agrees well with experiments in various liquids under different laser powers. Additionally, the bubble trajectory rotates azimuthally, arising from the symmetry breaking of the vortex pair accompanying the oscillation. Moreover, the double pendulum of oscillation bubbles has been demonstrated, achieving a preferable oscillation direction in a controllable way.

They transduce signals across membranes, scaffold signaling complexes, and mediate vesicular traffic. Their functions are regulated by constraining conformational ensembles through specific intra- and intermolecular interactions, physical tethering, and posttranslational modifications. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy receptor FAM134B/RETREG1, known for its reticulon homology domain (RHD), includes a substantial C-terminal IDR housing the LC3 interacting motif. Beyond engaging the autophagic machinery, the function of the FAM134B-IDR is unclear. Here, we investigate the characteristics of the FAM134B-IDR by extensive modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. We present detailed structural models for the IDR, mapping its conformational landscape in solution and membrane-anchored configurations. Our analysis reveals that depending on the membrane anchor, the IDRs collapse onto the membrane and induce positive membrane curvature to varying degrees. The charge patterns underlying this Janus-like behavior are conserved across other ER-phagy receptors. We found that IDRs alone are sufficient to sense curvature. When combined with RHDs, they intensify membrane remodeling and drive efficient protein clustering, leading to faster budding, thereby amplifying RHD remodeling functions. Our simulations provide a perspective on IDRs of FAM134B, their Janus-like membrane interactions, and the resulting modulatory functions during large-scale ER remodeling.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved many defenses against invading viruses (phage). Despite the many bacterial defenses and phage counterdefenses, in most environments, bacteria and phage coexist, with neither driving the other to extinction. How is coexistence realized in the context of the bacteria/phage arms race, and how are immune repertoire sizes determined in conditions of coexistence? Here we develop a simple mathematical model to consider the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of competing bacteria and phage with different immune/counterimmune repertoires. We find an ecologically stable fixed point exhibiting coexistence, in agreement with the experimental observation that each individual bacterium typically carries multiple defense systems, though fewer than the maximum number possible. However, in simulations, the populations typically remain dynamic, exhibiting chaotic fluctuations around this fixed point. These dynamics enable coexistence even when phage (predator) strains outnumber bacteria (prey) strains. We obtain quantitative predictions for the mean, amplitude, and timescale of these dynamics. Our results provide a framework for understanding the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of the bacteria/phage arms race and demonstrate how bacteria/phage coexistence can stably arise from the coevolution of bacterial defense systems and phage counterdefense systems.",

          "abstract": "Current research on memory indicates that learning is most effective when it involves spaced retrieval practice of study materials. Here, we investigated whether the benefits of both retrieval practice and spacing can be further boosted when variability is introduced across practice sessions. Across six experiments, participants learned translations of foreign vocabulary, with foreign words embedded in contextual sentences hinting at the meaning of these words. These sentences were then either kept constant or varied from one learning cycle to another. Whenever repeated practice took the form of retrieval from long-term memory with contextual sentences serving as cues (with or without feedback after retrieval attempts), variable sentences led to better learning of the meanings of the embedded foreign words than constant sentences. The benefits of variable retrieval were observed both immediately after study and after a 24-h delay, and they were larger when retrieval practice was spaced rather than massed. However, these benefits were not appreciated by the learners who judged learning to be more effective with constant rather than variable cues. This metacognitive illusion, misaligning the effectiveness of learning and its appraisal by learners, was confirmed in the seventh experiment which focused on learning lecture content. Thus, while spaced retrieval practice employing variable cues clearly produces robust benefits for memory performance, such benefits may be severely underappreciated by the learners.",

          "abstract": "Oysters (Ostreidae) play a pivotal role in the health and productivity of marine ecosystems. Their unique ability to filter water, provide habitat, and contribute to nutrient cycling has remained underused in many parts of Europe following the destruction of vast oyster beds in the 19th and 20th centuries. The burgeoning field of oyster restoration for aquaculture has recognized the potential of these bivalves in promoting ecosystem resilience and enhancing biodiversity. Restoring oysters to previous levels requires the establishment of ecological baselines that ideally take into account the long-term changes of animal behavior as well as the surrounding environment prior to significant human intervention, an extremely challenging task. Archaeological shell middens are invaluable baseline archives and provide exclusive insights into past ecosystems. Here, we use demographic information from over 2,000 analyzed European oyster ( Ostrea edulis ) shells dating from ~5,660 to 2,600 cal BCE (calibrated years BCE), the largest archaeological growth rate dataset of mollusks yet. Through the analysis of size as well as ontogenetic age, we decouple anthropogenic from environmental impacts throughout Denmark. Our data show definitive influence of oyster size–age structure through human harvesting during the Mid-Holocene, with older oysters in the Mesolithic (mean: 4.9 y) than the Neolithic (mean: 3.7 y), irrespective of changes in growth rate. Furthermore, we present the metrics for long-term sustainable harvesting of oysters across environmental and socioeconomic transitions, providing demographic targets for current oyster restoration projects and valuable context in mitigating the impact of modern climatic change.",

          "abstract": "Classically, all hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants causing human infection belong to the genus Paslahepevirus (HEV-A). However, the increasing cases of rat HEV infection in humans since 2018 challenged this dogma, posing increasing health threats. Herein, we investigated the underlying mechanisms dictating the zoonotic potentials of different HEV species and their possible cross-protection relationships. We found that rat HEV virus-like particles (HEV VLPs ) bound to human liver and intestinal cells/tissues with high efficiency. Moreover, rat HEV VLPs and infectious rat HEV particles penetrated the cell membrane and entered human target cells postbinding. In contrast, ferret HEV VLPs showed marginal cell binding and entry ability, bat HEV VLPs and avian HEV VLPs exhibited no binding and entry potency. Structure-based three-dimensional mapping identified that the surface spike domain of rat HEV is crucial for cell binding. Antigenic cartography indicated that rat HEV exhibited partial cross-reaction with HEV-A. Intriguingly, sera of HEV-A infected patients or human HEV vaccine Hecolin® immunized individuals provided partial cross-protection against the binding of rat HEV VLPs to human target cells. In summary, the interactions between the viral capsid and cellular receptor(s) regulate the distinct zoonotic potentials of different HEV species. The systematic characterization of antigenic cartography and serological cross-reactivity of different HEV species provide valuable insights for the development of species-specific diagnosis and protective vaccines against zoonotic HEV infection.",

Here, we characterize a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) from a growth-associated intestinal strain of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii cultured from these children. This enzyme, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, hydrolyzes a variety of N -acylamides, including oleoylethanolamide (OEA), neurotransmitters, and quorum sensing N -acyl homoserine lactones; it also synthesizes a range of N -acylamides, notably N -acyl amino acids. Treating germ-free mice with N -oleoylarginine and N -oleolyhistidine, major products of FAAH OEA metabolism, markedly affected expression of intestinal immune function pathways. Administering MDCF to Bangladeshi children considerably reduced fecal OEA, a satiety factor whose levels were negatively correlated with abundance and expression of their F. prausnitzii FAAH. This enzyme, structurally and catalytically distinct from mammalian FAAH, is positioned to regulate levels of a variety of bioactive molecules.",

Predation experiments suggest that the relative fitness of color phenotypes varies between forested and deforested habitats. Genomic and coloration analyses of 1200 specimens show repeated selection at the ebony locus controlling color polymorphism across lineages.

We developed a solvent affinity–induced assembly method that incorporates water-insoluble polymer semiconductors into double-network hydrogels. These semiconductors exhibited tissue-level moduli as soft as 81 kilopascals, stretchability of 150% strain, and charge-carrier mobility up to 1.4 square centimeters per volt per second. When they are interfaced with biological tissues, their tissue-level modulus enables alleviated immune reactions.

Despite inactivating this T6SS, ICE acquisition increases the fitness of the B. fragilis transconjugant over its progenitor by arming it with the new T6SS.

          "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic molecules containing adjacent aromatic rings. Infrared emission bands show that PAHs are abundant in space, but only a few specific PAHs have been detected in the interstellar medium. We detect 1-cyanopyrene, a cyano-substituted derivative of the related four-ring PAH pyrene, in radio observations of the dense cloud TMC-1 using the Green Bank Telescope. The measured column density of 1-cyanopyrene is ∼ 1 .52×10 12 cm − 2 , from which we estimate that pyrene contains up to 0.1% of the carbon in TMC-1. This abundance indicates that interstellar PAH chemistry favors the production of pyrene. We suggest that some of the carbon supplied to young planetary systems is carried by PAHs that originate in cold molecular clouds.",

Using satellite data, we analyzed the daily growth rates of more than 60,000 fires from 2001 to 2020 across the contiguous US. Nearly half of the ecoregions experienced destructive fast fires that grew more than 1620 hectares in 1 day. These fires accounted for 78% of structures destroyed and 61% of suppression costs ($18.9 billion). From 2001 to 2020, the average peak daily growth rate for these fires more than doubled (+249% relative to 2001) in the Western US. Nearly 3 million structures were within 4 kilometers of a fast fire during this period across the US. Given recent devastating wildfires, understanding fast fires is crucial for improving firefighting strategies and community preparedness.",

Using genome, transcriptome, and proteome analysis of Hypsibius henanensis sp. nov. , we explored the molecular basis contributing to radiotolerance in this organism. A putatively horizontally transferred gene, DOPA dioxygenase 1 ( DODA1 ), responds to radiation and confers radiotolerance by synthesizing betalains—a type of plant pigment with free radical–scavenging properties. A tardigrade-specific radiation-induced disordered protein, TRID1, facilitates DNA damage repair through a mechanism involving phase separation. Two mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly proteins, BCS1 and NDUFB8, accumulate to accelerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) regeneration for poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and subsequent poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)–mediated DNA damage repair. These three observations expand our understanding of mechanisms of tardigrade radiotolerance.",

In this study, we establish that aging of the immune system, regardless of the age of the stroma and tumor, drives lung cancer progression. Hematopoietic aging enhances emergency myelopoiesis, resulting in the local accumulation of myeloid progenitor–like cells in lung tumors. These cells are a major source of interleukin (IL)–1⍺, which drives the enhanced myeloid response. The age-associated decline of DNA methyltransferase 3A enhances IL-1⍺ production, and disrupting IL-1 receptor 1 signaling early during tumor development normalized myelopoiesis and slowed the growth of lung, colonic, and pancreatic tumors. In human tumors, we identified an enrichment for IL-1⍺–expressing monocyte-derived macrophages linked to age, poorer survival, and recurrence, unraveling how aging promotes cancer and offering actionable therapeutic strategies.",

Microplastics arise from multiple sources, including tires, textiles, cosmetics, paint, and the fragmentation of larger items. They are widely distributed throughout the natural environment, with evidence of harm at multiple levels of biological organization. They are pervasive in food and drink and have been detected throughout the human body, with emerging evidence of negative effects. Environmental contamination could double by 2040, and wide-scale harm has been predicted. Public concern is increasing, and diverse measures to address microplastic pollution are being considered in international negotiations.

Trapping of RNA–cross-linked peptides showed that the glutamic acid–arginine (ER) patch, a residue-coevolved polyampholytic element present in coiled coils, enhances RNA binding of its host RBPs. Deletion of this element in NONO (non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein) led to a defective mitosis-to-meiosis transition due to compromised NONO-RNA interactions. Whole-exome sequencing of over 1000 infertile men revealed a prominent role of RBPs in the human genetic architecture of male infertility and identified risk ER patch variants.",

          "abstract": "Intrinsically motivated information seeking is an expression of curiosity believed to be central to human nature. However, most curiosity research relies on small, Western convenience samples. Here, we analyze a naturalistic population of 482,760 readers using Wikipedia’s mobile app in 14 languages from 50 countries or territories. By measuring the structure of knowledge networks constructed by readers weaving a thread through articles in Wikipedia, we replicate two styles of curiosity previously identified in laboratory studies: the nomadic “busybody” and the targeted “hunter.” Further, we find evidence for another style—the “dancer”—which was previously predicted by a historico-philosophical examination of texts over two millennia and is characterized by creative modes of knowledge production. We identify associations, globally, between the structure of knowledge networks and population-level indicators of spatial navigation, education, mood, well-being, and inequality. These results advance our understanding of Wikipedia’s global readership and demonstrate how cultural and geographical properties of the digital environment relate to different styles of curiosity.",

Improved SWB in later adulthood has been considered a paradox given age-related declines in health and social losses. While SWB has mostly been studied in high-income countries, it remains largely unexplored in rural subsistence populations lacking formal institutions that reliably promote social welfare. Here, we evaluate the age profile of SWB among three small-scale subsistence societies ( n = 468; study 1), forest users from 23 low-income countries ( n = 6987; study 2), and Tsimane’ horticulturalists ( n = 1872; study 3). Across multiple specifications, we find variability in SWB age profiles. In some cases, we find no age-related differences in SWB or even inverted U-shapes. Adjusting for confounders reduces observed age effects. Our findings highlight variability in average well-being trajectories over the life course. Ensuring successful aging will require a greater focus on cultural and socioecological determinants of individual trajectories.",

Here, we propose and test a framework that integrates economic multifunctionality, encompassing timber production–oriented goals and resistance against disturbances, with multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality in European beech forest stands enriched with conifers. Our results show that enriched beech forest stands (~80 years old) can provide high levels of economic multifunctionality without compromising multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality. In comparison to pure beech stands, enriched stands with Douglas-fir supported win-win-win situations for these three dimensions. Our findings contribute to the discussion of integrating biodiversity, ecosystem, and economic functions, providing empirical evidence for future forest management.",

          "abstract": "While it is often argued that continuous exposure to social feedback is specifically challenging for the hypersensitive developing brain, empirical evidence is lacking. Across three studies, we reveal the developmental differences and computational mechanisms that underlie the social media engagement and feedback processing of adolescents and adults. First, using a reinforcement learning model on a large Instagram trace dataset ( N = 16,613, 1.6+ million posts), we show that adolescents are more sensitive to social feedback than adults. Second, in an experimental study ( N = 194), we show that adolescents’ mood is affected more strongly by a reduction in likes than adults. Last, in a neuroimaging study ( N = 96), we show that social media feedback sensitivity is related to individual differences in subcortical-limbic brain volumes of emerging adults. Together, these findings highlight the need for digital competence programs to help youth manage the constant feedback they encounter on social media platforms.",

This phenomenon is relatively well understood for inorganic materials but much less so for organic semiconductors (OSs). These materials present a challenge because the strong thermal fluctuations of electronic coupling between the molecules result in partially delocalized charge carriers that cannot be treated with traditional theories for thermoelectricity. Here, we develop a quantum dynamical simulation approach revealing in atomistic detail how the charge carrier wave function moves along a temperature gradient in an organic molecular crystal. We find that the wave function propagates from hot to cold in agreement with the experiment, and we obtain a Seebeck coefficient in good agreement with experimental measurements that are also reported in this work. Detailed analysis reveals that gradients in thermal electronic disorder play an important role in determining the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient, opening unexplored avenues for the design of OSs with improved Seebeck coefficients.",

Here, we report the development of a chemoproteomic platform, single-cell activity-dependent proximity ligation, which uses automated, microfluidics-based single-cell capture and nanoliter volume manipulations to convert the interactions of family-wide chemical activity probes with native protein targets into multiplexed, amplifiable oligonucleotide barcodes. We demonstrate accurate, reproducible, and multiplexed quantitation of a six-enzyme (Ag-6) panel with known ties to cancer cell aggressiveness directly in single cells.

We report an anisotropic composite PEM, mimicking the water-conductive composite structure of bamboo that meets this challenge. Micro- and nanoscale alignment of conductive pathways is achieved by in-plane thermal compression of a mat composed of co-electrospun Nafion and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers stabilizing the alignment. This translates to pronounced TP-enhanced proton conductivity, twice that of pure Nafion at high humidity, 13 times larger at low humidity, and 10 times larger water diffusivity. This remarkable improvement is elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that stronger nanochannels alignment upon dehydration compensates for reduced water content. The presented approach paves the way to overcoming the major drawbacks of ionomers and advancing the development of next-generation membranes for energy applications.",

Here, we report on Autler-Townes splitting observed in CdSe nanoplatelets. The strong intersubband transition of these nanoplatelets situated in the near-infrared allows us to coherently drive it with femtosecond near-infrared pulses, and meanwhile, their strong interband transition in the visible records the resultant spectral changes. The splitting is most prominent with cross-polarized, linear pump-probe pulses, consistent with the orthogonal polarizations of interband and intersubband transition dipoles. When the nanoplatelets are driven from tilted incident angles, we observe anomalous spectral lineshapes arising from a competition between interband and intersubband drivings, which are nevertheless quantitatively captured by our dressed-state model simulation.",

In this misguided repair process, activated fibroblasts drive the destruction of organ architecture by accumulating and contracting extracellular matrix. The resulting stiff scar tissue, in turn, enhances fibroblast contraction—bearing the question of how this positive feedback loop begins. We show that direct contact with profibrotic but not proinflammatory macrophages triggers acute fibroblast contractions. The contractile response depends on αvβ3 integrin expression on macrophages and Piezo1 expression on fibroblasts. The touch of macrophages elevates fibroblast cytosolic calcium within seconds, followed by translocation of the transcription cofactors nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 and Yes-associated protein, which drive fibroblast activation within hours. Intriguingly, macrophages induce mechanical stress in fibroblasts on soft matrix that alone suppresses their spontaneous activation. We propose that acute contact with suitable macrophages mechanically kick-starts fibroblast activation in an otherwise nonpermissive soft environment. The molecular components mediating macrophage-fibroblast mechanotransduction are potential targets for antifibrosis strategies.",

Depending on replication and the scaffolding protein 52K, late-replicated vDNA with rapidly exchanging green fluorescent protein–tagged capsid linchpin protein V and incomplete virions emerged from the VRC periphery. These nanogel-like puncta exhibited restricted movements and were located with the capsid proteins hexon, VI, and virions in the nuclear periphery, suggestive of sites for virion formation.

However, molecular electron density determination has so far not been achieved because of low photon counts, high noise levels, and low hit rates. Most approaches therefore focus on large specimen like entire viruses, which scatter sufficiently many photons to allow orientation determination of each image. Small specimens like proteins, however, scatter too few photons for the molecular orientations to be determined. Here, we present a rigorous Bayesian approach to overcome these limitations, additionally taking into account intensity fluctuations, beam polarization, irregular detector shapes, incoherent scattering, and background scattering. We demonstrate using synthetic scattering images that electron density determination of small proteins is possible in this extreme high noise Poisson regime. Tests on published virus data achieved the detector-limited resolution of 9 nm, using only 0.01% of the available photons per image.",

This result is unexpected because GHZ states do not provide any enhancement under dephasing due to white frequency noise compared to the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated states. The gain arises from a veto signal, which allows for the detection and mitigation of errors caused by spontaneous emission events.

Here, we decode the errors associated with writing and shifting domain walls using nanosecond current pulses in a ~5-micrometer-wide wire composed of a Pt/GdFeCo bilayer. We find that writing a domain wall at the edge of the wire causes a bit positioning error of ~0.3 micrometers, whereas the shifting process induces an error of ~0.1 micrometers per a 2-nanosecond-long current pulse. The error correlation among successive shifting is negligible when the current drive is sufficiently large.

Here, we propose an alternative approach to solve the electronic structure problem using VQE with a single qudit. Our approach exploits a high-dimensional orbital angular momentum state of a heralded single photon and notably reduces the required quantum resources compared to conventional multi-qubit–based VQE. We experimentally demonstrate that our single-qudit–based VQE can efficiently estimate the ground state energy of hydrogen (H 2 ) and lithium hydride (LiH) molecular systems corresponding to two- and four-qubit systems, respectively.

This work designs a type II band alignment in STM junction to achieve effective charge-transfer state decoupling. This strategy enables the successful identification of the lowest-frequency H g (ω 1 ) (Raman-active H g mode) vibronic excitation within single C 60 molecules, which, despite being notably pronounced in electron transport of C 60 single-molecule transistors, has remained hidden at submolecular level. Our results show that the observed H g (ω 1 ) excitation is “anchored” to all molecules, irrespective of local geometry, challenging common understanding of structural definition of vibronic excitation governed by Franck-Condon principle. Density functional theory calculations reveal existence of molecule-substrate interfacial charge-transfer dipole, which, although overlooked previously, drives the dominant H g (ω 1 ) excitation.

We reconstruct patterns in mineral aerosol flux from East Asia, the second largest global dust source, in a peat mire in northern Japan. Using geochemical fingerprinting, we show for the past ~3600 years that high but variable tephra flux dominated regional aerosol loads. A human signal was discernible as elevated pollutant metals, along with East Asian mainland dust, identifiable by its geochemical signature. After ~700 years before the present, dust flux increased as the westerly jet intensified and moved south, the summer monsoon strength reduced, and agriculture expanded. From the 20th century, dust flux increased by two times. Attributable largely to human activity, this demarks a major change in aerosol export to the northwestern Pacific with accompanying increases in fluxes for key micronutrients and increased pollution flux by 16 times.",

          "abstract": "Brain-inspired machine intelligence research seeks to develop computational models that emulate the information processing and adaptability that distinguishes biological systems of neurons. This has led to the development of spiking neural networks, a class of models that promisingly addresses the biological implausibility and the lack of energy efficiency inherent to modern-day deep neural networks. In this work, we address the challenge of designing neurobiologically motivated schemes for adjusting the synapses of spiking networks and propose contrastive signal–dependent plasticity, a process which generalizes ideas behind self-supervised learning to facilitate local adaptation in architectures of event-based neuronal layers that operate in parallel. Our experimental simulations demonstrate a consistent advantage over other biologically plausible approaches when training recurrent spiking networks, crucially side-stepping the need for extra structure such as feedback synapses.",

We report in Mus species that (i) mammalian nuclear/cytoplasmic hybrids can be created, (ii) they allow development and viability of a previously missing and uncharacterized hybrid class, (iii) different oocyte cytoplasm environments lead to different phenotypes of same nuclear hybrid genotype, and (iv) the novel hybrids exhibit sex ratio distortion with the absence of female progeny and represent a mammalian exception to Haldane’s rule.

By properly arranging the vibratory motions of the magnet, cantilever, and linkages, the pitching movement of the body and the vibration of the forelegs are in phase during the first-order vibration mode of the cantilever and in antiphase during the second-order mode, which induces the forward and backward movement of the microrobot.

However, the regulatory mechanisms governing social dominance, as well as the crucial regulators and biomarkers involved, remain poorly understood. We discover that mice lacking acid-sensing ion channel 2 (ASIC2) exhibit persistently higher social dominance than their wild-type cagemates. Conversely, overexpression of ASIC2 in the medial prefrontal cortex reverses the dominance hierarchy observed in ASIC2 knockout ( Asic2 −/− ) mice. Asic2 −/− neurons exhibit increased synaptic transmission and plasticity, potentially mediated by protein kinase A signaling pathway. Furthermore, ASIC2 plays distinct functional roles in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, thereby modulating the balance of neuronal activities underlying social dominance behaviors—a phenomenon suggestive of a cell subtype–specific mechanism. This research lays the groundwork for understanding the mechanisms of social dominance, offering potential insights for managing social disorders, such as depression and anxiety.",

While the proneural factor achaete-scute complex-like 1 ( Ascl1 ) is widely used for neuronal reprogramming, in the early postnatal mouse cortex, Ascl1 fails to induce the glia-to-neuron conversion, instead promoting the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC). Since Ascl1 activity is posttranslationally regulated, here, we investigated the consequences of mutating six serine phospho-acceptor sites to alanine (Ascl1SA6) on lineage reprogramming in vivo. Ascl1SA6 exhibited increased neurogenic activity in the glia of the early postnatal mouse cortex, an effect enhanced by coexpression of B cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl2 ). Genetic fate-mapping revealed that most induced neurons originated from astrocytes, while only a few derived from OPCs. Many Ascl1SA6/Bcl2-induced neurons expressed parvalbumin and were capable of high-frequency action potential firing. Our study demonstrates the authentic conversion of astroglia into neurons featuring subclass hallmarks of cortical interneurons, advancing our scope of engineering neuronal fates in the brain.",

We observed that TgMIF that interacts with CD74, antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) modulates endocytosis, restoration of mitochondrial function, and macrophage polarization, respectively. These interactions promote therapeutic efficacy in mice infected with MTB, thereby presenting a potential route to host-directed therapy development. Furthermore, TgMIF, in combination with first-line TB drugs, significantly inhibited drug-resistant MTB strains, including multidrug-resistant TB.

Here, we set out to determine whether FGF21 has a major impact on Kupffer cells’ (KCs) ability during MASH-HCC transition. We found aberrant hepatic FGF21 and KC pool in human MASH-HCC. Lack of FGF21 up-regulated ALOX15, which converted the oxidized fatty acids to induce excessive KC death and mobilization of monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs) for KC replacement. Lack of FGF21 oversupplied free fatty acids for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) cascade synthesis to mediate MASH-HCC transition via S1P-YAP signaling and cross-talk between tumor cells and macrophages. In conclusion, lack of FGF21 accelerated MASH-HCC transition via the S1P-AP signaling.

Using temporal interference measurements, we observe coherent oscillations between a pair of counter-circulating vortex states coupled by elastic scattering of polaritons off the laser-imprinted potential. The qubit basis states correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the two vortex states. By engineering the potential, we tune the coupling and coherent oscillations between the two circulating current states, control the energies of the qubit basis states, and initialize the qubit in the desired state.

We investigated how migrations of diverse fish community from Lake Biwa, Japan contribute to nutrient inputs in one of the lake’s tributary rivers and how they influence the ecosystem. Sequential migration of six fish species continued for 8 months of a year, causing high-level nutrient concentration and primary production. The fish-derived resources were taken up by diverse members of the river community.

Epithelial injury during colitis is associated with transient stem cell reprogramming from the adult, homeostatic to a “fetal-like” regenerative state. Here, we use murine and organoid-based models to study the role of Trp53 during epithelial reprogramming. We find that p53 signaling is silent and dispensable during homeostasis but strongly up-regulated in the epithelium upon DSS-induced colitis. While in WT cells this causes termination of the regenerative state, crypts that lack Trp53 remain locked in the highly proliferative, regenerative state long-term. The regenerative state in WT cells requires high Wnt signaling to maintain elevated levels of glycolysis. Instead, Trp53 deficiency enables Wnt-independent glycolysis due to overexpression of rate-limiting enzyme PKM2. Our study reveals the context-dependent relevance of p53 signaling specifically in the injury-induced regenerative state, explaining the high abundance of clones lacking p53 signaling in UC and UC-associated CRC.",

Among them, the quantum Hall current is a representative example. Realized in two-dimensional electronic systems under a strong magnetic field, the topological protection quantizes the Hall conductance in the unit of e 2 / h ( e , elementary charge; and h , Planck constant), of which the edge transport picture gives a good account.

Many stresses, such as telomere shortening and oncogene activation, induce senescence by damaging nuclear DNA. However, the mechanisms linking DNA damage to senescence remain unclear. Here, we show that DNA damage response (DDR) signaling to mitochondria triggers senescence. A genome-wide small interfering RNA screen implicated the outer mitochondrial transmembrane protein BNIP3 in senescence induction. We found that BNIP3 is phosphorylated by the DDR kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and contributes to an increase in the number of mitochondrial cristae. Stable isotope labeling metabolomics indicated that the increase in cristae enhances fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to acetyl–coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). This promotes histone acetylation and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 INK4a . Notably, pharmacological activation of FAO alone induced senescence both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, mitochondrial energy metabolism plays a critical role in senescence induction and is a potential intervention target to control senescence.",

Nanoscale imaging supported by atomic-scale molecular simulations tracked the adsorption and proliferation of oligomeric assemblies at nonperiodically spaced catalytic sites on the fibril surface. Upon confirming that fibril edges are preferential binding sites for oligomers during embryonic stages, the secondary fibrillar size changes were quantified during the growth stages.

Multiomic analysis of primary meningiomas revealed that MRMs have greater copy number losses ( P = 0.0313) and increased DNA methylation ( P = 0.0155). In meningioma cells with knockdown of EDNRB , a locus with greater promoter methylation and decreased gene expression in MRMs had increased proliferation ( P &lt; 0.0001). MRM recurrences were found to be similar to primaries but have a greater burden of copy number gains ( P &lt; 0.0001) and increased methylation ( P = 0.0045). This clinical and multiomic investigation of MRMs harbors implications for the future development of biomarkers and therapeutic agents for these challenging tumors.",

          "abstract": "The master regulator of the DNA damage response, the transcription factor p53, orchestrates multiple downstream responses and coordinates repair processes. In response to double-strand DNA breaks, p53 exhibits pulses of expression, but how it achieves temporal coordination of downstream responses remains unclear. Here, we show that p53’s posttranslational modification state is altered between its first and second pulses of expression. We show that acetylations at two sites, K373 and K382, were reduced in the second pulse, and these acetylations differentially affected p53 target genes, resulting in changes in gene expression programs over time. This interplay between dynamics and modification may offer a strategy for cellular hubs like p53 to temporally organize multiple processes in individual cells.",

          "abstract": "Precise and efficient delivery of macromolecules into cells enhances basic biology research and therapeutic applications in cell therapies, drug delivery, and personalized medicine. While pulsed electric field electroporation effectively permeabilizes cell membranes to deliver payloads without the need for toxic chemical or viral transduction agents, conventional bulk electroporation devices face major challenges with cell viability and heterogeneity due to variations in fields generated across cells and electrochemistry at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Here, we introduce the use of microfabricated electrodes based on the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), which substantially increases cell viability and transfection efficiency. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the enhanced delivery of Cas9 protein, guide RNA, and plasmid DNA into cell lines and primary cells. This use of PEDOT:PSS enables rapid modification of difficult-to-transfect cell types to accelerate their study and use as therapeutic platforms.",

          "authors": "Peter J. Bishop, Stephanie E. Pierce",
          "abstract": "The evolutionary transition from early synapsids to therian mammals involved profound reorganization in locomotor anatomy and function, centered around a shift from “sprawled” to “erect” limb postures. When and how this functional shift was accomplished has remained difficult to decipher from the fossil record alone. Through biomechanical modeling of hindlimb force-generating performance in eight exemplar fossil synapsids, we demonstrate that the erect locomotor regime typifying modern therians did not evolve until just before crown Theria. Modeling also identifies a transient phase of increased performance in therapsids and early cynodonts, before crown mammals. Further, quantifying the global actions of major hip muscle groups indicates a protracted juxtaposition of functional redeployment and conservatism, highlighting the intricate interplay between anatomical reorganization and function across postural transitions. We infer a complex history of synapsid locomotor evolution and suggest that major evolutionary transitions between contrasting locomotor behaviors may follow highly nonlinear trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian cells make the decision to divide at the G 1 -S transition in response to diverse signals impinging on the retinoblastoma protein Rb, a cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor. Passage through the G 1 -S transition is initially driven by Rb inactivation via phosphorylation and by Rb’s decreasing concentration in G 1 . While many studies have identified the mechanisms of Rb phosphorylation, the mechanism underlying Rb’s decreasing concentration in G 1 was unknown. Here, we found that Rb’s concentration decrease in G 1 requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5. UBR5 knockout cells have increased Rb concentration in early G 1 , exhibited a lower G 1 -S transition rate, and are more sensitive to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (Cdk4/6). This last observation suggests that UBR5 inhibition can strengthen the efficacy of Cdk4/6 inhibitor–based cancer therapies.",

          "abstract": "Ex vivo or in vivo cell-hitchhiking has emerged as a potential means for efficient drug delivery and various disease therapies. However, many challenges remain, such as the complicated engineering process and dependence on ligand-receptor interaction. Here, we present a simple in vivo platelet-hitchhiking strategy based on self-assembling peptides without ligand modification. The engineered peptide nanofibers can hitchhike ultrafast (&lt;5 s) and efficiently on both resting and activated platelets in a receptor-independent and species-independent manner. Mechanistic studies showed that unique secondary structure of nanofibers, which lead to surface exposure of hydrophobic and hydrogen bond–forming groups, might primarily contribute to the selective and efficient platelet-hitchhiking behavior. After intravenous injection, these peptide nanofibers hitchhiked in situ on circulating platelets and achieved almost 20-fold lung accumulation. Our study provides not only a different paradigm of in vivo platelet-hitchhiking beyond ligand-receptor recognition but also a potential strategy for lung-targeted drug delivery and pulmonary disease therapy.",
