          "abstract": "Electrolyte solvents for electrochemical devices have been dominated by oxygen (O)-based and nitrogen (N)-based ligands over the past decades1,2,3,4,5, for which the dipole–ion (Li+, Na+ and so on) interaction usually lays the foundations of ion dissociation and transport but frustrates the charge transfer process at the electrolyte–electrode interface6,7,8,9. Here, by synthesizing alkanes with monofluorinated structures, we show that fluorine (F)-based ligands with designed steric hindrance and Lewis basicity enable salt dissolution of more than 2 mol l−1. Among them, 1,3-difluoro-propane (DFP)-based Li-ion electrolyte is endowed with all merits for energy-dense and low-temperature batteries, including low viscosity (0.95 cp), high oxidation stability (>4.9 V) and ionic conductivity of 0.29 mS cm−1 at −70 °C. By incorporating F atoms in the first solvation shell, the weak F–Li+ coordination facilitates the Li plating/stripping process with Coulombic efficiency (CE) up to 99.7% and exchange current density one magnitude larger than O–Li+ coordination at −50 °C. The electrolytes further enable the operation of lithium-metal pouch cells under an electrolyte amount of less than 0.5 g Ah−1, achieving energy densities greater than 700 Wh kg−1 at room temperature and about 400 Wh kg−1 at −50 °C. The hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) electrolytes in this work provide a feasible approach to building electrochemical systems beyond traditional coordination chemistry.",

          "abstract": "The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogues of the high-temperature cuprates 1–6 . Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high critical temperatures ( T c ) under pressure came as a surprise 7–13 . The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. Apart from the practical challenges posed by working in a high-pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous ‘filamentary’ superconducting states 7,9,14–17 . Here we perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as-grown La 3 Ni 2 O 7 samples in situ, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell 18–23 . These maps confirm marked inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few μm scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged in situ, and stoichiometric composition, we show the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behaviour and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure–function correlations observed at the sub-μm pixel scale.",

          "abstract": "Alvarezsauroids are an enigmatic clade of predominantly small-bodied theropod dinosaurs that are known mainly from the Jurassic to Cretaceous periods of Asia and South America1,2,3. Late Cretaceous alvarezsauroids possess specialized forelimbs adapted for digging4,5, minute supernumerary teeth and heightened sensory capacities6, and are interpreted as myrmecophagous. They are hypothesized to exhibit evolutionary miniaturization coupled to their dietary specialization2. Fragmentary South American taxa are traditionally arrayed as a paraphyletic grade with respect to the Late Cretaceous Asian subclade Parvicursorinae2,3, invoking dispersal to explain their disjunct distributions. Here we describe a skeleton of the alvarezsauroid Alnashetri cerropoliciensis7 representing to our knowledge the most complete and smallest South American taxon to date. We also recognize two alvarezsauroids among historic taxa from the Northern Hemisphere. Phylogenetic analysis recovers Alnashetri among basal non-alvarezsaurids, rendering South American taxa polyphyletic. Combined with the new taxa recognized here, our biogeographical analyses infer a Pangaean ancestral distribution for Alvarezsauroidea, with vicariance dominating the early history of the clade. The early branching position of Alnashetri among larger-bodied relatives revises best-fit models of body size evolution in alvarezsauroids—we find no support for evolutionary miniaturization but, rather, find support for repeated evolution within a narrow body size range.",

          "abstract": "Multicellularity evolved independently multiple times in eukaryotes 1–4 . Two distinct mechanisms underpin multicellularity 5 : clonality (serial cell division without sister-cell separation) and aggregation (whereby independent cells assemble into a multicellular entity). Clonal and aggregative multicellularity are traditionally considered to be mutually exclusive 1,6–8 , with rare exceptions 9 , and evolutionary hypotheses have addressed why multicellularity might diverge towards one or the other extreme 3,4 . Both animals and their sister group, the choanoflagellates, are currently known to acquire multicellularity only clonally 4,10,11 . Here we show that the choanoflagellate Choanoeca flexa 12 forms motile and contractile cell monolayers (sheets) through multiple mechanisms— C. flexa sheets can form purely clonally, purely aggregatively or through a combination of both processes. We characterize the life history of C. flexa in its natural environment—ephemeral splash pools on the island of Curaçao—and show that C. flexa undergoes reversible transitions between unicellularity and multicellularity during evaporation–refilling cycles. Different splash pools house genetically distinct strains of C. flexa and kin recognition constrains aggregation between them. We show that clonal-aggregative multicellularity is a versatile strategy for the robust establishment of multicellularity in this variable and fast-fluctuating environment. Our findings challenge former generalizations about choanoflagellates and expand the option space of choanozoan multicellularity.",

          "abstract": "Clonally expanded CD4+ T-cells harboring rebound-competent HIV persist lifelong during ART1-5. Latency is considered the principal barrier to viral eradication and has resisted pharmacological reversal6,7, yet sustained immune pressure appears to erode reservoirs8-15. Recent advances have yielded glimpses into exceptionally rare reservoir-harboring cells, implicating pro-survival properties in persistence16-18. Here, we isolate and characterize authentic reservoir clones (ARCs) that robustly proliferate and accumulate while producing infectious virus, without overtly succumbing to cytopathicity. At any moment, only small fractions of ARCs expressed HIV proteins, a state associated with conserved host transcriptional programs but remarkably refractory to potent T-cell stimulation. Nevertheless, sustained co-culture with a CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone substantially culled proliferating ARCs, revealing time-integrated vulnerability to immune pressure. The corresponding ex vivo CD8+ T-cell response was poorly cytotoxic and in vivo erosion of ARCs occurred only slowly. A regulatory T-cell ARC displayed pronounced cell-intrinsic resistance to CTL—a longstanding hypothesis now directly demonstrated—linked to low oxidative stress and reversed with deferoxamine19, a hypoxic stress inducer and FDA-approved therapeutic. Overall, we provide novel insights into the vulnerabilities of reservoir clones to potent, sustained CTL pressure and highlight intrinsic resistance pathways as actionable therapeutic targets, opening opportunities for advancing immune-based HIV cure strategies.",

Our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the channelling of neutral lipids in hepatocytes towards cytosolic lipid droplets or secreted lipoproteins remains incomplete 3,4 . Here we performed a series of CRISPR–Cas9 screens under different metabolic states that led to the identification of CLCC1 as a critical regulator of neutral lipid storage and secretion in hepatocytes. Loss of CLCC1 resulted in the buildup of large lipid droplets in hepatoma cells and Clcc1 knockout in mice caused liver steatosis. Lipid droplets were present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum of the Clcc1 -knockout hepatocytes and exhibited properties of lipoproteins, indicating a profound shift in neutral lipid flux. The loss of CLCC1 also led to the accumulation of nuclear membrane herniations accompanied by a reduction in nuclear pores. Remote homology searches identified a domain in CLCC1 that is homologous to yeast Brl1 and Brr6, factors that promote nuclear envelope fusion during nuclear pore complex assembly. Molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis studies support a model in which CLCC1 mediates membrane bending and fusion. We propose that CLCC1 mediates membrane fusion to promote hepatic neutral lipid flux and nuclear pore complex assembly.",

          "authors": "Valerio Francioni, Vincent D. Tang, Enrique H. S. Toloza, Zilan Ding, Norma J. Brown, Mark T. Harnett",
          "abstract": "Vectorization of teaching signals is a key element of almost all modern machine learning algorithms, including backpropagation, target propagation and reinforcement learning. Vectorization allows a scalable and computationally efficient solution to the credit assignment problem by tailoring instructive signals to individual neurons. Recent theoretical models have suggested that neural circuits could implement single-phase vectorized learning at the cellular level by processing feedforward and feedback information streams in separate dendritic compartments1,2,3,4,5. This presents a compelling, but untested, hypothesis for how cortical circuits could solve credit assignment in the brain. Here we used a neurofeedback brain–computer interface task with an experimenter-defined reward function to test for vectorized instructive signals in dendrites. We trained mice to modulate the activity of two spatially intermingled populations (four or five neurons each) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the retrosplenial cortex to rotate a visual grating towards a target orientation while we recorded GCaMP activity from somas and corresponding distal apical dendrites. We observed that the relative magnitudes of somatic and dendritic signals could be predicted using the activity of the surrounding network and contained information about task-related variables that could serve as instructive signals, including reward and error. The signs of these putative teaching signals depended on the causal role of individual neurons in the task and predicted changes in overall activity over the course of learning. Furthermore, targeted optogenetic perturbation of these signals disrupted learning. These results demonstrate a vectorized instructive signal in the brain, implemented via semi-independent computation in cortical dendrites, unveiling a potential mechanism for solving credit assignment in the brain.",

          "abstract": "Oncogenes such as KRAS display marked tissue specificity in their oncogenic potential, genetic interactions and phenotypic effects, but the underlying determinants remain largely unresolved 1–5 . Here, to address these questions, we developed the Mouse Cancer Cell line Atlas, a broad-utility resource of 590 comprehensively characterized models across a wide range of entities ( www.mcca.tum.de ). Comparative and functional studies using this platform, human cohorts and mice identified core principles underlying tissue-specific evolution of KRAS -initiated cancers. First, we show that mutant KRAS dosage gain through allelic imbalance exerts cell-type-specific effects, defining its timing across entities, as exemplified by dosage-sensitive developmental reprogramming during pancreatic cancer initiation. Second, we highlight how tissue- and stage-specific evolutionary requirements, such as block of differentiation in the intestine, select for KRAS -collaborating alterations. Third, we identified context-dependent epistatic KRAS –tumour suppressor interactions and show that reciprocal dosage sensitivities dictate the entity-specific patterns of cancer gene alterations, explaining their frequency, zygosity and acquisition chronology. These findings highlight how intrinsic and acquired determinants instruct cancer evolution in different tissues, with predictable molecular patterns, temporal dynamics and phenotypic outcomes. Our study provides major advances towards a mechanistic understanding of cancer genomes.",

          "abstract": "A powerful approach to understand the computations carried out by the visual cortex is to build models that predict neural responses to any arbitrary image. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as the leading predictive models1,2, yet their underlying computations remain buried beneath millions of parameters. Here we challenge the need for models at this scale by seeking predictive and parsimonious DNN models of the primate visual cortex. We first built a highly predictive DNN model of neural responses in macaque visual area V4 by alternating data collection and model training in adaptive closed-loop experiments. We then compressed this large, black-box DNN model, which comprised 60 million parameters, to identify compact models with 5,000 times fewer parameters yet comparable accuracy. This dramatic compression enabled us to investigate the inner workings of the compact models. We discovered a salient computational motif: compact models share similar filters in early processing, but individual models then specialize their feature selectivity by ‘consolidating’ this shared high-dimensional representation in distinct ways. We examined this consolidation step in a dot-detecting model neuron, revealing a computational mechanism that leads to a testable circuit hypothesis for dot-selective V4 neurons. Beyond V4, we found strong model compression for macaque visual areas V1 and IT (inferior temporal cortex), revealing a general computational principle of the visual cortex. Overall, our work challenges the notion that large DNNs are necessary to predict individual neurons and establishes a modelling framework that balances prediction and parsimony.",

          "abstract": "Coral reefs are marine biodiversity hotspots that provide a wide range of ecosystem services 1 . They are reservoirs of bioactive metabolites, many produced by microorganisms associated with reef invertebrate hosts 2 . However, for the keystone species of coral reefs—the reef-building corals—we still lack a systematic assessment of their microbially encoded biosynthetic potential and the molecular resources at stake due to the alarming decline in reef biodiversity. Here we analysed microbial genomes reconstructed from 820 reef-building coral samples of three representative coral genera collected at 99 reefs across 32 islands throughout the Pacific Ocean ( Tara Pacific expedition) 3 . By contextualizing our analyses with the microbiomes of other reef species, we found that only 10% of the 4,224 microbial species and less than 1% of the 645 species exclusively identified in Tara Pacific samples had genomic information available. Furthermore, the biosynthetic potential of reef-building coral microbiomes rivalled or surpassed that of traditional natural product sources such as sponges. Among the biosynthetically rich bacteria in the reef microbiome, we identified new groups of Acidobacteriota that encode previously unknown enzymology, in turn opening promising avenues for functional protein engineering. Together, this study underscores the importance of conserving coral reefs as vital reservoirs of molecular diversity.",

Here we devised and implemented a new platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and prominent mode confinement20,21,22,23,24. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br (κ-ET). The frequencies of infrared hyperbolic modes (HMs) of hBN (refs. 25,26) match the infrared-active carbon–carbon (C=C) stretching molecular resonance of κ-ET implicated in superconductivity27. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the C=C stretching mode in κ-ET. Meissner-effect measurements using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/κ-ET interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl3/κ-ET and hBN/Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (BSCCO), do not show the pronounced superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/κ-ET realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state.

The discovery that PIII and PV phosphorus intermediates can undergo transition metal-like two-electron chemistry raises the question whether radical PIV intermediates can mimic other elementary steps in organometallic chemistry2,3. Here we describe a phosphine-photoredox catalyst system that promotes intermolecular Markovnikov hydroamination of unactivated terminal alkenes with numerous classes of N–H azoles, a reaction that is not possible with late transition metal catalysis. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies support a new elementary step for main group catalysis wherein a phosphine radical cation activates the alkene to nucleophilic amination by the azole, a step otherwise associated with transition metals. Given the broad value of nucleophilic alkene functionalization in transition metal catalysis, this PIV mechanism could offer new opportunities for main group element catalysis and chemical synthesis.",

          "abstract": "The existence of human hippocampal neurogenesis has long been disputed1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 and its relevance in cognition remains unknown. Recent studies have established the presence of proliferating progenitors and immature neurons and a reduction in the latter in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)11,13. However, their origin and the molecular networks that regulate neurogenesis and function are poorly understood. Here we studied human post-mortem hippocampi obtained from different cohorts: young adults with intact memory, aged adults with no cognitive impairments, aged adults with extraordinary memory capacity (SuperAgers)14,15, adults with preclinical intermediate pathology or adults with AD. Using multiomic single-cell sequencing (single-nucleus RNA sequencing and single-nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing), we analysed the profiles of 355,997 nuclei isolated from the hippocampus samples and identified neural stem cells, neuroblasts and immature granule neurons. Dysregulated neurogenesis was largely associated with changes in chromatin accessibility. Analyses of transcription factors and target gene signatures that distinguished each of the groups revealed early alterations in chromatin accessibility of neurogenic cells from individuals with preclinical AD, and such changes were even more evident in samples from individuals with AD. We identified a distinct profile of neurogenesis in SuperAgers that may reflect a ‘resilience signature’. Finally, alterations in the profile of astrocytes and CA1 neurons govern cognitive function in the ageing hippocampus. Together, our study points to a multiomic molecular signature of the hippocampus that distinguishes cognitive resilience and deterioration with ageing.",

          "abstract": "Squeaking is a constant companion in various aspects of our daily lives, whether we slide rubber-soled shoes across hardwood floors1, scrape chalk on a blackboard2, engage the brakes on a bicycle3 or walk with a hip replacement4,5. When two rigid bodies slide over each other, squeaking is widely understood to result from self-excited stick–slip oscillations, triggered by a decrease in the friction coefficient with increasing slip velocity6,7,8,9,10. However, sliding of extended interfaces can involve crack or slip-pulse propagation11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21. This distinction is amplified when a soft body slides on a rigid one, in which large deformations and material mismatch can cause detachment by opening slip pulses22,23,24,25,26,27. Previous studies focused mainly on slow sliding17,26,28,29,30,31,32,33,34, in which pulses are slow and squeaking is absent. Although squeaking at soft–rigid interfaces has been linked to stick–slip oscillations35,36,37, the mechanisms remain unclear. Here we experimentally investigate soft–rigid interfaces sliding at velocities that produce squeaking. High-speed imaging and acoustic analysis show that opening pulses propagate at approximately the shear wave speed of the soft material, mediating local slip across diverse materials. In flat samples, these pulses are irregular and generate broadband acoustic emissions. Introducing thin surface ridges confines pulse propagation, yielding a consistent repetition frequency matching the first shear mode of the sliding block and squeaking at that frequency. These findings show a structure-driven mechanism that stabilizes rupture in bimaterial friction. Geometric confinement suppresses competing modes, transforming irregular two-dimensional dynamics into coherent one-dimensional pulse trains, offering new insights into frictional rupture from engineered surfaces to geological faults.",

          "abstract": "Cold stress restricts plant growth and inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake, reducing yield and increasing fertilizer demand1,2,3. Enhancing both cold tolerance and phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) is crucial for sustainable crop productivity. Here we identify the SPX-domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase NITROGEN LIMITATION ADAPTATION (NLA) as a central regulator that links cold signalling to Pi homeostasis in maize (Zea mays L.). Under cold conditions, NLA promotes the degradation of the transcriptional repressor JAZ11, activating jasmonate signalling to enhance cold tolerance; however, NLA also simultaneously represses Pi uptake, through inositol polyphosphate (InsP)-dependent ubiquitination of the Pi transporter PT4. A ubiquitinome-informed genome-wide association study identified a natural PT4(K267A) (lysine-to-alanine substitution) variant that attenuates NLA-mediated degradation and increases Pi uptake in cold conditions. To overcome this nutrient–stress trade-off, we combined artificial-intelligence-guided structural modelling and ligand docking with genome editing to generate the nlaΔ12 allele, which encodes an NLA variant in which binding to InsP is impaired but JAZ11 targeting is retained. The Δ12 modification selectively redirects the activity of NLA towards jasmonate signalling, resulting in improved cold resilience, higher PUE and increased yield in multi-site field trials. These findings reveal a tunable SPX regulatory module that integrates environmental and nutrient signals, and provide a molecular framework for engineering climate-resilient, nutrient-efficient crops.",

          "abstract": "Atopic diseases associated with allergens, as well as allergic diseases, frequently arise early in life; however, the age-dependent mechanisms governing immune responses to allergens remain poorly understood1. Here we find that in early life, exposure to common allergens triggers a distinct bifurcated immune response, simultaneously triggering type 17 inflammation in the skin and initiating canonical T helper 2 sensitization in the lymph nodes. This early-life γδ type 17-mediated dermatitis primes the exaggerated allergic lung inflammation upon secondary allergen exposure. Mechanistically, we find dendritic cell (DC)-mediated type 17 activation directly in the skin without requiring migration to lymph nodes; we term this state ‘peripheral immune inducer’ (pii) DC. CD301b+ conventional type 2 DCs acquire allergen, adopt the pii-DC state, produce IL-23 and activate local γδ type 17 cells independently of lymph-node engagement. The pii-DC state is enabled by the immature hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and physiologically low systemic glucocorticoids characteristic of early life2,3; DC-specific deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor recapitulates the pii-DC phenotype. These findings define a developmental checkpoint, set by neuroendocrine maturation, that enables in situ DC activation and immune induction, thereby shaping age-dependent responses to allergens.",

AH-LNP exhibits size enlargement after assembly with proteins, facilitating capsule-filter-mediated pancreas-selective accumulation and receptor-mediated endocytosis, thereby boosting the pancreatic-targeted ability. Benefiting from this, AH-LNP enables precise and efficient genome editing in the pancreas through the delivery of Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA), exhibiting promising potential in the treatment of autoimmune pancreatic diseases. Furthermore, pancreatic-targeted delivery of mRNA encoding therapeutic cytokines through AH-LNP demonstrates superior antitumour efficacy when combined with a cancer vaccine or chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy in multiple pancreatic cancer models. The safety and pancreatic mRNA delivery of AH-LNP were verified in multiple animal models, including non-human primates, demonstrating great promise for clinical translation.

We identified and comprehensively validated OR7A10, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), as the top candidate. Engineering CAR-NK cells with OR7A10 cDNA (a CRISPR-independent method with a simple manufacturing strategy) enhanced their proliferation, activation, degranulation, cytokine production, death ligand expression, chemokine receptor expression, cytotoxicity, persistence, metabolic fitness and tumour microenvironment resistance. Moreover, exhaustion in primary human NK cells derived from multiple peripheral blood and cord blood donors was reduced. OR7A10 gain-of-function CAR-NK cells displayed strong in vivo efficacy across multiple solid tumour models.

          "abstract": "Orchestration of lipid production, storage and mobilization is vital for cellular and systemic homeostasis1,2. Dysfunctional plasma lipid control represents the major risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases—the leading cause of human mortality3,4. Within the cellular landscape, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the central hub of lipid synthesis and secretion, particularly in metabolically active hepatocytes in the liver or enterocytes in the gut5,6. Initially assembled in the ER lumen, lipid-ferrying lipoproteins necessitate the cross-membrane transfer of both neutral and phospholipids onto the lumenal apolipoprotein B (APOB), in a poorly defined process7,8,9,10. Here we show that the ER protein CLCC1 regulates cellular lipid partition and, consequently, systemic lipid homeostasis by participating in trans-bilayer equilibration of phospholipids. CLCC1 partners with the phospholipid scramblase TMEM41B11,12 to recognize imbalanced bilayers and promote lipid scrambling, thereby supporting lipoprotein biogenesis and the subsequent bulk lipid transport. Loss of CLCC1 or TMEM41B leads to the emergence of giant lumenal lipid droplets enclosed by imbalanced ER bilayers and, consequently, accelerated pathogenesis of metabolic-dysfunction-associated liver steatohepatitis. The results reveal that phospholipid scrambling at the ER is essential for establishing a dynamic equilibrium. Considering the requirement of trans-bilayer phospholipid equilibration in numerous biological processes, ranging from catabolic autophagy to viral infection13,14,15,16, we anticipate that future work will elucidate a homeostatic control mechanism intrinsic to ER function in lipid biogenesis and distribution.",

This exceptional perception originates from the gradient cellular solids (with varying void- or solid-phase diameters) along the [001] spine axis, generating a differential charge density across the stereom surface during liquid flow. Inspired by this natural wisdom, we create artificial spine-like structures using three-dimensional printing technology that exhibit three-fold higher voltage output and eight-fold greater amplitude differential than gradient-free samples, as well as a nature-inspired metamaterial mechanoreceptor capable of time-resolved self-monitoring information underwater.

Finally, we detected regulatory epistasis at 11% of tested regulatory variants in close proximity and identified multiple functional variants on the same haplotype at a small, but important, subset of trait-associated loci.

          "abstract": "Chiral antiferromagnets1,2 host octupole order3,4 and combine the advantages of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets. Despite the development of numerous switching strategies5,6,7,8,9, the field-free full switching remains unknown, posing an important obstacle to their practical application in memory technology. Here we prepared a homo-junction constituted of Mn3Sn(0001) bottom layer and polycrystalline Mn3Sn top layer. The tilted Kagomé geometry in polycrystalline Mn3Sn divides the out-of-plane spin polarization from Mn3Sn(0001) layer10,11 into the out-of-Kagomé-plane and in-Kagomé-plane components, generating the symmetric (antiferromagnet-type) and asymmetric (ferromagnet-type) driving forces, respectively. The former accelerates octupole rotation, whereas the latter determines switching chirality. Field-free full switching is realized in the unconventional protocol that integrates the advantages of both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic switching. It goes beyond the conventional full-switching framework requiring perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy7,12. An unprecedented switching efficiency is achieved, with both current density and power consumption an order of magnitude lower than in previous configurations, by virtue of the highly efficient driving forces due to spin-torque characteristics of octupole order and the ultralow energy barrier arising from easy-plane anisotropy, overcoming their trade-off in conventional protocols. The zero-field switching also shows the advantages of octupole-programmable chirality and robustness to external magnetic field.",

          "abstract": "From mammals to bacteria, the direct recognition and cleavage of viral nucleic acids is a potent defence strategy against viral infection, but it requires mechanisms for distinguishing self from non-self 1,2 . In bacteria, CRISPR–Cas and restriction-modification systems achieve this discrimination by recognizing specific DNA sequences or DNA modifications, respectively. Alternative mechanisms probably remain to be discovered. Here, we characterize SNIPE, an anti-bacteriophage defence system that constitutively localizes to the bacterial cell membrane in Escherichia coli to block phage λ infection. Using radiolabelled phage DNA and time-lapse microscopy to track phage genomes, we demonstrate that SNIPE directly cleaves phage DNA during genome injection. Based on proximity labelling, we find that SNIPE associates with host proteins essential for λ genome entry and with the λ tape measure protein, which facilitates λ genome injection across the inner membrane. SNIPE also defends against diverse siphoviruses, probably through direct interactions with their tape measure proteins. Our findings establish SNIPE as a widespread bacterial defence system that exploits the spatial organization of phage genome injection to specifically target viral DNA, representing a previously unknown strategy for distinguishing self from non-self in prokaryotic immune systems.",

In recent years, there has been a steady increase in the development and deployment of DMH solutions, particularly those incorporating AI-based mental health support. In this Perspective, we consider both the technological and clinical design spaces and advocate for purpose-driven, patient-centred solutions rather than a technology-first approach. The purpose of DMH should be to address societal gaps in mental healthcare, following established frameworks for chronic illness management to meet the specific needs of each patient. We examine the ethical dimensions of DMH, underscoring the importance of procedural justice, harm prevention and data privacy. Additionally, we highlight the unique challenges faced by marginalized and vulnerable populations, emphasizing the role of DMH in promoting equal availability of mental healthcare. Aligning DMH with user perspectives, ethical considerations and clinician involvement can result in more effective and empathetic digital interventions, thereby transforming mental healthcare delivery.",

          "abstract": "Narratives about the motivations and conditions for mass violence as a persistent feature of conflict throughout human history have evolved in complexity and materiality. Victims of these events are key for understanding the evolution and transformative power of violent behaviour as it developed from simple intergroup conflict to more strategic mass violence. Here we present the results of a bioarchaeological study of 77 and biomolecular analysis of 25 individuals from a ninth-century BCE mass grave from Gomolava in the Carpathian Basin, Southeast Europe. The site is located at the interface of complex sociospatial relations, divergent cultural traditions and values, and competing ideologies of landscape use. We show that excessive lethal violence enacted mostly on women and children suggests a selective demographic bias. The people buried together shared few, even distant, genetic relationships, and so their killing presents striking evidence for an episode of cross-regional conflict and an underlying aggressive shift in power, violence and gender relations in the region. Gomolava provides evidence consistent with deliberate annihilation of select sections of a regional population as a motivation for mass violence behaviour in later prehistoric Europe. It also shines new light on the socioeconomic agency and importance of women and young individuals in later European prehistory.",

          "abstract": "The rapid integration of generative AI into academic writing has prompted widespread policy responses from journals and publishers. However, the effectiveness of these policies remains unclear. Here, we analyze 5,114 journals and over 5.2 million papers to evaluate the real-world impact of AI usage guidelines. We show that despite 70% of journals adopting AI policies (primarily requiring disclosure), researchers’ use of AI writing tools has increased dramatically across disciplines, with no significant difference between journals with or without policies. Non-English-speaking countries, physical sciences, and high-OA journals exhibit the highest growth rates. Crucially, full-text analysis on 164 k scientific publications reveals a striking transparency gap: Of the 75 k papers published since 2023, only 76 (~0.1%) explicitly disclosed AI use. Our findings suggest that current policies have largely failed to promote transparency or restrain AI adoption. We urge a reevaluation of ethical frameworks to foster responsible AI integration in science.",

          "abstract": "The Biden Administration enacted the largest federal policy framework to incentivize clean energy and decarbonization in U.S. history. We examine whether Biden-era green investments produced political returns by affecting public opinion. Using geolocated survey data linked to investment records and a database of company and politician statements, we assess project visibility and credit attribution. People closer to new renewable energy and green manufacturing facilities are more likely to notice these investments but are not more likely to credit the Biden Administration. Instead, the public sees governors as most responsible. This credit allocation pattern aligns with the political message environment: Governors more frequently claim credit than the White House and companies spread recognition broadly across political actors. This fragmented information environment illustrates the limits of using less traceable forms of green spending to generate electoral gains and public support for climate policy.",

          "abstract": "Social distancing can mitigate the spread of diseases in humans and animals. Social distancing allows susceptible individuals to protect themselves (and others) but confers no personal benefit for infected individuals if recovery provides immunity. However, individuals are likely to be at least weakly altruistic and may be interested in protecting others when infected. A strongly altruistic population where individuals value others as equal to themselves would be expected to self-isolate when infected. This would strongly suppress the disease, avoid Herd Immunity, and vastly improve outcomes. Still, little is known about how weaker altruism affects behavior during epidemics. Here we show using game theory that even extremely weakly altruistic individuals, valuing their own lives equivalent to roughly 100,000 others, can rationally achieve almost identical outcomes. Individuals self-isolate in order to avoid setting off chains of infections that they would perceive as costly to them even at such small altruism. Our results are robust to a moderate fraction of asymptomatic cases or completely selfish individuals. The resulting behavior, while emerging from a complex optimization problem, is simple enough that it could have evolved as a behavioral response in social animals, as well as being easy to communicate and understand for humans.",

According to some scholars, our craving for mind-altering drugs is an evolutionary mistake—a hijacking of our reward system. In contrast, the “drunk hypothesis” argues that intoxication has been adaptive and essential for the rise of large-scale societies because it promotes social bonding, increases cooperation, alleviates stress, and enhances human creativity. Here, we test this hypothesis using the example of kava, a traditional Pacific beverage with a range of psychoactive effects, made from the root of Piper methysticum . Our analysis of 83 Oceanic-speaking societies shows a positive relationship between traditional kava consumption and both political complexity and social stratification. However, the results are not robust to controls for nonindependence. Moreover, we found no evidence of coevolution between kava drinking and either of the two sociopolitical traits after controlling for spatial nonindependence. Despite the cultural significance of kava in many Pacific societies, our results suggest that its consumption was unlikely to have been a major driver of sociopolitical complexity, underscoring the importance of controlling for nonindependence in cross-cultural studies.",

          "abstract": "The American public consistently supports stricter gun laws. We show that the gun lobby is most concerned that this support will translate into federal legislative action when fatal school shootings occur. Leveraging a dataset of political action committee (PAC) contributions and school shootings, we implement a staggered difference-in-differences design to estimate the causal effect of fatal school shootings on contributions to House candidates. We find progun Political Action Committees increase contributions by 31% to candidates in districts with fatal school shootings, and 20% for gun safety PACs. Neither show any significant response to nonfatal school shootings or mass shootings. The temporal pattern also reveals strategic behavior: For both progun and gun safety PACs, contribution spikes emerge in the wake of fatal school shootings, with effects dramatically amplified as Election Day approaches; when a shooting occurs within two months of Election Day, contributions from progun PACs increase by 2,820% while gun safety PAC contributions increase by 917%. These effects are concentrated in competitive districts ( ≤ 5% margins) where the two-sided surge in contributions offsets any measurable electoral impact. These results provide robust evidence that PACs strategically deploy contributions after school shootings, with the magnitude and timing suggesting a deliberate mobilization to advance its agenda. Our findings underscore a gap in democratic accountability: While public opinion should drive policy change, campaign contributions are wielded to blunt electoral responsiveness, providing insight into the inability of Congress to adopt broadly supported gun safety measures.",

          "abstract": "Nuclear Envelope Membrane Protein 1 (NEMP1) is crucial for metazoan fertility; loss of Nemp1 causes death of primordial oocytes that reside in the mechanically challenging ovarian cortex. Here, we show that softening the ovary rescues oocyte loss and restores fertility in N emp1 knockout (KO) mice. In cell culture, NEMP1 depletion on stiff substrates leads to death, while cells remain viable on soft substrates. We further show that NEMP1 regulates YAP nuclear translocation, essential for mechanotransduction. Mechanistically, Nemp1-depleted cells on stiff substrates or subjected to stretching exhibit reduced nuclear YAP localization, and expressing nuclear YAP5SA restores cell viability. Loss of NEMP1 disrupts actin organization. Inducing actin polymerization partially rescues nuclear YAP, indicating a role for F-actin in NEMP1 mediated mechanotransduction. NEMP1 forms a complex with NESPRIN’s Klarsicht, Anchorage (ANC)-1, Syne Homology (KASH) domain, strengthening the actin cytoskeleton to withstand mechanical forces, independent of SUN proteins. Thus, the Nemp1–Nesprin complex supports a mechanosensitive pathway parallel to the LINC complex, enabling cellular response to mechanical stress in vitro and in vivo.",

          "abstract": "Structural analyses of ribosomes by single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) have traditionally relied on purified or reconstituted samples, with particles often trapped in desired states using genetic, pharmacological, or biochemical perturbations. While informative, such in vitro methods often fail to capture the full diversity of structural states and associated protein factors present in cells. In contrast, in situ cryoelectron tomography preserves cellular context but is limited by low throughput and modest resolution. Here, we present cryoPRISM (purification-free ribosome imaging from subcellular mixtures), a rapid ex vivo workflow encompassing cell lysis, vitrification, and image analysis methods for high-resolution analyses of ribosomal structures directly from cell lysates. Applying cryoPRISM in Escherichia coli , we resolved more than 20 distinct ribosomal states spanning assembly, translation initiation, elongation, trans-translation, and quiescence, including a novel configuration of EF-G bound to idle ribosomes with the ribosome hibernation factor ribosome-associated inhibitor A. Given its speed, accessibility, and ability to preserve native interactions and structural heterogeneity, we anticipate that cryoPRISM will be broadly applicable for uncovering ribosomal biology across diverse organisms and conditions.",

          "abstract": "Same-sex sexual behavior (SSB) in insects has historically been considered a byproduct of sex recognition failure, or “mistaken identity,” and consideration of other hypotheses lags behind that of vertebrates where it is often thought to adaptively mitigate aggressive interactions. Comparative analyses to help disentangle the functions of insect SSB are lacking. To address this, we quantified male–male interactions in controlled trials across eight North American field cricket species ( Gryllus spp.). While limited taxonomic sampling precluded a formal phylogenetic comparative analysis, we were able to assess variation across species with structural equation models. Using this technique, we distinguished focal from partner influences and evaluated support for mistaken identity vs. other models of SSB. SSB expression varied extensively across species. It was always associated with reduced aggression, but the strength of this association and the balance of focal vs. partner effects varied. Temporal analysis of behavioral interactions showed that males exhibited SSB while able to discern the sex of their partner. These findings, along with observations of a previously undescribed sexual behavior not seen in different-sex interactions, imply a history of adaptive evolution inconsistent with mistaken identity SSB.",

Despite this important sex-bias in sepsis outcomes, little is known about its mechanistic drivers nor therapeutic implications. Much of the foundational data on sepsis pathogenesis is derived from animal studies that included only male subjects, potentially contributing to the notable paucity of successful mouse-to-human translation of sepsis therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrate that male-biased illness severity and organ dysfunction in mouse models of bacterial sepsis are mediated by impaired disease tolerance in males, involving impaired tolerogenic shifts in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism compared to females. Microbiological and immunological analyses of sepsis between males and females revealed that sex-biased disease tolerance was independent of infection resistance mechanisms, as well as canonical immune/inflammatory dysregulation. Therapeutic potentiation of mitochondrial tolerance with doxycycline neutralized sexual dimorphism of illness severity and organ dysfunction through a male-predominant treatment effect. These data reveal that biological sex is a fundamental determinant of illness severity and treatment responsiveness in sepsis through modulation of disease tolerance, which may be harnessed therapeutically to address sex-biased outcomes in sepsis.",

          "abstract": "Evolution is a historical process whose trajectories are determined in part by the introduction of new phenotypes. Although most phenotypes have evolved repeatedly within and among clades of organisms, others are unique and apparently originated only once, and even the earliest occurrences of repeated traits were unique for their time. To investigate the timing and circumstances of these unique events, we compiled adult skeletal phenotypes with single origins and first occurrences of repeated traits as recorded in the fossil record in the phylum Mollusca. Of the 24 unique and 72 repeated traits we considered, 46 (48%) originated during the first 96 m.y. of molluscan history (frequency 1 per 2.1 m.y.) and only 50 in the 444 m.y. since then (frequency 1 per 8.9 m.y.), with secondary peaks of frequency in the Triassic and Cenozoic. We interpret this finding to mean that molluscan evolutionary history has become substantially more predictable over time despite increasing diversity. Expansions of the phylum from its ancestral marine epifaunal benthic environment to other habitats including fresh water and dry land were generally not associated with unique or earliest occurrences of repeated phenotypes. Most of the innovations enhanced individual defense or activity and were therefore honed by interactions within and among species, although it remains possible that they originated in temporarily permissive conditions in which genetic and other constraints were relaxed.",

Unlike existing methods developed for continuous and categorical phenotypes, rare-variant association tests (RVATs) for TTE phenotypes in large biobanks face several major challenges, including heavy censoring, cryptic relatedness, and population structure. We introduce GATE-STAAR (Genetic Analysis of Time-to-Event phenotypes via the variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation), a powerful and computationally efficient frailty model framework for RVATs of TTE phenotypes in large biobanks. GATE-STAAR accounts for high censoring rates, cryptic relatedness, and population structure in large biobanks, while incorporating multifaceted variant functional annotations to improve power and result interpretability. We propose a rare-variant saddlepoint approximation method to effectively address heavy censoring in WGS TTE analysis. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that GATE-STAAR is powerful while maintaining proper control of type I error rates. We apply GATE-STAAR to analyze the WGS data of approximately 400,000 UK Biobank participants of white British ancestry across a variety of TTE phenotypes, and validate the findings using participants of European ancestry from the All of Us Research Program.

          "abstract": "The social environment experienced during development plays a crucial role in shaping social competence—the ability to respond appropriately to social challenges. Sibling number and the social interactions between them are key components of the early lives in many animals. While these components are well known to influence social development in humans, their role in nonhuman animals remains unclear. Here, we show that both the number of siblings and opportunities for social interaction are essential for developing social competence in the highly social cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher . Fish reared in large broods (LB) displayed more affiliative and fewer aggressive or submissive behaviors during early life compared to those reared in small broods (SB) or in large broods with restricted opportunities for interactions (4 × 8). Later in life, LB fish were more socially competent. Thus, social competence arises not from the number of individuals or interactions alone, but from the combination of both.",

          "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is an essential cellular process that needs to operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions. Internalization of the endocytic site involves forces generated by membrane-bound proteins and Arp2/3-mediated branched actin filament assembly to bend the plasma membrane from flat to omega-shaped. In mammalian CME, the requirement for a branched actin filament network varies depending on cell type and differences in membrane tension. However, how the actin network adapts to changes in load in order to ensure robustness of this process over a range of membrane tensions is not understood. Here, we combine live-cell imaging and superresolution microscopy of genome-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells to investigate the role of the mammalian class-I myosin, Myosin1E (Myo1E), in load adaptation. Under normal conditions, sites that recruit Myo1E are rare and exhibit slow CME dynamics. However, as membrane tension increases and CME dynamics are slowed globally, Myo1E is recruited to more sites, likely to increase actin assembly and motor activity, resulting in increased force generation to rescue stalled sites and promote internalization. Loss of Myo1E results in increased Arp2/3 complex lifetime at CME sites under normal conditions, and at high membrane tension, these sites fail to recruit as many Arp2/3 molecules. We propose that Myo1E is recruited to CME sites that have stalled due to increased membrane tension, where it helps build a more effective branched actin network by generating force through motor activity and recruiting additional Arp2/3 complexes to rescue stalled sites.",

Understanding the climate response to such natural forcings is essential for obtaining reliable estimates of its response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. While the climate impacts of volcanic sulfate aerosols are well documented, other natural forcings—including wildfire smoke reaching the stratosphere and water vapor injections from a submarine eruption—pose new challenges for detecting and attributing their atmospheric temperature impacts. Here, we demonstrate robust detection of statistically significant temperature anomalies in the troposphere and stratosphere using multidecadal satellite observations and internal variability estimates from a climate model ensemble and from observations. We analyze three landmark events: the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, the 2019-2020 Australian wildfires, and the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption. Each leaves a fingerprint with distinct altitudinal, geographical, and temporal structure. The global-mean stratospheric signal from Australian wildfires is detectable even in time averages extending beyond 10 mo, despite injecting only ~5% of Pinatubo’s aerosol mass. For Hunga Tonga, we detect significant and prolonged stratospheric cooling, but no robust tropospheric signal in the first 2 y. These findings show that both sulfate and nonsulfate stratospheric perturbations produce distinct, statistically identifiable global temperature signals. Accounting for such forcings in climate model simulations is therefore essential for improving comparisons of simulated and observed variability.",

TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a major pathological protein that is inextricably associated with ALS and FTLD. In this study, we investigated the roles of neuronal TDP-43 in neuron–oligodendrocyte interactions using neuron-specific TDP-43 knockout (TDP-43cKO) mice. TDP-43 depletion in neurons induced hypomyelination, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural analysis. In addition, conduction disturbance was revealed by electrophysiological analysis. The hypomyelination of TDP-43cKO mouse was restored by cytoplasmic TDP-43 supplementation in neurons. Neuron-specific transcriptome analysis revealed that neurexin 1 (NRXN1) is the regulatory target of TDP-43, which promotes myelin formation. The hypomyelination of TDP-43cKO mice was also restored by NRXN1b supplementation in neurons. We further confirmed that TDP-43 stabilizes Nrxn1 mRNA by binding to the Nrxn1 3’untranslated region (3’UTR). Although TDP-43cKO exhibited impaired recognition memory, the supplementation of NRXN1 in the hippocampus recovered the memory disturbances. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the neuron–oligodendrocyte interaction mediated by neuronal TDP-43 via NRXN1 mRNA stabilization. These findings shed light on neuron–oligodendrocyte interaction in the disease mechanisms of ALS/FTLD.",

In this study, we uncovered the microscopic mechanism of competitive adsorption of multimetals on heterogeneous clay mineral surfaces using first principles calculation, which indicates that metal ion size largely dominates their complexation on clay mineral surfaces, and competitive adsorption of metals plays a key modulatory role in the adsorption process on clay minerals. By integrating theoretically and experimentally derived multiscale information, a state-of-the-art surface complexation model (SCM) framework has been developed for modeling competitive adsorption. Extensive tests showed that the SCM framework accurately and efficiently reproduces the toxic metal distribution, which enables the quantitative prediction and understanding in realistic environmental conditions.

Using single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that the human DMC1–ssDNA presynaptic complex employs a diffusion-based mechanism to search for homologous DNA. Although this diffusing complex generates a migrating DNA “bubble,” it cannot align with the homologous sequence in the absence of free DMC1 protein. Strikingly, the meiosis-specific cofactor complex HOP2–MND1 compensates for the lack of free DMC1 and enables homology recognition. Notably, HOP2–MND1 achieves this by codiffusing with the presynaptic complex, acting to clamp the ssDNA–dsDNA junctions and maintain an expanded DNA bubble conducive to sequence alignment. Our findings identify DMC1 together with HOP2–MND1 as a functional homology search unit and provide mechanistic insights into how auxiliary factors regulate DMC1-driven strand exchange during meiotic recombination.",

          "abstract": "Epilepsy is increasingly recognized as a disorder involving metabolic dysregulation beyond neural hyperexcitability, yet the underlying metabolic mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a mitochondrion–immunity–metabolism axis that drives spontaneous chronic epilepsy. Brain-specific deletion of Mic19 impairs mitochondrial cristae structure and mitochondrial integrity in neurons, leading to activation of the Z-mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)–ZBP1–RIPK3–mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) axis and p-MLKL-mediated pore formation on the mitochondrial membrane. This process results in cytosolic and extracellular leakage of mtDNA, which is subsequently taken up by microglia and triggers cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–STING-dependent inflammatory signaling. The resulting neuroinflammation promotes sustained activation of astrocytes. Critically, reactive astrocytes undergo profound metabolic reprogramming, marked by upregulated glycolysis and enhanced L-serine biosynthesis. Astrocyte-derived L-serine is subsequently transferred to neurons and converted into D-serine, a key NMDA receptor coagonist that enhances neuronal excitability. This metabolic shift in astrocytes exacerbates excitotoxicity and sustains epileptic activity. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of STING with H-151 treatment markedly suppresses seizures, reinforcing the therapeutic potential of targeting immunometabolic crosstalk in epilepsy. Our findings reveal that mtDNA-mediated cGAS–STING activation and D-serine act as important drivers of epilepsy initiation, offering mechanistic insights into neuron–microglia–astrocyte crosstalk and highlighting immunometabolic modulation as a promising therapeutic strategy for epilepsy.",

          "abstract": "Electrified carbon capture and release holds promise in carbon management; but it is constrained by high energy demand. Here, we studied two candidate systems for electrochemical CO 2 release from a direct air capture (DAC) postcapture liquid: The first, a hydrogen loop cell, is electricity-efficient, but its evolved CO 2 is mixed with H 2 , introducing a 3 to 4 GJ/tonCO 2 additional energy separation cost. The second system, a solid-state metal oxide redox couple (proton sponge), avoids the gas separation challenge but is stable only in the bicarbonate and not the highly alkaline regime. These considerations led us to examine a two-stage system: An efficient hydrogen loop would first downshift the pH from 13.5 to 9; and a second metal oxide would be used to release CO 2 from bicarbonate. We report an electrified process that provides the release of a pure CO 2 stream from a post-DAC liquid with a measured total energy of ~4.5 GJ/tonCO 2 : 2.4 GJ from the H 2 looping stage and 2.1 GJ from the MnO 2 -based stage—substantially lower than the &gt;=10 GJ/tonCO 2 required by pH-swing methods such as bipolar membrane electrodialysis. We conclude with a generalized analysis of how staged pH downshifting reduces the overall Nernst voltage penalty and facilitates energy-efficient CO 2 release.",

Inspired by GFP’s barrel-like peptide scaffold, which stabilizes the chromophore within a confined space, here we develop photobleaching-resistant super-resolution DNA framework (SDF) dots that enables programmable confinement of various types of fluorophores within the inner cavity resembling GFP. We find that SDF dots are resistant to reactive oxygen species-induced photobleaching due to the shielding effects of DNA frameworks. SDF dots with four fluorophores labeling inside of the cavity leads to ~1.8-fold enhancement in photostability compared to the corner labeling, whereas ~50-fold enhancement compared to single fluorophore labeled on double-stranded DNA. These ultrastable SDF dots are readily adaptable for super-resolution imaging including stimulated emission depletion (STED) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging. We realize STED imaging of live cell membranes over 30 min. We further construct ultrastable super-resolution SIM barcodes that can distinguish eighteen colored barcodes with a spatial resolution of ~70 nm.

          "abstract": "The goal of meiosis is typically to produce haploid gametes (eggs or sperm). Failure to do so is catastrophic for fertility. However, Lepidopteran (moths and butterflies) males produce two sperm morphs: nucleated (eupyrene) sperm and anucleated (apyrene) sperm, both of which are essential for fertilization. The meiotic differences in the two types of spermatogenesis are unclear, and our knowledge of the molecular differences between eupyrene and apyrene spermatogenesis is extremely limited in all systems. The only factor identified as being required for apyrene spermatogenesis is Sex-lethal ( Sxl ). Here, we show through cytological analysis of meiotic events that there are several key differences in the genesis of apyrene and eupyrene sperm. Specifically, during meiosis I, apyrene spermatocytes fail to decondense and pair their chromosomes during meiotic prophase I. Telomeres fail to localize to the nuclear periphery, and full-length synaptonemal complex does not form. We also find evidence of an abnormal second cell division during apyrene meiosis. RNA sequencing of both eupyrene- and apyrene-producing testes reveals distinct changes in transcriptional programs, including down-regulation of a myriad of cell division genes during apyrene meiosis. By comparing wildtype and Sxl -knockout apyrene testes, we found that Sxl is not required for regulating the expression of the cell division genes but instead may play a role in blocking hormone signaling from altering testis cell identity. Together, our findings reveal significant insights into two converging molecular pathways that promote the formation of dimorphic sperm in Lepidoptera.",

          "abstract": "Organisms often inhabit environments comprising complex structures across various scales. Animals rely on visual information from surrounding geometrical structures for navigation. Even at the microscale, various microsediments form complex structures in microbial habitats. The movement of microorganisms is passively affected by collisions and hydrodynamic interactions with surrounding structures. However, the influence of microenvironmental geometry on behavioral changes of unicellular organisms that lack visual perception remains unclear. Here, we developed geometrically structured chambers to investigate anchoring site preferences in the swimming ciliate Stentor coeruleus . Our experiments revealed that S. coeruleus preferentially anchored in narrow regions characterized by specific geometrical features, including corner angle, depth, and curvature at the corner end. Before anchoring, free-swimming S. coeruleus changed its behavior to move along the boundary wall of the chambers, accompanied by Ca 2+ -induced asymmetrical body deformation. To further investigate how S. coeruleus moves along the wall continuously, we conducted a hydrodynamic simulation and revealed that the asymmetric morphology causes asymmetric propulsive forces, explaining wall-following behavior through physical interactions with a wall. Thus, morphological change near a wall causes wall-following behavior, facilitating the identification of these narrow anchoring sites. Our findings indicate that environmental geometry drives behavioral transitions in S. coeruleus through simple biophysical processes, enabling spatial selection without visual cues. Overall, these results suggest that microgeometry plays a key role in shaping ecological niches for unicellular microorganisms.",

PEX38 contains distinct domains that bind the cochaperone Hip and the PEX3-binding motif of PEX19, suggesting a role in stabilizing membrane proteins and preventing premature membrane docking. PEX38 illustrates functional repurposing in organelle biogenesis. It originated from a remnant of the GET/TRC pathway, typically responsible for the targeting of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. While most components of this machinery are absent in Euglenozoa, PEX38 has been retained and adapted to mediate peroxisomal membrane protein targeting. This evolutionary adaptation is unique to Euglenozoa.

          "abstract": "Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide globally, especially due to the extensive cultivation of genetically modified glyphosate-resistant crops. However, its intensive application has raised public concerns about the risks to food safety and human health. Identifying enzymes capable of metabolizing glyphosate in plants represents an ideal strategy for addressing this issue, but few are known. Here, we identified the rice variety Kitaake with natural tolerance to glyphosate and demonstrated that this tolerance is driven by glyphosate glycosylation metabolism. Seven up-regulated UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase ( UGT ) genes associated with glyphosate tolerance were identified in Kitaake. Molecular-docking analysis indicated that these UGT proteins have moderate binding affinity for glyphosate. Among these, a deletion of an adenine at position –803 in the promoter region of GLYPHOSATE RESPONSIVE GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 1 ( GRGT1 ) enhances its expression in Kitaake. GRGT1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and catalyzes glyphosate glycosylation both in vivo and in vitro. Rice lines complemented with GRGT1–GFP rescue the inability of grgt1 knockout mutants to produce glycosylated glyphosate derivatives. Overexpression of GRGT1 in the susceptible Nipponbare cultivar confers glyphosate tolerance by up-regulating glyphosate metabolism to produce glycosylated glyphosate derivatives M329, M331, and M345. This provides a strategy for developing herbicide-tolerant crops, but also offers a potential approach to consequently reduce glyphosate residues in crops.",

Many species of cyanobacteria exhibit gliding motility along surfaces to navigate complex environments and adapt to fluctuating conditions. Here, we studied the gliding motility of filamentous cyanobacteria Lyngbya lagerheimii at the transition between different physical environments. We show that on a dry surface, a filament adopts a curved shape that turns right while gliding. When a filament switches the gliding direction, the curvature is initially preserved and a filament can turn left as long as it backtracks along a slime trace. We propose a model of chiral motility that explains the bending based on the right-handed rotation of gliding filaments and a velocity mismatch between the leading and the trailing end of the filament. The mechanism involves a unique way of transferring the structural chirality to the macroscale and also a unique physical navigation mechanism.",

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the dynamic construction and maintenance of such sequences during goal-directed behavior are not yet clear. Empirical and theoretical studies of working memory function suggest that sequential information may be encoded in neural circuits by bursts of gamma activity occurring at consecutive theta phases. Here, we asked whether a similar coding scheme might support sequential planning during goal-directed navigation. Using noninvasive magnetoencephalography and an abstract navigation task, we found that hippocampal theta power during both planning and subsequent navigation decreased with proximity to the current goal, only during accurate navigation. At the same time, theta–gamma phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) increased with goal proximity, consistent with sequences of upcoming locations being represented by gamma bursts occurring at successive theta phases. Importantly, entorhinal high gamma and hippocampal low gamma dominated while traversing novel and previously experienced paths, respectively, consistent with previous rodent studies. These findings suggest that hippocampal theta–gamma PAC flexibly and dynamically coordinates sequences of actions during goal-directed behavior across mammalian species, using different gamma bands for mnemonic and prospective planning.",

We here analyze a corpus of more than 200 mobile objects of a 43,000 to 34,000 y old Aurignacian culture—associated with the first modern humans to settle in Central Europe. These objects are adorned with several thousand geometric signs. We apply classification algorithms and statistical models to capture their quantitative properties. First, our analyses illustrate that these sign sequences are clearly distinguishable from modern day writing. Second, however, their statistical properties are comparable to sign sequences on the earliest protocuneiform tablets. Third, Paleolithic signs were systematically applied to yield higher information density on certain types of objects, e.g. ivory figurines compared to tools. These results cannot be taken to strictly prove that Aurignacian sign sequences encoded numero-ideographic information as in the case of protocuneiform. However, they prove that the first hunter-gatherers arriving in Europe already applied sign sequences of comparable complexity in a deliberate, systematic, and conventional manner—several ten thousand years before the advent of genuine writing.",

The widely accepted “RNA world” theory proposes that ancient RNAs ensured both heredity and catalysis during the transition from prebiotic to biotic evolution. However, alternative hypothetical molecules and processes have also been proposed, suggesting that catalytic peptides may have existed before polynucleotides, and that their sequences were later reverse translated into genes. Our objective was to experimentally address these alternative theories by asking whether the steps required for the hypothetical conversion of peptide sequences into DNA could be catalyzed by the existing molecular kit. The reactions we tested comprise i) step-wise degradation of peptides by a processive amino peptidase, sequentially releasing amino acids, ii) matching the identity of released amino acids to codons by aptazymes (RNA adapters that recognize amino acids and self-cleave and release specific codon triplets in response), and iii) ligating codon triplets into longer RNAs that can be reverse-transcribed into DNA. In a hypothetical processive system based on these reactions, the resulting DNA sequence would match the sequence of amino acids in the starting peptide. Our results suggest that all these steps can be catalyzed, and therefore the possibility of reverse translation occurring at some point in early evolution should not be disregarded.",

It facilitates the transition of many viruses from viral internalization to downstream intracellular trafficking within the endosomal network, ultimately enabling their delivery to intracellular replication sites. Despite its significance, the molecular mechanisms regulating the fusion of these vesicles remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that Rabankyrin-5, a Rab5 effector, is essential for the fusion of human papillomavirus (HPV)-carrying early endosomes during viral entry. Additionally, Rabankyrin-5 acts as a dynein adaptor, directly binding both the HPV minor capsid protein L2 and the dynein motor complex to link virus-carrying early endosomes to the dynein transport machinery, thereby promoting virus movement along microtubules. These dual functions enable the coordinated integration of endosomal fusion with microtubule-based transport during the early stages of viral entry.",

Understanding the steps from the initial procapsid assembly to mature virions is essential, both for comprehending viral life cycles and for developing antiviral therapies. However, capturing these steps has been challenging due to the transient and elusive nature of intermediate states. The nonenveloped, T = 4, ssRNA-containing, Nudaurelia capensis omega virus (NωV) is a highly accessible model system that exemplifies the maturation process of a eukaryotic virus. During maturation, the particle shrinks in outer diameter from 482 Å (pH 7.6) to 428 Å (pH 5.0). It is possible to mimic the maturation process in vitro by lowering the pH of a population of procapsids produced in heterologous systems. Indeed, by controlling the pH in vitro, it is possible to produce homogenous populations of intermediate NωV virus-like particles (VLPs) that occur too fleetingly to be observed in vivo. Here, we report structural models, based on cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), of five intermediates in the NωV maturation process. The structures of the intermediate particles reveal unique, quaternary position-dependent trajectories and refolding of subunit N and C-terminal regions, including the formation of the autocatalytic cleavage site at N570. The detailed structures reported here, coupled with previously determined structures of the procapsids and mature particles, allow the maturation pathway to be described in detail for a eukaryotic virus.",

Here, we investigate how variation in traits to improve common resources emerges when locally modified environments show ecological inheritance. Using eco-evolutionary modeling, we reveal that ecological inheritance, when combined with limited dispersal, can facilitate the coexistence of two types with opposite ecological legacies: environmental helpers, who improve the local environment for the future at a personal cost, and environmental free riders, who benefit without contributing to the detriment of future generations, particularly when interactions among helpers generate diminishing returns. This polymorphism generates lasting spatial heterogeneity in environmental quality and, consequently, in survival and reproduction—particularly under isolation-by-distance, where it creates stable clusters of high- and low-quality habitats across an otherwise homogeneous landscape. These findings reveal how ecological inheritance and spatial structure interact to stabilize polymorphism, potentially driving long-term behavioral, ecological, and fitness variation across diverse biological systems.",

While a few emerging policies attempt to protect non-forest ecosystems, a globally consistent assessment of their conversion extent and drivers, especially related to livestock production and commodity-specific supply chain demand, remains lacking. Here, we conducted a spatially explicit analysis to identify pasture and cropland expansion into non-forest ecosystems between 2005 and 2020, as well as conversion-linked primary agricultural commodities and their underlying demand drivers (end uses and final market destinations). We found that the conversion rate of natural non-forest ecosystems was nearly four times that of lands with tree cover exceeding 5 m (a common forest height threshold), with Brazil contributing 13% of the global total and Russia, India, China, and the United States each contributing about 6%. While drivers varied greatly across regions, globally 50% of the conversion was linked to pasture, and 27, 17, and 6% to cropland for food, feed, and other uses (mainly bioenergy), respectively. Among conversion-linked commodities, most livestock-associated products served domestic demand, while 32% of feed crops and 20% of all crops were exported, with export shares reaching 70 to 80% in Brazil and Argentina. These findings reveal important areas for non-forest ecosystem conservation and highlight the need for integrated policies to prevent leakage across different ecosystems and different sustainable development goals while also aligning local actions with global supply chain governance.",

It is thus believed to be an “alternative” pathway, only supporting mitochondrial respiration when complex I fails. mtG3PDH also plays an important role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. To investigate the role of this understudied protein in mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox homeostasis, we generated Drosophila melanogaster mutant lines for mtG3PDH (GPO1) using a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach and determined several physiological and metabolic parameters. A drastically higher mortality rate was observed among the GPO1 flies, as well as a lethargic behavior characterized by an inability to climb. These results are in accordance with an impaired mitochondrial efficiency (ATP/O) mainly due to decreased ATP production (~60% decrease) and O 2 consumption (~33% decrease), rather than elevated ROS. In fact, GPO1 flies produced ~70% less ROS than controls, likely due to the reduced direct and reverse electron transfer-related ROS production from mtG3PDH. These results support an essential role of mtG3PDH in mitochondrial bioenergetic, challenging its alternative aspect, and confirming its importance in mitochondrial redox homeostasis.",

However, compared with proteins and nucleic acids, our understanding of the structures and functional mechanisms of glycans remains limited. Moreover, it is generally challenging to obtain high-resolution three-dimensional structures of glycans. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of the CryoSeek strategy in enabling high-throughput structural determination of glycans, thereby presenting novel avenues for their structural investigation. Meanwhile, unlike proteins, near atomic resolution density maps of glycofibrils do not inherently facilitate the determination of absolute hand, which is a prerequisite for building atomic models of glycofibrils. Existing absolute hand determination methods have severe limitations in the case of glycofibrils from natural sources. In this study, we introduce Ahaha, a straightforward and efficient method for determining such absolute hand in cryogenic electron microscopy. With their absolute hand measured by Ahaha, we built atomic models of four glycofibrils derived from a natural water sample, facilitating the study of glycans.

While some evidence suggests that there is a shared system in the human brain for processing semantic information from native and non-native languages, other evidence suggests that semantic processing is language specific. We conducted a study to determine how semantic information for different languages is represented in the brains of bilinguals. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to record brain responses while participants read several hours of natural narratives in their native (Chinese) and non-native (English) languages. These data were then used to compare semantic representations between the two languages.

          "abstract": "Establishing intrinsic structure–property relationships in amorphous solids remains a central challenge in materials science because the absence of long-range order obscures universal structural descriptors. Here, we introduce a structural disorder function, S d ( r ), as a physically interpretable and quantitative metric for atomic-scale disorder in amorphous systems. S d ( r ) is formulated as the magnitude of the normalized vector sum from a reference atom to its neighbors within different radial shells, thereby capturing local symmetry breaking analogous in concept to the Burgers vector in crystals. Molecular dynamics simulations across diverse amorphous alloys and glasses, together with colloidal-glass experiments, demonstrate that S d ( r ) correlates meaningfully (correlation coefficient &gt; 0.68) with key particle-scale plastic properties, including vibrational mean-square displacement, flexibility volume, atomic stiffness, and vibrational frequency. Liquid-like regions consistently exhibit higher S d ( r ) values than solid-like ones, revealing its ability to distinguish mechanical heterogeneity. When averaged over the field, S d monotonically increases with cooling rate and exhibits a universal negative linear relationship with shear strength, τ p = A – B S d , quantitatively linking structural disorder to macroscopic strength. These results establish S d ( r ) as a simple, dimensionless, and broadly applicable descriptor that unifies atomic configuration, processing history, and mechanical response in disordered materials, providing a physics-based framework for the rational design of amorphous solids.",

For this reason, the field of behavioral ecology, which specializes in testing adaptive explanations for biological observations, is dominated by research on larger multicellular animals such as insects, mammals, fish, and birds. The vast majority of modern life sciences, however, is concerned with the study of cells, genes, and molecules, which are often impossible to observe directly in nature. This severely compromises our ability to complement mechanistic understand of traits of interest with adaptive understanding. This matters because only the theory of adaptation can provide an explanation for why biology operates in the way that it does, why it varies across individuals and species, a formal tool for making predictions about the future. The good news is that technological advances are creating new opportunities for understanding cellular and subcellular traits as the products of natural selection.",

Here, we compiled the most comprehensive dataset to date, integrating 7,941 observations from 413 field warming experiments worldwide with random forest regression and Community Land Model (CLM) simulations. Field warming significantly accelerated nitrogen cycling, increasing N 2 O emissions (+24.7%), mineralization (+25.8%), nitrification (+51.7%), and denitrification (+41.1%). Soil inorganic nitrogen also increased, while plant nitrogen remained largely unchanged. Elevated natural abundance of 15 N indicated that warming alleviates nitrogen limitation and promotes more open nitrogen cycles. Soil moisture, ecosystem type, and warming magnitude were key drivers. N 2 O emission and nitrification further intensified with increased warming magnitude in random forest analyses. In contrast, CLM5-BGC simulated weak responses in N 2 O emissions and nitrification and negative changes in nitrogen mineralization, substantially diverging from field observations. These discrepancies highlight the omission of microbial processes and the oversimplification of large-scale ecosystem feedbacks, respectively. Uniquely, this study provides a direct comparison among empirical data, random forest regression, and CLM simulations, revealing discrepancies and their potential causes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that terrestrial nitrogen cycling is more responsive to climate warming than previously recognized and underscore the importance of integrating multiple analytical approaches to synthesize cross-scale ecological data.",

          "abstract": "Manipulation of kinetic pathways is essential to self-assemble nanoparticle building blocks into complex ordered structures, as the emergence of intermediate metastable states could either facilitate or hinder crystallization of the target lattice. Molecular simulations and Markovian and transition state theory are used to validate our conjecture that intermediary mesophases, with partial but long-range translational or orientational structural ordering, accelerate crystallization kinetics from the disordered structure. Using four representative models, two lyotropic single-component and two thermotropic binary mixture systems, we demonstrate that mesophases with intermediate entropies, such as nematic fluid, rotator solid, and microsegregated mesophases, speed up the overall crystallization rate. This enhancement occurs by effectively splitting a larger isotropic-to-crystal free energy barrier into two smaller barriers corresponding to isotropic-to-mesophase and mesophase-to-crystal transitions, with mesophase “bulk” macrostates being kinetically more favorable than microscopic fluctuations. The single-step isotropic-to-crystal transition occurs through a composite-cluster pathway that includes mesophase microdomains; an isotropic-crystal interfacial energy greater than or comparable to the sum of the isotropic-mesophase and mesophase-crystal interfacial energies is associated with enhanced two-step crystallization rate. Overall, our findings validate the conjecture, which offers additional guidance for selecting nanoparticle designs and conditions that promote efficient crystallization pathways.",

          "abstract": "Classical mate choice theories assume independent decision-making, yet mounting evidence shows that individuals often use social information and copy conspecifics’ mate choices, a behavior termed mate copying. While this nonindependent mate choice has been documented across vertebrates and notably in Drosophila melanogaster , theoretical and experimental frameworks have been mainly restricted to binary choice scenarios, limiting our understanding of its evolutionary implications in natural populations. Here, we develop a theoretical model of mate copying applicable to populations with multiple morphs, incorporating both private (inherent) and public (cultural) information in mate choice decisions. The population dynamics of the different male morphs are driven by the differing intensities of conformist and anticonformist mate copying. We demonstrate that mate copying can lead to the fixation of low-quality morphs and identify the conditions necessary for the existence of a polymorphism consisting of all male morphs in the population. Furthermore, we identify a plausible mechanism that could maintain a stable polymorphism in the case of conformist mate copying with two morphs. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding how social learning in mate choice can influence evolutionary trajectories and contribute to maintaining phenotypic diversity in populations, with potential implications for sexual selection and speciation.",

Deep RL agents could only solve the task when designed to explicitly predict action prediction errors that fire in the medial prefrontal cortex. When trained this way, they displayed signatures of metacontrol that closely resembled those observed in humans. Moreover, when deep RL agents were trained to over- or underestimate controllability, they developed behavioral pathologies partially matching those of humans who reported depressive, anxious, or compulsive traits on transdiagnostic questionnaires.

To address this need, we propose a two-photon quantum module evaluation method based on high-dimensional Hong–Ou–Mandel interference. Our method uses multi-degree-of-freedom photon encoding to enable rapid and accurate evaluation of optical quantum modules. Compared to traditional methods such as quantum process tomography and direct fidelity estimation, our method not only simplifies implementation but also significantly minimizes the measurement resources required. Notably, the resource demands remain invariant as the system dimensionality scales, ensuring efficient evaluation even in high-dimensional quantum systems. We validated this method on a programmable silicon photonic chip, demonstrating its ability to accurately evaluate optical quantum module performance while significantly reducing resource consumption.

Untargeted metabolomics of plasma revealed significant dysregulation of tryptophan metabolism in ARDS patients compared to healthy controls. Murine dietary interventions demonstrated that high tryptophan intake alleviated ALI severity, whereas deficiency exacerbated injury, with protection being gut microbiota dependent. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing revealed marked depletion of a functionally central bacterium Lactobacillus johnsonii ( L. johnsonii ) during ALI. Supplementation with L. johnsonii or its encapsulated form attenuated ALI, but this required dietary tryptophan sufficiency. Mechanistically, L. johnsonii converts tryptophan into oxindole, which enters pulmonary macrophages, promotes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-RelA binding, and thereby suppresses RelA-mediated transcriptional activation of C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13). Both genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of CXCL13 ameliorated ALI symptoms. Importantly, oxindole and CXCL13 levels correlated with ARDS severity in patients, suggesting their clinical relevance. Collectively, these findings define a protective microbiota-dependent gut–lung axis in ALI/ARDS that is mediated by dietary tryptophan-derived oxindole, which acts at least partially through CXCL13 suppression to underscore targetable diet–microbe–metabolite therapeutic paradigms.",

In certain dipteran species, a G→D mutation in the oxyanion hole of α-carboxylesterases (CBEs) enhances OP hydrolysis, yet this adaptation is not widespread despite the presence of orthologous CBEs in other insect species that are also exposed to OPs. The extent, and molecular basis, of evolutionary contingency and epistasis in this catalytic OP resistance has not been explored, and how further mutations might optimize OP detoxification in the future is not clear. Here, we systematically compare OP hydrolysis and analyze structures of CBE orthologs across several dipteran species, revealing that the success of the G137D mutation is sequence context-dependent. We employed laboratory-directed evolution to enhance OP turnover over 1,000-fold vs. the wildtype enzyme and tested these variants in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster , demonstrating that improved catalytic rates do not directly translate to increased resistance.

This unprecedented platform facilitates the manipulation of electrons and extends its capabilities to the effective control of bosons. For phonons, a consensus has been reached that interlayer twist greatly suppresses phonon transport as it breaks the symmetry of the lattice. Here, we report a counterintuitive experimental observation in which the interlayer twist can significantly promote the transportation of phonons across an intrinsically asymmetric heterointerface. Employing the time-domain thermoreflectance mapping technique, our results show a 2.5-fold increase in interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) in twisted bilayer MoS 2 /WS 2 heterostructures relative to initial commensurate configurations. Combined experimental and atomic simulation results reveal the inelastic scattering-dominated nature of thermal transport at MoS 2 /WS 2 heterointerfaces. The introduction of interlayer twist amplifies this effect, triggering a reconstruction of nonequilibrium phonon temperature distributions at the interface. This phenomenon activates efficient optical-to-acoustic phonon conversion through inelastic scattering and creates additional transport channels that overcome the intrinsic phonon mismatch in heterostructures. Our work establishes a paradigm for enhancing ITC by strategically introducing interlayer perturbations to amplify inelastic scattering effects. This breakthrough opens broad avenues for advanced thermal management in integrated circuits.",

          "abstract": "The formation of boundaries separating developmental fields with distinct gene expression and cell fate trajectories is a universal feature of noncolonial multicellular organisms. Developmental boundaries arise reiteratively during ontogeny and are characterized by stiff, slowly dividing cells that demarcate adjacent and divergent morphogenetic domains; the genetic mechanisms of cell fate acquisition within these boundaries are incompletely understood. Grass leaves are initiated at a developmental boundary in the periphery of the shoot apical meristem, an organogenic pool of plant stem cells that generates all lateral organs in the plant shoot. During later primordial growth, maize leaves form a de novo developmental boundary that ultimately separates the distal, photosynthetic leaf blade from the proximal, clasping leaf sheath. Morphogenesis at this blade/sheath boundary in maize leaves generates an epidermal outgrowth called the ligule and two tissue-wedges forming the auricle, a hinge-like structure with major effects on leaf angle, light capture, and yield. Here, we use cell lineage mapping, morphometric measures of cell division and expansion, cell-specific multidimensional transcriptomic analyses, and topological landscape modeling to investigate the mechanisms of cell fate acquisition at the ligule/auricle morphogenetic boundary in the maize leaf. The data suggest a model where auricle initial cells are recruited from blade founder cells at this boundary, via repression of blade identity during early stages in auricle ontogeny. Thereafter, auricle primordial cells assume a developmental genetic trajectory that is distinct from the blade, sheath, and ligule, thereby acquiring a unique auricle cell fate in the maize leaf.",

Increased NEK2 expression contributes to chromosomal instability by promoting nondisjunction, leading to a rise in aneuploid cell populations and fostering uncontrolled cell proliferation.

The lab of David Baker at the University of Washington made protein design a reality by adapting methods of classical physical chemistry.

However, its origin remains the subject of vigorous debate. Here, we present field relationships, and zircon and monazite U–Pb, biotite and muscovite Rb–Sr, and zircon (U–Th)/He thermochronology data for Precambrian crystalline basement rocks from North China to constrain the exhumation history below the unconformity. Dates from multichronometers and thermal history inversions show that the most substantial cooling of continental basement took place from ~2,100 to 1,600 Ma. Comparison with thermal history data from Laurentia, Baltica, and Amazonia suggests that protracted plate tectonics broadly modulated by supercontinent cycles, and not “snowball Earth” glaciation, is responsible for crustal exhumation below the unconformity. The most pronounced erosion evident in both the thermochronologic record and geochemical indicators of continental weathering is shown to correspond with development of Earth’s first true supercontinent (Columbia), rather than with either the Cambrian explosion or the emergence of modern plate tectonics.",

Herein, we compact H-bond connectivity through screening a series of additives to stimulate electrochemical proton quantum tunneling (QT) behaviors of “through-barrier”, which are virtually impossible for heavier D-relevant motions. The average H-bond length of H 2 O⋯OH − is 3.4% shorter (2.78 Å) with isopropanol additive at the engineered interface. Fundamentally, QT effects are magnified by selectively promoting proton transfer-involved reactions through strengthening the H-bond and filling the H-bond gap, which are further proved by both experimental Arrhenius plots with near small-curvature tunneling approximation and a stronger proton excursion in path integral molecular dynamics simulations. Hence, a record-high H 2 O separation factor of 276 is realized at room temperature with a three-order-of-magnitude growth of H/D kinetic isotope effect constant up to 10,165. Significantly, a large-scale multistage reactor is engineered to obtain continuous enrichment of heavy water with a deuterium atomic fraction over 80%.",

          "abstract": "Humans rely on both proprioceptive and visual feedback during reaching, integrating these two sensory streams to improve movement accuracy and precision. Patients using a brain-computer interface will similarly require artificial proprioceptive feedback in addition to vision to finely control a prosthesis. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) elicits sensory perceptions that could replace the lost proprioceptive signal. However, some learning may be required for encoding artificial sensation, as current technology does not give access to neurons with all of the desired encoding properties. We developed a freely moving mouse behavioral task in which to test learning and integration of artificial sensory information with natural vision. Mice implanted with a 16-channel microwire array in the primary somatosensory cortex were trained to navigate to randomly selected targets upon the floor of a custom behavioral training chamber. Target location was encoded with visual and/or patterned multichannel ICMS feedback. Mice received multimodal feedback from the beginning of training of the behavioral task, achieving 75% on multimodal trials after approximately 1,000 training trials. Mice also quickly learned to use the ICMS signal to locate invisible targets, achieving 75% proficiency on ICMS-only trials when tested. Critically, we found that performance with ICMS was as good or better than performance with natural vision, and that performance on multimodal trials significantly exceeded unimodal performance (vision or ICMS), demonstrating that animals rapidly learned to integrate natural vision with artificial sensation.",

This wave represents vegetation phenology, driven primarily by solar irradiation and modulated by climate variability and ecosystem dynamics. Despite its significance for multiple Earth system processes, we lack a unified metric to characterize and understand its dynamics. Here, we propose a concept to quantify global phenology by tracking the green wave’s centroid using satellite and Earth system model data. The resulting trajectory summarizes global phenological dynamics and directional trends. Earlier reports on global greening led us to hypothesize a rapidly northward shifting trajectory during boreal summer and a moderate southward shift during austral summer. Contrary to this expectation, we find that the centroid moves northward during both summer periods, with the austral summer shift consistently exceeding the boreal shift across datasets. As a consequence, the amplitude of the green wave trajectory is decreasing, a trend projected to intensify throughout this century. We also detect an accelerating eastward shift, a phenomenon not previously reported. Tracking the green wave’s centroid reveals how regionally changing land dynamics affect the global functioning of Earth’s terrestrial biosphere.",

          "abstract": "The mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) is an evolutionarily conserved destructive process that permeabilizes the inner mitochondrial membrane in response to calcium overload. The molecular mechanism underlying the mPT is not established. To unambiguously identify essential proteins, we designed two phenotypic assays for mitochondrial calcium overload and applied them to FACS-based CRISPR screening in human cells, ultimately evaluating 19,113 genes. The first screen studied mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse in response to calcium overload. Top-ranked genes were the essential proteins of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex, MCU and EMRE, reflecting that the calcium-induced MMP collapse results from mitochondrial calcium entry and not the mPT. The second screen measured the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, the fluorescent interaction of a membrane impermeant ~600 Da dye and a mitochondrial-targeted HaloTag protein was studied under mPT activating conditions; calcium overload and the thiol-reactive molecule phenylarsine oxide. With secondary validation, we identified four protein-encoding genes that delayed or prevented the mPT under knockout: NF2, REST, BPTF, and NRLX1. Knockout of the nonmitochondrial proteins BPTF, NF2, or REST increased mitochondrial calcium retention capacity (CRC). However, calcium release or sensitivity to cyclosporin A (CsA) persisted, indicative of mPT sensitizers. Only knockout of the mitochondrial matrix protein, NLRX1, increased CRC, abolished calcium release, and was CsA-insensitive. This top-ranked hit of the mitochondrial permeability screen meets the definition of an essential mPT activator. Integral membrane proteins, including all previously proposed mPT candidates, were not essential activators.",

          "abstract": "To trigger precipitation, water droplets in warm clouds need to attain a sufficient size. Theoretical estimates based on condensation and gravitational collisions alone fail to explain the observed timescales for the onset of precipitation for a range of droplet sizes. This suggests the involvement of collisional growth mediated by turbulence to resolve the so-called “size-gap problem.” For the onset of rain, it is sufficient that statistical outliers, coined “lucky droplets,” cross the size gap. In this study, we explore the influence of turbulence on droplet growth, focusing on correlated collisions and intermittency. Using direct numerical simulations of droplets in turbulent flow, we constrain a non-Markovian stochastic framework that allows us to assess memory effects on the droplet-size distribution arising from correlations between consecutive collisions. Using our framework, we find that correlated collisions accelerate the initial growth of lucky droplets but have subleading effect at later stages. Consequently, we neglect correlations from collisions and model an ensemble of cloud parcels representing fluctuations in the volume-averaged dissipation rate. Here, the distribution of droplet sizes in each parcel is described by a linear master equation with a time-dependent collision rate according to the volume-averaged dissipation rate. Our analyses of this toy model show that intermittency can significantly reduce the time required by lucky droplets to cross the size gap.",

By observing a 62% relative excess of AMH ancestry in Neanderthal X chromosomes, we characterized the interbreeding between the two groups as predominantly male Neanderthals with female AMHs.

The method utilizes a bifunctional peptide catalyst to template the terminal functional groups of the linear precursor, thereby favoring intra- over intermolecular reaction and enabling exquisite control over the stereochemistry of the emerging stereogenic centers. Diverse 12- to 18‐membered macrocyclic lactones and lactams were obtained from achiral linear precursors. The organocatalyst even dictates the stereochemical outcome upon cyclizing a chiral linear precursor.

We reveal that L1-mediated reciprocal translocations occur frequently, typically driven by two concurrent L1 retrotransposition events on non-homologous chromosomes. Using an independent tumor cohort spanning low to high L1 activity, we estimate that retrotransposon-mediated rearrangements arise at a frequency of one event per 60 somatic retrotranspositions. Molecular timing analyses indicate that these events arise early in tumorigenesis, establishing L1 activity as an early driver of chromosomal instability.

MLXIPL , a key regulator of sugar and lipid homeostasis, showed convergent sequence and regulatory changes across all sugar-feeding clades; experiments revealed enhanced sugar-induced transcriptional activity of hummingbird MLXIPL , highlighting its adaptive role in high-sugar diets.",

Unlike CD19 for B cell malignancies, no target with pan-cellular expression in solid tumors and absence in normal vital cells has been identified. CD70 is a promising candidate, physiologically confined to immune cell subsets and aberrantly expressed in many cancers. We show that heterogeneous CD70 expression in tumors is epigenetically regulated, ranging from high to very low in individual cells, appearing negative by conventional detection methods. Using a highly sensitive CD70 receptor, HLA-independent T cell (HIT) receptor coexpressing CD80 and 4-1BBL for costimulation, we efficiently eliminated CD70-heterogeneous tumors that evade prototypic CAR T cells. These findings provide a potential strategy to treat a broad range of solid tumors.",

          "abstract": "Human activities might have accelerated declines of population abundance, but this acceleration remains underexplored. Using 1033 North American Breeding Bird Survey routes, we analyze abundance change and its acceleration for 261 bird species, 54 avian families, and 10 habitats from 1987 to 2021. We show an average continent-wide decline of abundance of all birds per local route, with hotspots of decline in southern and warm parts of North America and hotspots of accelerating decline in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and California, matching patterns of agricultural intensity. Overall, 122 species (47%) exhibit significant declines, of which 63 also show acceleration of this decline, and 67 show declining per-capita growth rate, raising concerns for a large part of North American bird populations. These findings suggest that bird abundance decline is mostly accelerating, with spatial patterns of this acceleration indicating that agricultural intensity may be a driver of this trend.",

          "abstract": "To investigate organism-wide cellular alterations and epigenomic dynamics during aging, we constructed a single-cell chromatin accessibility atlas spanning 21 mouse tissues across three age groups and both sexes. We found that around one-quarter of 536 organ-specific cell types and 1828 finer-grained subtypes exhibited considerable age-related population shifts. Cellular states from broadly distributed lineages displayed synchronized dynamics with age, indicating systemic signals that coordinate these changes. Molecular analyses identified both intrinsic regulators (chromatin peaks, transcription factor activity) and extrinsic factors (cytokine programs) underlying these shifts. Moreover, ~40% of aging-associated population dynamics were sex-dependent, with tens of thousands of peaks altered exclusively in one sex. Together, these findings present a comprehensive framework for how aging reshapes the chromatin landscape and cellular composition across diverse tissues.",

          "abstract": "Influenza pandemics are often traced back to the spillover of avian influenza A viruses (IAVs) to humans. However, barriers against IAV transmission remain elusive. We demonstrated human stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as a transmission barrier against IAVs. STING activated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and downstream NF-κB–stimulated genes (NSGs) through a specific domain. Among these NSGs, growth arrest and DNA damage–inducible protein 34 ( GADD34 ) was crucial for IAV restriction. Some IAVs have evolved to evade activating human STING by mutating residue 115 in their matrix protein 1 (M1), which is essential for efficient viral replication in human respiratory cells. This barrier against the zoonotic threat of IAVs provides a tool for future investigations into the biological functions of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monosphosphate (cGMP-AMP) synthase (cGAS)–STING–NF-κB signaling pathway.",

          "abstract": "Non–long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposon proteins copy their RNA template into a genome through coordinated nicking and reverse transcriptase activities of target-primed reverse transcription. Mechanisms by which the first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) becomes a stably inserted duplex, including requirements for junction formation at the cDNA 3′ end and second-strand synthesis, are unknown. We screened for cellular factors that influence site-specific transgene synthesis into the human genome by an R2 retrotransposon protein. We discovered that insertion lengths and junction signatures differ based on alternative repair processes involving ATR-dependent polymerase θ end joining, 53BP1-directed shieldin and CST–polymerase α–primase fill-in synthesis, or limited strand annealing dependent on CtIP-MRN. These insights shed light on how genome-primed cDNA synthesis by a non-LTR retrotransposon protein can support stable new gene insertion, with major implications for native retrotransposon mobility and genome engineering.",

We found that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 ± 5.5) × 10 5 years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 ± 7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma that extends several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star-formation rate.",

We overcome this barrier by placing a polycrystalline lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic in a temperature and electric-field control module so that it operates at a quadruple phase point (QP). This QP ceramic exhibited a d 33 of ~6850 pC/N, which surpasses that of commercial PZT ceramics by 10 to 30 times and commercial lead magnesium niobate–lead titanate single crystals by ~4 times. This exceptional property arises from the tricritical nature of the QP, a thermodynamic singularity that produces an ultrasoft lattice and enables complete polarization alignment in polycrystals. The module maintained this performance for surrounding ambient temperature ranging from 25° to 350°C.",

Mutations in the RAD51 paralogs are linked to heritable breast and ovarian cancers and the cancer-prone disease Fanconi anemia. In this work, we show that the RAD51 paralogs assemble into two distinct heterotetrameric complexes, RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 (RAD51B complex) and XRCC3-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 (XRCC3 complex). The RAD51B complex promotes dynamic adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis–dependent assembly of RAD51 filaments, whereas the XRCC3 complex stably caps the 5′ termini of RAD51 filaments to promote homologous pairing, as visualized by cryo–electron microscopy. Highly conserved across evolution, the XRCC3 complex reveals insights into RAD51 filament formation and capping during DNA repair and replication fork stabilization.",

          "authors": "Lisa L. Walsh",
          "abstract": "Calls to address fieldwork safety that began in the 1980s have been amplified and expanded in the past decade by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and US federal funding agencies. Now, research on fieldwork safety and resulting recommendations are largely siloed by scientific discipline, limiting the spread of data and discussion that could yield rapid change for field research. This review synthesizes literature on fieldwork safety across scientific disciplines, highlighting four facets of safety for leaders and researchers to address: physical, social, financial, and psychological. Literature and real-life events demonstrate that the four facets of safety are interconnected and should be considered together. The review concludes with a synthesis of recommendations for each facet of safety. This review provides principal investigators with accessible, data-driven resources and propose a framework for future research on field safety that will enable cross-disciplinary sharing.",

          "abstract": "Social identity threat is a vigilance state in which a person anticipates that others in a setting may devalue them because of one (or more) of their social identities. According to theory, threat is multifaceted—encompassing concerns about stereotyping, belonging, fairness, authenticity, and more—and situational, fluctuating depending on which identities and contextual cues are salient. Threat is also theorized as a universal experience—affecting potentially anyone, across any of their identities. Here, we put these central aspects of theory to the test by introducing the Social Identity Threat Concerns (SITC) Inventory, a self-report instrument designed to assess threat across varied identity-by-context situations. Across nine studies ( N  = 8533), we show that threat is common across social groups yet situational, emerging under specific, theorized conditions. The SITC Inventory is a field-advancing tool that equips researchers to better understand and reduce identity-based threats, laying the groundwork for more inclusive and equitable environments.",

          "abstract": "People are often faced with choices whose outcomes will affect other individuals in addition to themselves. Being responsible for deciding on behalf of others alters choice behavior and increases delegation rates in decisions involving risk and ambiguity. However, it is unknown whether the influence of social responsibility on decision-making acts primarily or directly on risk, loss, and ambiguity attitudes versus more general aspects of cognition. We report a series of experiments on objective magnitude judgments that demonstrate that the influences of responsibility on cognition and behavior extend beyond risk or ambiguity and act at the metacognitive level. Specifically, responsibility for others changes metacognitive biases, leading to a decrease in decision confidence without affecting choice accuracy. Last, we propose and empirically test a normative computational framework based on decision confidence that can explain decisions to assume or delegate responsibility for others without needing to assume changes in risk preferences.",

Herein, we introduce interfacial functional ligands that not only optimize the electronic structures of active sites but also regulate the interfacial microenvironment for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, the pore edge–hosted FeF 3 O 2 sites enable a favorable electronic structure to generate * OOH intermediates and simultaneously promote the interfacial transport of hydroxide for enhanced OER kinetics. The F ligands in FeF 3 O 2 sites interact with interfacial water strongly via H-bonding to promote H-bond network connectivity, thus encouraging the temporally concerted proton transfer during hydroxide diffusion. Consequently, FeF 3 O 2 sites realize the 331.5-fold enhancement in turnover frequency for alkaline OER over the NiOOH and efficient water electrolyzers (1.663 voltage at 1.0 amperes per square centimeter at 60°C, durably operating at 1.0 amperes per square centimeter &gt; 1200 hours).",

Here, we propose an impact-driven magnetic untethered miniature robot (RoboIMP) capable of delivering repeatable high-force outputs of up to 3 N, surpassing the theoretical force limits of conventional magnetic robots at the same characteristic length. RoboIMP uses reciprocal oscillation to fluidize the surrounding medium, thereby reducing the resistance from the medium by up to 13-fold. This enables effective locomotion of an untethered miniature robot in both SLM and SGM. By integrating functional modules, the proposed system demonstrates various applications, including pipeline cleaning, cargo delivery and retrieval, and navigation in the presence of chyme.",

Participant studies demonstrate strong correlations between CO 2 flow rates from the skin and breath during both rest and exercise, with skin-emitted CO 2 approximately four orders of magnitude lower than exhaled CO 2 . Skin-emitted CO 2 also correlates with metabolic rate, suggesting its potential as a surrogate for breath-based indirect calorimetry.

Our strategy demonstrates superior antitumor efficacy across multiple tumor models, eliciting robust CD8 + T cell– and NK cell–mediated immunity while suppressing pulmonary metastasis progression. This strategic integration of synthetic lethality with an immunogenic stress response establishes a previously unidentified paradigm for expanding broad applications by cGAS-STING–mediated innate immunity.",

          "abstract": "Optically addressable spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride offer promising potential for 2D quantum sensing, although excited-state dynamics remain poorly understood. In particular, the nonradiative relaxation paths from the excited triplet states to the ground state, especially those involving a shelving intermediate state (IS), remain largely hypothetical, and the rate constants have yet to be directly measured. In this work, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of the IS in the optical pumping cycle in a broad temperature range. We measure a 24.0(3)-nanosecond relaxation time from IS to the ground state at room temperature, which approximately doubles at low temperatures. Simulations reveal how spin populations and ground-state polarization evolve with varying excitation rates. Accordingly, we optimize optically detected magnetic resonance pulse sequences to account for the effects of IS relaxation. This considerably enhances spin manipulation efficiency, allowing substantial optimization of the quantum sensor’s sensitivity based on boron vacancies.",

          "abstract": "Agricultural terraces are among the most widespread human-made landforms. They profoundly reshape soil landscapes and influence the carbon cycle, yet the extent and drivers of their impact remain highly uncertain. By integrating field observations from 14 well-drained terrace landforms across a climatic-geochemical gradient with a data synthesis, we show that changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after terracing are governed by two coupled C turnover-geomorphic processes: replacement of lost topsoil C at eroding positions and stabilization of buried SOC at depositional positions. Climate strongly modulates these processes by shaping soil geochemistry and plant productivity, which in turn control SOC replacement and stabilization within terraces. Thus, terracing effects on SOC stocks shift from consistently positive in humid regions to mixed (positive and negative) outcomes in dry regions. This study establishes a framework for elucidating SOC dynamics in well-drained terrace systems and provides a scientific basis for targeted management strategies to enhance C sequestration in agricultural terraces globally.",

The cytoprotective role of RTAs has been increasingly recognized as essential in regulating ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. However, current ferroptosis inhibitors primarily rely on phenolic or aromatic amine scaffolds, which were found through high-throughput screening or derived from historically known RTAs. We introduce hydrazine-derived tetrahydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazin-3-ones (THTZOs) as a class of nonclassical RTAs. THTZOs operate via a unique mechanism involving hydrazyl and verdazyl radical intermediates that is independent of aromatic stabilization. These compounds demonstrate broad reactivity against autoxidation in both simple hydrocarbons and membrane phospholipids, effectively suppressing ferroptosis induced by RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) or erastin in multiple cell lines. Our findings revitalize the application of hydrazine derivatives in RTA chemistry and establish a foundation for the rational design of RTAs as potent ferroptosis inhibitors, offering previously unidentified antioxidant therapeutic candidates.",

          "abstract": "Ischemic stroke followed by reperfusion urgently requires safe and efficient cytoprotective strategies, a need still unmet by current pharmacotherapies. Nanotechnology holds promise for improved drug delivery to the brain, yet the efficacy of nanomaterials crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is quite limited, and long-term intracranial retention of nanomaterials may provoke neurotoxicity. Leveraging the anti-inflammatory, BBB-crossing, and biosafe properties of hydrogen (H 2 ), we develop an inflamed vessel–targeted/anchored H 2 –producing system by modifying ZrSi 2 nanoparticles with a P-selectin–binding peptide (ZSNP), mimicking P-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand–mediated innate immune recruitment. Rather than relying on nanoparticle penetration into the brain parenchyma, this design enables ZSNP to anchor at the BBB vasculature, where it locally and continuously generates H 2 via hydrolysis. The released H 2 traverses the BBB, exerting cytoprotection through antioxidant and immunomodulatory mechanisms that coordinate multicellular recovery processes. Furthermore, ZSNP promotes microglia-mediated angiogenesis and neurogenesis, guides axonal projections along neovascular trajectories, and facilitates microglia-neuron interaction via the noncanonical Wnt/Ca 2+ pathway. This reconstruction of the neurovascular network supports the reintegration of functional neural circuits, leading to structural and functional recovery that surpasses the effects of edaravone. By enabling sustained H 2 release at the BBB interface without requiring nanoparticle intracranial accumulation, this strategy represents a promising and low-burden neuroprotective approach for ischemic stroke.",

BoNTs induce a flaccid paralysis by blocking neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic neurons via soluble N -ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) cleavage. The enteric nervous system (ENS) controls antimicrobial defense reactions within the intestine through neuron-released mediators. Here, we show that subclinical doses of BoNT/A and BoNT/B, which are not sufficient to cause botulism when released in the intestinal lumen, paralyze ENS neurons favoring infection by prototypic bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica and Shigella flexneri . The BoNTs reduce the release of mucin, decreasing the protective barrier against bacterial infection. These findings disclose previously unrecognized functions of BoNTs and roles in intestinal infections.

However, at high overpotentials, the production and conversion rates of H 2 O 2 are still limited. Here, we report an electrochemical method that can convert H 2 O and formaldehyde into high-concentration H 2 O 2 and high-value formate salts with high product purity under environmental conditions. At a current density of 30 milliamperes per square centimeter, continuous operation for 5 hours can produce 6.522% (m/v) H 2 O 2 , and the product does not contain acid, alkali, or excessive impurities.

Inspired by recent advances in 3D metamaterials, we show that a locally resonant ultrasonic metafluid consisting of a suspension of soft metallic beads is the innovation needed for 3D Anderson localization of scalar acoustic waves to be definitively observed. By reporting two independent sets of time- and position-resolved ultrasonic experiments, we present clear evidence of Anderson transitions between diffusion and localization, accurately determining the mobility edges and the localization phase diagram.",

We explore these parameter spaces and find that the fluidic torque generated by a magnetic microrobot collective can be exploited to apply bidirectional torque to concentric ring structures and demonstrate this through physical experiments and numerical simulations. Additionally, we demonstrate how the fluidic torque of the microrobots can be exploited to actuate gear trains, rotate comparatively large three-dimensional objects, dynamically self-assemble internally driven ring structures, and absorb and expel large numbers of circular objects.

          "abstract": "This study challenges widely held metabolic theory, which suggests that whole-animal metabolic rates increase with temperature because of its universal effects on the kinetics of the underlying biochemical reactions. Here, we show that metabolic rates across flatfish species are largely invariant from poles to the equator, which points to an explanation for interspecific thermal sensitivity based on ecology and evolution rather than thermodynamic constraints. The explanation proposed here is that warm water provides a thermodynamic opportunity, not a mandate, for metabolic rate escalation when required for predator-prey interactions. Flatfish do not require metabolic escalation because of their reliance on camouflage that mitigates the greater predation intensity in tropical waters. These findings have strong implications for models attempting to diagnose the response of organisms to climate change and for macroecological patterns more generally.",

          "abstract": "The South China Sea throughflow (SCSTF) serves as a heat and freshwater conveyor, playing a pivotal role in regulating physical processes and biogeochemical cycles in the SCS. Because of limited observations, the long-term changes of the SCSTF under a warming climate and underlying dynamics remain unclear. In this study, we reconstructed centennial-scale variability of the SCSTF (1894–2022) using coral oxygen isotope (δ 18 O) and satellite observations. Besides prominent interannual and decadal variabilities, there exists a marked long-term decreasing trend at −0.14 ± 0.02 Sv (1 Sv = 10 6 m 3 s −1 ) per decade for the total SCSTF volume transport. Consequently, the SCSTF transport decreased by 35 ± 5% over the past 129 years in comparison with the mean value of 5.15 Sv. Using the Time-dependent Island Rule theory, we further reveal that the intensified trade wind in the tropical western Pacific drives the SCSTF slowdown. The findings substantially contribute to investigating the physical, ecological, and biogeochemical changes in the SCS and the Indo-Pacific Oceans.",

FD exposure reduced allergic lung inflammation and increased monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) recruitment. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that FD-exposed MDMs had altered gene expression, including dampened Ccl8 and major histocompatibility complex class II expression, impairing eosinophil recruitment and antigen presentation. RNA sequencing and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing confirmed FD-induced epigenetic reprogramming ex vivo, on bone marrow–derived macrophages. This modulation, seen in both human and murine cells, relied on histone deacetylase activity sustained by peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ signaling.

In this study, we tested the decision and learning strategies of insects faced with multiple cues in a foraging task, using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris . We presented combinations of visual-only features, as found in natural flowers: colors of varying discriminability, paired with shapes or patterns. We found that the bees relied exclusively on colors when these were easy to discriminate, and did not learn pattern or shape features simultaneously. With harder to discriminate colors, the bees learned both color and shape or pattern features. Our results demonstrate that bumblebees flexibly adjust their learning strategies when presented with visual features of varying discriminability, to balance the investment in learning time and accuracy during multicue learning and decision making. A difference in learning dynamics suggests that blocking could serve as a mechanism to implement this strategy switch.",

This comprehensive repository has been pivotal in developing deep learning algorithms for predicting protein structures directly from sequences. In contrast, RNA structure prediction has lagged and suffers from a scarcity of structural data. Here, we present the secondary structure models of 1098 primary microRNAs and 1456 human messenger RNA regions determined through chemical probing. We develop a deep learning architecture inspired from the Evoformer model of Alphafold and traditional architectures for secondary structure prediction. This model, eFold, was trained on our newly generated database and more than 300,000 secondary structures across multiple sources. We benchmark eFold on two challenging test sets of long and diverse RNA structures and show that our dataset and architecture contribute to increasing the prediction performance, compared to similar state-of-the-art methods.

While trans-regulatory mechanisms governing Rorc expression are well characterized, cis-regulatory mechanisms, particularly in innate lymphocytes, remain partially understood. Here, we identify CNS11 as an essential cis-regulatory element of Rorc . In T H 17 cells, CNS11 was dispensable for induction but critical for maintaining RORγt expression. In contrast, CNS11 deletion blocked ILC3 progenitor induction, abolishing secondary lymphoid organ formation. CNS11 deletion also abolished the development of RORγt + T reg , RORγt + γδT, and RORγt + antigen-presenting cells. Mechanistically, CNS11 functioned through a RORγt-dependent feed-forward loop with cell type–specific cofactors: cooperating with RORγt and runt-related transcription factor 3 to direct ILC3 development and with RORγt and/or c-MAF to sustain RORγt expression in T H 17, RORγt + T reg , and RORγt + γδT cells.

Here, we show that a small molecule targeting an IDR evaluated in a clinical trial interacts selectively with an oligomeric form of its target, which is more structured than the monomer and is stabilized by interactions involving aromatic residues in partially α-helical regions. The interaction reshapes the conformational ensemble of the target, alters the biophysical properties of its phase-separated condensates in vitro, and attenuates RNA polymerase II recruitment in cells.

Here, we established a systematic CRISPR-based protein-tagging approach that enables direct, unambiguous comparison of nuclear localization and genome-wide binding profiles of endogenous ZAD-ZnFs in developing Drosophila embryos. Evidence is provided that a subset of ZAD-ZnFs forms nuclear condensates through the stacking of the N-terminal ZAD dimerization surface. Disruption of condensation activity leads to misregulation of genome-wide binding profiles and lethality, underscoring its functional and physiological significance in development. Integrative chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and Micro-C analyses reveal that many ZAD-ZnFs colocalize with core insulator proteins such as CCCTC-binding factor and Centrosomal protein 190 kD to control the formation of topological boundaries. We suggest that the diverse molecular functions of ZAD-ZnFs have evolutionarily arisen from their ancestral role as insulator-binding proteins.",

Our experiments encompass multiple length and timescales, allowing us to obtain a nucleus-wide view of the mechanism connecting hub formation to bulk Dl concentration. Our results show that previously unobserved, slowly moving clusters of Dl are present, in addition to the expected populations of freely mobile and DNA-bound Dl. Furthermore, both mobile clusters and DNA-bound Dl appear only once a threshold concentration in the nucleus is surpassed, a behavior consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation.

However, its impact on circadian metabolic regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how chronic IH reshapes 24-hour hepatic and systemic metabolic programs in a mouse model mimicking OSA-associated chronic hypoxia. Through integrated circadian transcriptomic, metabolomic, and physiological 24-hour profiling, we show that 4 weeks of rest phase–restricted IH reprograms hepatic and systemic metabolism in a time-specific manner. This reorganization involves the coordinated circadian regulation of glucose, lipid, and redox pathways, with a shift away from oxidative metabolism toward oxygen-sparing processes such as gluconeogenesis, glycogen turnover, and lipid mobilization. These changes align with the hypoxic phase exposure and coincide with reshaped hepatic metabolite oscillations and systemic autonomic rhythms, supporting a functional adaptation to intermittent oxygen availability. Mechanistically, we identify the cAMP-CREB1 pathway as a driver of circadian transcriptional remodeling in the liver and a central integrator of IH-dependent adrenergic stress. Our findings establish chronic IH as a potent metabolic zeitgeber that rewires hepatic transcriptional and metabolic programs, revealing a circadian dimension to the metabolic consequences of sleep-disordered breathing.",

However, the mechanisms by which such minute melt fractions migrate through largely solid rocks and generate large-scale geophysical anomalies have remained unclear. Here, our high-pressure experiments demonstrate that, in the presence of H 2 O and NaCl, carbonate-rich melts act as super-spreaders, completely wetting and coating the surfaces of surrounding mantle minerals. This perfect wetting enables even trace amounts of melt (0.02 to 0.08 vol%) to form fully interconnected networks. Such connectivity facilitates efficient melt migration and chemical exchange, driving global material recycling between the surface and planetary interior.",

          "abstract": "Exceptional point degeneracies (EPDs) are non-Hermitian singularities where K eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. When a small perturbation is induced, the eigenvalue detuning from an EPD follows a K th-root sublinear expansion, which provides a means of enhancing the sensitivity (frequency shift) of resonant-based sensors. On the downside, resonant-based sensors are susceptible to cavity imperfections, local mechanical disturbances (temperature variations, vibrations), and other experimental uncertainties. Here, we overcome this problem by experimentally implementing passive periodic microwave metamaterials with nonresonant EPDs (NR-EPDs) occurring in their Bloch spectrum. We demonstrate a sublinear variation of the reflectance near NR-EPDs to a specific class of (global) perturbations and propose its usage for ultrasensitive sensing that is immune to undesired (local) perturbations. The sensitivity is shielded from technical or fundamental noise that typically degrades the signal-to-noise performance of resonant EPDs.",

Here, we show that both error rates and performance speed on correct trials are parametrically modulated by when DES starts and stops relative to the timeline of task-driven processing in stimulated brain areas and networks. We propose a framework, causal parametric mapping, which moves beyond the classic approach of binarizing the effects of DES on behavior into “positive” and “negative” mapping trials.

We examined the interaction of a genetically diverging hypervirulent Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) serotype with macrophages, identifying closely phylogenetically related isolates with differential susceptibility to intracellular killing. We reasoned that macrophage genes relatively suppressed during pathogen escape from killing were likely to encode mediators normally promoting bacterial killing. This led to the validation of ACOD1 and its product itaconate, NAMPT, and P2RX7 as host defense factors against pneumococci and related gram-positive pathogens. Last, we repurposed the antihistamine clemastine to augment phagolysosomal bacterial killing, via P2RX7, as a candidate host-directed therapy against pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium .

Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs before strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model’s assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model, the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the nonequilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2 to 3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario.

This approach reassessed existing knowledge of heat development within the context of modern geospatial datasets, revealing expanded applications of satellite-derived fire radiative power in classifying distinct smoldering dynamics. The findings additionally emphasized the importance of capturing fine-scale variation in climate-sensitive fuel loading when determining regional fire season impact.

Identification of the best hapten is an essential step in the development of third-generation Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between Hib oligosaccharide chain length and immunological activities remains elusive. A series of Hib capsular polysaccharide (CPS) oligosaccharide derivatives of different lengths were synthesized to establish carbohydrate structure-function relationships. Glycan microarray screening and immunological evaluation of oligosaccharides revealed that tetramer 4 , comprising four repeated disaccharide units, is the key immunogenic epitope of CPS. The investigation into the influence of carrier proteins, adjuvants, and vaccination dose on immunogenicity demonstrated that an equivalent dose of glycoconjugate 4 -TT without adjuvant can induce a similar immune response as a licensed Hib vaccine (MINHAI Hib). Adjuvant-free 4 -TT glycoconjugates can induce both a humoral and a cellular immune response as efficiently as licensed Hib vaccine. This formulation exhibited protective efficacy in a mouse septic infection model through effective pathogen clearance from the circulation to the liver-resident macrophage Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells in a mouse septic infection model. In conclusion, a well-defined semisynthetic glycoconjugate vaccine candidate 4 -TT was developed with a more straightforward and adaptable manufacturing process and demonstrated excellent efficacy comparable to licensed Hib vaccine, providing a rationale for further evaluation in clinical trials.",

Sulfur, selenium, and tellurium are volatiles, but also siderophile elements. Their abundances in Earth’s mantle can be used to determine whether volatile elements were delivered to Earth during or after the segregation of the core. Here, we experimentally measured their partition coefficients between core-forming metal and mantle silicate under pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacity conditions relevant to a deep magma ocean. Our results show that these elements exhibit similar partitioning behaviors, indicating that core-mantle equilibrium preserves their chondritic relative abundances. If a volatile-rich late veneer has been delivered to Earth after core segregation, it must have been limited in mass, making up a maximum of 0.1% Earth’s mass. This suggests that volatile elements, including water, were accreted continuously during Earth’s growth rather than being delivered predominantly by a late veneer of volatile-rich material such as carbonaceous chondrites.",

We apply BRIGHT to a MoS 2 -MoSe 2 transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) lateral heterojunctions exhibiting built-in strain and out-of-plane ripples and show that varying heterojunction widths lead to distinct surface morphologies and corresponding changes in the planar strain distribution.

We reveal that environmental stress induces epididymal macrophage senescence, whereas the clearance of above cells significantly alleviates environmental stress–reduced sperm motility. In vivo and in vitro experiments further demonstrate that environmental stress induces macrophage senescence via down-regulating Foxo3 expression. Mechanistically, environmental stress increases the epididymal Foxo3 N 6-methyladenosine level and inhibits the FTO. Overexpression of Fto in vitro and S -adenosylhomocysteine supplementation in vivo alleviates environmental stress–induced macrophage senescence.

While IL-4/13 signaling in epithelial cells is required for tuft cell hyperplasia, few signals that support this process have been identified. Here, we show that tuft cells across all tissues express the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT and that IL-4/13 is necessary and sufficient to up-regulate KIT on small intestinal (SI) tuft cells. Although epithelial KIT is dispensable for homeostatic turnover, KIT deletion from tuft cells during helminth infection reduces tuft cell hyperplasia and delays helminth clearance.

Dopaminergic neurons, known to encode reward expectation and prediction error, are prime candidates for linking value and vigor. Here, we show that human reach vigor dynamically tracks canonical dopaminergic learning signals not only at movement onset but also during ongoing motion. Using a reaching task with probabilistic rewards (0, 33, 66, and 100%), we observed that peak velocity scaled with expected value. Crucially, following feedback, reach velocity was transiently invigorated or enervated in proportion to the sign and magnitude of the reward prediction error. Trial-by-trial changes in kinematics reflected value updating, consistent with dopaminergic phasic learning signals. These results demonstrate that movement vigor is modulated by reward-learning signals on rapid timescales, revealing a real-time behavioral readout of motivational computation in the brain.",

However, here, we present evidence that Wnt11 can regulate PCP in a gradient-independent manner. In the neural plate of Xenopus embryos, endogenous Wnt11 does not form an obvious gradient in the direction of PCP, but is polarized at cell boundaries together with core PCP components. Wnt11 polarization is dependent on core PCP components, while polarization of core PCP components can also be induced by Wnt11, indicating a mutual amplification loop between Wnt11 and core PCP components in PCP formation. Furthermore, Wnt11 and core PCP components compose an intercellular loop to coordinate the direction of polarity.

          "abstract": "Myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD1) L122R -mutant spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma (SRMS) is an ultrarare, treatment-resistant sarcoma with dismal outcomes. We performed regulatory network analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) from six patient tumors, revealing disrupted myogenesis and actionable master regulator (MR) dependencies across three coexisting tumor cell states, also conserved in patient-derived xenografts: (i) a MYOD1-enriched progenitor-like state, (ii) a proliferative transition state, and (iii) a partially differentiated state with reduced MYOD1 activity. Ligand-receptor analysis uncovered paracrine insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)-IGF1 receptor (IGF1R)–phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling from progenitor to transition/differentiated states, whose inhibition demonstrated therapeutic potential in ex vivo drug screens, and significantly improved disease control in a patient-derived xenograft model. Oncogenic MRs were recapitulated in 24 bulk RNA profiles, while 20 DNA profiles revealed recurrent IGF2/PI3K/AKT alterations, reinforcing shared transcriptional vulnerabilities. These findings characterize aberrant, mutant MYOD1–driven myogenesis sustained by IGF2 and nominate IGF1R-PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors for therapeutic translation in MYOD1 L122R -mutant SRMS, underscoring the utility of single-cell regulatory network analysis for uncovering actionable dependencies in rare, transcriptionally complex cancers.",

          "abstract": "Transport of warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) across the Antarctic continental shelf break is the primary source of heat to Antarctica’s marginal seas. Net heat supplied by CDW is ultimately lost to: (i) the ocean surface, either to the atmosphere or sea ice, or (ii) the ice sheet, by melting the base of ice shelves and calved icebergs. Ocean models often neglect the heat exchange needed to melt ice shelves and icebergs. Simulations presented here indicate that this omits the largest ocean heat sink on the Antarctic continental shelf, representing 60% of heat supplied across the shelf break. Suppressing this heat sink in simulations drives enhanced heat loss to the atmosphere through thinned sea ice cover as well as nonlocal reductions in heat supply to the continental shelf via sea ice–mediated stratification changes. These results highlight a source of climate model bias and clarify the dynamics of heat transport to Antarctic ice shelves.",

          "abstract": "Cellular interactions between germ cells and gonadal somatic cells are essential for the progression of gametogenesis. Here, we report a culture method for generating fetal testicular somatic cell–like cells (fTeSLCs) from embryonic stem cells. These fTeSLCs exhibit a transcriptomic profile closely resembling that of their in vivo counterparts, including distinct cell populations corresponding to Sertoli cells and interstitial cells. For functional assessment, interstitial cell–like cells (ICLCs) and Sertoli-like cells (SerLCs) were isolated from fTeSLCs. ICLCs differentiated into Leydig cells when cocultured with testes lacking endogenous Leydig cells, thereby restoring androgenic support. SerLCs reconstituted the seminiferous epithelium following selective ablation of endogenous Sertoli cells. Both cell types supported spermatogenesis and generated spermatids reaching the elongating stage. Notably, round spermatids derived from these reconstructed systems produced viable offspring by round spermatid injection. These findings demonstrate that fTeSLCs can generate functional testicular somatic cells, providing a valuable platform for studying testis development and spermatogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Iron deficiency, anemia, and Plasmodium infection are global health challenges with overlapping geographical distributions, particularly affecting pregnant women in Africa, yet the mechanisms underlying their interactions remain poorly understood. We used a multilayered approach combining clinical data from Malawian pregnant women ( n  = 711) in the REVAMP trial, a genetic mouse model [ Tmprss6 -knockout (KO)], and in vitro Plasmodium falciparum cultures to clarify iron-malaria associations. Iron deficiency was associated with 50% reduced P. falciparum parasitemia in pregnant women [95% CI (30 to 64%), P  &lt; 0.0001], while iron-deficient mice exhibited improved survival against P. berghei (median 15.5 days versus 7.0 days for WT mice) and protection from cerebral malaria (83% versus 17% survival). Iron chelation substantially changed the transcriptomic and proteomic profile of cultured P. falciparum parasites. Intravenous iron supplementation did not increase parasitemia when coupled with malaria prevention. These findings demonstrate that iron deficiency protects against Plasmodium infection and support World Health Organization recommendations for iron supplementation in malaria-endemic regions when combined with adequate malaria prevention strategies in place.",
