          "authors": "Tristan L. Botelho, Sora Jun, Demetrius Humes, Katherine A. DeCelles",
          "abstract": "Online platforms are rife with racial discrimination1, but current interventions focus on employers2,3 rather than customers. We propose a customer-facing solution: changing to a two-point rating scale (dichotomization). Compared with the ubiquitous five-star scale, we argue that dichotomization reduces modern racial discrimination by focusing evaluators on the distinction between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ performance, thereby reducing how personal beliefs shape customer assessments. Study 1 is a quasi-natural experiment on a home-services labour platform (n = 69,971) in which the company exogenously changed from a five-star scale to a dichotomous scale (thumbs up or thumbs down). Dichotomization eliminated customers’ racial discrimination whereby non-white workers received lower ratings and earned 91 cents for each US dollar paid to white workers for the same work. A pre-registered experiment (study 2, n = 652) found that the equalizing effect of dichotomization is most prevalent among evaluators holding modern racist beliefs. Further experiments (study 3, n = 1,435; study 4, n = 528) provide evidence of the proposed mechanism, and eight supplementary studies support measurement and design choices. Our research offers a promising intervention for reducing customers’ subtle racial discrimination in a large section of the economy and contributes to the interdisciplinary literature on evaluation processes and racial inequality.",

          "abstract": "Infectious disease threats to individual and public health are numerous, varied and frequently unexpected. Artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies, which are already supporting human decision making in economics, medicine and social science, have the potential to transform the scope and power of infectious disease epidemiology. Here we consider the application to infectious disease modelling of AI systems that combine machine learning, computational statistics, information retrieval and data science. We first outline how recent advances in AI can accelerate breakthroughs in answering key epidemiological questions and we discuss specific AI methods that can be applied to routinely collected infectious disease surveillance data. Second, we elaborate on the social context of AI for infectious disease epidemiology, including issues such as explainability, safety, accountability and ethics. Finally, we summarize some limitations of AI applications in this field and provide recommendations for how infectious disease epidemiology can harness most effectively current and future developments in AI.",

          "authors": "Adam S. Lowet, Qiao Zheng, Melissa Meng, Sara Matias, Jan Drugowitsch, Naoshige Uchida",
          "abstract": "Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions3. Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons4,5,6,7,8,9 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.",

They raised important concerns, which led them to conclude that our dataset was underpowered to be informative about human evolution during the Black Death. We agree that small sample sizes are an inherent limitation of ancient DNA studies. To address this, we incorporated multiple lines of evidence, including genomic data spanning before, during and after the Black Death; replication across two distinct population cohorts; and experimental data on cellular responses to Yersinia pestis infection, to build a case for selection. Our functional analyses—a rarity in ancient DNA studies—are further supported by independent epidemiological data, showing that the putatively selected ERAP2 allele does indeed protect against severe respiratory infection in contemporary populations3. Together, all lines of evidence continue to support selection on ERAP2.",

          "abstract": "Neoantigen vaccines are under investigation for various cancers, including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR )-driven lung cancers 1,2 . We tracked the phylogenetic history of an EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with erlotinib, osimertinib, radiotherapy and a personalized neopeptide vaccine (NPV) targeting ten somatic mutations, including EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del). The ex19del mutation was clonal, but is likely to have appeared after a whole-genome doubling (WGD) event. Following osimertinib and NPV treatment, loss of the ex19del mutation was identified in a progressing small-cell-transformed liver metastasis. Circulating tumour DNA analyses tracking 467 somatic variants revealed the presence of this EGFR wild-type clone before vaccination and its expansion during osimertinib/NPV therapy. Despite systemic T cell reactivity to the vaccine-targeted ex19del neoantigen, the NPV failed to halt disease progression. The liver metastasis lost vaccine-targeted neoantigens through chromosomal instability and exhibited a hostile microenvironment, characterized by limited immune infiltration, low CXCL9 and elevated M2 macrophage levels. Neoantigens arising post-WGD were more likely to be absent in the progressing liver metastasis than those occurring pre-WGD, suggesting that prioritizing pre-WGD neoantigens may improve vaccine design. Data from the TRACERx 421 cohort 3 provide evidence that pre-WGD mutations better represent clonal variants, and owing to their presence at multiple copy numbers, are less likely to be lost in metastatic transition. These data highlight the power of phylogenetic disease tracking and functional T cell profiling to understand mechanisms of immune escape during combination therapies.",

          "abstract": "The complex life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum involves several major differentiation stages, each requiring strict control of gene expression. Fundamental changes in chromatin structure and epigenetic modifications during life cycle progression suggest a central role for these mechanisms in regulating the transcriptional program of malaria parasite development 1–6 . P. falciparum chromatin is distinct from other eukaryotes, with an extraordinarily high AT content (&gt;80%) 7 and highly divergent histones resulting in atypical DNA packaging properties 8 . Moreover, the chromatin remodellers that are critical for shaping chromatin structure are not conserved and are unexplored in P. falciparum . Here we identify P. falciparum Snf2L ( Pf Snf2L, encoded by PF3D7_1104200 ) as an ISWI-related ATPase that actively repositions P. falciparum nucleosomes in vitro. Our results demonstrate that Pf Snf2L is essential, regulating both asexual development and sexual differentiation. Pf Snf2L globally controls just-in-time transcription by spatiotemporally determining nucleosome positioning at the promoters of stage-specific genes. The unique sequence and functional properties of Pf Snf2L led to the identification of an inhibitor that specifically kills P. falciparum and phenocopies the loss of correct gene expression timing. The inhibitor represents a new class of antimalarial transmission-blocking drugs, inhibiting gametocyte formation.",

          "abstract": "Chronic stress can change how we learn and, thus, how we make decisions1,2,3,4,5. Here we investigated the neuronal circuit mechanisms that enable this. Using a multifaceted systems neuroscience approach in male and female mice, we reveal a dual-pathway, amygdala–striatal neuronal circuit architecture by which a recent history of chronic stress disrupts the action–outcome learning underlying adaptive agency and promotes the formation of inflexible habits. We found that the projection from the basolateral amygdala to the dorsomedial striatum is activated by rewarding events to support the action–outcome learning needed for flexible, goal-directed decision-making. Chronic stress attenuates this to disrupt action–outcome learning and, therefore, agency. Conversely, the projection from the central amygdala to the dorsomedial striatum mediates habit formation. Following stress, this pathway is progressively recruited to learning to promote the premature formation of inflexible habits. Thus, stress exerts opposing effects on two amygdala–striatal pathways to disrupt agency and promote habit. These data provide neuronal circuit insights into how chronic stress shapes learning and decision-making, and help understanding of how stress can lead to the disrupted decision-making and pathological habits that characterize substance use disorders and mental health conditions.",

          "abstract": "Gas samples relevant to health1,2,3 and the environment4,5,6 typically contain many molecular species that span a huge concentration dynamic range. Mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy with high-finesse cavity enhancement has allowed the most sensitive multispecies trace-gas detections so far2,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. However, the robust performance of this technique depends critically on ensuring absorption-path-length enhancement over a broad spectral coverage, which is severely limited by comb–cavity frequency mismatch if strongly absorbing compounds are present. Here we introduce modulated ringdown comb interferometry, a technique that resolves the vulnerability of comb–cavity enhancement to strong intracavity absorption or dispersion. This technique works by measuring ringdown dynamics carried by massively parallel comb lines transmitted through a length-modulated cavity, making use of both the periodicity of the field dynamics and the Doppler frequency shifts introduced from a Michelson interferometer. As a demonstration, we measure highly dispersive exhaled human breath samples and ambient air in the mid-infrared with finesse improved to 23,000 and coverage to 1,010 cm−1. Such a product of finesse and spectral coverage is orders of magnitude better than all previous demonstrations2,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, enabling us to simultaneously quantify 20 distinct molecular species at above 1-part-per-trillion sensitivity varying in concentrations by seven orders of magnitude. This technique unlocks next-generation sensing performance for complex and dynamic molecular compositions, with scalable improvement to both finesse and spectral coverage.",

          "abstract": "The survival of malignant cells within tumours is often seen as depending on ruthless competition for nutrients and other resources1,2. Although competition is certainly critical for tumour evolution and cancer progression, cooperative interactions within tumours are also important, albeit poorly understood3,4. Cooperative populations at all levels of biological organization risk extinction if their population size falls below a critical tipping point5,6. Here we examined whether cooperation among tumour cells may be a potential therapeutic target. We identified a cooperative mechanism that enables tumour cells to proliferate under the amino acid-deprived conditions found in the tumour microenvironment. Disruption of this mechanism drove cultured tumour populations to the critical extinction point and resulted in a marked reduction in tumour growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that tumour cells collectively digest extracellular oligopeptides through the secretion of aminopeptidases. The resulting free amino acids benefit both aminopeptidase-secreting cells and neighbouring cells. We identified CNDP2 as the key enzyme that hydrolyses these peptides extracellularly, and loss of this aminopeptidase prevents tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. These data show that cooperative scavenging of nutrients is key to survival in the tumour microenvironment and reveal a targetable cancer vulnerability.",

However, it is challenging for ultrasmall CsPbI3 QDs to retain their solution-phase properties when they assemble into conductive films, greatly hindering their device application3,6. Here we report an approach for in situ deposit stabilized ultrasmall CsPbI3 QD conductive solids, by constructing CsPbI3 QD/quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite heteroepitaxy. The well-aligned periodic array of edge-oriented ligands at heterointerface triggers a substantial octahedral tilting in a critical layer thickness of CsPbI3 QDs, which heightens the Gibbs free energy difference between the tilted-CsPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 leading to thermodynamic stabilization of CsPbI3 QDs. The approach allows us to fabricate stabilized CsPbI3 QD conductive films with tunable emission covering the entire red spectral region from 600 nm to 710 nm. Here we report the pure-red PeLEDs with narrow electroluminescence peak centred at 630 nm, matching the Rec. 2100 standard for ultrahigh-definition display. The champion device exhibits a certified external quantum efficiency of 24.6% and a half-lifetime of 6,330 min, ranking as one of the most efficient and stable pure-red PeLED reported to date.

          "abstract": "The generation of large-scale entangled states is crucial for quantum technologies, such as quantum computation1, communication2 and metrology3. Integrated quantum photonics that enables on-chip encoding, processing and detection of quantum light states offers a promising platform for the generation and manipulation of large-scale entangled states4,5. Generating entanglement between qubits encoded in discrete variables within single photons is challenging, owing to the difficulty of making single photons interact on photonic chips6,7,8,9,10,11. Devices that operate with continuous variables are more promising, as they enable the deterministic generation and entanglement of qumodes, in which information is encoded in light quadratures. Demonstrations so far have been limited to entanglement between two qumodes12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. Here we report the deterministic generation of a continuous-variable eight-mode entanglement on an integrated optical chip. The chip delivers a quantum microcomb that produces multimode squeezed-vacuum optical frequency combs below the threshold. We verify the inseparability of our eight-mode state and demonstrate supermode multipartite entanglement over hundreds of megahertz sideband frequencies through violation of the van Loock–Furusawa criteria. By measuring the full matrices of nullifier correlations with sufficiently low off-diagonal noises, we characterize multipartite entanglement structures, which are approximate to the expected cluster-type structures for finite squeezing.

          "abstract": "DNA damage promotes mutations that fuel cancer, ageing and neurodegenerative diseases1,2,3, but surprisingly, the causes and types of damage remain largely unknown. There are three identified mechanisms that damage DNA during transcription: collision of RNA polymerase (RNAP) with the DNA-replication machinery head-on and co-directionally4,5,6, and R-loop-induced DNA breakage7,8,9,10. Here we identify novel DNA damage reaction intermediates11,12 and uncover a fourth transcription-related source of DNA damage: endogenous DNA damage at sites of terminated transcripts. We engineered proteins to capture single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends with 3′ polarity in bacterial and human cells. In Escherichia coli, spontaneous 3′-ssDNA-end foci were unexpectedly frequent, at one or more per cell division, and arose via two identifiable pathways, both of which were dependent on DNA replication. A pathway associated with double-strand breaks was suppressed by overexpression of replicative DNA polymerase (pol) III, suggesting competition between pol III and DNA damage-promoting proteins. Mapping of recurrent 3′-ssDNA-ends identified distinct 3′-ssDNA-end-hotspots, mostly unrelated to double-strand breaks, next to the 5′-CCTTTTTT transcription-terminator-like sequence. These 3′-ssDNA-termini coincide with RNA 3′-termini identified by DirectRNA sequencing13 or simultaneous 5′ and 3′ end RNA sequencing (SEnd-seq)14 and were prevented by a mutant RNAP that reads through terminators. Our findings reveal that transcription termination or pausing can promote DNA damage and subsequent genomic instability.",

          "abstract": "Ultra-hot Jupiters, an extreme class of planets not found in our solar system, provide a unique window into atmospheric processes. The extreme temperature contrasts between their day- and night-sides pose a fundamental climate puzzle: how is energy distributed? To address this, we must observe the 3D structure of these atmospheres, particularly their vertical circulation patterns, which can serve as a testbed for advanced Global Circulation Models (GCM) e.g.1. Here we show a dramatic shift in atmospheric circulation in an ultra-hot Jupiter: a unilateral flow from the hot star- facing side to the cooler space-facing side of the planet sits below an equatorial super-rotational jet stream. By resolving the vertical structure of atmospheric dynamics, we move beyond integrated global snapshots of the atmosphere, enabling more accurate identification of flow patterns and allowing for a more nuanced comparison to models. Global Circulation Models based on first principles struggle to replicate the observed circulation pattern3 underscoring a critical gap between theoretical understanding of atmospheric flows and observational evidence. This work serves as a testbed to develop more comprehensive models applicable beyond our Solar System as we prepare for the next generation of giant telescopes.",

          "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) disrupt the continuity of the genome, with consequences for malignant transformation. Massive DNA damage can elicit a cellular checkpoint response that prevents cell proliferation1,2. However, how highly aggressive cancer cells, which can tolerate widespread DNA damage, respond to DSBs alongside continuous chromosome duplication is unknown. Here we show that DSBs induce a local genome maintenance mechanism that inhibits replication initiation in DSB-containing topologically associating domains (TADs) without affecting DNA synthesis at other genomic locations. This process is facilitated by mediators of replication and DSBs (MRDs). In normal and cancer cells, MRDs include the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex and the WEE1 kinase, which actively dislodges the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex from replication origins adjacent to DSBs and prevents initiation of DNA synthesis at DSB-containing TADs. Dysregulation of MRDs, or disruption of 3D chromatin architecture by dissolving TADs, results in inadvertent replication in damaged chromatin and increased DNA damage in cancer cells. We propose that the intact MRD cascade precedes DSB repair to prevent genomic instability, which is otherwise observed when replication is forced, or when genome architecture is challenged, in the presence of DSBs3,4,5. These observations reveal a previously unknown vulnerability in the DNA replication machinery that may be exploited to therapeutically target cancer cells.",

Here, using 18 single, double and triple whole-body and tissue-specific knockout and mutant mice, along with systematic mitochondrial morphology analysis, untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered that the synergy between two stress-responsive systems—the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin and the metalloprotease OMA1—safeguards mitochondrial structure and genome by mitochondrial fusion, mediated by the outer membrane GTPase MFN1 and the inner membrane GTPase OPA1. Whereas the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses. Thus, our data show that Parkin and OMA1 maintain a dual regulatory mechanism that controls mitochondrial fusion at the two membranes, even in the absence of extrinsic stress.",

          "abstract": "Glaciers are indicators of ongoing anthropogenic climate change 1 . Their melting leads to increased local geohazards 2 , and impacts marine 3 and terrestrial 4,5 ecosystems, regional freshwater resources 6 , and both global water and energy cycles 7,8 . Together with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, glaciers are essential drivers of present 9,10 and future 11–13 sea-level rise. Previous assessments of global glacier mass changes have been hampered by spatial and temporal limitations and the heterogeneity of existing data series 14–16 . Here we show in an intercomparison exercise that glaciers worldwide lost 273 ± 16 gigatonnes in mass annually from 2000 to 2023, with an increase of 36 ± 10% from the first (2000–2011) to the second (2012–2023) half of the period. Since 2000, glaciers have lost between 2% and 39% of their ice regionally and about 5% globally. Glacier mass loss is about 18% larger than the loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and more than twice that from the Antarctic Ice Sheet 17 . Our results arise from a scientific community effort to collect, homogenize, combine and analyse glacier mass changes from in situ and remote-sensing observations. Although our estimates are in agreement with findings from previous assessments 14–16 at a global scale, we found some large regional deviations owing to systematic differences among observation methods. Our results provide a refined baseline for better understanding observational differences and for calibrating model ensembles 12,16,18 , which will help to narrow projection uncertainty for the twenty-first century 11,12,18 .",

We identified T cell receptor clones capable of recognizing and targeting neoantigens derived from aberrant splicing in GNAS and RPL22 . In cases with multi-site biopsies, we detected the tumour-wide expression of the GNAS neojunction in glioma, mesothelioma, prostate cancer and liver cancer. These neoantigens are endogenously generated and presented by tumour cells under physiologic conditions and are sufficient to trigger cancer cell eradication by neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells. Moreover, our study highlights a role for dysregulated splicing factor expression in specific cancer types, leading to recurrent patterns of neojunction upregulation. These findings establish a molecular basis for T cell-based immunotherapies addressing the challenges of intratumoural heterogeneity.",

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide 1,2 . HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that accumulate progressive driver mutations 3 , with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin 2 . However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is broadly independent of the underlying aetiologies 4 . Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC, outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations 5,6 . Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC 7 . Here we generated a suite of genetically driven immunocompetent in vivo and matched in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance and metastasis. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human–mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with the human histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard-of-care treatment and used a linked in vitro–in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not previously been linked to HCC treatment. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental challenge for cancer vaccines is to generate long-lived functional T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Here we find that mRNA–lipoplex vaccines against somatic mutation-derived neoantigens may solve this challenge in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a lethal cancer with few mutations. At an extended 3.2-year median follow-up from a phase 1 trial of surgery, atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitory antibody), autogene cevumeran1 (individualized neoantigen vaccine with backbone-optimized uridine mRNA–lipoplex nanoparticles) and modified (m) FOLFIRINOX (chemotherapy) in patients with PDAC, we find that responders with vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8) have prolonged recurrence-free survival (RFS; median not reached) compared with non-responders without vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8; median RFS 13.4 months; P  =  0.007). In responders, autogene cevumeran induces CD8+ T cell clones with an average estimated lifespan of 7.7 years (range 1.5 to roughly 100 years), with approximately 20% of clones having latent multi-decade lifespans that may outlive hosts. Eighty-six percent of clones per patient persist at substantial frequencies approximately 3 years post-vaccination, including clones with high avidity to PDAC neoepitopes. Using PhenoTrack, a novel computational strategy to trace single T cell phenotypes, we uncover that vaccine-induced clones are undetectable in pre-vaccination tissues, and assume a cytotoxic, tissue-resident memory-like T cell state up to three years post-vaccination with preserved neoantigen-specific effector function. Two responders recurred and evidenced fewer vaccine-induced T cells. Furthermore, recurrent PDACs were pruned of vaccine-targeted cancer clones. Thus, in PDAC, autogene cevumeran induces de novo CD8+ T cells with multiyear longevity, substantial magnitude and durable effector functions that may delay PDAC recurrence. Adjuvant mRNA–lipoplex neoantigen vaccines may thus solve a pivotal obstacle for cancer vaccination.",

          "abstract": "The peripheral nervous system (PNS) orchestrates organ function in health and disease. Most cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are infiltrated by PNS neurons, contributing to the complex tumor microenvironment (TME)1,2. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumor mass. Thus, cancer or healthy organ-innervating neurons elude current tissue sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single cell resolution, we developed “Trace-n-seq”. This method employs retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing >5.000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons with about 4.000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas we reveal novel neuronal cell types and unique molecular networks distinct to pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC, or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuro-cancer-microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic cancer-nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a proinflammatory TME and increases immune-checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness. Nab-Paclitaxel causes intra-tumor neuropathy which attenuated PDAC growth and in combination with sympathetic denervation results in synergistic tumor regression. Our multi-dimensional data reveal new insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, supporting inclusion of denervation in future therapies.",

          "abstract": "The fusion of non-Abelian anyons is a fundamental operation in measurement-only topological quantum computation1. In one-dimensional topological superconductors (1DTSs)2,3,4, fusion amounts to a determination of the shared fermion parity of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here we introduce a device architecture5 that is compatible with future tests of fusion rules. We implement a single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity6,7,8,9,10,11 in indium arsenide–aluminium heterostructures with a gate-defined superconducting nanowire12,13,14. The interferometer is formed by tunnel-coupling the proximitized nanowire to quantum dots. The nanowire causes a state-dependent shift of the quantum capacitance of these quantum dots of up to 1 fF. Our quantum-capacitance measurements show flux h/2e-periodic bimodality with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1 in 3.6 μs at optimal flux values. From the time traces of the quantum-capacitance measurements, we extract a dwell time in the two associated states that is longer than 1 ms at in-plane magnetic fields of approximately 2 T. We discuss the interpretation of our measurements in terms of both topologically trivial and non-trivial origins. The large capacitance shift and long poisoning time enable a parity measurement with an assignment error probability of 1%.",

Here we report a distinct pattern of cancer–nerve interactions between the peripheral nervous system and gastric cancer. In multiple mouse models of gastric cancer, nociceptive nerves demonstrated the greatest degree of nerve expansion in an NGF-dependent manner. Neural tracing identified CGRP+ peptidergic neurons as the primary gastric sensory neurons. Three-dimensional co-culture models showed that sensory neurons directly connect with gastric cancer spheroids. Chemogenetic activation of sensory neurons induced the release of calcium into the cytoplasm of cancer cells, promoting tumour growth and metastasis. Pharmacological ablation of sensory neurons or treatment with CGRP inhibitors suppressed tumour growth and extended survival. Depolarization of gastric tumour membranes through in vivo optogenetic activation led to enhanced calcium flux in jugular nucleus complex and CGRP release, defining a cancer cell–peptidergic neuronal circuit. Together, these findings establish the functional connectivity between cancer and sensory neurons, identifying this pathway as a potential therapeutic target.",

          "abstract": "Long chain fatty acids are the building blocks of fat in human bodies. In mammals, fatty acid synthase (FASN) contains multiple enzymatic domains to catalyze all chemical reactions needed for de novo fatty acid synthesis1. While the chemical reactions carried out by these enzymatic domains are well defined, how the dimeric FASN with an open architecture continuously catalyzes such reactions to synthesize a complete fatty acid remains elusive. Here, using a strategy of tagging and purifying endogenous FASN in HEK293 for single particle cryogenic electron microscopy studies, we characterized the structural dynamics of endogenous human FASN. We captured the conformational snapshots of various functional substates in the condensing cycle and developed a procedure to analyze particle distribution landscape of FASN with different orientations between its condensing and modifying wings. Together, we reveal that FASN function does not require large rotational motion between its two major functional domains during the condensing cycle, and that the catalytic reactions in condensing cycle carried out by two monomers are unsynchronized. Our data thus provide a new composite view of FASN dynamics during the fatty acid synthesis condensing cycle.",

          "abstract": "When two insulating, neutral materials are contacted and separated, they exchange electrical charge 1 . Experiments have long suggested that this ‘contact electrification’ is transitive, with different materials ordering into ‘triboelectric series’ based on the sign of charge acquired 2 . At the same time, the effect is plagued by unpredictability, preventing consensus on the mechanism and casting doubt on the rhyme and reason that series imply 3 . Here we expose an unanticipated connection between the unpredictability and order in contact electrification: nominally identical materials initially exchange charge randomly and intransitively, but—over repeated experiments—order into triboelectric series. We find that this evolution is driven by the act of contact itself—samples with more contacts in their history charge negatively to ones with fewer contacts. Capturing this ‘contact bias’ in a minimal model, we recreate both the initial randomness and ultimate order in numerical simulations and use it experimentally to force the appearance of a triboelectric series of our choosing. With a set of surface-sensitive techniques to search for the underlying alterations contact creates, we only find evidence of nanoscale morphological changes, pointing to a mechanism strongly coupled with mechanics. Our results highlight the centrality of contact history in contact electrification and suggest that focusing on the unpredictability that has long plagued the effect may hold the key to understanding it.",

          "abstract": "Most current strategies for carbon management require CO2 removal (CDR) from the atmosphere on the multi-hundred gigatonne (Gt) scale by 2100 (refs. 1,2,3,4,5). Mg-rich silicate minerals can remove >105 Gt CO2 and sequester it as stable and innocuous carbonate minerals or dissolved bicarbonate ions3,6,7. However, the reaction rates of these minerals under ambient conditions are far too slow for practical use. Here we show that CaCO3 and CaSO4 react quantitatively with diverse Mg-rich silicates (for example, olivine, serpentine and augite) under thermochemical conditions to form Ca2SiO4 and MgO. On exposure to ambient air under wet conditions, Ca2SiO4 is converted to CaCO3 and silicic acid, and MgO is partially converted into a Mg carbonate within weeks, whereas the input Mg silicate shows no reactivity over 6 months. Alternatively, Ca2SiO4 and MgO can be completely carbonated to CaCO3 and Mg(HCO3)2 under 1 atm CO2 at ambient temperature within hours. Using CaCO3 as the Ca source, this chemistry enables a CDR process in which the output Ca2SiO4/MgO material is used to remove CO2 from air or soil and the CO2 process emissions are sequestered. Analysis of the energy requirements indicates that this process could require less than 1 MWh per tonne CO2 removed, approximately half the energy of CO2 capture with leading direct air capture technologies. The chemistry described here could unlock Mg-rich silicates as a vast resource for safe and permanent CDR.",

HGGs include clinically, anatomically and molecularly distinct subtypes that stratify into diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), such as H3K27M-altered diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and hemispheric HGGs, such as IDH wild-type glioblastoma. Neuronal activity drives glioma progression through paracrine signalling1,2 and neuron-to-glioma synapses3,4,5,6. Glutamatergic AMPA receptor-dependent synapses between neurons and glioma cells have been demonstrated in paediatric3 and adult4 high-grade gliomas, and early work has suggested heterogeneous glioma GABAergic responses7. However, neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by neurotransmitters other than glutamate remain understudied. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, in vivo optogenetics and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models, we identified functional, tumour-promoting GABAergic neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by GABAA receptors in DMGs. GABAergic input has a depolarizing effect on DMG cells due to NKCC1 chloride transporter function and consequently elevated intracellular chloride concentration in DMG malignant cells. As membrane depolarization increases glioma proliferation3,6, we found that the activity of GABAergic interneurons promotes DMG proliferation in vivo. The benzodiazepine lorazepam enhances GABA-mediated signalling, increases glioma proliferation and growth, and shortens survival in DMG patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models. By contrast, only minimal depolarizing GABAergic currents were found in hemispheric HGGs and lorazepam did not influence the growth rate of hemispheric glioblastoma xenografts. Together, these findings uncover growth-promoting GABAergic synaptic communication between GABAergic neurons and H3K27M-altered DMG cells, underscoring a tumour subtype-specific mechanism of brain cancer neurophysiology.",

Three-unit-cell (3UC) thick La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 pure-phase single-crystal films are grown using the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy) on SrLaAlO4 substrates9.

The transition to zero resistance exhibits characteristics consistent with a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT)-like behavior, with TBKT = 9 K. Meissner diamagnetic effect is observed at TM = 8 K via a mutual inductance setup, in agreement with the BKT-like transition. In-plane and out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exhibit anisotropy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and X-ray reciprocal space mappings (RSMs) reveal that the bilayer nickelate films adopt a tetragonal phase under ~2% coherent epitaxial compressive strain in the NiO2 planes relative to the bulk.

SPO11 is critical for meiosis in most species, but it generates dangerous DSBs with mutagenic 2 and gametocidal 3 potential. Cells must therefore utilize the beneficial functions of SPO11 while minimizing its risks 4 —how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we report reconstitution of DNA cleavage in vitro with purified recombinant mouse SPO11 bound to TOP6BL. SPO11–TOP6BL complexes are monomeric (1:1) in solution and bind tightly to DNA, but dimeric (2:2) assemblies cleave DNA to form covalent 5′ attachments that require SPO11 active-site residues, divalent metal ions and SPO11 dimerization. SPO11 can also reseal DNA that it has nicked. Structure modelling with AlphaFold 3 suggests that DNA is bent prior to cleavage 5 . In vitro cleavage displays a sequence bias that partially explains DSB site preferences in vivo. Cleavage is inefficient on complex DNA substrates, partly because SPO11 is readily trapped in DSB-incompetent (presumably monomeric) binding states that exchange slowly. However, cleavage is improved with substrates that favour dimer assembly or by artificially dimerizing SPO11. Our results inform a model in which intrinsically weak dimerization restrains SPO11 activity in vivo, making it exquisitely dependent on accessory proteins that focus and control DSB formation.",

Here, using Mus musculus SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyses break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5′ broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization for the reconstitution of two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyses DNA cleavage with an activity similar to that of SPO11 alone. However, this complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role after cleavage. We propose a model in which additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11–TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage. Our work establishes SPO11 dimerization as the fundamental mechanism that controls the induction of meiotic DSBs.",

We designed pre-organized ligand-binding pockets in high-quality four-helix backbones for a fluorogenic ligand, and generated a transmembrane span using gradient-guided hallucination. The designer transmembrane proteins specifically activated fluorescence of the target fluorophore with mid-nanomolar affinity, exhibiting higher brightness and quantum yield compared to those of enhanced green fluorescent protein. These proteins were highly active in the membrane fraction of live bacterial and eukaryotic cells following expression. The crystal and cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the designer protein–ligand complexes were very close to the structures of the design models. We showed that the interactions between ligands and transmembrane proteins within the membrane can be accurately designed.

Traditionally, TMDs are epitaxially grown on crystalline substrates by chemical vapour deposition. However, this approach requires post-growth transfer to target substrates, which makes controlling thickness and scalability difficult. Here we introduce a method called hypotaxy (‘hypo’ meaning downward and ‘taxy’ meaning arrangement), which enables wafer-scale single-crystal TMD growth directly on various substrates, including amorphous and lattice-mismatched substrates, while preserving crystalline alignment with an overlying 2D template. By sulfurizing or selenizing a pre-deposited metal film under graphene, aligned TMD nuclei form, coalescing into a single-crystal film as graphene is removed. This method achieves precise MoS2 thickness control from monolayer to hundreds of layers on diverse substrates, producing 4-inch single-crystal MoS2 with high thermal conductivity (about 120 W m−1 K−1) and mobility (around 87 cm2 V−1 s−1). Furthermore, nanopores created in graphene using oxygen plasma treatment allow MoS2 growth at a lower temperature of 400 °C, compatible with back-end-of-line processes. This hypotaxy approach extends to other TMDs, such as MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, offering a solution to substrate limitations in conventional epitaxy and enabling wafer-scale TMDs for monolithic three-dimensional integration.",

Using a point-mutation strategy, we reveal that Mg2+ is essential for the DNA-cleavage activity of this complex in vitro, as confirmed by knock-in mice carrying a point mutation in SPO11 that disrupts its binding to Mg2+, thereby abolishing DSB formation.

In mammals, a single gene encodes six catalytically active domains and a flexibly tethered acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that shuttles intermediates between active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis1. FASN is an essential enzyme in mammalian development through the role that fatty acids have in membrane formation, energy storage, cell signalling and protein modifications. Thus, FASN is a promising target for treatment of a large variety of diseases including cancer, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, and viral and parasite infections2,3. The multi-faceted mechanism of FASN and the dynamic nature of the protein, in particular of the ACP, have made it challenging to understand at the molecular level. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human FASN in a multitude of conformational states with NADPH and NADP+ plus acetoacetyl-CoA present, including structures with the ACP stalled at the dehydratase (DH) and enoyl-reductase (ER) domains. We show that FASN activity in vitro and de novo lipogenesis in cells is inhibited by mutations at the ACP–DH and ACP–ER interfaces. Together, these studies provide new molecular insights into the dynamic nature of FASN and the ACP shuttling mechanism, with implications for developing improved FASN-targeted therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Modular structure and function are ubiquitous in biology, from the organization of animal brains and bodies to the scale of ecosystems. However, the mechanisms of modularity emergence from non-modular precursors remain unclear. Here we introduce the principle of peak selection, a process by which purely local interactions and smooth gradients can drive the self-organization of discrete global modules. The process combines strengths of the positional and Turing pattern-formation mechanisms into a model for morphogenesis. Applied to the grid-cell system of the brain, peak selection results in the self-organization of functionally distinct modules with discretely spaced spatial periods. Applied to ecological systems, it results in discrete multispecies niches and synchronous spawning across geographically distributed coral colonies. The process exhibits self-scaling with system size and ‘topological robustness’1, which renders module emergence and module properties insensitive to most parameters. Peak selection ameliorates the fine-tuning requirement for continuous attractor dynamics in single grid-cell modules and it makes a detail-independent prediction that grid module period ratios should approximate adjacent integer ratios, providing a highly accurate match to the available data. Predictions for grid cells at the transcriptional, connectomic and physiological levels promise to elucidate the interplay of molecules, connectivity and function emergence in brains.",

When we reached the edge of the bluff and saw that big ole mess below, you’d expect a cuss word or two, ’specially this bein’ the fifth flood in less as many years. But he just whistled an’ shook his head.\n\nOver a decade ago now, when I was just a lil’ one, we lived in a small house down on the riverbank. One spring, in the middle o’ the night, them waters came for us, unexpected-like. Paw barely got me an’ sis out alive. Mama didn’t make it. Some folk still rebuild down there, stubborn as ever, but time an’ again, they get washed out an’ hafta clean up the mess or start anew elsewheres.\n\nAnyhoo, the stink o’ wet dirt was real strong in the air. Could smell a bit o’ rot as well. There was dead things down there in the mud an’ silt. Lotsa fine fish that’d be welcome in our nets was lyin’ in the mud with flies buzzin’ ’round ’em.\n\n“Paw,” I says. “Why’s it gotta be like this, anyway? They say on the news this’s ’nother one o’ them ‘hundred year’ floods. But it ain’t been a hundred years since the last one, or the one before!”\n\n“Don’t pay that any mind,” he says, shakin’ his head again. “The droughts, them rains, these floods. Just cyclical, that’s all.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“Well, if that’s true, when’s the cycle gonna end?”\n\n“Only God knows that, boy. Not them people on the news.” I could tell he didn’t wanna talk none more ’bout it, so I stopped with my questions.\n\nHe beckoned me ta follow him down to the bank, so I did. Slow goin’, on account o’ the mud an’ debris an’ such. That brown river, still flowin’ a few inches ’bove the bank, rumbled and roared, carryin’ trees, sticks an’ other bits o’ wood from far upstream. I even saw the puffed-up body of a pig float on by in the white an’ yeller foam of them rapids.\n\nPaw stopped here an’ there to twist his walkin’ stick through the mud, measurin’ the depth o’ the silt that covered the road, which had mostly been spared, by some miracle. But the fishin’ boats were gone, and all that was left o’ the docks were them posts.\n\n“It ain’t right,” I says over the sounds of the river. “Havin’ ta rebuild new docks so frequent. An’ I don’t see our boat nowhere this time.”\n\nPaw just shrugged. “We’ll build a new one.” He put a hand on my shoulder. “Look, boy. We’s fisherfolk. This’s what we do. We keep goin’. Gotta bring food ta table, an’ food ta market. Ain’t no flood’s gonna stop us.” An’ then he kept on walkin’ along the bank, shakin’ his head at the things we was seein’. I had ta wonder how long we could keep goin’ like this, determined or no.\n\nAfter we got back home an’ were eatin’ some lunch with Liz, my sis, I remind Paw that my friend Leon and his family was movin’ away the next day, an’ asked if I could go pay my respects.\n\nHe looks at me an’ nods, then he says, “Go on an’ say goodbye to yer friend.” I got up ta wash my plate and he goes, “We don’t need them rich folk anyway. They just take what they want an’ go. Always the same.”\n\nFisherfolk like me weren’t s’posed ta mix with them types, but me an’ Leon were like brothers. His paw tried ta keep us apart, but Leon wouldn’t have it, an’ he won out in the end. But now he was leavin’, and though it hurt me plenty, I was beginnin’ ta understand why they was goin’ away.\n\nLater on that evenin’, we’re in Leon’s rec room, as they calls it. We’d been havin’ fun, playin’ some card games an’ rememberin’ ole times, but he got all serious-like all’va sudden. He looked me straight in the eyes an’ he says, “This world. It’s dying, you know.”\n\nI didn’t know what ta say to that, so I just go, “Whaddaya mean, dyin’?”\n\n“We’ve ruined it. The situation is even more dire than they say in the media.” He always had an odd way of puttin’ things. Then he goes, “And there’s no going back. It’s only going to get worse.”\n\n“Paw says it’ll get better eventually. That why yer leavin’? It’s really not?”\n\n“It’s really not.”\n\n“Well … What’s gonna happen to me an’ Paw an’ Liz?”\n\nLeon sighed loudly, lookin’ real gloomy. “I asked my father if you all could come with us. Even just you. But he refused.”\n\n“How come?”\n\n“He just said, ‘It’s not the way of things,’ and refused to answer my questions.”\n\nI could feel the heat on my cheeks. “Oh,” I says.\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“How long’s we got, you reckon?”\n\n“There’s no telling, really. Our generation might get on well enough, even the next. But … since no one’s going to stop doing what they’re doing, find another way to do things, well …”\n\n“We’s gonna starve, ain’t we?”\n\nLeon nodded real slow. I could see tears startin’ ta well up in his eyes. “And then war,” he whispered. We sat there quiet-like for a spell as I tried to wrap my head ’round what Leon was sayin’.\n\n“Why’s it gotta be like this, anyway?” I asks him.",

          "title": "China made waves with Deepseek, but its real ambition is AI-driven industrial innovation",
          "authors": "Jacob Dreyer",
          "abstract": "When US technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel’s book Zero to One was published in Chinese in 2015, it struck at an insecurity felt by many in China. Thiel suggested that although the country excelled at scaling and commercializing emerging technologies, it lagged behind the United States in true innovation — creating something entirely original from scratch. Take the iPhone: engineers in Cupertino, California, design them; workers in -Shenzhen, China, build them.\n\nFor more than a decade, Chinese policymakers have aimed to shed this image, embedding the pursuit of innovation into national industrial policies, such as Made in China 2025. And there are some early results to show. For instance, in 2023, the Shenzhen-based technology company Huawei launched the Mate 60 smartphone, which is powered by a domestically produced chip. This was celebrated as a symbolic breakthrough — demonstrating that China could manufacture advanced semiconductors despite stringent US sanctions on crucial tools and high-end design software. And last month’s release of Deepseek-R1, a Chinese large language model developed at a fraction of the cost of its Western counterparts, sent shockwaves through the US tech establishment.\n\nProminent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen described it as “AI’s Sputnik moment” — a reference to the mid-twentieth-century US–Soviet space race that began with the launch of the first satellite, Sputnik, by the Soviet Union. Accessing Deepseek through an application programming interface (API) — a protocol for connecting software applications — is roughly 13 times cheaper than similar models developed by OpenAI, based in San Francisco, California.\n\nThe sudden rise of Deepseek has put the spotlight on China’s wider artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, which operates differently from Silicon Valley. Although consumer-facing applications garner much attention, Chinese AI firms, unlike their US counterparts, are in fact more invested in solving industrial and manufacturing problems at scale. The divergence in priorities reflects the forces driving innovation in each economy: venture capital in the United States and large-scale manufacturing enterprises and organs of the state in China.\n\nTechnology split\n\nAt the root of the difference is China’s comparative advantage in the world economy — manufacturing — along with the government being the largest client for new technologies. The Chinese government aims to develop low-cost, scalable AI applications that can modernize the rapidly developing country.\n\nAt a press conference last September, for example, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian laid out the view of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that tech innovation is a core component of “national development”. To stay in the good books of Beijing, AI research laboratories have responded by building practical applications — to make trains run on time, monitor fish stocks and provide automated telehealth services.\n\nBeijing-based company Zhipu AI has partnered with several local governments and state-owned enterprises to deploy its agent model, which automates tasks such as form-filling and financial-report analysis. Last month, tech behemoth Alibaba, headquartered in Hangzhou, China, reached a deal with the Beijing-based startup 01.AI to set up an ‘industrial large model laboratory’ focused on deploying AI to optimize business and industrial processes.\n\nNvidia is a US company that manufactures chips needed to build AI systems.Credit: Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nAI also has an interesting role in China’s energy transition, from large-scale trials of integrated smart homes to the roll-out of a major investment (equivalent to US$800 billion) for a national smart grid.\n\nThus, Beijing’s goal is not necessarily to attain global leadership in AI chatbots, but to use the underlying technology to develop affordable, commercially viable business solutions. Its applications can then be exported, especially to lower-income countries. In other words, China’s target is not necessarily ‘frontier AI’, but ‘mass-market AI’. Its emerging AI playbook mirrors its approach to other technologies, such as electric vehicles and clean energy: not the first to innovate, but the first to make them affordable for widespread use.\n\nOut of necessity\n\nThe technological ‘stack’, an interconnected set of resources needed to develop advanced AI models, includes hardware, such as semiconductors; cutting-edge learning algorithms optimized for that hardware; and a backend comprising energy-intensive data centres and predictable capital flows.\n\nTo maintain its global lead in AI technology, the United States has periodically imposed export sanctions on key components. On 7 October 2022, the administration of former US president Joe Biden released a set of export controls on advanced computing and semiconductor-manufacturing items, aiming to block China from purchasing high-performance chips from companies such as Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California. Then--national-security-adviser Jake Sullivan called it the “small yard, high fence” strategy: the United States would erect a ‘fence’ around crucial AI technologies, encouraging even companies in allied countries, such as the Netherlands and South Korea, to restrict shipments to China.\n\nChina–US research collaborations are in decline — this is bad news for everyone\n\nMeanwhile, the CCP sees moving up the manufacturing supply chain, particularly into categories such as airplanes and semiconductors, as crucial for sustained economic growth. In that sense, the rivalry adds urgency and intensity to China’s efforts. If the United States owns the technology of the future and is willing to use export controls, then China runs the risk of economic stagnation — and the political turbulence that might accompany it. The battle for supremacy over AI is part of this larger geopolitical matrix.\n\nAnd China has been preparing for this scenario for a while. In 2019, the US added Huawei to its entity list, a trade-restriction list published by the Department of Commerce. This spurred China to rethink how to become less vulnerable to US export controls. The Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE) created a set of integrated research platforms (IRPs), a major institutional overhaul to help the country to catch up in key areas, including robotics, driverless cars and AI, that are vulnerable to US sanctions or export controls. There are now 30 IRPs.\n\nTake the IRP for new-generation integrated circuit technology at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, for instance — the sort of state-driven research enterprise that could drive breakthroughs. The 2022 export restrictions targeted chips with ‘nodes’ — the smallest component on a semiconductor — of 14 nanometres or less. Chips with smaller nodes can pack more transistors into the same area, potentially improving performance and efficiency. In 2021, the Fudan IRP was ahead of the curve, and already recruiting for roles to support research on even smaller nodes, of 3–4 nanometres. These high-performance chips now fuel the AI tech stack. To address manufacturing bottlenecks, the third round of China’s ‘Big Fund’ — a state-backed investment initiative to pool in resources from -public enterprises and local governments — was announced last year, with a planned US$47 billion investment in its semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nThis shows that China is serious about indigenizing AI capabilities by investing significant institutional, academic and scientific resources. By restricting access to chips, US policy has forced China to explore workarounds and unconventional methods. Many of these endeavours might fail. But it doesn’t take many successes to make a global impact.\n\nThe IRPs have emerged as ideal platforms to train a cadre of engineers, filling a talent gap that existed even a decade ago. The Deepseek success story is, in part, a reflection of this years-long investment.",

          "title": "What are the best AI tools for research? Nature’s guide",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Credit: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty\n\nA new and seemingly more impressive artificial intelligence (AI) tool is released almost weekly, and researchers are flocking to try them out. Whether they are looking to edit manuscripts, write code or generate hypotheses, researchers have more generative AI tools to choose from than ever before.\n\nEach large language model (LLM) is suited to different tasks. Some are available through free chatbots, whereas others use a paid-for application programming interface (API) that means they can be integrated with other software. A few can also be downloaded, allowing researchers to build their own custom models.\n\nAlthough LLMs produce human-like responses, they all remain too error-prone to be used on their own, says Carrie Wright, a data scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, headquartered in Seattle, Washington.\n\nSo which LLM is best for what task? Here, researchers share their current favourites with Nature to help guide those in need.\n\no3-mini (the reasoner)\n\nOpenAI, based in San Francisco, California, introduced the world to LLMs in 2022 with its free-to-use ChatGPT bot. Scientists have mainly used the bot to look up information or as a writing assistant, for example to draft abstracts, but newer models are broadening the technology’s potential uses. Last September, in the firm’s most significant advance since then, OpenAI wowed scientists with its o1 ‘reasoning model’, which it followed with the more advanced o3 in December. Both reasoning models work more slowly than an LLM alone does, because they have been trained to answer queries in a step-by-step way. This ‘chain of thought’ process, aimed at simulating human reasoning, has helped them to smash tough benchmarks in science and mathematics. It has also made them good at technical tasks, such as solving coding issues and reformatting data.\n\nAfter the little-known Chinese start-up DeepSeek in Hangzhou launched a rival reasoner on 20 January, OpenAI responded with a range of new tools. These include a speedy o3-mini — a reasoner that is free for registered chatbot users — and ‘deep research’, which allows some paying subscribers to create reports that synthesize information, with citations, from hundreds of websites, akin to carrying out a literature review. The models excel when used in combination, says Andrew White, a chemist and AI expert at FutureHouse, a start-up in San Francisco.\n\nWhen it comes to tasks such as picking apart unfamiliar concepts in a new mathematical proof, o3-mini does a “really good job”, says Simon Frieder, a mathematician and AI researcher at the University of Oxford, UK. But even the best models “are still not even close to rivalling a mathematician”, he says.\n\nDeepSeek (the all-rounder)\n\nDeepSeek-R1, launched last month, has abilities on a par with o1’s, but is available through an API at a fraction of the cost. It also stands apart from OpenAI’s models because it is open weight, meaning that although its training data have not been released, anyone can download the underlying model and tailor it to their specific research project. R1 has “just unlocked a new paradigm” in which communities, particularly those with relatively few resources, can build specialized reasoning models, says White.\n\nRunning the full model requires access to powerful computing chips, which many academics lack. But researchers such as Benyou Wang, a computer scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, are creating versions that can run or train on a single machine. Like o1, DeepSeek-R1’s forte is maths problems and writing code. But it is also good at tasks such as generating hypotheses, says White. This is because DeepSeek has opted to publish the model’s ‘thought processes’ in full, which allows researchers to better refine their follow-up questions and ultimately improve its outputs, he says. Such transparency could also be hugely powerful for medical diagnostics. Wang is adapting R1 in experiments that use the model’s reasoning-like powers to build “a clear and logical pathway from patient assessment to diagnosis and treatment recommendation”, he says.\n\nDeepSeek-R1 has some cons. The model seems to have a particularly long ‘thought’ process, which slows it down and makes it less useful for looking up information or brainstorming. Concerns about the security of data input into its API and chatbot have led several governments to ban workers at national agencies from using the chatbot. DeepSeek also seems to have taken fewer measures to mitigate its models generating harmful outputs than have its commercial competitors. Adding filters to prevent such outputs — instructions to make weapons, for instance — takes time and effort. Although it is unlikely that this was done on purpose, “the lack of guard rails is worrisome”, says Simon.\n\nOpenAI has also suggested that DeepSeek may have “inappropriately distilled” its models, referring to a method for training a model on another algorithm’s outputs, which OpenAI’s conditions of use prohibit.\n\nDeepSeek could not be reached for comment on these criticisms before this article was published.\n\nSome researchers see such distillation as commonplace and are happy to use R1, but others are wary of using a tool that could be subject to future litigation. There’s a chance that scientists using R1 could be forced to retract papers, if using the model was considered a violation of the journal's ethical standards, says Ana Catarina De Alencar, a lawyer at EIT Manufacturing in Paris who specializes in AI law. A similar situation could apply to the use of models by OpenAI and other firms accused of intellectual-property violations, says De Alencar. News organizations claim that the firms used journalistic content to train their models without permission.\n\nLlama (the workhorse)\n\nLlama has long been a go-to LLM for the research community. A family of open-weight models first released by Meta AI in Menlo Park, California, in 2023, versions of Llama have been downloaded more than 600 million times through the open-science platform Hugging Face alone. The fact it can be downloaded and built on is “probably why Llama has been embraced by the research community”, says Elizabeth Humphries, a data scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.\n\nBeing able to run an LLM on personal or institutional servers is essential when working with proprietary or protected data, to avoid sensitive information being fed back to other users or to the developers, says Wright.\n\nResearchers have built on Llama’s models to make LLMs that predict materials’ crystal structure, as well as to simulate the outputs of a quantum computer. Tianlong Chen, a machine-learning scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says Llama was a good fit for simulating a quantum computer because it was relatively easy to adapt it to understand specialized quantum language.\n\nBut Llama requires users to request permission to access it, which is minor point of friction for some, says White. As a result, other open models such as OLMo, developed by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, or Qwen, built by the Chinese firm Alibaba Cloud, based in Hangzhou, are now often the first choice in research, he adds. DeepSeek’s efficient underlying V3 model is also a rival base for building scientific models.\n\nClaude (the coder)",

          "abstract": "Microsoft has unveiled its Majorana 1 quantum chip.Credit: John Brecher for Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has announced that it has created the first ‘topological qubits’ — a way of storing quantum information that the firm hopes will underpin a new generation of quantum computers. Machines based on topology are expected to be easier to build at scale than competing technologies, because they should better protect the information from noise. But some researchers are sceptical of the company’s claims.\n\nThe announcement came in a 19 February press release containing few technical details — but Microsoft says it has disclosed some of its data to selected specialists in a meeting at its research centre in Santa Barbara, California. “Would I bet my life that they’re seeing what they think they’re seeing? No, but it looks pretty good,” says Steven Simon, a theoretical physicist at the University of Oxford, UK, who was briefed on the results.\n\nAt the same time, the company published intermediate results — but not the proof of the existence of topological qubits — on 19 February in Nature1.\n\nSuperconducting wire\n\nTopological states are collective states of the electrons in a material that are resistant to noise, much like how two links in a chain can be shifted or rotated around each other while remaining connected.\n\nThe Nature paper describes experiments on a superconducting ‘nanowire’ device made of indium arsenide. The ultimate goal is to host two topological states called Majorana quasiparticles, one at each end of the device. Because electrons in a superconductor are paired, an extra, unpaired electron will be introduced, forming an excited state. This electron exists in a ‘delocalized’ state, which is shared between the two Majorana quasiparticles.\n\nEvidence of elusive Majorana particle dies — but computing hope lives on\n\nThe paper reports measurements suggesting that the nanowire does indeed harbour an extra electron. These tests “do not, by themselves” guarantee that the nanowire hosts two Majorana quasiparticles, the authors warn.\n\nAccording to the press release, the team has carried out follow-up experiments in which they paired two nanowires and put them in a superposition of two states — one with the extra electron in the first nanowire, and the other with the electron in the second nanowire. “We’ve built a qubit and shown that you can not only measure parity in two parallel wires, but a measurement that bridges the two wires,” says Microsoft researcher Chetan Nayak.\n\n“There’s no slam dunk to know immediately from the experiment” that the qubits are made of topological states, says Simon. (A claim of having created Majorana states, made by a Microsoft-funded team based in Delft, the Netherlands, was retracted in 2021.) The ultimate proof will come if the devices perform as expected once they are scaled up, he adds.",

          "authors": "Linsey C. Marr",
          "abstract": "Air-Borne: The Hidden History of the Life We Breathe Carl Zimmer Dutton (2025)\n\nIn the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, one of the most pressing questions for researchers was how the SARS-CoV-2 virus was transmitted. Some physicians and public-health specialists argued that the virus spread solely in wet droplets from coughing. Others — backed by aerosol scientists — thought that it also spread through the air.\n\nIn Air-borne, acclaimed science writer Carl Zimmer examines why it took more than a year of vociferous debate to establish that the second theory was correct. His book is an enthralling historical exploration of the role of airborne microorganisms in disease, and examines why these pathogens have been overlooked for centuries.\n\nVaccine specialist Peter Hotez: scientists are ‘under attack for someone else’s political gain’\n\nThe beginning of ‘aerobiology’, as -Zimmer labels it, had its roots in ancient Greece. -Hippocrates, a physician and philosopher, was the first to propose that a miasma — “an invisible corruption of the air” — caused disease. The concept endured: from the fourteenth century onwards, miasmas were often wrongly blamed for plague outbreaks that devastated cites across the world. Now, we know that the disease was caused by a bacterium carried by fleas that live on rodents.\n\nA long history\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Italian physician -Girolamo Fracastoro wrote a book about tiny, invisible ‘seeds’ that could multiply in a host and spread through the air. Proponents of his theory, known as contagionists, would lock horns with miasmatists — who maintained that the air itself was the cause of disease — for the next 300 years. It wasn’t until the late 1800s — after physician Robert Koch proved that anthrax was caused by bacteria — that the idea that microbes cause infectious diseases became accepted and miasma theory was rejected.\n\nIn the 1930s, scientists began seriously considering the idea that microbes can spread disease through the air. Mildred Wells was an insightful, rigorous researcher who found that poliovirus was airborne. Her husband William — inspired by his wife’s work — pivoted from studying waterborne to airborne pathogens, and made the revolutionary discovery that bacteria released in sneezes could linger in the air of a classroom after the students had left.\n\nDr Semmelweis review: Mark Rylance play shows how hand washing saved hundreds of lives\n\nIn their landmark theory of airborne disease transmission, they proposed that diseases not only are spread through the droplets that are dispelled by coughs and sneezes and fall quickly to the ground, but also can be transmitted in microdroplets, now known as aerosol particles. These tiny particles, they argued, are released with every exhalation, settle very slowly and drift long distances.\n\nMildred went on to show that disinfecting air in schools with ultraviolet light reduced cold and flu incidence. William, meanwhile, found that hospitalized people with tuberculosis could infect guinea pigs through bacteria in aerosol particles — much to the annoyance of hospital staff, who for years had to run extra tuberculosis tests and autopsy dozens of guinea pigs. Unfortunately, the duo’s work was largely dismissed — perhaps owing to concern about reviving the discredited miasma theory and their “cantankerous and wearying” personalities.\n\nReading Air-borne, I felt frustrated by how long it took for researchers to accept that pathogens could spread through the air. Zimmer synthesizes research from various fields in a way that makes airborne transmission seem obvious, illustrating how scientific siloing inhibits progress. For example, plant pathologists knew from the early 1900s that the fungus that causes rust on wheat could spread to farms hundreds of kilometres away. Yet physicians — focused on the idea that -diseases spread through contact with infected people or contaminated objects — vehemently rejected the idea of airborne transmission indoors, even as late as the 1950s.",

Now they’re upending the world of video games, too.\n\nIn a study published in Nature on 19 February, a team of researchers reveals a generative AI engine that can create coherent, immersive video-game worlds that respond to player inputs1.\n\n“I knew that this could be done, but it's still impressive,” says Julian Togelius, a researcher at New York University specializing in AI in video games.\n\nLast year, researchers at Google showed that an AI engine could simulate the 1990s video game DOOM. But the ability for generative AI tools to generate fresh ideas in complex worlds has been limited. When a team led by Microsoft game-intelligence researcher Katja Hoffman interviewed game developers to find out what they wanted in AI tools, they suggested engines that can generate gameplay sequences that remain consistent with the rules and physics of the game. They also wanted the ability to tweak outputs throughout development.\n\nThe team built and trained WHAM, a generative AI system focusing on these capabilities. The researchers took the online multiplayer game Bleeding Edge, developed by a Microsoft-owned studio named Ninja Theory, and extracted video frames and controller inputs from 500,000 anonymized game sessions, which equated to more than seven years of continuous play. They trained the engine on one-second slices of gameplay involving up to 1.6 billion parameters.\n\nThe team showed that WHAM could perform well in three crucial areas. It could act within the rules of the original game (consistency) and generate a range of gameplay slices (diversity), with anything that was added to the world by the user remaining there (persistency). Together, these features demonstrate WHAM’s potential for creative ideation, the authors say.\n\nPlausible gameplay\n\nFinally, they built a concept prototype, the WHAM Demonstrator, which provides an interface for users to prompt the AI engine. In one example, the researchers showed that they could feed a single promotional image for Bleeding Edge into the Demonstrator and it would generate plausible gameplay and controller inputs. They also added a function that allows developers to drag and drop imagery into the Demonstrator, which the AI engine then incorporates directly into the generated game world. Togelius says this is the most impressive thing to emerge from the paper.",

The gene is usually switched on only in the brain where the NOVA1 protein controls the expression of dozens of other brain-active genes.\n\nDarnell thought that NOVA1 might be involved in speech when, as a neurologist, he treated a boy with language and movement problems, who had one working copy of the gene2. Another team had found that nearly all humans have a version of NOVA1 that is distinct from Neanderthals and another extinct human group called Denisovans (as well as other mammals, including mice)3.\n\nChirp change\n\nThe genetic change — which swaps an isoleucine amino acid for a valine in the encoded protein — was one of just a handful of protein-altering changes that evolved in the more than 500,000 years after the hominin groups split from a common ancestor in Africa. This suggests that the changes benefited early humans so greatly that the mutations became ubiquitous.\n\nTo study the effects of the change a neuroscientist in Darnell’s group Yoko Tajima used CRISPR gene editing to engineer mice carrying the human version of NOVA1.\n\nExhaustive analysis identified only subtle differences between the ‘humanized’ mice and normal rodents: when newborn mice were isolated from their mothers, pups with the human version of NOVA1 had altered distress calls. Similarly, in the presence of a female mouse in heat, male mice carrying the change made more complex courtship calls.\n\nIn the mouse brains, the human version of NOVA1 affected a molecular process, called alternative splicing, in which coding sequences of other individual genes are mixed and matched to create diverse proteins. Some of the ‘alternatively spliced’ genes have been implicated in vocal behaviour. The results were published1 on 18 February in Nature Communications.\n\nLanguage contribution",

          "abstract": "PostdocNet represents several thousand postdocs at the Max Planck institutes and provides opportunities for professional development and community building.Credit: Swen Pfoertner/Alamy\n\nA year into my first postdoc, at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, Germany, I saw a call to join the steering group of the research institute’s PostdocNet as its financial officer. PostdocNet represents the 3,000 postdocs across Germany and a few other countries working at the Max Planck institutes, advocating for better working conditions and career development. I thought managing a budget would be a useful skill for future applications to become a research group leader. I submitted a 3-minute pitch explaining why I wanted the role, and I won the nomination.\n\nI enjoyed my 12-month term so much that I continued in the steering group as a spokesperson. In this one-year role, I represented and managed PostdocNet and headed our steering group, which aims to maximize opportunities for mentorship and academic exchange and build community among postdocs. In practice, we organized interdisciplinary meetings and discussions and represented all postdocs to the Max Planck institutes and external parties, including the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research. I was responsible for communication in the network and with external parties, including the society’s president and contacts in science, industry and politics.\n\nStress rewarded\n\nI spent about 10 hours each week fulfilling this demanding role — a mini-job alongside my postdoctoral research responsibilities, often spilling into evenings and weekends. The role could be taxing; sometimes, the stress led to sleepless nights.\n\nBut the work fulfilled me in ways my research could not. I saw the value and necessity of networks that advocate for postdocs. I wanted to pave the way for future postdocs to have better opportunities. Moreover, I could identify concrete problems, develop solutions and see the immediate impact of our efforts.\n\nThanks to this role, my confidence and professionalism have grown, and I’ve improved my communication skills. Tasks that once took hours, such as drafting official e-mails, now come easily. The connections I have made have expanded my professional network far beyond my research field. I learnt how to manage a diverse, international team, navigate conflict and lead meetings inclusively.\n\nUltimately, the extra work was worth it not just for the professional skills that I gained, but also for the personal growth that I experienced — which I will carry with me throughout my career. I have now been appointed by the Max Planck president to serve on the advisory board of the Planck Academy, which offers professional-development opportunities for specific groups of Max Planck employees. This is a service role usually given to those at mid- to senior-career stages.\n\nI am also applying for junior professorships and research-group-leader positions, and I think my PostdocNet roles made a difference in my interviews. One committee member asked me to share more about my work there. In another interview, I drew on my experiences to answer a question about how I would manage conflict in a research group. These experiences taught me that it was not enough to simply list this service role on my CV. I needed to clearly and concretely outline my responsibilities and skills to help interview committees to better understand my achievements.\n\nOvercoming the challenges of running a network\n\nOver the past year, I saw at first hand the struggles of running a successful postdoc network and taking part in academic service relatively early in my career. Here are the four biggest challenges I encountered, and how I addressed them:\n\n1. Institutional memory. Given the high turnover rate of postdocs, steering groups often consist entirely of new members each year. This year, we were fortunate that both the deputy spokesperson and I had served on the steering group previously, which helped to preserve institutional memory, or the collective knowledge and experiences of a group of people. To support the incoming steering group, we wrote a guide on standard operating procedures for the spokesperson role, made e-mail introductions to all our contacts and included the spokesperson-elect in our end-of-term meetings. I documented all activities, meetings and decisions in a comprehensive report for the new steering group. I also made myself available for any questions or enquiries, even after my term ended.\n\n2. Recruitment and participation. Many postdocs are on short-term contracts, and finding their next position is a top priority. Others might be starting families. Very few have extra time to dedicate to an academic network. Offering clear, specific tasks — along with an estimated time commitment — was the most effective way to encourage participation. For example, I estimated that it takes one hour a week to manage social-media posts, and a similar time commitment to organize a scientific talk. Specific and manageable requests yielded better engagement than did vague calls for help.\n\n3. Mentorship. Although I had experience in the steering group, the spokesperson role brought new challenges. To navigate these, I sought a mentor: I reached out to someone experienced in the society who was no longer actively involved, and they provided valuable guidance on pressing issues. Finding a mentor is often just a matter of asking — you’d be surprised by how willing experienced scholars and representatives are to help.",

The child’s mother took the gene-targeting drug during late pregnancy, and the child continues to take it.\n\nThe “baby has been effectively treated, with no manifestations of the condition,” says Michelle Farrar, a paediatric neurologist at UNSW Sydney in Australia. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine yesterday.\n\nThe child was conceived with a genetic condition known as spinal muscular atrophy, which affects motor neurons that control movement, and leads to progressive muscle weakening. About one in every 10,000 births have some form of the condition — making it a leading genetic cause of death in infants and children.\n\nIn its most severe form, as in the case of this child, individuals lack both copies of the SMN1 gene, and have only one or two copies of a neighbouring gene, SMN2, that partially compensates for that deficiency. As a result, the body does not produce enough of the protein required for maintaining motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. This protein is most important in the second and third trimesters, and the first few months of life. Babies with severe disease don’t usually live past their third birthday.\n\nIn the past decade, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three drugs to treat newborns for spinal muscular atrophy. The oral drug used in this study, called Risdiplam, manufactured by biotech firm Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, is a small molecule that works by modifying expression of the SMN2 gene so that it produces more SMN protein.\n\nUp until now, treatments for spinal muscular atrophy were given after birth. But up to half of newborns lacking both copies of the SMN1 gene and with only two copies of the SMN2 gene are born with some symptoms. “There was still room for improvement,” says Richard Finkel, a clinical neuroscientist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, who led the study.\n\nParent proposal\n\nThe idea of giving the drug in utero came from the parents, says Finkel. “They had already experienced a loss from this horrible disease,” he says, and wanted to know whether there were treatment options they could start before birth. The FDA approved the study for this one individual.\n\nThe mother, who was 32 weeks pregnant, took Risdiplam daily for six weeks. The baby started taking the drug from roughly one week old, and will probably continue to take it for the rest of her life.",

          "abstract": "Donald Trump took office as US president for the second time one month ago.Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty\n\nIn the wake of the Second World War, US leaders adopted the view that scientific progress is an “essential key to our security as a nation, to our better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to our cultural progress”. And for the next eight decades, government officials on both sides of the political aisle agreed to invest in US science. Just one month into the second administration of Republican President Donald Trump, scientists fear that that long-time consensus is disintegrating.\n\nAre the Trump team’s actions affecting your research? How to contact Nature\n\nActing with unprecedented speed, the administration has laid off thousands of employees at US science agencies and announced reforms to research-grant standards that could drastically reduce federal financial support for science. The cuts form part of a larger effort to radically reduce the government’s spending and downsize its workforce.\n\nAlthough US courts have intervened in some cases, Republicans in both chambers of the US Congress — which largely blocked Trump’s efforts to cut science funding during his first term as president from 2017 to 2021 — have mostly fallen in line with the agenda for Trump 2.0. For many researchers, this first month signals a realignment of priorities that could affect science and society for decades to come.\n\nThese actions are all “unprecedented”, says Harold Varmus, a former director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) who is now a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. “No one has ever seen a [presidential] transition in which one of the most valuable parts of our government enterprise is being taken apart.”\n\nThe Trump White House did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nHere, Nature unpacks the Trump team’s blazing-fast actions on science so far (scroll to bottom to see timeline ‘Science impacts: one month of Trump 2.0’) and talks to policy watchers about what’s next.\n\nFast and furious\n\nThe overhaul of US science kicked off within hours of Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, when he signed dozens of executive orders, which are presidential directives on how the government should operate inside existing laws.\n\nSome of those orders had been anticipated, including pulling the United States out of the 2015 Paris agreement to rein in global climate emissions and terminating the nation’s membership in the World Health Organization. Others had surprising and immediate ripple effects through the scientific community.\n\nOne order erroneously attempted to define only two biological sexes, male and female, and banned federal actions “that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology”. Biomedical-research agencies such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) scrambled to respond by, among other things, taking down data sets from their websites and pulling back manuscript submissions from scientific journals to purge terms including ‘gender’ and ‘transgender’.\n\nResearchers, clinicians and others protest the Trump administration’s actions outside the US Department of Health and Human Services in Washington DC on 19 February.Credit: Matthew Rodier/Sipa US/Alamy\n\nAnother executive order banned what Trump called “illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI)”. Any federal employee who did not report colleagues defying the DEI orders would face “adverse consequences”, according to an e-mail sent to government workers. To many scientists’ dismay, agencies began terminating DEI programmes, including environmental-justice efforts, which are programmes aimed at protecting low-income communities vulnerable to pollution and climate change. Even some scientific societies and private research organizations scrubbed DEI mentions from their websites. In one of Trump’s orders, he called for the investigation of foundations, non-profit organizations and other private entities not in compliance.\n\nOn 27 January, just one week into the new administration, Trump’s budget office froze all federal grants and loans, saying that it needed to review government spending to ensure that it aligned with the executive orders. Chaos erupted as agencies, including the NIH and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) — both major funders of basic science — halted grant payments, cancelled review panels for research-grant funding and paused communications. A federal judge temporarily blocked the order, but disruptions and confusion continue.\n\nPrincipal investigators who lead research teams are suffering in this environment, says a university scientist who requested anonymity because their research is funded by multiple US agencies. “Everything is on you to manage your grants and your team,” they say, adding that “there’s a lot of fear of people not wanting to say or do the wrong thing” and therefore lose financial support for their work. “It’s completely chaotic; I’m losing sleep.”\n\nSlash and burn\n\nTrump’s unprecedented directives landed as his partnership with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has flourished. The pair are working together to slash federal spending and dismantle agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, which funds global disease research, prevention and care.\n\nTo accomplish this goal, the Trump administration — working through the US Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk reportedly advises — has moved quickly to demoralize and gut the federal workforce, including about 280,000 scientists and engineers. Initially, a 30 January e-mail offer to all federal employees asked them to “move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector”; around 75,000 employees subsequently resigned, on the promise that they would retain their salary through September. And last week, layoffs began for probationary employees across the US government — those usually hired into their positions within the past two years, meaning that early-career researchers were particularly affected.\n\nTrump has partnered with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk (left) to downsize the US government.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\n“I can’t even convey how haphazard and cruel the layoffs are,” says an NIH researcher who lost members of their laboratory to the job cuts and requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak with the press. E-mails notifying workers that they were being let go reportedly gave a blanket reason of poor performance for the termination — even to those whose performance was rated ‘exceptional’ by their supervisors. “They took some of the best and brightest people who just joined the government and laid them off,” the researcher says.",

          "title": "Money and murder: the dark side of the Asilomar meeting on recombinant DNA",
          "authors": "Matthew Cobb",
          "abstract": "On 24 February 1975, some 150 people met at the Asilomar Conference Grounds near Monterey on the Californian coast. They were mostly scientists from the United States, together with representatives of various companies and government agencies, and 16 journalists. Their subject was the new technology of recombinant DNA — molecules created in a laboratory by stitching together genetic material from different organisms. Researchers were excited by the possibilities for discoveries, and the potential of the technique to produce drugs, for example using specially engineered bacteria to make insulin. But they were also terrified that they might inadvertently create diseases that could infect lab workers and the wider community.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, its participants had agreed to adopt biosafety protocols that are still in force in the United States, and which have hugely influenced similar regulations worldwide. The meeting has become known simply as Asilomar, a byword for how a scientific community came together to forge consensus on a thorny topic. It is often held up as an example of how science can self-regulate without the involvement of politicians (although some criticize it for just those same reasons). Periodic calls can be heard for ‘another Asilomar’ in other potentially hazardous fields such as synthetic biology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence.\n\nBut grasping the full significance of a historic event often involves understanding what was not discussed and highlighting the decisions that were not taken. Half a century on from Asilomar, that longer view provides a different perspective on two unspoken, yet essential, issues that loomed in the background of the meeting — the technology’s potential for creating riches and for destroying human life.\n\nAsilomar 1975: DNA modification secured\n\nDebates about the possible hazards of recombinant DNA first came to the fore in June 1971. Robert Pollack, a postdoctoral researcher at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, New York, learnt from Janet Mertz, a PhD student on a course he was teaching, that her supervisor wanted her to transfer DNA from simian virus 40 (SV40) into the gut bacterium Escherichia coli. SV40 could cause uncontrolled growth in hamster cells, and it was feared it might cause cancer in humans.\n\nMertz’s supervisor was Paul Berg at Stanford University in California, a leading molecular biologist in his mid-40s. Pollack, more than ten years Berg’s junior, had never met him but was deeply alarmed at the idea, and so telephoned him the next day to ask why he was planning to do such a “crazy” experiment. The conversation did not last long; according to Pollack, Berg responded, “Who the bleep are you?”.\n\nBerg later recalled that he thought the concerns were “bunk” and “outrageous”. But this exchange and subsequent conversations with friends, colleagues and students kindled doubts in his mind. The experiment he had given to Mertz was not central to his research project, and faced with opposition and the slight possibility that the experiment might go awry, he abandoned this part of it.\n\nBerg’s creation of the first recombinant DNA the following year — inserting a DNA segment from E. coli into SV40 — did not cause outrage. Indeed, it helped him to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980. But the subsequent discovery1 of the powerful method of plasmid-based gene cloning by a team including Stanley Cohen at Stanford University and Herb Boyer at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), did lead to great alarm. By allowing researchers to move any piece of DNA into a bacterium where its function could be studied, this technique “made it possible for anybody to do anything”, as Berg put it later. When Boyer presented the technique at a conference in June 1973, participants raised their concerns with the meeting’s organizers, who published a letter2 in Science warning that the creation of “new kinds of hybrid plasmids or viruses, with biological activity of unpredictable nature … may prove hazardous to laboratory workers and to the public”.\n\nThe US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) tasked Berg with convening a working group to address these concerns. In July 1974, Berg, Boyer, Cohen and eight others — including James Watson, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA — wrote an open letter3 calling on scientists to defer all such experiments “until the potential hazards of such recombinant DNA molecules have been better evaluated or until adequate methods are developed for preventing their spread”. They also announced a meeting to be held in early 1975 to discuss the matter. For perhaps the first time in history, scientists had publicly decided to stop doing an experiment until it was safe. This soon became known as a moratorium — a word adopted from opposition to atomic-weapons testing.\n\nThis was the backdrop to the Asilomar meeting, organized by Berg under the auspices of the NAS. Its main aim was to agree biosafety protocols that could be adopted by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a condition of funding, without fractious lawmakers getting involved. Researchers from Europe were culturally less hostile to the prospect of legislation. In many countries outside the United States, laws using protocols very similar to those adopted at Asilomar eventually governed recombinant DNA research.\n\nThe lure of lucre\n\nIn early 1975, Berg learnt to his horror that administrators at Stanford and UCSF had applied for a patent on the Cohen–Boyer cloning technique4. If all went well, both universities — as well as Cohen and Boyer — stood to become very rich. Berg was keen to see the moratorium lifted to enable research to continue. He disagreed with the Cohen–Boyer patent, but immediately understood that, were the patent application to become widely known, the Asilomar meeting would be fatally compromised. It would look as if the researchers wanted to lift the moratorium so that they could make money. Caught in a bind, Berg had no alternative but to press on in the hope that no one would leak the story.\n\nThis was more problematic than it might seem. There were curious reporters at Asilomar, including Michael Rogers, a writer for Rolling Stone, a US counter-cultural music magazine. In an article5 about the meeting, Rogers described the possibility of producing insulin in a recombinant microorganism, adding drily, “The prospect is sufficiently realistic that the conference includes representatives from the research arms of drug manufacturers Merck, Roche, G. D. Searle — and even General Electric.” However, despite the twitching of Rogers’ journalistic antennae, there was no revelation of the patent at Asilomar or in the immediate aftermath.\n\nChildren at a military barracks in Kineshma, Russia, simulate a biochemical attack in 1999.Credit: Oleg Nikishin/Hulton Archive/Getty\n\nThe Asilomar recommendations were accepted by the NIH in 1976. These involved increasingly strict biosafety measures with increasing levels of perceived hazard. They were later summarized by Gwladys Caspar, a biosafety officer at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as: level 1 — don’t eat it; level 2 — don’t touch it; level 3 — don’t breathe it; level 4 — don’t do it.\n\nAt the end of 1977, researchers working with a tiny start-up company co-founded by Boyer, named Genentech, produced a human growth hormone in a microbe6 and then repeated the trick with insulin7. Debate began to focus not on the morality of patenting processes that had been developed with public money, but instead on who was going to get rich. The US Patent Office eventually accepted the Stanford–UCSF application in early December 1980, following a landmark US Supreme Court ruling, Diamond v. Chakrabarty. Less than two weeks after the patent was finally granted, the Bayh–Dole Act was signed into law, which encouraged recipients of federal funding to take out patents on discoveries and to license them.\n\nThis all led to an explosion of venture-capital-funded biotechnology. The excitement soon infected Nature, which created the “Nature guide to bio-riches”, an index of US biotechnology stocks that was published in the journal each month. Taking Boyer and Cohen’s patent alone, during its lifetime (17 years in the United States, 20 in Europe) more than 2,000 products were developed using the technique, generating billions in sales. The total revenue was around $255 million; each university received $90 million, with Boyer and Cohen sharing the rest8.\n\nThe intrusion of vast potential wealth also had a profound effect on relations between scientists. Competition became even greater, with inevitable conflicts of interest (although as late as 1997, a Nature editorial9 dismissed such concerns). Scientists stopped speaking openly about their research, as Berg complained a few years later: “No longer do you have this free flow of ideas. You go to scientific meetings and people whisper to each other about their companies’ products. It’s like a secret society.” Had the underlying conflict of interest of some of those debating at Asilomar been revealed in 1975, the meeting’s decisions would surely have been the focus of greater political opposition.\n\nHidden menace\n\nAt the opening session of Asilomar, biologist David Baltimore at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, speaking for the organizing committee, ruled that there would be no discussion of the danger of recombinant DNA being used to create bioweapons, for example by introducing toxin genes into highly infectious bacteria. As he explained, although the issue of bioweapons was a very serious one “which many of us care about and have cared about for a long time”, the meeting was “not designed to deal with that question”, which was “peripheral” and might “confuse” the discussion.\n\nMany people felt that the menace of biological warfare had been hugely reduced by the 1972 United Nations Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). This entered into force a month after Asilomar, following ratification by the Soviet Union, the United States and 20 other countries. The BWC was partly prompted by then US president Richard Nixon’s unexpected and unilateral cancellation in 1969 of the US biological warfare programme, which used natural microbial pathogens and had been developed during the Second World War. All US bioweapon stockpiles were declared destroyed.\n\nHowever, the microbiologist and anti-bioweapons campaigner Richard Novick, together with colleagues working on plasmids, wanted the final Asilomar declaration to include a clear statement on the threat of recombinant DNA bioweapons10. The hectic last session of the conference saw Berg and Baltimore invoking the right of academic enquiry as they rejected any declaration that some dangerous experiments should never be carried out. Berg’s compromise formulation, adopted by the meeting — “there is a class of experiments that should not be done at all irrespective of the type of containment available today” — left it open whether such experiments would be permissible in the future.\n\nThe February 1975 meeting at the Asilomar resort in California lifted a moratorium on a controversial strand of DNA research.Credit: John D. Ivanko/Alamy\n\nUnknown to almost everyone at Asilomar, exactly this kind of work was being proposed in the Soviet Union. In April 1974, the federation had launched a top-secret biological-warfare programme, overseen by an agency called Biopreparat, that would use recombinant DNA alongside existing bioweapons such as anthrax and plague11. The Soviet delegation to Asilomar included three men who were deeply involved with Biopreparat: at the time of its launch, Alexander Baev and Andrej Mirzabekov were members of the military–scientific body that oversaw the recombinant DNA bioweapons project, and Vladimir Engelhardt, who at 80 years old was the senior Soviet delegate, was director of the Moscow-based Institute of Molecular Biology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, one of the main contractors for this research.\n\nThese cultured and knowledgeable men had excellent scientific reputations and were close friends of many Western molecular biologists. Their involvement in the bioweapons project was a consequence of the terrible situation in Soviet genetics. From the 1930s to the mid-1950s, the Soviet regime had been virulently hostile to genetics, driven by the ideas and ambition of the agronomist Trofim Lysenko, a favourite of the country’s then-leader Josef Stalin. Even though Lysenko’s influence eventually waned in the 1960s, Soviet genetics was in a parlous state. This led Soviet molecular biologists to agree to create bioweapons in return for a huge increase in funding.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to have been the slightest suspicion among the Western scientists that anything might be amiss. Looking back, the age and behaviour of the Soviet delegation at Asilomar seemed almost designed to deflect attention. According to the Rolling Stone article, one US microbiologist chuckled: “These Russians, they just send over the old guys from the [Soviet Academy of Sciences] who don’t know anything. You ask them something and they hedge around — and it’s not that they’re hiding things … they just don’t know in the first place”. Delegates were further amused when one of the Soviets used a camera fitted with a flashbulb to take photographs of slides that were being presented (all that would have appeared on the film would be a white screen). Convinced that the Soviets were harmless, the chortling Americans paid them no further attention, although one of the conference organizers, Maxine Singer, later officially noted their support and cooperation.\n\nApart from Rogers, the journalists were equally incurious. He found the Soviet presence “somewhat puzzling”, and asked one of the delegates whether the Soviet Union viewed molecular biology as militarily significant (there was no direct answer). Rogers also noted that the delegation was accompanied by “a charming, dapper, San Francisco vice-consul, performing chaperon service”. You do not need to be a spy novelist to realize this man’s real role — the Soviet Union’s consulate in San Francisco was the notorious centre of a huge spy operation (and was closed down by the US government in 2017). It seems unlikely that Western security agencies blithely allowed their scientists to discuss the future of genetic engineering, with its evident potential for bioweapons development, and in the presence of Soviet scientists, without any supervision or surveillance. What form that might have taken is unknown.\n\nBiological arms race\n\nWhether or not the Soviet delegation learnt anything at Asilomar that was of direct relevance to the Biopreparat programme, the conference and its decisions did provide civilian cover for the huge expansion of biotechnology in the Soviet Union. On 20 February 1977, the Los Angeles Times suggested Soviet interest in this area could be used to develop bioweapons, but Baev insisted that any use of recombinant DNA in biological warfare would breach both the BWC and “the moral code of science”. The US Defense Intelligence Agency was similarly sanguine (or unimaginative), reporting in 1976 that the sudden increase in Soviet genetic-engineering capacity was simply a response to “embarrassment” at the US lead in the field.",

          "authors": "Rachel Brazil",
          "abstract": "Could you double the lifespan of a mouse, decipher passages in scrolls destroyed nearly 2,000 years ago or, in less than 30 minutes, detect bacteria that cause urinary-tract infections? If so, you would have been eligible to win one of a barrage of ‘challenge prizes’ — the above examples alone provide rewards of more than £12 million (US$15 million). Such prizes have seen a resurgence in the past decade, in the hope that a hefty reward can turbocharge innovation and solve some of society’s stickiest problems.\n\nThe concept of a challenge prize is not new. One of the most famous examples is the 1714 Longitude prize, offered by the UK Parliament to find a method for determining longitude at sea. More than 50 years later, clockmaker John Harrison won it with a marine chronometer that was able to accurately keep time on a rough sea journey.\n\nThe winning solution “changed the world”, says Tris Dyson, managing director of Challenge Works, the London-based non-profit organization that runs challenge prizes across the globe. In 2014, 300 years after the original, Challenge Works launched its own Longitude prize to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Dyson says that running a successful innovation prize takes a lot more than simply dangling a pot of money, and Challenge Works now provides support ranging from funding grants to community-building events.\n\nThe current interest in such prizes came out of concerns that the pace of innovation was slowing, and with public finances becoming more constrained, prizes could offer a cheaper way to stimulate new ideas.\n\nPrizes can de-risk innovation spending, and this is one attraction of the American-Made programme, launched in 2018 by the US Department of Energy to advance technologies to support clean energy. The programme has administered more than 100 prizes, including the annual flagship Solar prize, and has allocated $400 million in prize money. “We reward people for the work that they already do,” says programme manager Debbie Brodt-Giles. “To the government, it’s very low-risk.” The programme also diversifies who is funded by providing a low barrier to entry. “It could be an innovator working out of their garage, or a large-scale company.”\n\nFor researchers, it’s a chance to apply their knowledge to real-world challenges and move in a direction that conventional research funding often doesn’t allow. Even for unsuccessful applicants, participation can lead to a start-up venture, an advance in a research goal or a renewed enthusiasm for innovation.\n\nDyson describes the modern Longitude prize as Challenge Works’ most audacious and high-risk venture. “We didn’t know if we were going to get a winner,” he says.\n\nEncouraging innovators in stages\n\nA partnership with the UK government, the prize featured a public vote on the BBC to select the topic. AMR won, and the £8-million contest was designed around creating an affordable, accurate, rapid and easy-to-use diagnostic test for bacterial urinary-tract infections (UTIs).\n\nMicrobiologist Emma Hayhurst took up the challenge. Then at the University of Cardiff, UK, she is now chief executive of Llusern Scientific in Cardiff, a company she co-founded to commercialize the technology she and her collaborators developed. “I can absolutely 100% say that without the Longitude prize, that wouldn’t have got off the ground,” she says. In 2016, she had just returned to science after maternity leave and was looking to kick-start her research by focusing on AMR. She used skills she had already developed in replicating DNA and RNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a single-test-tube molecular technique that can amplify nucleic acids without having to cycle temperatures. Eventually, she created Lodestar DX, a device that uses LAMP to identify six common UTI-causing pathogens in 35 minutes (J. Diggle et al. JCR-Antimicrob. 6, dlae148; 2024).\n\nThe SunFlex team won $650,000 from the American-Made programme for its solar modules.Credit: Sunflex Solar\n\nAn important aspect of the competition, Hayhurst says, was the clear requirement that the winning solution should be user-friendly and inexpensive, two of eight mandatory criteria. “It made us focus very early on,” she says, and provided concrete goals.\n\nBut having a clear brief and offering a seven-figure reward is often not enough to stimulate innovation, says Anton Howes, head of innovation research at The Entrepreneurs Network, a London-based think tank. People think of the Longitude prize “as a big sum of money that was put up for solving this big problem, and then people came forth with their solutions”, he says. “That’s not really how it works.” The 1714 prize, he points out, awarded small sums along the way to develop promising ideas. Harrison, for example, received £250 in 1737 to improve his sea clock.\n\nThe AMR Longitude prize also provided partial funding. “They gave us £16,000, enough to employ a research assistant for 6 months,” says Hayhurst. Unlike a conventional grant, the funding was not dependent on having a proven track record in the field. “Anyone from anywhere can apply, as long as the idea is good,” she says. Her team also sourced small amounts of money from the University of Cardiff and the Welsh government, crucial to help produce a prototype.\n\nThe American-Made prizes also provide some funding to help lower the barriers to entry, and the programme employs ‘power connectors’ — people who help with outreach and the recruitment of innovators beyond the organization’s typical networks.\n\nHolly Jamieson, executive director of Challenge Works, says that many of its prizes now include more competition stages: the organization funds an initial cohort that is whittled down, with increased funding at each stage. Challenge Works used this model for its second Longitude prize, launched in 2022, which offered £4.4 million to create technology to help people with dementia live independently. In 2023, 24 semi-finalists each got £80,000 to produce a prototype, with five finalists then getting £300,000 each to develop innovations such as smart glasses to aid memory and a remote safety-monitoring system. The winner, to be announced next year, will get £1 million. Similarly, the American-Made Solar prize awards 20 first-stage competitors $50,000, ”enough to keep them energized and working towards that next goal”, says Brodt-Giles, with $100,000 for ten finalists and then two final $500,000 prizes. The competition also awards vouchers that grant access to US national lab facilities to help accelerate innovations.\n\nThe 2022 winner, Origami Solar, based in Bend, Oregon, produces steel frames that house solar panels and that use less materials than existing set-ups, drastically lowering the carbon footprint of installation. The company received $150,000 in vouchers which it used at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to investigate whether the frames could be used in any climate. “Solar can provide energy in even extreme climates, but you have to have panels able to handle snow loads,” says founder Eric Hafter. “With Sandia, we’ve been doing extensive snow-load testing.”\n\nHafter says the competition has been central to their success. “That level of validation was like going from a stationary concrete diving board to a springboard, something that really gave us so much more momentum.”\n\nRunner-up rewards\n\nEnvironmental systems modeller John Gallagher, at Trinity College Dublin, vied for one of the first European Commission Horizon prizes. The 2018 award was €3 million (US$3.1 million) for ways to reduce the concentration of particulates in urban areas. He had been working for several years with a colleague to provide a pre-filtration process for mechanical ventilation systems in urban buildings, to remove particulates from the air.\n\nGallagher received funding to move his ideas forwards, and says that compared with other European funding, the prize “didn’t have the same level of reporting required around it, which was fantastic”. His team’s prototype reduced the energy consumption of ventilation systems by one-third and was one of only two to progress to the final stage, but the prize ultimately went to a large multinational company. “We went to the ceremony and sat beside the winner and clapped for the winner, and they received €3 million as a company, and we received zero,” he remembers. “I think that was the hardest part”, because both teams’ work contained innovations. Hayhurst also missed out on the Longitude prize but feels her team came close. “I’d love it if there were second and third prizes, not just all to one winner, because I feel that we could have done an awful lot with even some of that money.”\n\nInnovator and entrepreneur Emma Hayhurst.Credit: Llusern Scientific\n\nUnlike Hayhurst’s, Gallagher’s innovation ultimately stalled for lack of more-substantial funding. Undeterred, he is now competing in Science Foundation Ireland’s Sustainable Communities Challenge. His team’s entry is a phone app that helps rural communities to manage water scarcity, contamination and infrastructure issues, using real-time monitoring and artificial intelligence for better decision-making. It is one of 12 projects to make the penultimate round, each of which was awarded €250,000.\n\nEven if he doesn’t win this time, Gallagher says that taking part in these competitions has made him keener to explore the commercial opportunities that arise from his research. “It can accelerate real-world impact” more so than continuing at the pace of basic research, he adds.\n\nIn the end, the 2024 AMR Longitude prize was awarded to diagnostic company Sysmex Astrego, based in Uppsala, Sweden. Its PA-100 AST point-of-care test captures bacterial cells directly from urine samples using a microfluidic chip, and monitors their growth rates when exposed to nine antibiotics (Ö. Baltekin et al. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 114, 9170–9175; 2017), to indicate which drug should work best against a UTI.\n\nOriginally called Astrego, the firm was acquired by a Japanese company called Sysmex in 2022, which helped it to grow. But being part of the competition provided the company with both external validation and inspiration for its technology. “It gives some legitimacy to what we’re doing, that this is something that is needed,” says chief executive Mikael Olsson. “It has motivated a lot of people within the team.”\n\nContests that spur collaboration\n\nDo challenge prizes elevate competition above cooperation? They are competitive, especially in the later stages, agrees Dyson, but earlier on, “can actually be quite collaborative”. Jamieson adds that there are cases of teams combining during Challenge Works competitions.\n\nThe Vesuvius Challenge successfully blended competition and cooperation in its contest to use machine learning and computer vision to read the Herculaneum scrolls that were buried and carbonized by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in ad 79. “For me, this is the gold standard” of how a challenge prize should be run, says Howes.",

It can also make sense of existing DNA, including hard-to-interpret ‘non-coding’ gene variants that are linked to disease.\n\n‘ChatGPT for CRISPR’ creates new gene-editing tools\n\nEvo-2, co-developed by researchers at the Arc Institute and Stanford University, both in Palo Alto, California, and chip maker NVIDIA, is available to scientists through web interfaces or they can download its freely available software code, data and other parameters needed to replicate the model.\n\nThe developers see Evo-2 as a platform that others can adapt to their own uses. “We’re really looking forward to how scientists and engineers build this ‘app store’ for biology,” Patrick Hsu, a bioengineer at the Arc Institute and the University of California, Berkeley, said at a press briefing announcing Evo-2’s launch.\n\nOther scientists are impressed with what they’ve read about the model — which is described in a paper posted to the Arc Institute website and submitted to the bioRxiv preprint server. But they say they will need to kick the tyres before coming to firm conclusions.\n\n“We’ll have to see how it holds up in independent benchmarks after the preprint is out,” says Anshul Kundaje, a computational genomicist at Stanford University in Palo Alto. So far, he is impressed by the engineering that underpins the model.\n\nTrillions of letters\n\nIn the past few years, researchers have developed increasingly powerful ‘protein language models’ such as the ESM-3 model developed by former Meta employees that, after training on millions of protein sequences, have been used to help predict protein structures and design totally new proteins including gene editors and fluorescent molecules.\n\nAI has dreamt up a blizzard of new proteins. Do any of them actually work?\n\nUnlike these models, Evo-2 was trained on genome data that contains both ‘coding sequences’ — which carry instructions for making proteins — and non-coding DNA that includes sequences that can control when, where and how genes are active. The first version of Evo released last year was trained on the genomes of 80,000 bacteria and archaea — simple organisms called prokaryotes — as well as their viruses and other sequences.\n\nThe latest model is based on 128,000 genomes, including those of humans and other animals, plants and other eukaryotic organisms. These genomes encompass a total of 9.3 trillion DNA letters. Based on the computing power needed to devour this data and other features, the Evo-2 is the biggest biological AI model yet released, says Hsu.\n\nCredit: Arc Institute\n\nCompared with prokaryotes, eukaryotic genomes tend to be longer and more complex: genes are made of interspersed segments of coding and non-coding regions, and non-coding ‘regulatory DNA’ can be far away from the genes they control. To handle this complexity, Evo-2 was built so that it can learn patterns in sequences of DNA as far away as 1 million base pairs.\n\nTo demonstrate its ability to make sense of complex genomes, Hsu and his colleagues used Evo-2 to predict the effects of previously studied mutations in a gene implicated in breast cancer called BRCA1. It did nearly as well as the best bio-AI models at determining whether changes to coding regions would cause diseases, said Hsu. “It’s state of the art for non-coding mutations.” In the future, the model could help to identify these hard-to-interpret changes in patient genomes.\n\nThe researchers also tested the model’s ability to decipher other features of complex genomes — including that of the woolly mammoth. “Evo-2 represents a significant step in learning DNA regulatory grammar,” says Christina Theodoris, a computational biologist at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, California.",

          "title": "Migraine is more than a headache — a radical rethink offers hope to one billion people",
          "authors": "Fred Schwaller",
          "abstract": "Andrea West remembers the first time she heard about a new class of migraine medication that could end her decades of pain. It was 2021 and she heard a scientist on the radio discussing the promise of gepants, a class of drug that for the first time seemed to prevent migraine attacks. West followed news about these drugs closely, and when she heard last year that atogepant was approved for use in the United Kingdom, she went straight to her physician.\n\nWest had endured migraines for 70 years. Since she started taking the drug, she hasn’t had one. “It’s marvellous stuff. It’s genuinely changed my life,” she says.\n\nFor ages, the perception of migraine has been one of suffering with little to no relief. In ancient Egypt, physicians strapped clay crocodiles to people’s heads and prayed for the best. And as late as the seventeenth century, surgeons bored holes into people’s skulls — some have suggested — to let the migraine out. The twentieth century brought much more effective treatments, but they did not work for a significant fraction of the roughly one billion people who experience migraine worldwide.\n\nWhat causes migraines? Study of ‘brain blackout’ offers clues\n\nNow there is a new sense of progress running through the field, brought about by developments on several fronts. Medical advances in the past few decades — including the approval of gepants and related treatments — have redefined migraine as “a treatable and manageable condition”, says Diana Krause, a neuropharmacologist at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nAt the same time, research is leading to a better understanding about the condition — and pointing to directions for future work. Studies have shown, for example, that migraine is a broad phenomenon that originates in the brain and can manifest in many debilitating symptoms, including light sensitivities and aura, brain fog and fatigue. “I used to think that disability travels with pain, and it’s only when the pain gets severe that people are impaired. That’s not only false, but we have treatments to do something about it,” says Richard Lipton, a neurologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.\n\nResearchers are trying to discover what triggers a migraine-prone brain to flip into a hyperactive state, causing a full-blown attack, or for that matter, what makes a brain prone to the condition. A new and broader approach to research and treatment is needed, says Arne May, a neurologist at the University Medical Center Hamburg–Eppendorf in Germany. To stop migraine completely and not just headache pain, he says, “we need to create new frameworks to understand how the brain activates the whole system of migraine”.\n\nWonder drugs?\n\nWhen May started researching migraine in the 1990s, the leading hypotheses were that migraine was either a psychological issue or a vascular headache disorder, with throbbing pain caused by dilation of blood vessels. The psychological associations came with stigma, May says. “No one believed people who had migraine, they just thought they didn’t want to work. Nearly all of my patients at that time had to see a psychologist or psychiatrist.” The field, Krause says, is still recovering from these ideas. Most clinicians have abandoned the idea that the problem is psychological, but the notion that migraine is akin to a particularly bad headache persists even now.\n\nA lot changed in the 1990s, when May and others began conducting brain scans of people with migraine. The researchers saw for the first time that brain regions were activated during headache attacks, showing that it was more than just a vascular issue1. “From that point on, a lot of things changed. It was the very first time someone could point to migraine and say it’s a biological disease,” says May.\n\nResearchers found that changes in the brain’s activity start appearing at what’s known as the premonitory phase, which begins hours to days before an attack (see ‘Migraine is cyclical’). The premonitory phase is characterized by a swathe of symptoms, including nausea, food cravings, faintness, fatigue and yawning. That’s often followed by a days-long migraine attack phase, which comes with overwhelming headache pain and other physical and psychological symptoms. After the attack subsides, the postdrome phase has its own associated set of symptoms that include depression, euphoria and fatigue. An interictal phase marks the time between attacks and can involve symptoms as well.\n\nSource: N. Karsan & P. J. Goadsby Nature Rev. Neurol. 14, 699–710 (2018).\n\nBut the type, severity and causes of migraine symptoms can differ between people. Dom Horton, who is 53 and an editor in the United Kingdom, never gets headaches. But he experiences other migraine symptoms all the time. “Constant dizziness and a swimming mind are always present,” he says, and they sometimes build to a severity that prevents him from leaving his house. Fiona Gartside, a 60-year-old veterinary surgeon in Scotland, experiences sensitivities to noise, light and movement, overwhelming exhaustion and headaches that get so severe that she occasionally loses consciousness, “which is a relief”, she says. Migraine can even drive full-blown visual hallucinations similar to the ‘reflections of the living light’ painted by Hildegard von Bingen, a twelfth-century abbess who was thought to have experienced a condition that is now called migraine with aura.\n\nDespite the variety of symptoms, it was research into normal, non-migraine associated headaches that led to revolutionary treatments for migraine. Gepant drugs and a handful of monoclonal antibodies have been designed to block activity of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). They came from decades of research on the role of CGRP in headache and are a real “bench to bedside success story”, according to Peter Goadsby, a neurologist at King’s College London, who pioneered the research along with Lars Edvinsson, a neuroscientist at Lund University, Sweden, and collaborators in the 1980s.\n\nChronic pain can be treated — so why are millions still suffering?\n\nHeadache begins when sensory nerves called nociceptors in the meninges become sensitized, sending information to the brain to evoke pain. Goadsby’s work showed that CGRP is a key factor in sensitizing these nociceptors. Clinical trials of drugs that block the peptide in people with migraine proved effective both in alleviating headache and sometimes in preventing attacks from starting2. Goadsby says it’s been stunning to see the completeness of people’s responses to gepants. “Patients come back and literally cry,” he says. “They’d forgotten before what normal was.”\n\nFrom the successes of CGRP blockers, it’s tempting to view CGRP as a ‘factor X’ of migraine. Yet it’s clear that other elements are at play. CGRP blockers work only for a subset of people, as few as one in five according to some studies3. And for those who do respond well to the drugs, some migraine symptoms often persist. West, for example, still has bouts of nausea even though the drug she takes, atogepant, stops her migraine attacks. And although atogepant has minimized Gartside’s symptoms, migraine still dominates her life. “There is a constant juggle between prevention, medication, trigger avoidance, fatigue, fear and anticipation of attacks,” she says.\n\nMigraine in the brain\n\nGoadsby says the mixed results of CGRP blockers show a huge gap in the biological understanding of migraine. “This tells us there are other frameworks of migraine that need to be discovered, and other pathways,” he says. May agrees. He thinks the field needs a radical change in thinking to find new mechanisms of migraine. “We’re focusing too much on migraine as a headache disease,” he says. “The thinking for most people stops at CGRP, but CGRP isn’t the only answer.” The problem, he says, is that scientists don’t fully understand what a migraine attack looks like in the brain.\n\nStudies in the past seven years or so have solidified the hypothalamus as a centre of the condition4. “It must involve the limbic system, of which the hypothalamus is the king,” May says. The limbic system is a group of interconnected brain structures that process sensory information and regulate emotions. Studies that scanned the brains of people with migraine every few days for several weeks showed that hypothalamic connectivity to various parts of the brain increases just before a migraine attack begins, then collapses during the headache phase5.\n\nUS drug agency approves potent painkiller — the first non-opioid in decades\n\nMay and others think that the hypothalamus loses control over the limbic system about two days before the attack begins, and it results in changes to conscious experiences that might explain symptoms such as light- and sound-sensitivity, or cognitive impairments. At the same time, the breakdown of hypothalamic control puts the body’s homeostatic balance out of kilter, which explains why symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, yawning and food cravings are common when a migraine is building up, says Krause.\n\nGoadsby agrees that the hypothalamus is important, but thinks it’s more complex than simply a loss of control. He hypothesizes that an attack could begin when any part of a ‘migraine network’, potentially including the hypothalamus, thalamus and limbic system, is overstimulated. Researchers have yet to pinpoint precisely which brain regions are part of the network, or the “exact order of batting” of when these regions are activated during an attack, Goadsby says.\n\nPredispositions and triggers\n\nMigraine researchers now talk of a hypothetical ‘migraine threshold’ in which environmental or physiological triggers tip brain activity into a dysregulated state.\n\nThe list of potential triggers is extensive. West’s migraines are closely linked to certain foods and to hunger, stress and hormonal changes. She used to get terrible headaches with her period, then after menopause they developed into full-blown three-day migraines. More than half of women with migraine experience attacks every month during menstruation. And migraine is also three times more prevalent in women than in men; it’s the number one debilitating issue for cisgender women in their reproductive years, and it seems equally prevalent in transgender women taking hormone replacement therapy.",

          "title": "Exclusive: These universities have the most retracted scientific articles",
          "authors": "Richard Van Noorden",
          "abstract": "Two days before the end of 2021, administrators at Jining First People’s Hospital in Shandong, China, issued a highly unusual report. The hospital announced that it had disciplined some 35 researchers who had been linked to fraud in publications, such as fabricating data. These sanctions were part of a countrywide crackdown motivated by concerns about a flood of sham medical papers emanating from hospitals.\n\nThe problem was that some young physicians at hospitals had purchased fake manuscripts from paper mills: companies that churn out fraudulent scientific reports to order. These doctors were under pressure because they were required to publish papers to get jobs or earn promotions, says integrity sleuth Elisabeth Bik in California. Sleuths such as Bik soon began spotting signs of this problem, identifying duplicated images in large numbers of papers. They publicized the issue and a wave of retractions followed.\n\nThis surge can now be seen in a first-of-its-kind analysis of institutional retraction rates around the globe over the past decade, for which Nature’s news team used figures supplied by three private research-integrity and analytics firms. Jining First People’s Hospital tops the charts, with more than 5% of its total output from 2014 to 2024 retracted — more than 100 papers (see ‘Highest retraction rates’). That proportion is an order of magnitude higher than China’s retraction rate, and 50 times the global average. Depending on how one counts, the hospital could be the institution with the world’s highest retraction rate.\n\nSource: Nature analysis\n\nMany other Chinese hospitals are retraction hotspots. But universities and institutes in China, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan and Ethiopia feature in the data as well. Retractions can be for honest mistakes and administrative errors, but evidence suggests the majority of cases in these data are related to misconduct.\n\nThis type of institution-level analysis has never been done before because it is particularly challenging: retractions data are messy, there are errors in assigning author addresses to institutions, and creators of the underlying data sets make different choices about how to count institutions and published papers. So the results from the three independent analyses don’t always agree, and should be seen as preliminary.\n\nDespite those challenges, common trends emerge. They show that there is significant variation within countries: some institutions seem to be retraction hotspots, whereas others are relatively unscathed. In certain cases, that might just be because some institutions have evaded sleuths’ attention, but it might also be related to specific research environments that seem to be associated with high proportions of erroneous or fraudulent work.\n\nWhy retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science\n\n“It’s tempting to think about whether differences are related to varying incentives for researchers in different institutions,” says Ivan Oransky, co-founder of the website Retraction Watch, which maintains a public database of retractions on which the companies contacted by Nature partly depend.\n\nNature’s analysis found that, for the majority of institutions with high retraction rates, retractions are spread across many authors. This hints at a problem with research-integrity culture rather than a few rogue researchers, says Dorothy Bishop, a retired neuropsychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who investigates cases of research misconduct. This kind of analysis “could lead to some positive action” if institutions respond by examining what is leading to the patterns, she adds.\n\nIntegrity signals\n\nThe retraction data provided to Nature come from research-integrity tools that technology firms have launched over the past two years, which aim to help publishers stem a surge in fake and significantly flawed research. Among a flurry of these software products are Argos, from Scitility in Sparks, Nevada; Signals, from the firm Research Signals in London; and Dimensions Author Check, from the London-based company Digital Science. (The latter is part of Holtzbrinck, the majority shareholder in Nature’s publisher, Springer Nature. Nature’s news and features team is editorially independent of its publisher.) These three firms provided their institution-based retractions data to Nature; they also looked at countries and journals associated with retractions.\n\nTheir tools aim to alert users to potential ‘red flags’ in research articles or submitted manuscripts, such as authors who might have high numbers of misconduct-associated retractions. To build them, the firms have created internal data sets of retracted papers and their affiliations. These are largely based on Retraction Watch’s database; launched in 2018, it was acquired in 2023 for public distribution by Crossref, a US non-profit organization that indexes publishing data. This made it easier for others to use and analyse the information.\n\nJournals with high rates of suspicious papers flagged by science-integrity start-up\n\nThe firms Nature contacted have built on this data set by omitting retracted articles that lack DOIs (digital object identifiers) and adding retraction information gleaned from other online sources, such as CrossRef, the life-sciences index PubMed and journal websites. The companies shared their internal work on the condition that their data sets would not be published in full, in part because they use them for the software tools that they sell to scientific publishers and institutions.\n\nOne firm, Scitility, says it will make its institution-level figures public later this year. “We think scientific publishing will be helped if we create transparency around this,” says the firm’s co-founder Jan-Erik de Boer, a former chief information officer at Springer Nature who is based in Roosendaal, the Netherlands.\n\nThe three firms’ numbers of retracted articles are some 6–15% greater (over the past decade) than the Retraction Watch data set they build on. But in some cases, articles can be recorded erroneously in CrossRef and other online sources1, so the data might not be 100% accurate, cautions Jodi Schneider, an information-sciences researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who studies retractions.\n\nRetraction Watch staff have also manually filled in the reasons — as far as they can determine them — for each recorded retraction, indicating that the majority are due to misconduct. Those data aren’t available for the records that the firms have added.\n\nRetraction patterns\n\nData on retractions show that they are rare events. Out of 50 million or more articles published over the past decade, for instance, a mere 40,000 or so (fewer than 0.1%) have been retracted, according to the firms’ data sets. But the rise in retraction notices (by which journals announce that a paper is being retracted) is outstripping the growth of published papers — partly because of the rise of paper mills and the growing number of sleuths who spot problems with published articles.\n\nSource: Nature analysis\n\nIn 2023, as Nature reported, more than 10,000 retraction notices were issued (Nature 624, 479–481; 2023). Most of these were from Hindawi, a now-closed London subsidiary of the publisher Wiley, which found that Hindawi journals were affected by a blizzard of peer-review fraud and sham papers. (Wiley told Nature at the time that it had scaled up its research-integrity teams, put in place more rigorous processes to oversee manuscripts and removed “hundreds” of bad actors, including some guest editors, from its systems). During the past decade, the annual retraction rate — the proportion of published articles in a particular year that have been retracted — has trebled (although fewer retraction notices were issued overall in 2024 than in 2022 or 2023; see ‘A tide of retractions’). The proportion reached around 0.2% for papers published in 2022, and will rise as more articles are withdrawn (see ‘Rates on the rise’).\n\nSource: Nature analysis\n\nOver 2014–24, almost 60% of retracted articles (more than 20,000 of them) have authors with affiliations in China. Overall, about 0.3% of that country’s articles have been retracted so far — three times the global average.\n\nBut this is surpassed by retraction rates in Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia, and exceeded or rivalled (depending on the data set) by those in Iraq and Pakistan. (In the Retraction Watch data, Russia also rivals Iraq’s rates, but because many Russian retractions don’t have DOIs and aren’t in global databases, the firms omitted them from their analyses.) Meanwhile, countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have rates of around 0.04%, much lower than the global average of 0.1%, and many countries have even lower rates (see ‘Retraction rates by country’).\n\nSource: Nature analysis\n\nThe rates quoted depend on how analysts count a country’s overall number of research articles: the denominator. For instance, Signals and Argos use data from OpenAlex, a public bibliometric database, to tally published articles. But this data set’s coverage is generally larger than that of the Dimensions database, which Digital Science curates. Therefore, retraction rates are typically lower in the data from Signals and Argos.\n\nInstitutional hotspots\n\nAnalysing institutions is an even thornier task, because there are both data errors and different approaches in the underlying databases, Nature’s analysis found. To map institutional affiliations, Dimensions uses a private Global Research Identifier Database (GRID), whereas OpenAlex uses the public Research Organization Registry (ROR). Both contain quirks — affiliations can be missing or wrongly attributed (a particular issue for some smaller institutes) or the database curators might simply have made different choices about how to assign an affiliation. Accordingly, the firms’ analyses vary.\n\nStill, a general picture emerges of an institutional retraction-rate leader board that is dominated by small Chinese hospitals and medical universities. In the Dimensions data set, over 2014–24, around 70% of the 136 institutions with a retraction rate above 1% are from China, and about 60% of those are hospitals or medical universities. The Argos data set, with 186 institutions with rates above 1%, gives a similar split. Signals shared only its top-ten lists, again dominated by Chinese institutions. (Nature reached out to all of the institutions mentioned in this article for comment, and did not hear back before publication.)\n\nChina conducts first nationwide review of retractions and research misconduct\n\nChina’s science ministry and other government bodies have tried to crack down on fraud and perverse publishing incentives. In guidelines issued in 2020 and 2021, they emphasized that “research publications should not be a mandatory requirement for professional advancement,” says Shaoxiong Brian Xu at Huanggang Normal University in China, who studies retraction notices. The government agencies have also announced other sweeping investigations into research fraud. But, as Xu points out in an analysis published this January, China’s annual retraction rates have risen2. (Jining First People’s Hospital, however, has seen only three retractions of papers published in 2022, and none since.)\n\nOutside China, institutions that are notably high up on several leader boards include Ghazi University in Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan; Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia; and India’s KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology in Coimbatore. In KPR’s case, according to the Retraction Watch data set, almost all of the retractions relate to a decision by IOP Publishing (the publishing arm of the UK Institute of Physics), which in 2022 retracted 350 papers from 2 volumes of conference proceedings released the year before. The publisher cited misconduct as the reason, including “systematic manipulation of the publication process and considerable citation manipulation”. More than 100 of those papers had authors who were affiliated with KPR.\n\nTo avoid counting the smallest institutes, for which high rates reflect just a few retractions, Nature filtered out universities that produce fewer than 100 articles a year. This means, for instance, that Showa University Hospital in Tokyo — where the work of one researcher generated 124 retractions — is excluded from the list; otherwise, it would have notched up a retraction rate of almost 10%.\n\nStill, the universities that top the lists tend to be relatively small. In Ghazi University’s case, around half of its total retracted papers are by just four authors.\n\nSome sleuths have speculated that authors from Ethiopia and some other African countries that publish relatively few articles might sometimes have been added to paper-mill products that originated elsewhere, to take advantage of Hindawi’s waived open-access fee for scholars from low- or lower-middle-income countries. A spokesperson for Wiley (the owner of Hindawi) did not give details, but commented: “We are aware of authorship for sale and waiver manipulation schemes deployed by paper mills,” adding that the publisher has strengthened its internal checks.\n\nMost retractions\n\nA different way to view the data is to pick out institutions with the largest overall numbers of retractions. Most are Chinese universities, but King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, makes the top three. The institutions with the largest number of retracted papers tend not to have the highest retraction rates, because they are large and so publish a lot. The lists of highest-overall retractions also differ because for some Chinese universities — such as Jilin University — some analysts counted retractions from hospitals associated with the university, too.\n\nOne clear change on which all the analyses agree is that in the past half-decade, retractions from institutions in Saudi Arabia and India have come to the fore — largely because of paper-mill activity from Hindawi journals (see ‘Institutions with most retractions’).\n\nSource: Nature analysis\n\nAnother way to examine the overall data is though scatter charts, which highlight that there is significant variation within countries. These show, for instance, that Chinese universities tend to have a lower retraction rate than do Chinese hospitals (see ‘Retractions across research institutions’).\n\nSource: Nature analysis\nPressures to publish\n\nIn India, it’s notable that the institutes with the highest retraction rates are almost all private colleges and institutes in the state of Tamil Nadu, an education hub, says Achal Agrawal, a freelance data scientist in Raipur. That accords with his own analyses of retractions in India, which he has been posting online over the past year after founding India Research Watch (IRW), an online group of researchers and students that is trying to highlight plagiarism and other publication misconduct in the country. Working with IRW, Agrawal has also created a dashboard to visualize Retraction Watch’s data for other countries.\n\nResearchers in public universities and government institutes in India face fewer pressures to publish than do those in private universities and colleges, says Agrawal. Private institutions, he says, push students and researchers to publish many articles, and in some cases pay bonuses for papers published.",

          "abstract": "Superconductors would make make many technologies radically more efficient.Credit: Patrick Gaillardin/Look At Sciences/SPL\n\nA new family of superconductors is exciting physicists. Compounds containing nickel have been shown to carry electricity without resistance at the relatively high temperature of 45 kelvin (–228 °C), and without being squeezed under pressure.\n\nPhysicists at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China, observed the key hallmarks of superconductivity in a thin film of crystals of nickel oxide, which they grew in the laboratory. They published their work1 in Nature on 17 February.\n\nHow would room-temperature superconductors change science?\n\n“There’s a huge hope that we could eventually raise the critical temperature and make [such materials] more useful for applications,” says Danfeng Li, a physicist at the City University of Hong Kong.\n\nNickelates now join two groups of ceramics — copper-based cuprates and iron-based pnictides — as ‘unconventional superconductors’ that operate at room pressure and at temperatures as high as 150K (–123 °C). This new data point could help physicists to finally explain how high-temperature superconductors work, and ultimately to design materials that operate under ambient conditions. This would make technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging, radically cheaper and more efficient.\n\nHow unconventional superconductors operate at warmer temperatures remains mostly a mystery, whereas the mechanism behind how some metals can carry electricity without resistance at colder temperatures, or extreme pressures, has been understood2 since 1957.\n\nThe advancement by the SUSTech researchers in precisely engineering the material’s properties will help them to understand unconventional superconductivity, says Lilia Boeri, a physicist at the Sapienza University of Rome. “The idea that you have a system that you can sort of tune experimentally is something quite exciting.”\n\nRaising temperatures\n\nExcitement about nickelates has been growing since 2019, when Li and his colleagues found hints that compounds containing nickel behaved similarly to superconductors, albeit at low temperatures. These materials’ structural similarity to cuprates raised hopes that nickelates could be coaxed to conduct at higher temperatures. A separate group demonstrated this in 2023, but the materials were under high pressure.\n\nCrystals of a nickelate compound.Credit: Argonne National Laboratory\n\nIn December, researchers at Stanford University in California saw the first signs of nickelate superconductivity under ambient pressure. The SUSTech researchers went further in latest study, showing that the nickelate crystals lost resistance at a critical temperature and expelled magnetic fields.\n\nNickelates have a way to go before their critical temperature — at which superconductivity kicks in — matches that of the cuprates. Increasing this is “a priority”, says Zhuoyu Chen, a physicist at SUSTech and a study co-author. The team is trying various tricks to tweak how the material is grown and its precise composition, he says.",

          "title": "Why is it so hard to rewrite a genome?",
          "authors": "Michael Eisenstein",
          "abstract": "When Patrick Yizhi Cai reflects on the state of synthetic genomics, he recalls the Big DNA Contest. Launched in 2004, the competition challenged synthetic biologists to design a novel, functional 40,000-base-pair DNA sequence that the contest sponsor, US DNA-synthesis firm Blue Heron Biotech (now Eurofins Genomics Blue Heron) would manufacture for free.\n\nIt was no small prize: at the time, producing this modest slab of DNA — less than 1% the length of the Escherichia coli genome — would have cost roughly US$250,000. The company’s aim was to energize the then-nascent field of synthetic biology. “In the end, zero applications were received,” says Cai, a synthetic biologist at the University of Manchester, UK. “That just tells you that even if you could make synthetic DNA for free, nobody really had enough imagination 20 years ago.”\n\nEngineered yeast breaks new record: a genome with over 50% synthetic DNA\n\nToday, steady progress in genomics and computational biology — not to mention DNA synthesis and assembly — have yielded multiple examples of what an ambitious, imaginative genome-writing effort can achieve. The synthetic bacterial strain JCVI-syn3A, developed at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) in La Jolla, California, is a streamlined version of Mycoplasma mycoides that survives and replicates despite having had several hundred non-essential genes stripped away1. Various groups are engineering E. coli strains in which the genetic code has been altered to enable production of proteins containing amino acids beyond the 20 typically observed in nature. And last year, the multinational Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0) completed construction of heavily engineered versions of every chromosome in the eukaryotic budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae — comprising some 12 million base pairs in all.\n\nThese efforts have been invaluable learning experiences, says Akos Nyerges, a synthetic-genomics researcher involved with the E. coli rewriting effort in George Church’s lab at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. “You can mimic and test evolutionary steps which otherwise would have taken billions of years to evolve — or wouldn’t have evolved ever,” he says. But they have also laid bare how much we still don’t understand about the fundamental language of the genome. Every genome-rewriting program so far has grappled with substantial and unexpected challenges, and the era of made-to-order genomes remains out of reach. When it comes to heavily modified genomes, says Nyerges, “we underestimated how complex biology is”.\n\nBack to basics\n\nMost synthetic-genome projects are ‘top-down’ efforts that take a naturally occurring organism and pare away or redesign its DNA. That provides a valuable initial framework relative to ‘bottom-up’ approaches, in which the goal is to build a working genome from scratch. After all, explains Farren Isaacs, a genome engineer at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, when it comes to tinkering with genomes, the margin for error is surprisingly slim. “If you create an error in an essential gene, you’re going to wipe the organism out.”\n\nA key goal of the JCVI and Sc2.0 projects was to determine which genes are truly essential — a characteristic that is surprisingly hard to predict. John Glass, leader of the JCVI’s synthetic-biology programme, says that when he and his team published2 their 2016 report on their first minimal cell, nearly one-third of the cell’s remaining genes (149 of 473) had no known function. “I’d say it’s 78 now,” he adds.\n\nTo determine which genes were necessary, both projects used random mutagenesis — basically, introducing untargeted perturbations throughout the genome and asking which ones the cells could tolerate and which ones severely undermined cellular viability.\n\nHow to build a genome\n\nBut essentiality is a slippery concept, particularly given that most genomes contain redundancies and ‘fail-safe’ mechanisms to minimize the impact of individual mutations. Glass and his colleagues encountered dozens of instances in which mutagenesis revealed pairs of seemingly dissimilar genes that unexpectedly performed overlapping functions. As a result, there is no single minimal genome, he explains. “You take away one [gene], and with each choice, you’re going down a different road to a slightly different minimal cell.” Furthermore, many bacterial genes have multiple jobs, making it difficult to recognize which is the essential function. Glass cites the example of enolase, an enzyme with a well-known role in carbohydrate metabolism that also, it turns out, helps to degrade unwanted RNA.\n\nIncreasingly sophisticated computational ‘whole-cell models’ could help to remove some of the guesswork from future genome-trimming efforts. In 2020, mathematician Lucia Marucci and synthetic biologist Claire Grierson, both at the University of Bristol, UK, led an effort to simulate genome-reduction strategies in a whole-cell model of Mycoplasma genitalium — a close relative of the microorganism edited by the JCVI3. Their analysis, which used elaborate models of cellular processes and their interactions, suggested two redesigns with distinct sets of genes deleted, each yielding genomes that were roughly 40% smaller than the natural M. genitalium genome.\n\nMore recently, Marucci and Grierson have begun working with sophisticated whole-cell models of E. coli. As described in a 2024 preprint4, their current efforts combine mechanistic models with machine learning to predict the consequences of genome manipulation across a broad range of biological functions. These are described by thousands of interlinked equations, yielding blueprints for bacteria that have 40% fewer genes than wild-type E. coli. “We now have a bunch of minimized reduced genomes that we want to test in the laboratory,” Marucci says.\n\nFind and replace\n\nRather than making abridged editions of the genome, other groups have set out to subtly reword the genetic text — encountering an entirely different set of challenges.\n\nSynthetic yeast genome reveals its versatility\n\nProtein-coding sequences are built of nucleotide triplets known as codons. With 61 possible codons for the 20 naturally occurring amino acids as well as 3 ‘stop’ codons that terminate protein synthesis, there is considerable redundancy in the resulting code. Various teams have shown that, by comprehensively converting each instance of a given codon to one of its ‘synonyms’, one can repurpose that codon. This month, for example, Isaacs and his colleagues described an E. coli strain called Ochre in which two stop codons were reassigned to direct the incorporation of the non-natural amino acids para-acetyl-l-phenylalanine and Nε-Boc-l-lysine5. These amino acids have chemical properties and functions that don’t exist in nature, but recoding can also serve as a ‘firewall’ that prevents the interaction and exchange of genetic material with other organisms in natural environments.\n\nSuch work might sound straightforward — simply substituting one codon for another — but genome recoding requires much planning and effort. After researchers have found all instances of the codon they wish to eliminate, they must then work out how to replace it without disrupting the affected genes or regulatory machinery. Bacterial genes often contain regulatory sequences in the protein-coding sequence, Nyerges points out, and a gene on one DNA strand can overlap with a gene on the opposite strand. Seemingly minor changes can thus have major, unexpected consequences.\n\nNyerges, Church and their colleagues are grappling with this challenge at an unprecedented scale as they finalize a heavily recoded variant of E. coli that uses only 57 of the 61 naturally occurring amino-acid codons6. This effort has entailed more than 73,000 changes to the strain’s 4-megabase genome, which inevitably creates unintended effects. “Some things will happen readily with no impact on growth or fitness, while others have a striking impact,” says Nyerges. Some changes disabled existing regulatory elements or unwittingly created new one; others established new protein-coding sequences. “And we’re only learning about this as we go.”\n\nComputer-generated models of the synthetic minimal cell created by researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, California.Credit: Laboratory of Zaida Luthey-Schulten\n\nSorting out these issues is a substantial undertaking in its own right. For example, throughout the recoding process for their Ochre strain, Isaacs and his team used extensive ‘multi-omic’ analyses to characterize the bacterium. “We collected metabolic profiling data under different [culture] conditions,” he says. “We also collected proteomics data comparing the recoded cell to a few different progenitors, including wild-type cells.” In this way, they systematically tweaked the genome until the cells were able to grow under standard culture conditions at roughly the same rate as unmodified bacteria — a non-trivial result, given that genome recoding often impairs growth. Nyerges and his colleagues likewise turned to multi-omics to troubleshoot their 57-codon genome. They also used an experimental strategy that spurs rapid evolution of bacteria in culture, to promote the selection of genome mutations that improve fitness.\n\nAlgorithmic tools are also helping researchers to model and predict the outcomes of some genome-rewriting experiments in advance. For instance, synthetic biologist Howard Salis’s team at Pennsylvania State University in University Park uses quantitative data from high-throughput screens of both genetically modified cells and strands of synthetic DNA to develop algorithms that can define, characterize and even design sequences that govern processes such as transcription and translation. “A typical paper for us nowadays is anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 different defined, designed experiments,” says Salis. The results are used to extract testable physical principles that allow the algorithms to predict, for example, how changes to a gene’s promoter sequence alter downstream expression.\n\n“You can ground-truth everything,” says Salis. “And we can combine our existing models to design the next experiments to understand the remaining misunderstood stuff.” Indeed, the Church lab has used several of Salis’s tools to design its 57-codon microbe. Nyerges says such algorithms have been a substantial asset — albeit not enough to prevent considerable troubleshooting. “Even very tiny changes can cumulatively lead to significant fitness problems once you add up thousands of genes in a genome,” he says.\n\nBrewing progress in eukaryotes",

Standard treatments had been unable to hold the cancer back. It had spread to her bones, and the prognosis was poor.\n\nThe race to supercharge cancer-fighting T cells\n\nNineteen years later, she is cancer-free and the mother of two children. The remarkable success story, published on 17 February in Nature Medicine1, is the longest reported cancer remission following treatment with engineered immune cells called CAR T cells.\n\nIn the years since the girl’s treatment in 2006, CAR T cells have produced stunning results in some blood cancers such as leukaemia. Seven CAR-T-cell therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration since 2017, and some early recipients of CAR-T therapy have been cancer-free for more than a decade.\n\nBut researchers have struggled to repeat that success against solid tumours such as those caused by neuroblastoma, a nerve-cell cancer that is typically diagnosed in young children. That makes the latest results particularly good news, says Sneha Ramakrishna, a paediatric oncologist and cancer researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“This provides me with a lot of hope,” she says. “We’re going to unlock CAR T cells for people with solid tumours.”\n\nCell target\n\nCAR T cells are immune cells that have been engineered to make a protein called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). This protein is designed to latch onto a target found on a cancer cell, triggering the immune cell to attack and destroy it.\n\nWhy are so many young people getting cancer? What the data say\n\nWhen the Texas neuroblastoma study began in 2004, CAR-T-cell therapy was still a bit of a wild idea, says Helen Heslop, an immunotherapy researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and a member of the team that ran the trial. “This is some kind of weird synthetic biology,” she remembers thinking. “Will it actually work?”\n\nThe CAR-T-cell therapies Heslop and her colleagues tested then are now considered first-generation editions of the molecules. Later versions, including those that are now approved medicines, contain extra modifications to bolster their power. Heslop calls her first CAR-T-cell study “a vintage trial”.",

          "abstract": "Neurons (artist’s illustration) in the brain region called the amygdala send signals that influence decision-making after chronic stress.Credit: Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library\n\nScientists have found two ‘dials’ in the brain that help to explain how chronic stress hijacks decision-making1.\n\nHow the stressed-out brain can weaken the immune system\n\nThe discovery is based on experiments in mice and will therefore need to be confirmed in humans. But it shows that prolonged stress dials back deliberate decision-making while also boosting an ‘autopilot’ mode in the brain that favours rigid, habitual behaviours.\n\nIt’s long been known that humans who face chronic stress are prone to resort to a habit, such as smoking a cigarette or eating junk food, rather than make a well-thought-out decision. The work, reported today in Nature, uncovers a biological mechanism for how stress puts its finger on the scale in favour of routine, scientists say.\n\n“It’s really a major achievement,” says Kyle Smith, a neuroscientist at Dartmouth University in Hanover, New Hampshire, who was not involved in the study. The process described “is probably not the only way in which stress increases habit formation, but it really nails down one way”.\n\nStressful studies\n\nStudy author Jacqueline Giovanniello’s interest in stress was piqued by her experience as a student, when she juggled three jobs and a full course load at university. “Something that really interested me was how these stressful experiences change your brain,” says Giovanniello, a neuroscientist now at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nTo study these changes, she and her colleagues exposed mice to an assortment of mild stressors, including damp bedding and white noise. Alongside a control group of hungry but unstressed mice, those that were both hungry and stressed learnt to press a lever to receive a treat of tasty pellets.\n\nChronic stress can inflame the gut — now scientists know why\n\nThe scientists then tested all of the animals’ ability to make flexible decisions — which, for humans, means that you “think about the consequences of your behaviour and use that information to decide what to do”, says study co-author Kate Wassum, a behavioural neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. The alternative is to fall back on habit, “an automatic, almost unconscious reflex to keep doing what you did before”, Smith says.\n\nTo test whether the animals were behaving habitually, the scientists gave the mice a hefty serving of pellets. Then, the animals were given the chance to once again press the lever. The unstressed mice that had filled up with pellets didn’t bother much with the lever — an example of their ability to make purposeful decisions, the authors say. But the stressed mice that were full kept pressing the lever many times per minute, a behaviour that is more automatic than goal-driven, the researchers add.",

          "title": "Why these scientists devote time to editing and updating Wikipedia",
          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Victoria Doronina is a member of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.Credit: Dr. Vadzim Chalau\n\nVictoria Doronina was a biology research associate in the mid-2000s when she started to become active on Wikipedia, adding to and improving pages on the Russian-language version of the online encyclopaedia.\n\nIn 2006, five years after Wikipedia’s launch, she became an administrator, after successfully completing a nomination and voting process. An admin goes beyond editing to manage pages across the site using special permissions, such as the ability to rename pages (see ‘Wikipedia made simple’ and ‘Wikipedia by the numbers’).\n\nFour years ago Doronina, who now works as a technical officer at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK, was elected to become a member of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization, registered in the United States and based in San Francisco, California, that is responsible for Wikipedia and related projects. The foundation’s trustees oversee its work.\n\nA standard question as part of the selection process was whether she had experience of living in a repressive regime. She did, being from Belarus and living there until 1998, but Doronina didn’t understand why it was relevant.\n\nAfter running for re-election in 2024, she understood why. A Russian alternative to Wikipedia, the government-funded Great Russian Encyclopedia, had shut down, following controversies that included what content should be included in scientists’ biographies, which might have contributed to it losing government funding.\n\nTwo years earlier, the Belarusian government imprisoned human-rights activist Pavel Alexandrovich Pernikaŭ for his Wikipedia edits about human-rights abuses. When Doronina made her pitch for re-election, she mentioned both her experience of “living in a totalitarian regime” and her scientific experience (including a PhD in molecular biology from the University of Edinburgh, UK, which she gained in 2001), as providing a useful perspective.\n\nScientist contributions\n\nA 2018 survey of more than 4,000 Wikipedians (as the site’s editors are called) found that 12% had a doctorate. Scientists made up one-third of the Wikimedia Foundation’s 16 trustees, according to Doronina.\n\nAlthough Wikipedia is the best-known project under the Wikimedia umbrella, there are other ways for scientists to contribute besides editing Wikipedia pages. For example, an entomologist could upload photos of little-known insect species to Wikimedia Commons, a collection of images and other media. A computer scientist could add a self-published book to the digital textbook site Wikibooks. Or a linguist could explain etymology on the collaborative dictionary Wiktionary. All of these are open access, a key part of Wikimedia’s mission.\n\nAlthough Wikipedia’s structure might seem daunting for new editors, there are parallels with academic documents.\n\nFor instance, Jess Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London, who focuses on creating and improving biographies of female scientists and scientists from low- and middle-income countries, says that the talk page, which is the behind-the-scenes portion of a Wikipedia page on which editors discuss how to improve it, is almost like the peer-review file of an academic paper.\n\nJess Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London, creates and edits biographies of female scientists.Credit: Thomas Angus, Imperial College London\n\nWell-informed Wikipedians are especially valuable in certain areas, and a key gap is content about and specific to women, says Wade. But addressing this isn’t always straightforward. To create a new Wikipedia biography, the person has to be deemed notable. But even when women meet the criteria for notability, their pages are nominated for deletion more often than are men’s1.\n\nAnd even if Wikipedia pages already exist for people from under-represented groups, Wade says, “their pages are usually shorter and have less technical detail, and are more focused on personal life”.\n\nThe gender gap extends to pages about women’s health. Doronina has seen plenty of misinformation about topics such as menopause. This is partly related to the disproportionate number of men contributing to Wikipedia. One study of the Spanish-language Wikipedia found that women made up around 11.6% of editors2. But the disparity also reflects the insufficiency of the source material, including scientific publications on women’s health. “If there is a gap in scientific literature, you cannot write a high-quality article,” Doronina says. “It’s a feedback cycle.”\n\nWhy we’re editing women scientists onto Wikipedia\n\nThere’s also a particular need for input for language versions that have small editing communities. Doronina says that the small group of contributors for such versions of Wikipedia have more power than do members of large communities.\n\nPrashanth Nuggehalli Srinivas, director of the Institute of Public Health in Bengaluru, an Indian non-profit organization, occasionally contributes to Wikipedia in Kannada, an official language of the Indian state Karnataka, but there is little information on the Kannada-language Wikipedia overall. Language remains a barrier to increasing the representation of academics from low- and middle-income countries, Srinivas says.\n\nEven languages spoken in a number of countries can be poorly supported on Wikipedia. Vinicius Siqueira Tavares Meira Silva is a primary-care physician and a PhD student at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation's Sergio Arouca National School of Public Health in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He used to frequently translate articles from English Wikipedia to the Portuguese version. But translation started to feel insufficient. Siqueira says that his current interest, Brazilian public health, often doesn’t have entries on non-Portuguese Wikipedia sites, creating a need for original articles in Portuguese.\n\nPublic good\n\n“Wikipedia articles should be based on the most reliable independent sources, and scientists seem to have a good understanding of what constitutes a reliable source within a particular field,” says Stephen Harrison, a journalist based in Dallas, Texas, who has carved out a niche writing about Wikipedia, and in 2024 published The Editors, a thriller based on the platform.\n\nHealth and medicine are particularly important areas for specialist contributors. WikiProject Medicine, a Wikipedia community focusing on medicine that launched in 2004, has more than 100 active members, including physicians, medical students and researchers. But Srinivas strikes a note of caution, warning: “While Wikipedia is such an amazing place for health-related information, by design it is not vetted by doctors.”\n\nPrashanth Nuggehalli Srinivas encourages academics to introduce Wikipedia to their students when teaching critical-thinking skills.Credit: Prashanth N S\n\nSiqueira and other Wikipedians stress that scientific expertise can definitely help to inform Wikipedia content, but ultimately contributions matter more than credentials, and it should be an egalitarian rather than an elite project. Beyond scientists, “it will be much more revolutionary if we have people from all groups committed to this work,” Siqueira emphasizes. The Wikimedia Foundation provides access to scientific journals to users with a certain level of activity, so that more editors can translate scientific publications for mass audiences. Overall, Wikipedia’s generalist editors tend to prefer systematic reviews or meta-analyses rather than primary research. “They don’t want to be dazzled by some obscure reference,” Srinivas adds.\n\nThere can be cross-benefits of Wikimedia activity and a scientific job. Doronina says that her conference organizing skills were refreshed by her role on the Wikimedia Foundation’s Board. And Wade says that practising writing neutral, jargon-free text is a useful exercise for scientists in general.\n\nMore broadly, “Wikipedia to me is particularly exciting because it spans partisan divides,” Wade comments. “From an information-sharing perspective, there’s very few places like that any more.”\n\nCaution\n\nHowever, scientists have their own biases about aspects such as how to classify certain topics. This matters, Harrison says, because “Wikipedia is intended to be a general-purpose encyclopaedia instead of a scientific encyclopaedia.”\n\nOne example is a long-standing battle over Wikipedia pages on cryptids and folklore creatures such as Bigfoot. Labels such as ‘pseudoscience’ have angered cryptid enthusiasts and raised questions about different types of knowledge. One suggestion is for the pages to feature a disclaimer that says that a topic is not accepted by mainstream science.\n\nWade raises a point about resourcing, saying it’s especially difficult for the platform to retain academics who might be enthusiastic about editing Wikipedia initially, but then drop off. One reason is time. For full-time researchers, Wikipedia editing could be an activity best left to evenings, weekends and holidays.",

          "abstract": "The main historical building on the campus of the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.Credit: Grandbrothers/Alamy\n\nAbout a month after Donald Trump took office as the 47th US president, almost all grant-review meetings remain suspended at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), preventing the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research from spending much of its US$47 billion annual budget.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next\n\nThese review panels are suspended because the Trump administration has barred the agency from taking a key procedural step necessary to schedule them. This has caused an indefinite lapse in funding and led scientists to make difficult decisions about the future of their research programmes.\n\nThe Trump administration issued an order on 27 January freezing payment on all federal grants and loans, but lawsuits challenging its legality were filed soon after, placing the order on hold. The fact that payments still aren’t going out because Trump’s team has halted grant-review meetings is exploiting a “loophole” in the process, says Aaron Hoskins, an RNA biochemist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has had to reconsider hiring graduate students because of a frozen grant application. “It’s really quite nefarious.”\n\nSome legal scholars say this ‘backdoor’ approach to freezing funding is illegal. That’s because the US Constitution gives Congress, not the president or his team, the power to appropriate funds, says David Super, an administrative-law specialist at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington DC. Blocking “advisory-committee meetings that are legally required to make payments is no different in effect than simply refusing to sign contracts or issue checks”, he says.\n\nThe NIH did not respond to Nature’s queries about the freeze, its legality or when the freeze would be lifted.\n\nA ‘loophole’ in the process\n\nTo gain approval, research-grant applications are considered in two steps, by two separate panels at the NIH. The first is a study section, which is a group of independent scientists who convene to score applications. The second is a meeting of the agency’s advisory council, which is a separate group of external and internal scientists that acts as a final check on an application before a funding decision is made.\n\nAre the Trump team’s actions affecting your research? How to contact Nature\n\nTo run either of these grant-review sessions, the agency must post its meeting plans at least 15 days in advance on the Federal Register, which is the official daily publication of the US government. Trump’s team has barred NIH officials from making these posts, according to e-mail correspondence that Nature has obtained. The NIH has posted zero notices on the Federal Register since Trump took office; during the same period in 2024, there were more than 150 notices posted by the agency.\n\nAccording to the e-mail, the Trump administration will require that these notices be posted at least 35 days prior to grant-review meetings in future, instead of the standard 15 in effect previously. This means that, even if these notices were allowed beginning today, the earliest a new grant-review meeting could be scheduled is 28 March.\n\nA small number of study sections have convened since Trump took office, but that’s because a Federal Register notice was posted prior to his inauguration scheduling them. The continuing cancellation of these meetings has snowballed into an enormous backlog of applications (see ‘Trend reversal’).\n\nSource: NIH RePORTER database/Nature analysis (see code here)\nAn untenable backlog\n\nAdvisory councils at 23 of the NIH’s institutes and centres usually meet only once every four months to discuss grant applications. The first of those gatherings for 2025, scheduled between late January and early February, was cancelled by the new administration during a ‘communications pause’.\n\n‘Devastating’ cuts to NIH grants by Trump’s team put on hold by US judge\n\n“As we get more backed up, there will reach a point where it’ll be impossible to do peer review in time for the [second] council meeting date,” says an NIH scientific review officer, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak with the press.",

Set up by the United Nations, the organization’s goals include expanding universal health coverage and coordinating the world’s response to health emergencies.\n\nNature spoke to senior figures in global health to gauge what might be next for the WHO and the field.\n\nBudget uncertainty hinders work\n\nSome remain optimistic about the WHO’s future. “It’s a pretty robust organization and I think the WHO will weather this,” says Robert Yates, a political-health economist at the London School of Economics and Political Science. “And if other Western powers step up to defend it and put more money into it, then it might come out a bit stronger.”\n\nBut given that the United States contributes about 18% of the WHO annual budget of roughly US$3.4 billion, the uncertainty is already having an impact. Opening the WHO executive board meeting this month, director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that, even before Trump’s executive order, the WHO was planning to shrink spending because of a shortfall caused by economic difficulties in many donor countries. “The US announcement has made the situation more acute, and we have announced a set of measures with immediate effect,” he said.\n\nThe result is that “WHO staff are grounded” says Ilona Kickbusch, a political scientist who specializes in health at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. “Nearly every meeting is cancelled and travel to countries is cancelled.”\n\nIs bird flu spreading among people? Data gaps leave researchers in the dark\n\nThat’s affecting the agency’s work, she adds. “If you are trying to negotiate a new set of standards or something like that it helps to be in one room.”\n\nProjects that the WHO is currently working on include a Europe-wide push to improve mental-health services and work on the ground after a surge of violence in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, providing medical assistance and supplies, supporting health workers and coordinating the emergency response.\n\nHow events will play out is hard to judge, she adds, because the WHO’s operations are more complex than its critics often realize. “For Trump, WHO is an international bureaucracy in Geneva,” Kickbusch says. “But it’s actually incredibly complicated.”\n\nTrump’s complaints about the WHO include its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the slow pace of reform and what his executive order cites as an “inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states”.\n\nRegional offices might still be funded\n\nMuch of the WHO’s work is routed through six regional offices. One of these, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), receives a separate funding stream from the US government, which could continue to be paid even after the US withdraws from the WHO proper.\n\n“There are other regional groups which the US may choose to fund bilaterally and therefore not fund through WHO,” says David Heymann, an infectious-disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. There are also dozens of designated WHO collaborating centres that conduct research at US academic institutions to support the agency’s programmes. These could continue to work with the WHO to provide technical support, he adds.\n\nWorld Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced plans for the organization to reduce spending.Credit: Lian Yi/Xinhua/Alamy\n\nBeyond the financial impacts, any US withdrawal “sets a very poor example for other countries”, he says. Argentina also said this month that it will leave the organization.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei accused the WHO of promoting “endless lockdowns without scientific support” among other claims. But Milei said that Argentina would remain part of the PAHO. Still, leaving the WHO would mean that Argentina loses international support for future pandemics and other global-health problems, says Adolfo Rubinstein, a former health minister of Argentina. “This is terrible news.”\n\nOther populist leaders could follow, says Lawrence Gostin, who directs the WHO Collaborating Center for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington DC. “But I expect the vast majority of countries to remain members and perhaps coalesce around WHO.”\n\nDisease-monitoring gaps raise risks",

          "abstract": "In sexually reproducing organisms, a type of cell division called meiosis is responsible for the formation of gametes, the specialized cells that combine to create offspring (in humans, sperm and egg cells). Meiosis involves a process of DNA manipulation known as recombination, which enables the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes — the nearly identical pairs of chromosomes in each cell that are inherited from an organism’s parents, one from the mother and one from the father. In 1997, it was discovered1 that meiotic recombination is initiated by the protein SPO11, which cuts both strands of the DNA duplex at ‘hotspot’ regions in the genome. However, it has not been possible to reconstitute the DNA-cleaving activity of SPO11 using purified proteins, which has prevented the molecular characterization of this important cellular process. Writing in Nature, three research groups now report2–4 that they have finally succeeded in reconstituting DNA cleavage by purified SPO11, unlocking a new era of research in this field.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence (ages 10–24) is characterized by cognitive, behavioural and social development. Childhood environments are typically centred on home and care settings, whereas adolescents increasingly engage with peer and community environments. These changing environments confer risks of experiencing specific adversities at different ages. Despite the unique characteristics of adversities in adolescence and potential associations with lifespan outcomes, few frameworks exist to systematize adversities in adolescents. Here we review current research and propose an approach specific to this developmental period: the adverse adolescent experiences (AAEs) framework. Building on existing models (for example, the adverse childhood experiences framework), the AAEs focus on potentially traumatizing experiences during adolescence. The framework builds on Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory to conceptualize adversities at intrapersonal, interpersonal, community and societal levels. We argue that this approach can enhance our understanding of adolescent adversity, facilitate the study of its potential effects, and guide prevention and intervention efforts.",

The recent availability of fine-grained mobility data and context attributes ranging from venue type to demographic mixture offer researchers a deeper understanding of experienced inequalities at scale, and pose many new questions. Here we review emerging uses of urban mobility behaviour data, and propose an analytic framework to represent mobility patterns as a temporal bipartite network between people and places. As this network reconfigures over time, analysts can track experienced inequality along three critical dimensions: social mixing with others from specific demographic backgrounds, access to different types of facilities, and spontaneous adaptation to unexpected events, such as epidemics, conflicts or disasters. This framework traces the dynamic, lived experiences of urban inequality and complements prior work on static inequalities experience at home and work.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: As LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two measures: LLM Word Association Test, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Relative Decision Test, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in contextual decisions. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Word Association Test adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Relative Decision Test operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). These prompt-based measures draw from psychology’s long history of research into measuring stereotypes based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.",

Listening may enhance persuasion by promoting cognitive processing, reducing defensiveness, and improving perceptions of the persuader. However, empirical tests of this widely theorized hypothesis are surprisingly scarce. We review the case for and against this hypothesis, arguing previous research has not sufficiently attended to reasons why listening may not enhance persuasion. We test this hypothesis using a preregistered, well-powered field experiment in which trained professional canvassers, acting as confederates, had ∼10 min video conversations with U.S. participants ( N = 1,485) about unauthorized immigration, a salient topic of disagreement. We independently randomized whether confederates shared a persuasive narrative about an undocumented immigrant and whether they practiced high-quality nonjudgmental listening to participants’ opinions. We measured outcomes immediately after the conversation and again five weeks later. Sharing a persuasive narrative meaningfully and durably reduced prejudice and changed policy attitudes. The listening manipulation also successfully improved perceptions of the persuader and increased processing. Surprisingly, however, the listening manipulation did not enhance persuasion: Sharing a persuasive narrative was just as effective in the absence of high-quality listening. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.",

          "abstract": "An enormous body of literature argues that recommendation algorithms drive political polarization by creating “filter bubbles” and “rabbit holes.” Using four experiments with nearly 9,000 participants, we show that manipulating algorithmic recommendations to create these conditions has limited effects on opinions. Our experiments employ a custom-built video platform with a naturalistic, YouTube-like interface presenting real YouTube videos and recommendations. We experimentally manipulate YouTube’s actual recommendation algorithm to simulate filter bubbles and rabbit holes by presenting ideologically balanced and slanted choices. Our design allows us to intervene in a feedback loop that has confounded the study of algorithmic polarization—the complex interplay between supply of recommendations and user demand for content—to examine downstream effects on policy attitudes. We use over 130,000 experimentally manipulated recommendations and 31,000 platform interactions to estimate how recommendation algorithms alter users’ media consumption decisions and, indirectly, their political attitudes. Our results cast doubt on widely circulating theories of algorithmic polarization by showing that even heavy-handed (although short-term) perturbations of real-world recommendations have limited causal effects on policy attitudes. Given our inability to detect consistent evidence for algorithmic effects, we argue the burden of proof for claims about algorithm-induced polarization has shifted. Our methodology, which captures and modifies the output of real-world recommendation algorithms, offers a path forward for future investigations of black-box artificial intelligence systems. Our findings reveal practical limits to effect sizes that are feasibly detectable in academic experiments.",

However, the production of antibodies with homogeneous Fc-SCT glycan requires multiple in vitro enzymatic and purification steps. In this study, we report two cell-based methods to produce Fc-GlcNAc antibody and Fc-SCT-enriched antibodies with improved effector functions. First, we expressed endoglycosidase S2 in Expi293F GnT1- cells to trim all N-glycans to Fc-GlcNAc antibody for in vitro transglycosylation to generate homogeneous antibodies with well-defined Fc glycan. Second, we engineered the glycosylation pathway of HEK293T cells through knock-out of undesired glycosyltransferases and knock-in of desired glycosyltransferases to produce Fc-SCT-enriched antibodies and evaluated their binding to Fc receptors, and we found that the Fc-SCT-enriched antibody is like or better than the homogeneous Fc-SCT antibody in binding to the Fc receptors associated with ADCC, ADCP, and ADVE.",

          "abstract": "Cell populations must adjust their phenotypic composition to adapt to changing environments. One adaptation strategy is to maintain distinct phenotypic subsets within the population and to modulate their relative abundances via gene regulation. Another strategy involves genetic mutations, which can be augmented by stress-response pathways. Here, we studied how a migrating bacterial population regulates its phenotypic distribution to traverse diverse environments. We generated isogenic Escherichia coli populations with varying distributions of swimming behaviors and observed their phenotype distributions during migration in liquid and porous environments. We found that the migrating populations became enriched with high-performing swimming phenotypes in each environment, allowing the populations to adapt without requiring mutations or gene regulation. This adaptation is dynamic and rapid, reversing in a few doubling times when migration ceases. By measuring the chemoreceptor abundance distributions during migration toward different attractants, we demonstrated that adaptation acts on multiple chemotaxis-related traits simultaneously. These measurements are consistent with a general mechanism in which adaptation results from a balance between cell growth generating diversity and collective migration eliminating underperforming phenotypes. Thus, collective migration enables cell populations with continuous, multidimensional phenotypes to flexibly and rapidly adapt their phenotypic composition to diverse environmental conditions.",

In this study, we report the identification of a potent proactivator of SARM1, G10, which is converted into a direct activator (M1) by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. Cryoelectron microscopy structures of SARM1 bound to M1, as well as to M1 and a nonhydrolyzable NAD + analog (1AD), captured two intermediate activation states and the fully active state, revealing a stepwise mechanism of SARM1 activation. Further, introducing a disulfide bond to prevent conformational transitions between the two intermediate states mediated by M1 stabilized SARM1 in its inactive form and blocked M1-induced cell death. Together, these findings propose a sequential, stepwise activation model for SARM1 and offer a framework for developing potential SARM1 inhibitors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the two-domain capsid protein dimerizes, and this dimer connects individual chains in the mature capsid lattice. Previous NMR studies have shown that different dimer arrangements can be formed by isolated capsid protein chains and in assembled capsid lattices; however, the dynamics and functional relevance of these alternate dimers are unknown. To explore the conformational landscape of the CA-CTD dimer, we carried out atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using the weighted ensemble path sampling strategy, generating an ensemble of conformations. Focusing on the two dimer forms previously observed via solution NMR, we refined the conformational ensemble to highlight two metastable states using a Markov state model. Experimentally, we measured the interconversion rates between the two alternate dimers using 19 F NMR, and these rates showed good agreement with the interconversion rates derived from the simulations. After identifying the key interactions that distinguish the dimer states, the alternate dimer was further experimentally verified through disulfide crosslinking. Our results demonstrate the advantages of pairing weighted ensemble path sampling with 19 F NMR to gain atomistic insights into the hidden dimer state of the HIV-1 capsid protein.",

          "abstract": "While advances in genome editing technologies have simplified gene disruption in many organisms, the study of essential genes requires development of conditional disruption or knockdown systems that are not available in most organisms. Such is the case for Trypanosoma cruzi , a parasite that causes Chagas disease, a severely neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America that is often fatal. Our knowledge of the identity of essential genes and their functions in T. cruzi has been severely constrained by historical challenges in very basic genetic manipulation and the absence of RNA interference machinery. Here, we describe the development and use of self-cleaving RNA sequences to conditionally regulate essential gene expression in T. cruzi . Using these tools, we identified essential roles for Polo-like and Aurora kinases in T. cruzi cell division, mirroring their functions in Trypanosoma brucei . Importantly, we demonstrate conditional knockdown of essential genes in intracellular amastigotes, the disease-causing stage of the parasite in its human host. This conditional knockdown system enables the efficient and scalable functional characterization of essential genes in T. cruzi and provides a framework for the development of conditional gene knockdown systems for other nonmodel organisms.",

          "abstract": "Longitudinal imaging data are routinely acquired for health studies and patient monitoring. A central goal in longitudinal studies is tracking relevant change over time. Traditional methods remove nuisance variation with custom pipelines to focus on significant changes. In this work, we present a machine learning–based method that automatically ignores irrelevant changes and extracts the time-varying signal of interest. Our method, called Learning-based Inference of Longitudinal imAge Changes (LILAC), performs a pairwise comparison of longitudinal images in order to make a temporal difference prediction. LILAC employs a convolutional Siamese architecture to extract feature pairs, followed by subtraction and a bias-free fully connected layer to learn meaningful temporal image differences. We first showcase LILAC’s ability to capture key longitudinal changes by simply training it to predict the temporal ordering of images. In our experiments, temporal ordering accuracy exceeded 0.98, and predicted time differences were strongly correlated with actual changes in relevant variables (Pearson Correlation Coefficient r = 0.911 with embryo phase change, and r = 0.875 with time interval in wound healing). Next, we trained LILAC to explicitly predict specific targets, such as the change in clinical scores in patients with mild cognitive impairment. LILAC models achieved over a 40% reduction in root mean square error compared to baseline methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that LILAC effectively localizes and quantifies relevant individual-level changes in longitudinal imaging data, offering valuable insights for studying temporal mechanisms or guiding clinical decisions.",

          "abstract": "Groundwater is essential to urban water supplies throughout the world, but we do not understand how quantity and quality issues may jeopardize the ability of cities to meet their water needs. Here, we present a national analysis of both quantity and quality challenges facing China’s urban groundwater supply security, using high-resolution groundwater depletion modeling and a recently compiled dataset detailing quality violations in drinking groundwater sources. We estimate that 180 cities (about half of the prefecture-level-and-above cities), accounting for 311 million urban residents, face at least one groundwater pressure between 2016 and 2021. Cities that face dual quantity and quality pressures pinpoints hotspots of intense groundwater threats— Specifically, 40 cities, mainly situated in Northeast China and the middle to lower reaches of the Yellow River, are exposed to dual groundwater pressures. The results highlight the interconnected and possibly mutually reinforcing nature of groundwater depletion and quality issues. The logistic regression models indicate that groundwater depletion and quality violations are associated with natural water endowment and anthropogenic factors. Particularly, drinking groundwater quality issues are clustered in relation to socioeconomic gaps, with larger, wealthier cities being less prone to such problems. We argue that securing drinking water sources in small and poor cities through integrated groundwater management and economic assistance should be an important national priority for achieving groundwater supply sustainability.",

          "abstract": "Electrocatalytic reduction (ECR) of furfural represents a sustainable route for biomass valorization. Unfortunately, traditional Cu-catalyzed ECR suffers from diversified product distribution and industrial-incompatible production rates, mainly caused by the intricate mechanism−performance relationship. Here, we manipulate hydrogenation pathways on Cu by introducing ceria as an auxiliary component, which enables the mechanism switching from proton-coupled electron transfer to electrochemical hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) and thus high-speed furfural-to-furfuryl alcohol electroconversion. Theoretical and kinetic analyses show that oxygen-vacancy-rich ceria delivers an efficient formation−diffusion−hydrogenation chain of H* by diminishing H* adsorption. Spectroscopic characterizations indicate that Cu/ceria interfacial perimeter enriches the local furfural, synergistically lowering the barrier of the rate-determining HAT step across the perimeter. Our Cu/ceria catalyst realizes high-rate HAT-dominated ECR for electrosynthesis of single-product furfuryl alcohol, achieving a high production rate of 19.1 ± 0.4 mol h −1 m −2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97 ± 1% at an economically viable partial current density of over 0.1 A cm −2 . Our results demonstrate a highly efficient route for biofeedstock valorization with enhanced techno-economic feasibility.",

Here, we propose an “ on-demand release ” model, wherein the formation of microvesicles, a specific group of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is an important step. A coculture model system that combines a reporter cell line expressing the fluorescent eCB sensor, G protein-coupled receptor-based (GRAB) eCB2.0 , and neuronal cells revealed that neurons release EVs containing 2-AG, but not anandamide, in a stimulus-dependent process regulated by protein kinase C, Diacylglycerol lipase, Adenosinediphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), and which was sensitive to inhibitors of eCB facilitated diffusion. A vesicle contained approximately 2,000 2-AG molecules. Accordingly, hippocampal eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity was modulated by Arf6 and transport inhibitors. The “ on-demand release ” model, supported by mathematical analysis, offers a cohesive framework for understanding eCB trafficking at the molecular level and suggests that microvesicles carrying signaling lipids in their membrane regulate neuronal functions in parallel to canonical synaptic vesicles.",

          "abstract": "The proteasome is a multisubunit degradation machinery that is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by breaking down unnecessary or damaged proteins into peptides. While most of these peptides are further processed into amino acids, a subset evades complete degradation and plays key roles in biological processes such as antigen presentation, signaling, and apoptosis. However, the variability in peptide lengths and the diverse composition of proteasomes make their comprehensive identification and characterization particularly challenging. Here, we present a method that enables real-time identification of generated peptides, as well as uncleaved and partially cleaved protein substrates, revealing the processive nature of protein proteasomal degradation. Our intact degradomics workflow is based on intact mass spectrometry measurements and treats the enzymatically produced peptides as if they were generated within the mass spectrometer, akin to top–down products. We applied this approach to determine the kinetic profile of proteasome degradation and compare the real-time activity of proteasomes isolated from different mouse organs, uncovering distinct functionalities of the complex. Overall, this method offers a valuable tool for studying peptide degradation products across various proteasome configurations, while also enabling the investigation of how interacting proteins, inhibitors, and activators influence proteasome activity. Furthermore, its adaptability makes it applicable to a wide range of other proteolytic complexes, broadening its potential impact in the field.",

          "abstract": "G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate various physiological functions by rewiring cellular gene expression in response to extracellular signals. Control of gene expression by GPCRs has been studied almost exclusively at the transcriptional level, neglecting an extensive amount of regulation that takes place translationally. Hence, little is known about the nature and mechanisms of gene-specific posttranscriptional regulation downstream of receptor activation. Here, we apply an unbiased multiomics approach to delineate an extensive translational regulatory program initiated by the prototypical beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) and provide mechanistic insights into how these processes are orchestrated. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we identify nearly 120 gene targets of adrenergic receptor activity for which expression is exclusively regulated at the level of translation. We next show that all translational changes are induced selectively by endosomal β2-ARs and report that this proceeds through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Specifically, within the set of translational GPCR targets, we find significant enrichment of genes with 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, a gene class classically known to be translationally regulated by mTOR. We then demonstrate that endosomal β2-ARs are required for mTOR activation and subsequent mTOR-dependent TOP mRNA translation. This site-selective crosstalk between the pathways is observed in multiple cell models with native β2-ARs, across a range of endogenous and synthetic adrenergic agonists, and for other GPCRs with intracellular activity. Together, this comprehensive analysis of drug-induced translational regulation establishes a critical role for location-biased GPCR signaling in fine-tuning the cellular protein landscape.",

          "abstract": "Anti-CTLA-4 Abs (ACAs) are a breakthrough for cancer therapy, but their potential is limited by immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAE). We previously reported that ACAs with acidic pH-sensitive binding to CTLA-4 exhibit higher antitumor activity with fewer irAE. We now test a panel of variants of Ipilimumab (Ipi), the first ACA cancer therapeutic, for tumoricidal efficacy and irAE. Surprisingly, not all pH-sensitive Ipi variants exhibited an enhanced therapeutic index. Ipi13, which retained binding to CTLA-4 at pH 6.0 but dissociated at lower pH, showed no enhancement. By contrast, Ipi25, which dissociates from CTLA-4 at pH 6.0, the pH of the early endosome (EE), showed greater tumor regression and less severe irAE. Confocal microscopy showed that Ipi13 maintained colocalization with CTLA-4 at the late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes resulting in lysosomal degradation of CTLA-4. Conversely, Ipi25 did not colocalize with CTLA-4 in LE or lysosomes after endocytosis but allowed both proteins to transfer to recycling endosomes. EE dissociation was also characteristic of variants of Tremelimumab (Treme), another clinical ACA, that showed better efficacy and fewer side effects. Thus, our data reveal the significance of early intracellular dissociation from CTLA-4 to improve ACAs for safer and more effective cancer immunotherapy.",

This study investigates the hypothesis that hydrodynamic restriction led to severe ecological impacts, including basin-wide extinction due to elevated salinity followed by a short time of oxygen depletion. Uranium–Thorium dating of deep-water corals (DWCs) from 26 northern Red Sea sites reveals coral growth during and after the Last Glacial sea-level lowstand, indicating tolerable seawater chemistry. Additional geochemical data show no significant difference in Red Sea chemistry or temperature between the Latest Pleistocene and Holocene. A meta-analysis of 27 deep-sea cores reveals that while planktonic foraminifera experienced local extinction, other microfossil groups seemingly persisted. These findings suggest that the Red Sea survived the last sea-level lowstand, challenging the paradigm of a complete ecological collapse and providing insights into the resilience of marine ecosystems.",

Most land plants have evolved two N uptake pathways, a direct root pathway and a symbiotic pathway, via association with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, the interaction between the two pathways is ambiguous. Here, we report that OsNAR2.1–OsNRT2s, the nitrate (NO 3 − ) transporter complexes with crucial roles in direct NO 3 − uptake, are also recruited for symbiotic NO 3 − uptake. OsNAR2.1 and OsNRT2.1/2.2 are coregulated by NIN-like protein 3 (OsNLP3), a key regulator in NO 3 − signaling, and OsPHR2, a major regulator of phosphate starvation responses. More importantly, AM symbiosis induces expression of OsNAR2.1 – OsNRT2s, OsNLP3, and OsSPX4 , encoding an intracellular Pi sensor, in arbuscular-containing cells, but weakens their expression in the epidermis. OsNAR2.1 and OsNLP3 can activate both mycorrhizal NO 3 − uptake and mycorrhization efficiency. Overall, we demonstrate that OsNLP3 and OsPHR2 orchestrate the direct and mycorrhizal NO 3 − uptake pathways by regulating the NAR2.1–NRT2s complexes in rice.",

We also find that an ancestral follistatin gene likely had multiple promoters and that the follistatin duplicates that evolved wingless-specific expression retained only the ancestral wingless-specific promoter. Our work provides a roadmap for how alternative promoter usage and subsequent gene duplication can enable the evolution of animal form.",

          "abstract": "Deep learning tools that predict peptide binding by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins play an essential role in developing personalized cancer immunotherapies and vaccines. In order to ensure equitable health outcomes from their application, MHC binding prediction methods must work well across the vast landscape of MHC alleles observed across human populations. Here, we show that there are alarming disparities across individuals in different racial and ethnic groups in how much binding data are associated with their MHC alleles. We introduce a machine learning framework to assess the impact of this data imbalance for predicting binding for any given MHC allele, and apply it to develop a state-of-the-art MHC binding prediction model that additionally provides per-allele performance estimates. We demonstrate that our MHC binding model successfully mitigates much of the data disparities observed across racial groups. To address remaining inequities, we devise an algorithmic strategy for targeted data collection. Our work lays the foundation for further development of equitable MHC binding models for use in personalized immunotherapies.",

Here, we used biochemistry and mass spectrometry to define PSKH1’s consensus substrate motif, protein interactors, and how interactors, including Ca 2+ sensor proteins, promote or suppress activity. Intriguingly, despite the absence of a canonical Calmodulin binding motif, Ca 2+ -Calmodulin activated PSKH1 while, in contrast, the ER-resident Ca 2+ sensor of the Cab45, Reticulocalbin, Erc55, Calumenin (CREC) family, Reticulocalbin-3, suppressed PSKH1 catalytic activity. In addition to antagonistic regulation of the PSKH1 kinase domain by Ca 2+ sensing proteins, we identified UNC119B as a protein interactor that activates PSKH1 via direct engagement of the kinase domain. Our findings identify complementary allosteric mechanisms by which regulatory proteins tune PSKH1’s catalytic activity and raise the possibility that different Ca 2+ sensors may act more broadly to tune kinase activities by detecting and decoding extremes of intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations.",

We employed advanced time-series analysis at the brain region level and machine learning to predict age. While traditional spectral features achieved low to moderate accuracy, over a hundred time-series features proved superior.

Hundreds of structures of these domains have been solved. However, a comprehensive understanding of DDFs is lacking. In this article, we report the curation of a DDF structural atlas as a public website (deathdomain.org) and deduce the common and distinct principles of DDF-mediated oligomerization among the four families (death domain or DD, death effector domain or DED, caspase recruitment domain or CARD, and pyrin domain or PYD).

KAI2 is believed to recognize an endogenous butenolide (KAI2 ligand; KL), but the identity of this compound remains unknown. Recent studies have suggested that ligand hydrolysis by KAI2 is a prerequisite for receptor activation to induce interaction with the target proteins, similar to the situation with D14. However, direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we designed KAI2 ligands (carba-dMGers) whose butenolide rings were modified so that they cannot be hydrolyzed or dissociated from the original ligand molecule by KAI2, by structurally modifying dMGer, a potent and selective KAI2 agonist. Using these dMGer analogs, we found that the strongly bioactive ligand, (+)-dMGer, was hydrolyzed by KAI2 at a lower enzymatic rate compared with the weakly bioactive ligand, (+)-1′-carba-dMGer, and the hydrolyzed butenolide ring of (+)-dMGer was transiently trapped in the catalytic pocket of KAI2. Additionally, structural analysis revealed that (+)-6′-carba-dMGer bound to the catalytic pocket of KAI2 in the unhydrolyzed state. However, this binding did not induce the interaction between KAI2 and SMAX1, indicating that ligand binding to the receptor alone was not sufficient for KAI2 signaling. This study showed experimental data from a ligand structure–activity study that ligand hydrolysis and subsequent covalent adduct formation with the catalytic triad plays a key role in KAI2 activation, providing insight into the chemical structure of the Arabidopsis KL.",

          "abstract": "Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus, pose significant public health threats globally. Extensive efforts have led to the development of promising highly active compounds against DENV targeting viral non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) protein. However, due to the cocirculation of flaviviruses and to prepare for emerging flaviviruses, there is a need for more broadly acting antivirals. Host-directed therapy where one targets a host factor required for viral replication may be active against multiple viruses that use similar replication strategies. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 library that we designed to target the druggable genome and identified signal peptide peptidase (SPP, encoded by Histocompatibility Minor 13, HM13), as a critical host factor in DENV infection. Genetic knockout or introducing mutations that disrupt the proteolytic activity of SPP markedly reduced the replication of multiple flaviviruses. Although their substrates differ, SPP has structural homology with γ-secretase, which has been pursued as a pharmacological target for Alzheimer’s disease. Notably, SPP-targeting compounds exhibited potent anti-DENV activity at low nanomolar concentrations across multiple primary and disease-relevant cell types, acting specifically through SPP inhibition rather than γ-secretase inhibition. Importantly, SPP inhibitors were active at low nanomolar concentrations against flaviviruses other than DENV including ZIKV while DENV NS4B inhibitors lost activity. This study emphasizes the strong potential of SPP as a pan-flaviviral target and provides a framework for identifying host druggable targets to screen for broad-spectrum antivirals.",

          "abstract": "The often-distinctive pigment patterns of vertebrates are varied in form and function and depend on several types of pigment cells derived from embryonic neural crest or latent stem cells of neural crest origin. These cells and the patterns they produce have been useful for uncovering features of differentiation and morphogenesis that underlie adult phenotypes, and they offer opportunities to discover how patterns and the cell types themselves have diversified. In zebrafish, a body pattern of stripes arises by self-organizing interactions among three types of pigment cells. Yet these fish also exhibit white ornamentation on their fins that depends on the transdifferentiation of black melanophores to white cells, “melanoleucophores.” To identify mechanisms underlying this conversion we used ultrastructural, transcriptomic, mutational, and other approaches. We show that melanophore–melanoleucophore transition depends on regional BMP signals transduced through noncanonical receptors (Rgmb-Neo1a-Lrig2) as well as BMP-dependent signaling by Agouti genes, asip1 and asip2b . These signals lead to expression of transcription factor genes including foxd3 and runx3 that are necessary to induce loss of melanin, curtail new melanin production, and deploy a pathway for accumulating guanine crystals that, together, confer a white phenotype. These analyses uncover an important role for positional information in specifying ornamentation in zebrafish and show how tissue environmental cues and an altered gene regulatory program have allowed terminal addition of a distinct phenotype to a preexisting cell type.",

CircVP28, which contains an internal ribosome entry site, was further characterized to determine its potential as a template for protein translation. We observed the presence of a truncated, circRNA-encoded VP28 (ceVP28) in infected shrimp. Both ceVP28 and its parental counterpart, VP28, share the same host cell binding partner Rab7, which is a host receptor for WSSV. Coadministration of recombinant ceVP28 protein and WSSV to penaeid shrimps reduced both viral copy numbers and mortality upon WSSV challenges.

Using mice lacking K ATP channel activity (e.g., Kir6.2 −/− mice), we explored how changes in glucose utilization affect cortical electroencephalography (EEG) activity and sleep/wake homeostasis. In the brain, Kir6.2 −/− mice shunt glucose toward glycolysis, reducing neurotransmitter biosynthesis and dampening cortical EEG activity. Kir6.2 −/− mice spent more time awake at the onset of the light period due to altered ISF lactate dynamics.

          "abstract": "Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) are electromotile and implicated in amplification of responses to sound that enhance sound sensitivity and frequency tuning. They send afferent information through glutamatergic synapses onto type II spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). These synapses are weaker than those from cochlear inner hair cells onto type I SGN, suggesting that type II SGNs respond only to intense sound levels. OHCs also receive efferent innervation from medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons. MOC neurons are cholinergic yet inhibit OHCs due to the functional coupling of alpha9/alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to calcium-activated SK potassium channels. The resulting hyperpolarization reduces OHC activity-evoked electromotility and is implicated in cochlear gain control, protection against acoustic trauma, and attention. MOC neurons also label for markers of GABA and GABA synthesis. GABA B autoreceptor (GABA B R) activation on MOC terminals has been demonstrated to reduce ACh release, confirming important negative feedback roles. However, the full complement of GABAergic activity in the cochlea is not currently understood, including mechanisms of GABA release from MOC axons, whether GABA diffuses from MOC axons to other postsynaptic cells, and the location and function of GABA A receptors (GABA A Rs). We used optical neurotransmitter detection, immunohistochemistry, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to demonstrate that in addition to presynaptic GABA B autoreceptor activation, MOC efferent terminals release GABA onto type II SGN afferent dendrites with postsynaptic activity mediated by GABA A Rs. This synapse may have roles including developmental regulation of cochlear innervation, fine-tuning of OHC activity, or providing feedback to the brain about MOC and OHC activity.",

The stability and activity of VISA are tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications, among which polyubiquitination plays important roles. Various E3 ubiquitin ligases, including atrophin interacting protein 4 (AIP4), mediate polyubiquitination of VISA and result in its degradation. However, how polyubiquitination of VISA is regulated remains unclear. Here, we uncovered a dual function for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key enzyme in cholesterol homeostasis and a well-known therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases, modulating host responses to RNA viruses both extracellularly and intracellularly. Secreted PCSK9 inhibited sendai virus (SeV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, while the intracellular PCSK9 potentiated RLRs-mediated interferons (IFNs) induction by stabilizing VISA on mitochondria. Viral infection induced the translocation of PCSK9 to mitochondria where it competed with AIP4 for VISA, thereby inhibiting its polyubiquitination and degradation. Consequently, overexpression of PCSK9 enhanced VISA-mediated innate immune response against RNA viral infection, whereas its deficiency had the opposite effects and resulted in more robust replication of the virus. Pcsk9 −/− mice produced lower levels of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines, rendering the increased sensitivity to VSV and influenza A virus infection. Altogether, our findings uncovered an important and unexpected role of PCSK9 in virus–host interaction and contribute to the understanding of the sophisticated mechanism governing the proper and efficient immune response to viral infection.",

In plants, such regulation is critical for flower formation, which involves the progressive maturation of stem cell populations within shoot meristems to floral meristems, followed by rapid sequential differentiation into floral organs. Across plant taxa, these transitions are orchestrated by the F-box transcriptional cofactor gene UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS ( UFO ). The conserved and pleiotropic functions of UFO offer a useful framework for investigating how evolutionary processes have shaped the intricate cis- regulation of key developmental genes. By pinpointing a conserved promoter sequence in an accessible chromatin region of the tomato ortholog of UFO , we engineered in vivo a series of cis- regulatory alleles that caused both loss- and gain-of-function floral defects. These mutant phenotypes were linked to disruptions in predicted transcription factor binding sites for known transcriptional activators and repressors. Allelic combinations revealed dosage-dependent interactions between opposing alleles, influencing the penetrance and expressivity of gain-of-function phenotypes. These phenotypic differences support that robustness in tomato flower development requires precise temporal control of UFO expression dosage. Bridging our analysis to Arabidopsis , we found that although homologous sequences to the tomato regulatory region are dispersed within the UFO promoter, they maintain similar control over floral development. However, phenotypes from disrupting these sequences differ due to the differing expression patterns of UFO . Our study underscores the complex cis- regulatory control of dynamic developmental genes and demonstrates that critical short stretches of regulatory sequences that recruit both activating and repressing machinery are conserved to maintain developmental robustness.",

          "abstract": "The ability of parasitic plants to withdraw nutrients from their hosts depends on the formation of an infective structure known as the haustorium. How parasites regulate their haustoria numbers is poorly understood, and here, we uncovered that existing haustoria in the facultative parasitic plants Phtheirospermum japonicum and Parentucellia viscosa suppressed the formation of new haustoria located on distant roots. Using Phtheirospermum, we found that this effect depended on the formation of mature haustoria and could be induced through the application of external nutrients. To understand the molecular basis of this root plasticity, we analyzed hormone response and found that existing infections upregulated cytokinin-responsive genes first at the haustoria and then more distantly in Phtheirospermum shoots. We observed that infections increased endogenous cytokinin levels in Phtheirospermum roots and shoots, and this increase appeared relevant since local treatments with exogenous cytokinins blocked the formation of both locally and distantly formed haustoria. In addition, local overexpression of a cytokinin-degrading enzyme in Phtheirospermum prevented this systemic interhaustoria repression and increased haustoria numbers locally. We propose that a long-distance signal produced by haustoria negatively regulates future haustoria, and in Phtheirospermum , such a signaling system is mediated by a local increase in cytokinin to regulate haustoria numbers and balance nutrient acquisition.",

          "abstract": "The dominant organisms in modern oxic ecosystems rely on respiratory quinones with high redox potential (HPQs) for electron transport in aerobic respiration and photosynthesis. The diversification of quinones, from low redox potential (LPQ) in anaerobes to HPQs in aerobes, is assumed to have followed Earth’s surface oxygenation ~2.3 billion years ago. However, the evolutionary origins of HPQs remain unresolved. Here, we characterize the structure and biosynthetic pathway of an ancestral HPQ, methyl-plastoquinone (mPQ), that is unique to bacteria of the phylum Nitrospirota . mPQ is structurally related to the two previously known HPQs, plastoquinone from Cyanobacteriota /chloroplasts and ubiquinone from Pseudomonadota /mitochondria, respectively. We demonstrate a common origin of the three HPQ biosynthetic pathways that predates the emergence of Nitrospirota , Cyanobacteriota , and Pseudomonadota . An ancestral HPQ biosynthetic pathway evolved ≥ 3.4 billion years ago in an extinct lineage and was laterally transferred to these three phyla ~2.5 to 3.2 billion years ago. We show that Cyanobacteriota and Pseudomonadota were ancestrally aerobic and thus propose that aerobic metabolism using HPQs significantly predates Earth’s surface oxygenation. Two of the three HPQ pathways were later obtained by eukaryotes through endosymbiosis forming chloroplasts and mitochondria, enabling their rise to dominance in modern oxic ecosystems.",

The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity cosimulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.",

          "abstract": "Pathogenic Enterobacter species are of increasing clinical concern due to the multidrug-resistant nature of these bacteria, including resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. Our understanding of Enterobacter virulence is limited, hindering the development of new prophylactics and therapeutics targeting infections caused by Enterobacter species. In this study, we assessed the virulence of contemporary clinical Enterobacter hormaechei isolates in a mouse model of intraperitoneal infection and used comparative genomics to identify genes promoting virulence. Through mutagenesis and complementation studies, we found two porin-encoding genes, ompC and ompD , to be required for E. hormaechei virulence. These porins imported clinically relevant carbapenems into the bacteria, and thus loss of OmpC and OmpD desensitized E. hormaechei to the antibiotics. Our genomic analyses suggest porin-related genes are frequently mutated in E. hormaechei , perhaps due to the selective pressure of antibiotic therapy during infection. Despite the importance of OmpC and OmpD during infection of immunocompetent hosts, we found the two porins to be dispensable for virulence in a neutropenic mouse model. Moreover, porin loss provided a fitness advantage during carbapenem treatment in an ex vivo human whole blood model of bacteremia. Our data provide experimental evidence of pathogenic Enterobacter species gaining antibiotic resistance via loss of porins and argue antibiotic therapy during infection of immunocompromised patients is a conducive environment for the selection of porin mutations enhancing the multidrug-resistant profile of these pathogens.",

We show that this analysis allows determination of the structure of both mycobacterial ATP synthase and the supercomplex of respiratory complexes III and IV in their native membrane. The latter structure reveals that the enzyme malate:quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo) physically associates with the respiratory supercomplex, an interaction that is lost on extraction of the proteins from the lipid bilayer. Mqo catalyzes an essential reaction in the Krebs cycle, and in vivo survival of mycobacterial pathogens is compromised when its activity is absent. We show with high-speed spectroscopy that the Mqo:supercomplex interaction enables rapid electron transfer from malate to the supercomplex. Further, the respiratory supercomplex is necessary for malate-driven, but not NADH-driven, electron transport chain activity and oxygen consumption. Together, these findings indicate a connection between the Krebs cycle and aerobic respiration that directs electrons along a single branch of the mycobacterial electron transport chain.",

          "abstract": "Generation of membrane curvature is fundamental to cellular function. Recent studies have established that the glycocalyx, a sugar-rich polymer layer at the cell surface, can generate membrane curvature. While there have been some theoretical efforts to understand the interplay between the glycocalyx and membrane bending, there remain open questions about how the properties of the glycocalyx affect membrane bending. For example, the relationship between membrane curvature and the density of glycosylated proteins on its surface remains unclear. In this work, we use polymer brush theory to develop a detailed biophysical model of the energetic interactions of the glycocalyx with the membrane. Using this model, we identify the conditions under which the glycocalyx can both generate and sense curvature. Our model predicts that the extent of membrane curvature generated depends on the grafting density of the glycocalyx and the backbone length of the polymers constituting the glycocalyx. Furthermore, when coupled with the intrinsic membrane properties such as spontaneous curvature and a line tension along the membrane, the curvature generation properties of the glycocalyx are enhanced. These predictions were tested experimentally by examining the propensity of glycosylated transmembrane proteins to drive the assembly of highly curved filopodial protrusions at the plasma membrane of adherent mammalian cells. Our model also predicts that the glycocalyx has curvature-sensing capabilities, in agreement with the results of our experiments. Thus, our study develops a quantitative framework for mapping the properties of the glycocalyx to the curvature generation capability of the membrane.",

          "abstract": "Natural selection often acts on multiple traits simultaneously. For example, the virus HIV-1 faces pressure to evade host immunity while also preserving replicative fitness. While past work has studied selection during HIV-1 evolution, as in other examples where selection acts on multiple traits, it is challenging to quantitatively separate different contributions to fitness. This task is made more difficult because a single mutation can affect both immune escape and replication. Here, we develop an evolutionary model that disentangles the effects of escaping CD8 + T cell–mediated immunity, which we model as a binary trait, from other contributions to fitness. After validation in simulations, we applied this model to study within-host HIV-1 evolution in a clinical dataset. We observed strong selection for immune escape, sometimes greatly exceeding past estimates, especially early in infection. Conservative estimates suggest that roughly half of HIV-1 fitness gains during the first months to years of infection can be attributed to T cell escape. Our approach is not limited to HIV-1 or viruses and could be adapted to study the evolution of quantitative traits in other contexts.",

          "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast carcinogenesis and drug resistance remain incompletely understood. Elevated expression of CCND1 is linked to enhanced invasiveness, poorer prognosis, and resistance to drug therapies in ER-positive breast cancer. In this study, we identify a highly expressed circular RNA (circRNA) derived from FOXK2 , called circFOXK2, which plays a key role in stabilizing CCND1 mRNA, thereby promoting cell cycle progression, cell growth, and endocrine therapy resistance in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, circFOXK2 binds directly to CCND1 mRNA via RNA–RNA pairing and recruits the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1/HuR, stabilizing the CCND1 mRNA and enhancing CCND1 protein levels. This results in activation of the CCND1–CDK4/6–p-RB–E2F signaling axis, driving the transcription of downstream E2F target genes and facilitating the G1/S transition during cell cycle progression. Notably, targeting circFOXK2 with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO-circFOXK2) suppresses ER-positive breast cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, combination therapy with ASO-circFOXK2 and tamoxifen exhibits synergistic effects and restores tamoxifen sensitivity in tamoxifen-resistant cells. Clinically, high circFOXK2 expression is positively correlated with CCND1 levels in both ER-positive breast cancer cell lines and patient tumor tissues. Overall, our findings reveal the critical role of circFOXK2 in stabilizing the oncogene CCND1 and promoting cancer progression, positioning circFOXK2 as a potential therapeutic target for ER-positive breast cancer in clinical settings.",

To determine the spectrum of molecular mechanisms responsible for this life-threatening condition, we used an integrative approach to determine the biophysical, functional, and trafficking properties of 61 KCNQ1 variants distributed throughout all domains of the channel. Impaired trafficking to the plasma membrane was the most common cause of LOF across all channel domains, often but not always coinciding with protein instability. However, many LOF variants, particularly in transmembrane domains, trafficked normally, but when coexpressed with KCNE1 exhibited impaired conductance, altered voltage dependence, or abnormal gating kinetics, highlighting diverse pathogenic mechanisms. This indicates a need for personalized treatment approaches for LQT1. Use of our data to benchmark variant pathogenicity prediction methods demonstrated that prediction accuracy depends on the exact mechanism of pathogenicity associated with a given variant.",

The beneficial material properties and bioactivity of mucus stem from glycoproteins called mucins, motivating the development of mucin-derived hydrogels for wound dressings and antifouling coatings.

Inspired by the chemical cross-linking and water-tolerant adhesion of marine mussel adhesive structures, we use catechol–thiol bonding to drive gelation of native mucin proteins and synthetic mucin-inspired polymers, forming soft, adhesive hydrogels that can be coated onto diverse surfaces. The gelation dynamics and adhesive properties can be systematically tuned by varying the hydrogel composition, polymer architecture, and thiol availability, with gelation timescales adjustable from seconds to hours, and values of elastic modulus, failure stress, and debonding work spanning orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the functionality of these gels in two applications: as tissue adhesives, using porcine skin as a proxy for human skin, and as bioactive surface coatings to prevent bacterial colonization. The results highlight the potential of catechol–thiol cross-linking as a versatile platform for engineering multifunctional glycoprotein hydrogels with applications in wound repair and antimicrobial surface engineering.",

          "abstract": "Arp2/3 complex generates branched actin networks essential for numerous motile functions of the cell. It comprises seven subunits: actin-related proteins (Arps) 2 and 3 and five scaffolding subunits (ArpC1-5). The complex adopts two major conformations: inactive, with the Arps interacting end-to-end, and active, with the Arps aligned side-by-side like subunits in the actin filament. Activation involves several cofactors, including ATP, WASP-family nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs), actin monomers, and the mother actin filament. NPFs bind to two sites, one on Arp2–ArpC1 and one on Arp3, delivering actin subunits at the barbed end of the Arps to initiate branch elongation. However, the mechanisms by which each NPF drives the equilibrium toward activation remain unclear. We present two cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Arp2/3 complex at 2.9-Å resolution: one with NPFs bound to Arp3 and ArpC1 but not Arp2 and another with NPFs bound to Arp3 and Arp2–ArpC1. The structures reveal that NPF binding to Arp2 is allosterically linked to the release of ArpC5’s N-terminal tail from Arp2 and conformational changes in Arp2, including closure of its ATP-binding cleft and partial rotation and translation toward its position in the active complex at the branch. Previous work identified another allosteric switch linking NPF binding to Arp3 with the release of its inhibitory C-terminal tail, which we also observe. In summary, both NPF-binding sites induce allosteric changes in Arp2/3 complex, collectively shifting the equilibrium toward activation.",

          "abstract": "Modern ecosystems display complex associations of plants–insects that underwent a long evolutionary process since the appearance of mid-Paleozoic vascular plants. Although several major hypotheses explain the evolution of these plant–insect associations, the initial pattern of modern insect herbivory is poorly understood. To understand the antiquity of modern patterns of terrestrial arthropod herbivory, functional feeding group–damage type (FFG-DT) data were used to analyze a 305 My interval from Late Pennsylvanian to present, in which 134 plant assemblages were used to assess turnover (replacement of some species by other species between sites) and nestedness (difference in composition when no species are replaced between sites) in pairwise comparisons of DTs. Results of beta diversity analyses indicate that the prototype pattern for modern insect herbivory was established on gymnosperm-dominated plant assemblages by late Middle Jurassic, antedating angiosperm dominance by 60 My. Turnover among plant groups and FFGs declined in earlier late Paleozoic, whereas during the later Cenozoic, nestedness generally increased. Insect feeding on gymnosperms showed one pattern of change with low turnover and high nestedness, whereas a bimodal pattern characterized angiosperms. Ferns and angiosperms exhibited less DT functional breadth (host-plant “specificity” by herbivores) than gymnosperms, reflecting major differences in links between insect herbivores and their host plants. This fundamental trophic shift is consistent with the Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution, implying top–down control of herbivores by their consumers rather than bottom–up regulation of food sources that shaped the modern herbivory pattern. These findings provide a data-rich account of the ecological origins of modern herbivory.",

Here, we investigated in adolescents the independent roles of the endogenous circadian system and of the behavioral sleep/wake cycle (sleep/wake, fasting/eating, rest/activity, dark/dim light, social interaction, posture, etc.) on self-selected caloric intake using a Forced Desynchrony protocol. Fifty-one male and female adolescents across three weight status categories (24 with healthy weight, 13 with overweight, and 14 with obesity) completed the protocol where participants lived on seven 28-h sleep/wake cycles in dim light during wake and complete darkness during sleep. Results suggest that the circadian system and the behavioral cycle each affected caloric intake, with a decrease across the wake episode and an increase from circadian morning to circadian evening in caloric intake. The endogenous circadian rhythm in caloric intake showed a circadian peak-to-trough difference of 196 [CI 95% 164, 226] kcal per meal with peak timing of 296° [288°, 304°; equivalent to ~17:30 in these participants]. In those with overweight/obesity, more calories were consumed later in the waking episode and later in the circadian cycle, and with blunted amplitudes compared to those with healthy weight. Results implicate both the endogenous circadian system and the behavioral cycle in shaping the daily rhythm of food intake.

          "abstract": "Spacecraft using combustion engines require substantial amounts of oxygen for their propellant. The Moon could be a source of oxygen for rocket propellant, since the material composing the lunar surface can be processed to extract oxygen. However, little is known about overall energy requirements of the processes described in the literature for oxygen extraction from lunar regolith. This knowledge gap constrains the planning of lunar missions, since the scale of energy infrastructure required for oxygen production facilities is not well characterized. This study presents an energy consumption model for oxygen production via hydrogen reduction of the mineral ilmenite (FeTiO 3 ). We consider an end-to-end production chain starting from dry regolith as the feedstock. The production includes the following process steps: excavation, transportation, beneficiation, hydrogen reduction, water electrolysis, liquefaction, and zero boil-off storage. The model predicts the energy demand per kilogram oxygen produced based on adjustable parameters for each process step. As expected, the model indicates a strong dependence on feedstock composition. For regolith composed of 10 wt% ilmenite, the model predicts that a total of 24.3 (± 5.8) kWh is needed per kg of liquid oxygen produced. This study confirms that the hydrogen reduction and electrolysis steps have the highest energy requirements in the production chain. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the enrichment factor of the beneficiation process is the most critical parameter for optimizing energy utilization. Overall, this study provides a parameterized end-to-end model of energy consumption that can serve as a foundation for various production systems on the Moon.",

          "abstract": "Viral proteins frequently mutate to evade host innate immune responses, yet the impact of these mutations on the molecular energy landscape remains unclear. Epistasis, the intramolecular communications between mutations, often renders the combined mutational effects unpredictable. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a major virulence factor of the influenza A virus (IAV) that activates host PI3K by binding to its p85β subunit. Here, we present a deep analysis of the impact of evolutionary mutations in NS1 that emerged between the 1918 pandemic IAV strain and its descendant PR8 strain. Our analysis reveals how the mutations rewired interresidue communications, which underlie long-range allosteric and epistatic networks in NS1. Our findings show that PR8 NS1 binds to p85β with approximately 10-fold greater affinity than 1918 NS1 due to allosteric mutational effects, which are further tuned by epistasis. NMR chemical shift perturbation and methyl-axis order parameter analyses revealed that the mutations induced long-range structural and dynamic changes in PR8 NS1, relative to 1918 NS1, enhancing its affinity to p85β. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations and graph theory-based network analysis for conformational dynamics on the submicrosecond timescales uncover how these mutations rewire the dynamic network, which underlies the allosteric epistasis. Significantly, we find that conformational dynamics of residues with high betweenness centrality play a crucial role in communications between network communities and are highly conserved across influenza A virus evolution. These findings advance our mechanistic understanding of the allosteric and epistatic communications between distant residues and provide insight into their role in the molecular evolution of NS1.",

          "abstract": "Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are sets of often heterologous genes that are genetically and functionally linked. Among eukaryotes, BGCs are most common in plants and fungi and ensure the coexpression of the different enzymes coordinating the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites. Here, we report the identification of a withanolide BGC in Physalis grisea (ground-cherry), a member of the nightshade family ( Solanaceae ). A combination of transcriptomic, epigenomic, and metabolic analyses revealed that, following a duplication event, this BGC evolved two tissue-specifically expressed subclusters, containing several pairs of paralogs that contribute to related but distinct biochemical processes; this subfunctionalization is tightly associated with epigenetic features and the local chromatin environment. The two subclusters appear strictly isolated from each other at the structural chromatin level, each forming a highly self-interacting chromatin domain with tissue-dependent levels of condensation. This correlates with gene expression in either above- or below-ground tissue, thus spatially separating the production of different withanolide compounds. By comparative phylogenomics, we show that the withanolide BGC most likely evolved before the diversification of the Solanaceae family and underwent lineage-specific diversifications and losses. The tissue-specific subfunctionalization is common to species of the Physalideae tribe but distinct from other, independent duplication events outside of this clade. In sum, our study reports on an instance of an epigenetically modulated subfunctionalization within a BGC and sheds light on the biosynthesis of withanolides, a highly diverse group of steroidal triterpenoids important in plant defense and amenable to pharmaceutical applications due to their anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, and anticancer properties.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are capable of writing grammatical text that follows instructions, answers questions, and solves problems. As they have advanced, it has become difficult to distinguish their output from human-written text. While past research has found some differences in features such as word choice and punctuation and developed classifiers to detect LLM output, none has studied the rhetorical styles of LLMs. Using several variants of Llama 3 and GPT-4o, we construct two parallel corpora of human- and LLM-written texts from common prompts. Using Douglas Biber’s set of lexical, grammatical, and rhetorical features, we identify systematic differences between LLMs and humans and between different LLMs. These differences persist when moving from smaller models to larger ones and are larger for instruction-tuned models than base models. This observation of differences demonstrates that despite their advanced abilities, LLMs struggle to match human stylistic variation. Attention to more advanced linguistic features can hence detect patterns in their behavior not previously recognized.",

          "abstract": "In aqueous ammonium-ion storage, hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in the reversible insertion/extraction of NH 4 + within transition metal oxides/hydroxides. Although fluorine (F) is known for its strong electronegativity and potential to form robust hydrogen bonds with NH 4 + , its specific influence on NH 4 + storage remains unexplored. Herein, we systematically investigate the effects of F-based hydrogen bond chemistry within a layered double hydroxide matrix, where F species are introduced and subsequently partially removed via an electrochemical method. Our findings demonstrate that while increasing F doping content accelerates NH 4 + diffusion due to F’s strong electronegativity, it also triggers crystal shrinkage and depresses storage capacity. To this end, controlled partial removal of F, employing a lye-assistant electrochemical strategy, induces expanded interlayer spacing and distinct edge lattice tearing, thereby facilitating improved NH 4 + accommodation. The retained F sites couple with emerging exposed O sites maintain a high hydrogen bonding capability, which is further enhanced by the formation of highly active, curved hydroxyl groups centered around F sites. These manipulations significantly boost the NH 4 + storage performance of the electrode, providing insights into leveraging the strongest F-based hydrogen bond chemistry in developing high-performance ammonium-ion energy storage devices.",

          "abstract": "The collective influence of animals on the processes shaping the Earth’s surface remains largely unknown, with most studies limited to individual species and well-known exemplars. To establish the global geomorphic significance of animals, we systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence across freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. Over 600 animal taxa had reported geomorphic effects. For the 495 wild animals and 5 livestock identified to species level, we estimated their global abundance, and collective biomass and energy. While our census is global in scope, a lack of research in the tropics and subtropics, and on less visible animals, leaves them underrepresented in analyses. Most reported species are globally widespread, but some are rare, endemic, and/or threatened, leading to risks that key geomorphic processes cease before we fully understand them. We estimate the collective biomass in wild animal geomorphic agents at ≈0.2 Mt Carbon, equating to a biological energy content of ≈7.6 million GJ. If a conservative minimum 1% of this energy contributes to geomorphic work annually, this yields an energy contribution from wild animal geomorphic agents of ≈76,000 GJ—equivalent to the energy of hundreds of thousands of extreme floods. Uncertainties in biomass estimates and energy partitioning mean this value could credibly be an order of magnitude higher, and countless species remain unreported or undiscovered. The livestock estimates exceed the wild animals estimates by three orders of magnitude. The geomorphic energy of animals is far more influential than previously recognized and future losses, dispersal and introductions of zoogeomorphic species may induce substantive landscape changes.",

          "abstract": "Dark-field microscopy is a technique used in optical microscopy to increase the contrast in unstained samples, making it possible to observe details that would otherwise be difficult to see under bright-field microscopy; thus, it has been widely employed in biological research, material science, and medical diagnostics. However, most dark-field microscopy methods cannot overcome the optical diffraction limit and require a bulky dark-field condenser and precise alignment of each optical element. In this study, we introduce a planar photonic device that can produce random speckles for dark-field illumination and improve the optical resolution. This planar device is made of random distribution fibers for injection of a laser beam, a scattering layer to produce random speckles, a one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPC) to produce a hollow cone of light, and a metallic film to increase the energy efficiency. This planar device can work as a substrate for conventional microscopy. Taking advantage of the hollow cone of light with random speckles generated by the proposed planar device, we achieve a high-contrast, label-free image with a 1.55-fold improvement in spatial resolution. Furthermore, random evanescent speckles can be generated on the 1DPC just through tuning the incident wavelength, which demonstrates the ability for optical surface imaging beyond the diffraction limit. The advantage of this technique is that it does not require complex optical system or precise knowledge of the illumination pattern. This study will expand the potential applications of dark-field microscopy and provide insights into samples that might otherwise be invisible under traditional dark-field microscopy.",

At the same time, quantum computing likely will not supplant classical computing in the foreseeable future—after all, quantum computing architectures are best equipped to solve certain problems, but not every problem. Quantum computers almost certainly will work in concert with classical processing, where each computing architecture will handle those parts of a calculation that it is best suited to tackle. For that to happen, the quantum computing hardware will require software that combines quantum with classical computing.

In this study, we demonstrated that mice exhibit rescue-like social behaviors toward unresponsive conspecifics, characterized by intense physical contact and grooming directed at the recipient’s facial and mouth areas, which expedite their recovery from unresponsiveness. We identified the medial amygdala (MeA) as a key region that encodes the unresponsive state of others and drives this head-directed physical contact. Notably, the behavioral responses toward unresponsive conspecifics differed from those directed at awake, stressed individuals, and these responses were differentially represented in the MeA.

The latter intense actions, more prominent in familiar pairs, begin after prolonged immobility and unresponsiveness and cease when the partner regains activity. Their consequences, including improved airway opening and clearance and accelerated recovery from unconsciousness, suggest rescue-like efforts. Oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus respond differentially to the presence of unconscious versus active partners, and their activation, along with oxytocin signaling, is required for the reviving-like actions. This tendency to assist unresponsive members may enhance group cohesion and survival of social species.",

Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect–induced Lorentz force’s direction. We show that at LPBF length scales, electromagnetic damping is weak, and for alloys with a large Seebeck coefficient, TEMHD becomes the dominant mechanism controlling flow behind the keyhole.",

Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine 5′-triphosphate (dITP) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates downstream effector to mediate cellular NAD + depletion, resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells.

We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O 2 ) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O 2 on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity.",

We analyzed immune receptor datasets from 593 individuals to develop MAchine Learning for Immunological Diagnosis, an interpretive framework to screen for multiple illnesses simultaneously or precisely test for one condition. This approach detects specific infections, autoimmune disorders, vaccine responses, and disease severity differences. Human-interpretable features of the model recapitulate known immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza, and human immunodeficiency virus, highlight antigen-specific receptors, and reveal distinct characteristics of systemic lupus erythematosus and type-1 diabetes autoreactivity. This analysis framework has broad potential for scientific and clinical interpretation of immune responses.",

          "abstract": "The vision of robotic materials—cohesive collectives of robotic units that can arrange into virtually any form with any physical properties—has long intrigued both science and fiction. Yet, this vision requires a fundamental physical challenge to be overcome: The collective must be strong, to support loads, yet flow, to take new forms. We achieve this in a material-like robotic collective by modulating the interunit tangential forces to control topological rearrangements of units within a tightly packed structure. This allows local control of rigidity transitions between solid and fluid-like states in the collective and enables spatiotemporal control of shape and strength. We demonstrate structure-forming and healing and show the collective supporting 700 newtons (500 times the weight of a robot) before “melting” under its own weight.",

Adding a single C(sp 3 )-atom surrounded by four σ-C–C bonds, which opens up the three-dimensional space, is an unresolved problem in synthetic chemistry. We report the synthesis and application of the diazosulfur ylide Ph 2 S=C=N 2 reagent that combines the reactivity of both sulfur ylides and diazo compounds to create carbon spiro-centers in a general fashion by the sequential or single-step installation of a C(sp 3 )-atom. New C–C and C–X (where X is O or N) bonds can be created around the C(sp 3 )-atom, which can ultimately be extended to four C–C σ-bonds in one step without resorting to transition metal catalysis.

However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the uptake of α-syn fibrils remain unclear. In this work, we identified FAM171A2 as a PD risk gene that affects α-syn aggregation. Overexpressing FAM171A2 promotes α-syn fibril endocytosis and exacerbates the spread and neurotoxicity of α-syn pathology. Neuronal-specific knockdown of FAM171A2 expression shows protective effects. Mechanistically, the FAM171A2 extracellular domain 1 interacts with the α-syn C terminus through electrostatic forces, with &gt;1000 times more selective for fibrils. Furthermore, we identified bemcentinib as an effective blocker of FAM171A2–α-syn fibril interaction with an in vitro binding assay, in cellular models, and in mice. Our findings identified FAM171A2 as a potential receptor for the neuronal uptake of α-syn fibrils and, thus, as a therapeutic target against PD.",

However, the idea that mutation can become biased toward adaptive outcomes remains controversial. In this work, we report the evolution of enhanced evolvability through localized hypermutation in experimental populations of bacteria. The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change. Lineages with localized hypermutability were more likely to acquire additional adaptive mutations, revealing an unanticipated benefit.",

In the American system, a federal research grant comes with one component that pays the direct costs of research—covering salaries of the researchers and supplies and equipment they use—and a so-called indirect component that represents the government’s contribution to facilities and administration—the overhead necessary to do the work. The indirect contribution does not cover everything needed to support the research; the remainder is provided by the university. This agreement between higher education and the government has been a hallmark of the funding system for 70 years. The scientific community must unite in speaking out against this betrayal of a partnership that has enabled American innovation and progress.",

ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to alignment to improve its fidelity. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins.

However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power owing to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations revealed a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow, over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, the ice quake cascades appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude with those measured geodetically, providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations.",

The cryo–electron microscopy structures of CAAD in its apo and activated forms, together with biochemical evidence, revealed how cA 4 or cA 6 binds to the CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domain and abrogates CAAD autoinhibition, inducing substantial conformational changes that reshape the structure of CAAD and induce its deaminase activity.

HARMONI operates at subsecond resolution, estimating 3D mesh representations and spatial interactions of humans, and adapts to challenging natural environments using an environment-targeted synthetic data generation module. Deployed on 500 hours from the SEEDLingS dataset, HARMONI generates detailed quantitative measurements of 3D human behavior previously unattainable through manual efforts or 2D methods. HARMONI identifies longitudinal trends in child-caregiver interaction, including child movement, body pose, dyadic touch, visibility, and conversational turns. The integrated visual and audio analysis further reveals multimodal trends, including associations between child conversational turns and movement. Open-sourced for large-scale analysis, HARMONI facilitates advancements in human development research. HARMONI achieves 63 to 80% consistency on key attributes with human annotators on SEEDLingS and 84 to 93% consistency on videos taken from a laboratory setting while achieving &gt;100 times savings in time.",

          "abstract": "Most wounds form scars without hair follicles. However, in the wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN) model of skin regeneration, wounds regenerate hair follicles if tissue rigidity is optimal. Although WIHN depends on Wnt signaling, whether Wnt performs a mechanoregulatory role that contributes to regeneration remains uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that Wnt signaling affects mechanosensitivity at both cellular and tissue levels to drive WIHN. Atomic force microscopy revealed an attenuated substrate rigidity response in epidermal but not dermal cells of healing wounds. Super-resolution microscopy and nanoneedle probing of intracellular compartments in live human keratinocytes revealed that Wnt-induced chromatin remodeling triggers a 10-fold drop in nuclear rigidity without jeopardizing the nucleocytoskeletal mechanical coupling. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling orchestrated a massive reorganization of actin architecture and recruited adherens junctions to generate a mechanical syncytium—a cohesive contractile unit with superior capacity for force coordination and collective durotaxis. Collectively, our findings unveil Wnt signaling’s mechanoregulatory role that manipulates the machinery of mechanotransduction to drive regeneration.",

          "abstract": "Internal tides profoundly influence diapycnal mixing and marine ecosystems in oceans worldwide. Previous estimates on internal tides focused regionally spanning a decade, leaving a knowledge gap regarding their long-term global behavior, especially over centuries. Because of limited long-term observations, a critical question arises: How will global warming affect internal tides? Using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the High-Resolution Empirical Tidal (HRET) model, we identify a robust accelerating trend in globally averaged internal tide speeds. This trend, increasing from historical rates (0.4 centimeters per second per decade) to future projections (2.0 centimeters per second per decade), is primarily driven by intensified upper-ocean stratification, with background currents playing a secondary role. Our findings suggest that internal tides propagate faster in a warming climate, potentially influencing energy cascade and marine biological productivity.",

          "abstract": "Marine photoautotrophs have evolved to exploit the ocean’s variable light conditions, with chromatic acclimators being able to adjust their pigment content to better match the ambient light color. The impact of chromatic acclimation on phytoplankton distribution and competition is not well understood despite its global importance. This study explores chromatic acclimation’s role in shaping the biogeography of Synechococcus , a widespread cyanobacterium. We integrated three pigment types into a global ecosystem model: a green-light specialist, a blue-light specialist, and a chromatic acclimator. Laboratory studies defined each type’s specific absorption properties. Our results indicate that chromatic acclimation offers an evolutionary advantage by enabling Synechococcus to adapt to varying light environments. This ability to mimic blue- and green-light specialists and enhance absorption at intermediate states, particularly in areas with high seasonal light variations, increases Synechococcus distribution and biomass. Thus, chromatic acclimation affects ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical processes in the ocean.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are emerging as a promising platform for epitaxial growth, largely free from the constraints of lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficient mismatches. Among them, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), known for their superior electrical properties, are ideal for ultrathin semiconductor applications. Their unique epitaxial characteristics enable seamless integration with 3D materials, facilitating the development of gate stacks and heterojunction devices. In this regard, developing a process for growing high-quality 3D epitaxial materials before and after the growth of 2D TMDs and understanding the 2D/3D interface are crucial. This study demonstrates the sequential growth of fully epitaxial ZnSe/MoSe 2 /ZnSe heterostructures using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. ZnSe and MoSe 2 , sharing chalcogen elements, enable large-area quasi van der Waals epitaxy with sharp interfaces without intermediate phase. Multiscale analysis involving transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals lattice commensurability, van der Waals gaps, termination, and interfacial reconstruction. Understanding these interactions is crucial for advancing multidimensional integration of 2D and 3D materials.",

How the chirality of the entanglements is deterministically created and how the chirality conversion is actuated in the disclinations with Möbius strip topology have never been explored. Here, we create colloidal entanglements with designed chirality in the nematic disclination loops with Möbius topology. An irreversible process of chirality change is revealed if we move the colloidal entanglement along the loops. A nonreciprocal chirality conversion in the dynamical colloidal entanglements is demonstrated, which is induced by the interplay between topological profiles and the geometrical curvature of the disclination loop. Colloidal entanglements in opposite chirality are templated in arbitrary shapes of disclination lines. This work opens opportunities to design smart colloidal materials.",

          "abstract": "Cytosolic aggregation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43) is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Here, we report that during oxidative stress, TDP-43 becomes SUMO2/3-ylated by the SUMO E3 ligase protein PIAS4 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4) and enriches in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). Upon pharmacological inhibition of TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation or PIAS4 depletion, TDP-43 enrichment in SGs is accompanied by irreversible aggregation. In cells that are unable to assemble SGs, SUMO2/3-ylation of TDP-43 is strongly impaired, supporting the notion that SGs are compartments that promote TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation during oxidative stress. Binding of TDP-43 to UG-rich RNA antagonizes PIAS4-mediated SUMO2/3-ylation, while RNA dissociation promotes TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation. We conclude that SUMO2/3 protein conjugation is a cellular mechanism to stabilize cytosolic RNA-free TDP-43 against aggregation.",

We also present an experimental generation of hybrid toroidal vortex pulses by a compact coaxial horn emitter augmented with a radial metasurface. These topological pulses exhibit peculiar electromagnetic features, such as vortex streets, skyrmions, and transverse orbital angular momentum, and may present advantages when propagating through perturbations, opening avenues for enhanced free-space information transmission, topologically nontrivial light-matter interaction, and microscopy techniques.",

          "abstract": "Hebbian plasticity has long dominated neurobiological models of memory formation. Yet, plasticity rules operating on one-shot episodic memory timescales rarely depend on both pre- and postsynaptic spiking, challenging Hebbian theory in this crucial regime. Here, we present an episodic memory model governed by a simpler rule depending only on presynaptic activity. We show that this rule, capitalizing on high-dimensional neural activity with restricted transitions, naturally stores episodes as paths through complex state spaces like those underlying a world model. The resulting memory traces, which we term path vectors, are highly expressive and decodable with an odor-tracking algorithm. We show that path vectors are robust alternatives to Hebbian traces, support one-shot sequential and associative recall, along with policy learning, and shed light on specific hippocampal plasticity rules. Thus, non-Hebbian plasticity is sufficient for flexible memory and learning and well-suited to encode episodes and policies as paths through a world model.",

          "abstract": "Osteoporosis and bone injury healing in elderly patients are major medical challenges, often exacerbated by the accumulation of senescent cells. Herein, we show that TPE-Gal, which contains a tetraphenylethene unit and a galactose moiety, offers a promising molecular therapy designed to light up and eliminate senescent cells through a hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by β-galactosidase, an enzyme overexpressed in senescent cells. The reaction produces TPE-OH, which, in turn, increases reactive oxygen species levels within the senescent cells, leading to noninflammatory apoptosis of senescent cells. This targeted clearance mechanism helps to alleviate osteoporosis symptoms and promotes bone injury healing. Moreover, apoptotic vesicles, which are generated during the process, are partly phagocytosed by macrophages, mimicking physiological metabolic processes. This study opens new avenues for addressing bone health issues through the designed bioclearance of senescent cells, aligning with the body’s natural pathways for maintaining homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "In the process of DNA replication, the first steps in restoring the chromatin landscape involve parental histone recycling and new histone deposition. Disrupting histone recycling to either the leading or lagging strand induces asymmetric histone inheritance, affecting epigenome maintenance and cellular identity. However, the order and kinetics of these effects remain elusive. Here, we use inducible mutants to dissect the early and late consequences of impaired histone recycling. Simultaneous disruption of both leading (POLE4) and lagging strand (MCM2-2A) recycling pathways impairs the transmission of parental histones to newly synthesized DNA, releasing some parental histones to the soluble pool. Subsequently, H3K27me3 accumulates aberrantly during chromatin restoration in a manner preceding gene expression changes. Loss of histone inheritance and the ensuing chromatin restoration defects alter gene expression in embryonic stem cells and challenge differentiation programs and cell viability. Our findings demonstrate the importance of efficient transmission of histone-based information during DNA replication for maintaining chromatin landscapes, differentiation potential, and cellular viability.",

The current approaches are difficult in effectively inducing TLS formation, let alone fully exploiting its anticancer efficacy. Here, a biomimetic nanovesicle (ADU-S@M1) is constructed to target tumors and then to produce abundant activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in situ by polarizing the tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype and promoting dendritic cell maturation. These activated APCs effectively initiate the TLS de novo neogenesis by acting as lymphoid tissue inducer cells that secrete lymphotoxin α and tumor necrosis factor α while normalizing the intratumoral vasculatures. In addition, they induce robust in situ adaptive immune responses by presenting the antigens released from the M1 cell–destroyed tumors and transporting them to the nearby TLS. Therefore, the development of tumors in mice, especially immune-cold tumors, was efficiently prevented, providing a promising strategy for promoting cancer immunotherapy.",

A promising mechanism for large-scale natural H 2 generation is serpentinization of exhumed mantle material. We study this serpentinization-related H 2 generation during rifting and subsequent rift-inversion orogen development using numerical geodynamic models. Serpentinization-related H 2 generation is best known from rifted margins and spreading ridges. However, because orogens are colder than rift environments, conditions for serpentinization and natural H 2 generation are considerably better in orogenic settings: We find that yearly H 2 generation capacity from serpentinization in the overriding mantle wedge during rift inversion may be up to 20 times larger than during rifting. Moreover, suitable reservoirs and seals required for economic H 2 accumulations to form are readily available in rift-inversion orogens but are likely absent during bulk serpentinization in rift settings. Together with indications of ongoing natural H 2 generation in the Balkans and Pyrenees, our model results provide a first-order motivation for natural H 2 exploration in rift-inversion orogens.",

One well-explored example is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, where experimental development is grounded in decades-old theory, but structural dynamics are not easily integrated into this picture. Here, we introduce an approach that selectively excites NMR resonances that undergo chemical exchange while suppressing the signal arising from nondynamic components of the system. We show that for exchange rates spanning more than four orders of magnitude, one can still selectively excite spins undergoing exchange while suppressing static resonances. Generalizing this approach, to selectively excite (or selectively preserve) only members of an ensemble that have undergone exchange or rearrangement, has the potential to improve the analytical power of many spectroscopic techniques.",

Our case study is Mono Lake in California, which has close to 1 millimolar dissolved P at steady state despite extremely high rates of biological productivity, in contrast to smaller closed basins where life is scarce. Hence, large closed-basin lakes offer an environment where high rates of prebiotic P productivity can plausibly coexist with high steady-state P concentrations.

The ruthenium-catalyzed system can accommodate acid-sensitive functional groups and challenging low-reactivity acceptors.

Here, we unveil a single-protein mechanism for ionic strength sensing and mitigation in animal cells, one that is notably different from the analogous high osmolarity glycerol kinase cascade in yeast. The Rel family transcription factor NFAT5 directly senses intracellular ionic strength using a C-terminal prion-like domain (PLD). In response to elevated intracellular ionic strength, this PLD is necessary and sufficient to coordinate an adaptive gene expression program by recruiting the transcriptional coactivator BRD4. The purified NFAT5 PLD forms condensates in response to elevated solution ionic strength in vitro, and human NFAT5 alone is sufficient to reconstitute a mammalian transcriptional response to ionic stress in yeast. We propose that ion-sensitive conformational changes in a PLD directly regulate transcription to maintain ionic strength homeostasis in animal cells.",

          "abstract": "N 2 -fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) sustain life on our planet by providing biologically available nitrogen to plants. In the oceans, cyanobacterial diazotrophs, mostly prevalent in warm tropical and subtropical waters, were traditionally considered the sole contributors to marine N 2 fixation. Recently, an almost ubiquitous distribution of N 2 -fixing heterotrophic bacteria has been discovered in the pelagic ocean. However, the mechanisms enabling heterotrophic diazotrophs to thrive in cold high-latitude waters and their contribution to the global nitrogen budget are unknown. Using a data-driven cell-based metabolic model, we show that heterotrophic bacteria inside sinking particles can fix N 2 over a wide range of temperatures, explaining their ubiquitous presence in the oceans. We estimate that heterotrophic diazotrophs account for about 10% of global marine N 2 fixation, with the highest contribution in oxygen minimum zones. These findings call for a reassessment of the N 2 fixation patterns and the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in the global ocean.",

This unique function renders them appealing for the construction of dynamic molecular systems, actuating materials, and molecular machines.

Herein, a series of highly photoefficient visible-light–responsive molecular motors (MMs), featuring various rotary speeds, was obtained by a convenient one-step formylation of their parent motors. This strategy greatly improves all aspects of the performance of MMs—red-shifted wavelengths of excitation, high photoisomerization quantum yields, and high photostationary state distributions of isomers—beyond the state-of-the-art light-responsive MM systems. The development of this late-stage functionalization strategy of MMs opens avenues for the construction of high-performance molecular machines and devices for applications in materials science and biological systems, representing a major advance in the synthetic toolbox of molecular machines.",

Improving catalytic reactivity and reducing energy consumption are urgently needed but remain challenging. Here, we report an unexplored associative strategy to realize DME formation at room temperature and the generation of olefins even at 413 kelvin, which is achieved by coinjecting basic acetone to manipulate the local chemical microenvironment of the methanol reactant inside the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The crucial role of acetone in accelerating methanol direct dehydration to DME is highlighted as the obvious destabilization effect for the adsorbed methanol cluster with strong hydrogen bonds and the subsequent traction of water during DME formation. These findings offer more insights into the rational design of reaction systems by manipulating the local surroundings to regulate catalytic performances and should represent a large step forward in methanol conversion technology.",

Yet, wildfires rely on the availability of ignition and fuel, which are underrepresented in fire forecast and prediction practices. By analyzing satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis, here we show that near-surface weather only partially captures wildfire occurrence and intensity across the daily to seasonal timescales. Beyond near-surface weather, convection and fuel abundance play a complementary role in regulating burning processes. Specifically, enhanced atmospheric convection is identified for over 40% of the low-human-impact regions and 61% of global burnable areas during wildfire ignition and spreading periods. Meanwhile, 56% of shrublands and 54% of grasslands see higher fuel load with actual occurrence of fire. Our results highlight the role of convection and fuel in wildfire forecast, prompting a revisit of wildfire prediction under intertwined atmospheric and terrestrial changes.",

We applied representational similarity analysis to human intracranial electroencephalography to track the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying the reinstatement and transformation of memory traces. Specifically, we examined how reinstatement and transformation of item-specific representations across occipital, ventral visual, and lateral parietal cortices contribute to successful memory formation and recognition. Our findings suggest that reinstatement in temporal cortex and transformation in parietal cortex coexist and provide complementary strategies for recognition. Further, we find that generalization and differentiation of neural representations contribute to memory and probe memory-specific correspondence with deep neural network (DNN) model features.

However, the mechanisms regulating this conversion remain unclear. In this study, we showed that removal of toxic and bitter SGAs is under the control of DNA demethylation, ethylene, and key transcription factors by forming a feedback loop that governs the expression of key GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM ( GAME ) genes during ripening. Moreover, the ethylene-inducible transcription factors NON-RIPENING, RIPENING INHIBITOR, and FRUITFULL1 coordinately regulate the expression of GAME31 , GAME40 , GAME5 , and the glycoalkaloid transporter gene GORKY , whereas jasmonic acid–induced MYC2 modulates the transcription of GAME36 .

They rely on inventories of past landslide locations, which are difficult to collect and often nonrepresentative. Furthermore, susceptibility maps are most needed in regions without the means to assemble an inventory. To overcome these challenges, we develop a method for assessing shallow landslide susceptibility based on a probabilistic morphometric analysis of the landscape’s topography, rather than the characteristics of landslides. The model assumes that hillslopes with higher relief and gradient compared to the surrounding landscape are more prone to landslides. We demonstrate the superior performance of this approach over contrasting data-driven models across the northwestern United States. As our morphometric model only requires elevation data, it overcomes the major limitations of data-driven models and facilitates the creation of effective susceptibility models in areas where it was previously unfeasible.",

Fortuitously, we discovered an anoxic deep-sea brine pool sited close enough to shore to chronicle floods, yet be otherwise undisturbed by animals. Cores retrieved from the pool delivered a 1600-year rainfall record. We merge these core-layer histories with modern rainfall statistics, satellite observations, and simulations to deliver a high-resolution quantitative Late Holocene hydroclimate record for Arabia. We find that the modern era is 2.5 times drier than the last 1.6 thousand years. The Little Ice Age stands out as particularly wet. That period experienced a fivefold increase in rainfall intensity compared to today. Though hyperarid now, the flood layers demonstrate that climate shifts can generate weather conditions unwitnessed in the modern era.

This protocol enables the simultaneous transmission of information and key exchange using the same single photons and is robust against loss and error because it uses error correction and spectrum expansion techniques. In a proof-of-principle demonstration using weak coherent pulses, the system achieved a real-time secure transmission rate of 2.38 kilobits per second over a 104.8-kilometer standard telecommunication fiber, which set world records in both aspects.

Alteration in microglial numbers has been associated with abnormal behaviors akin to those observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. Consequently, establishing the appropriate microglial numbers during development is crucial for ensuring normal cortical function. Here, we uncovered a dynamic relationship between pyramidal cells and microglia that tunes microglial numbers and development through distinct phases of mouse postnatal development. Changes in pyramidal cell activity during development induce differential release of activity-dependent proteins such as Activin A, which, in turn, adjusts microglial numbers accordingly. Decoupling of this relationship not only changes microglial numbers but has a long-term consequence on their role as synaptic organizers, which ultimately affects cortical function. Our findings reveal that microglia adapt their numbers to changes in pyramidal cell activity during a critical time window in development, consequently adjusting their numbers and function to the demands of the developing local circuits.",

In this study, we suppress first-cycle voltage hysteresis and irreversible O 2 evolution in Li-rich oxide cathodes through covalency competition induced by the substitution of electropositive groups. We found that the nonequivalent electron distribution within an asymmetric M A -O-M B backbone (metal-to-metal charge transfer via oxygen ligands) increases electron density on electronegative transition metal ions, preventing them from reaching unstable oxidation states within an operating voltage range. This phenomenon is observed across diverse transition metal combinations, providing insights into controlling unnecessary oxygen redox activity. Our findings open new avenues for controlling intrinsic redox chemistry and enabling the rational design of high–energy density Li-rich oxide cathodes.",

However, the function and mechanism of posttranscriptional chemical modifications, especially the newly identified N 4 -acetylcytidine (ac 4 C) modification catalyzed by N -acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), are unknown. In this study, we developed a low-input ac 4 C sequencing technology, ac 4 C LACE-seq, and mapped 8241 ac 4 C peaks at the whole-transcriptome level using 50 mouse oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage. Oocyte-specific Nat10 knockout wiped out ac 4 C signals in oocytes and caused severe defects in meiotic maturation and female infertility. Mechanically, Nat10 deletion led to a failure of ac 4 C deposition on mRNAs encoding key maternal factors, which regulate transcriptome stability and maternal-to-zygotic transition. Nat10 -deleted oocytes showed decreased mRNA translation efficiency due to the direct inhibition of ac 4 C sites on specific transcripts during meiotic maturation. In summary, we developed a low-input, high-sensitivity mRNA ac 4 C profiling approach and highlighted the important physiological function of ac 4 C in the precise regulation of oocyte meiotic maturation by enhancing translation efficiency.",

We present previously unknown observational evidence that the atlantification processes are strengthening in the eastern Eurasian Basin. The primary example is the diminishing sea ice, which is related to a powerful ocean-heat/ice-albedo feedback, which accelerates sea-ice losses. Furthermore, we observe that atlantification is extending far beyond the Lomonosov Ridge into the Makarov Basin of the Arctic Ocean where upper ocean ventilation creates a new and unique ecological environment. The eastern part of the Siberian Arctic Ocean is still strongly stratified, but the atlantification-driven shoaling of warm, salty, and nutrient-rich intermediate waters already has important ecological consequences there. Disentangling the role of atlantification in multiple and complex high-latitude changes should be a priority in future modeling and observational efforts.",

TLISA uses a split T7 RNA polymerase fused to affinity domains against a protein. The target antigen drives polymerase reassembly, inducing reporter expression. We characterize the platform and then demonstrate its modularity by using 16 affinity domains against four different antigens with minimal protocol optimization. We show that TLISA is suitable for POC use by sensing human biomarkers in serum and saliva with a colorimetric readout within 1 hour and by demonstrating functionality after lyophilization.

We confirm our theoretical findings in the microwave experiment by measuring the extinction spectra of subwavelength Mie-resonant ceramic rings.

In this work, we propose a passive modulated ultrasound (PMU) principle for IMDs and develop a circuit-free ultrasonic system (CUS) for thoracic pressure monitoring. The PMU principle can passively modulate monitored physiological signals into ultrasound pulses without using electrical circuits or power supply. The size of the developed CUS is only 2.5 millimeters in radius and 850 micrometers in height. Animal experiments demonstrated that the CUS, with a high sensitivity (−22.96 millivolts per kilopascal), can monitor thoracic pressure to assist in diagnosing different heart diseases, including cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction.

To test this proposal, we introduced algal particulate matter (APM) to marine sediments underlying a modern marine oxygen minimum zone with bottom-water oxygen concentrations approximating those of the late Neoproterozoic water column. We found that under anoxia, APM significantly stimulated microbial eukaryote gene expression, particularly genes involved in anaerobic energy metabolism and phagocytosis, and increased the relative abundance of 18 S rRNA from known predatory clades. We additionally confirmed that APM promoted the reproduction of benthic foraminifera under anoxia with higher-than-expected net growth efficiencies. Overall, our findings suggest that algal biomass exported to the Neoproterozoic benthos stimulated the ecology of benthic predatory protists under anoxia, thereby creating more modern food webs by enhancing the transfer of fixed carbon and energy to eukaryotes occupying higher trophic levels, including the earliest benthic metazoans.",

Hematopoietic-specific Mto1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice were embryonic lethal and showed niche-independent defect in erythroblast proliferation and terminal differentiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes were severely impaired in the Mto1 cKO fetal liver, and this was followed by cytosolic iron accumulation. Overloaded cytosolic iron promoted heme biosynthesis, which induced an unfolded protein response (UPR) in Mto1 cKO erythroblasts. An iron chelator or UPR inhibitor rescued erythroid terminal differentiation in the Mto1 cKO fetal liver in vitro.

Our results revealed fully quantized rotational states of methane with minimal interference from surrounding H 2 molecules, enabling precise determination of the rotational constant for each hydrogen cluster. The cluster-size dependence of the determined rotational constant aligns with behavior predicted by path-integral Monte Carlo simulations, indicating that more than 60% of the hydrogen molecules in the clusters participate in quantum bosonic exchanges, a characteristic feature of superfluidity.

By engineering a resonance at the pump wavelength and leveraging the field enhancement provided by the ENZ effect, the photon pair generation efficiency of the 68-nanometer-thick metasurface is substantially boosted compared to that of an unpatterned indium tin oxide film. More notably, the ENZ metasurface platform facilitates versatile manipulation of the system’s anisotropic second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, enabling direct control over the polarization states of the photon pairs and generating a polarization-entangled Bell state without additional components.

By engineering diagnostic glycosylation sites around test peptide sequences inserted into a host protein, we devised a system that can differentiate between water-soluble, surface-bound, and transmembrane (TM) states of the sequence based on its glycosylation pattern.

This study developed a constriction-based microfluidic device that monitors the deformation of mouse oocytes under controlled pressure. The device can distinguish mechanically aberrant oocyte groups from healthy control ones. On the basis of a mathematical model, we propose that deformability measurements infer both oocyte tension and elasticity, elasticity being the most discriminating factor in our geometry. Despite force transmission during oocyte deformation, no long-term damage was observed.

The MoS 2 channel was squeezed within a distributed Bragg reflector microcavity which was combined with a transparent graphene gate-electrode and a hexagonal boron nitride insulator. We observe trion polaritons with distinct lower polariton branch (LPB) and upper polariton branch (UPB). This allows us to modulate the intensity and energy switchings via gate bias: At gate bias below threshold voltage, both polaritons are decoupled, and above threshold voltage, they are coupled to form LPB-UPB pair, and at high bias, complex polaritons (CPB) emerge due to polariton screening, a phenomenon consistent with Rabi splitting.
