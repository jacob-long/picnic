          "abstract": "The mammalian cerebral cortex comprises a complex neuronal network that maintains a precise balance between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Accumulating evidence indicates that specific interneuron subtypes form stereotyped microcircuits with distinct pyramidal neuron classes1,2,3. Here we show that pyramidal neurons have an active role in this process by promoting the survival and terminal differentiation of their associated interneuron subtypes. In the wild-type cortex, interneuron subtype abundance mirrors the prevalence of their pyramidal neuron partners. In Fezf2 mutants, which lack L5b pyramidal neurons and are expanded in L6 intratelencephalic neurons, corresponding subtype-specific shifts occur through two distinct mechanisms: somatostatin interneurons adjust their programmed cell death, whereas parvalbumin interneurons switch their subtype identity. Silencing neuronal activity or blocking vesicular release in L5b pyramidal neurons revealed that their communication with interneurons does not require voltage-gated synaptic activity but engages both tetanus toxin-sensitive and tetanus toxin-insensitive pathways. Moreover, a targeted bioinformatic screen for ligand–receptor pairs displaying subtype-specific expression and reduced expression of pyramidal neuron-derived ligand in Fezf2 mutants identified candidate secreted factors and adhesion molecules. These findings reveal distinct, pyramidal neuron-driven mechanisms for sculpting interneuron diversity and integrating them into local cortical circuits.",

          "abstract": "Behaviours are adaptive traits evolving through natural selection. Crucially, the genetic, molecular and neural modifications that shape behavioural innovations are poorly understood 1 . Here, we identify specialized adaptations linked to the evolution of invertebrate aggression 2 . Using the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus , we developed a machine learning model from behavioural tracking data and identified robust behavioural states associated with aggressive episodes. Strikingly, predatory aggression coincides with a rewiring of key circuits across nematode evolution. We find modifications to the noradrenergic pathway, with octopamine promoting aggressive predatory bouts whereas tyramine antagonistically induces passive states. Modulation occurs through the octopamine receptors Ppa-ser-3 and Ppa-ser-6 , and tyramine receptor Ppa-lgc-55 . These localize to sensory neurons whose inhibition diminishes aggressive events. Crucially, this octopaminergic innovation emerged within this predatory lineage, consistent with an ancient divergence in function. Thus, evolutionary adaptations in noradrenergic circuits facilitated the emergence of aggressive behavioural states associated with complex predatory traits.",

          "abstract": "Schizophrenia and related psychoses occur in all human populations, with the highest rates of diagnosis among Black individuals and those of mainly African ancestry1. Decades of research have established a highly heritable and polygenic basis for schizophrenia, which is mostly shared across populations2,3,4. However, a recruitment bias towards European cohorts5 has led to discoveries that are poorly generalizable to African populations. This exclusion of the world’s most genetically diverse populations narrows our understanding of disease biology and risks exacerbating health disparities. Here we show that electronic health records linked with genomic data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP)6—a national research programme that looks at the effects of genes, lifestyle, military experiences and exposures on the health and wellness of veterans—enable a comprehensive assessment of schizophrenia genetics in populations of African ancestry in the USA. We identify ancestry-independent associations in African populations and expand the catalogue of implicated regions by more than 100 loci. Through statistical fine-mapping and integrative transcriptomic analyses, we refine disease-associated signals to consensus genes with convergent neurobiological functions. These findings provide a much-needed view of schizophrenia’s genetic architecture in populations of African ancestry, and offer biological insights that both extend previous work and broaden its global relevance.",

          "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases affect 1 in 12 people globally and remain incurable. Central to their pathogenesis is a loss of neuronal protein maintenance and the accumulation of protein aggregates with ageing1,2. Here we engineered bioorthogonal tools3 that enabled us to tag the nascent neuronal proteome and study its turnover with ageing, its propensity to aggregate and its interaction with microglia. We show that neuronal protein half-life approximately doubles on average between 4-month-old and 24-month-old mice, with the stability of individual proteins differing among brain regions. Furthermore, we describe the aged neuronal ‘aggregome’, which encompasses 1,726 proteins, nearly half of which show reduced degradation with age. The aggregome includes well-known proteins linked to diseases and numerous proteins previously not associated with neurodegeneration. Notably, we demonstrate that neuronal proteins accumulate in aged microglia, with 54% also displaying reduced degradation and/or aggregation with age. Among these proteins, synaptic proteins are highly enriched, which suggests that there is a cascade of events that emerge from impaired synaptic protein turnover and aggregation to the disposal of these proteins, possibly through microglial engulfment of synapses. These findings reveal the substantial loss of neuronal proteome maintenance with ageing, which could be causal for age-related synapse loss and cognitive decline.",

          "abstract": "The Afar depression in northeastern Ethiopia contains a rich palaeontological and archaeological record, which documents 6 million years of human evolution. Abundant faunal evidence links evolutionary patterns with palaeoenvironmental change as a principal underlying force1. Many of the earlier hominin taxa recognized today are found in the Afar, but Paranthropus has been conspicuously absent from the region. Here we report on the discovery, in the Mille-Logya research area, of a partial mandible that we attribute to Paranthropus, dated to between 2.5 and 2.9 million years ago and found in a well-understood chronological and faunal context. The find is among the oldest fossils attributable to Paranthropus and indicates that this genus, from its earliest known appearance, had a greater geographic distribution than previously documented2. Often seen as a dietary specialist feeding on tough food, the range of diverse habitats with which eastern African Paranthropus can now be associated shows that this suggested adaptive niche did not restrict its ability to disperse as widely as species of Australopithecus and early Homo. The discovery of Paranthropus in the Afar emphasizes how little is known about hominin evolution in eastern Africa during the crucial period between 3 and 2.5 million years ago, when this genus and the Homo lineage presumably emerged.",

          "abstract": "Crystalline silicates form at high temperatures (>900 K) (refs. 1,2). Their presence in comets3,4,5,6 suggests that high-temperature dust processing occurred in the early Solar System and was subsequently transported outwards to comet-forming regions. However, direct evidence for this crystallization and redistribution in Sun-like protostars has remained unknown. By comparing James Webb Space Telescope mid-infrared spectra of the periodically bursting protostar EC 53 (ref. 7), we detect crystalline silicate (forsterite and enstatite) emission features that appear only during the burst. The emergence of these features indicates active crystal formation by thermal annealing in the hot inner disk during the accretion burst. We also detect a nested outflow—a collimated atomic jet enclosed by slower molecular outflows, consistent with magnetohydrodynamic wind models8. This configuration provides a mechanism for the outward transport of freshly crystallized silicates9. To our knowledge, our results provide the first direct observational evidence of in situ silicate crystallization during episodic accretion bursts in a very young star still embedded in its dense envelope. Although we do not directly detect grains transported to the outer disk, the observed trends are consistent with outward redistribution, indicating that both dust processing and transport occur during the earliest and most dynamic stages of star formation.",

          "abstract": "Fibre electronic devices are transforming traditional fibres and garments into new-generation wearables that can actively interact with human bodies and the environment to shape future life1,2,3,4,5. Fibre electronic devices have achieved almost all of the desired functions, such as powering6,7, sensing8,9 and display10,11 functions. However, viable information-processing fibres, which lie at the heart of building intelligent interactive fibre systems similar to any electronic product, remain the missing piece of the puzzle12,13,14,15. Here we fill this gap by creating a fibre integrated circuit (FIC) with unprecedented microdevice density and multimodal processing capacity. The integration density reaches 100,000 transistors per centimetre, which effectively satisfies the requirements for interactive fibre systems. The FICs can not only process digital and analogue signals similar to typical commercial arithmetic chips but also achieve high-recognition-accuracy neural computing similar to that of the state-of-the-art in-memory image processors. The FICs are stable under harsh service conditions that bulky and planar counterparts have difficulty withstanding, such as repeated bending and abrasion for 10,000 cycles, stretching to 30%, twisting at an angle of 180° cm−1 and even crushing by a container truck weighing 15.6 tons. The realization of FICs enables closed-loop systems in a single fibre, without the need for any external rigid and bulky information processors. We demonstrate that this fully flexible fibre system paves the way for the interaction pattern desired in many cutting-edge applications, for example, brain–computer interfaces, smart textiles and virtual-reality wearables. This work presents new insights that can promote the development of fibre devices towards intelligent systems.",

          "abstract": "Plasticity—the ability of cells to undergo phenotypic transitions—drives cancer progression and therapy resistance1,2,3. Recent studies have suggested that plasticity in solid tumours is concentrated in a minority subset of cancer cells4,5,6, yet functional studies examining this high-plasticity cell state (HPCS) in situ are lacking. Here we develop mouse models enabling the detection, longitudinal lineage tracing and ablation of the HPCS in autochthonous lung tumours in vivo. Lineage tracing reveals that the HPCS cells possess a high capacity for cell state transitions, giving rise to both early neoplastic (differentiated) and progressed lung cancer cell states in situ. Longitudinal lineage tracing using secreted luciferases reveals that HPCS-derived cells have a high capacity for growth compared with bulk cancer cells or another cancer cell state with features of differentiated lung epithelium. Ablation of HPCS cells in early neoplasias abrogates benign-to-malignant transition, whereas ablation in established tumours by suicide gene or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells robustly reduces tumour burden. We further demonstrate that the HPCS gives rise to therapy-resistant cell states, whereas HPCS ablation suppresses resistance to chemotherapy and oncoprotein-targeted therapy. Notably, an HPCS-like state is ubiquitous in regenerating epithelia and in carcinomas of multiple other tissues, revealing a convergence of plasticity programs. Our work establishes the HPCS as a critical hub enabling reciprocal transitions between cancer cell states. Targeting the HPCS in lung cancer and in other carcinomas may suppress cancer progression and eradicate treatment resistance.",

          "abstract": "Sensing technologies that exploit quantum phenomena for measurement are finding increasing applications across materials, physical and biological sciences 1–7 . Until recently, biological candidates for quantum sensors were limited to in vitro systems, had poor sensitivity and were prone to light-induced degradation. These limitations impeded practical biotechnological applications, and high-throughput study that would facilitate their engineering and optimization. We recently developed a class of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins including MagLOV, which overcomes many of these challenges 8 . Here we show that through directed evolution, it is possible to engineer these proteins to alter the properties of their response to magnetic fields and radio frequencies. We find that MagLOV exhibits optically detected magnetic resonance in living bacterial cells at room temperature, at sufficiently high signal-to-noise for single-cell detection. These effects are explained through the radical-pair mechanism, which involves the protein backbone and a bound flavin cofactor. Using optically detected magnetic resonance and fluorescence magnetic-field effects, we explore a range of applications, including spatial localization of fluorescence signals using gradient fields (that is, magnetic resonance imaging using a genetically encoded probe), sensing of the molecular microenvironment, multiplexing of bio-imaging and lock-in detection, mitigating typical biological imaging challenges such as light scattering and autofluorescence. Taken together, our results represent a suite of sensing modalities for engineered biological systems, based on and designed around understanding the quantum-mechanical properties of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins.",

          "abstract": "Tissue-resident macrophages (RTMs) form during embryogenesis, self-renew locally, and regulate tissue homeostasis by clearing dead cells and debris 1–6 . During tissue damage, however, bone-marrow-derived monocytes enter tissues and differentiate into RTMs, repairing the tissue and replenishing macrophages in the niche 1 . The universal cell-intrinsic mechanisms that control the monocyte-to-RTM transition and the maintenance of mature RTMs across tissues remain elusive 3 . Here we show that deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS), an enzyme that mediates spermidine-dependent hypusine modification of translation factor eIF5A 5,7 , is required for RTM differentiation and maintenance. Mice with myeloid cell lack of DHPS ( Dhps -ΔM mice) had a global defect in RTMs across tissues, resulting in persistent but ultimately futile monocyte influx. Transcriptional analyses of DHPS-deficient macrophages indicated a block in their ability to differentiate into mature RTMs, whereas proteomics revealed defects in cell adhesion and signalling pathways. Sequencing of ribosome-engaged transcripts identified a subset of mRNAs involved in cell adhesion and signalling that rely on DHPS for efficient translation. Imaging of DHPS-deficient macrophages in tissues showed differences in morphology and tissue interactions, which were correlated with their failed RTM differentiation. DHPS-deficient macrophages were also defective in critical homeostatic RTM functions including efferocytosis and tissue maintenance. Together, our results demonstrate a cell-intrinsic, tissue-agnostic pathway that drives differentiation of monocyte-derived macrophages into RTMs.",

Here we determined the structure of Escherichia coli LetAB, a phospholipid transporter involved in outer membrane integrity, and found that LetA adopts a distinct architecture that is structurally and evolutionarily unrelated to known transporter families. LetA localizes to the inner membrane, where it is poised to load lipids into its binding partner, LetB, a mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein that forms an approximately 225 Å long tunnel for lipid transport across the cell envelope. Unexpectedly, the LetA transmembrane domains adopt a fold that is evolutionarily related to the eukaryotic tetraspanin family of membrane proteins, including transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) and claudins. Through a combination of deep mutational scanning, molecular dynamics simulations, AlphaFold-predicted alternative states and functional studies, we present a model for how the LetA-like family of membrane transporters facilitates the transport of lipids across the bacterial cell envelope.",

Glacial climate was therefore very different, with colder global mean temperatures and an increased Equator-to-pole temperature gradient, probably resulting in stronger westerlies 2 . However, the state of the deep North Atlantic Ocean under these glacial climate forcings remains uncertain 3–6 , particularly owing to the rarity of deep-ocean temperature and salinity constraints. Here we show that the temperature of the glacial deep (&gt;1.5 km) Northwest Atlantic was approximately 0–2 °C (only 1.8 ± 0.5 °C (2 s.e.) colder than today), and, after accounting for the whole-ocean change, seawater δ 18 O was 0.3 ± 0.1‰ (2 s.e.) higher and can be traced back to the surface subtropics via the subpolar Northeast Atlantic and Nordic Seas. Together, our hydrographic data reveal the thermal and isotopic structure of the deep Northwest Atlantic and suggest sustained production of relatively warm and probably salty North Atlantic Deep Water during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Although abnormal crossover recombination is known to confer risk for aneuploidy 3,4 , limited data have hindered understanding of the potential shared genetic basis of these key molecular phenotypes. To address this gap, we performed retrospective analysis of pre-implantation genetic testing data from 139,416 in vitro fertilized embryos from 22,850 sets of biological parents. By tracing transmission of haplotypes, we identified 3,809,412 crossovers, as well as 92,485 aneuploid chromosomes. Counts of crossovers were lower in aneuploid versus euploid embryos, consistent with their role in chromosome pairing and segregation. Our analyses further revealed that a common haplotype spanning the meiotic cohesin SMC1B is associated significantly with both crossover count and maternal meiotic aneuploidy, with evidence supporting a non-coding cis -regulatory mechanism. Transcriptome- and phenome-wide association tests also implicated variation in the synaptonemal complex component C14orf39 and crossover-regulating ubiquitin ligases CCNB1IP1 and RNF212 in meiotic aneuploidy risk. More broadly, variants associated with aneuploidy often showed secondary associations with recombination, and several also exhibited associations with reproductive ageing traits.

          "abstract": "Physiological and pathological processes such as inflammation and cancer emerge from interactions between cells over time1. However, methods to follow cell populations over time within the native context of a human tissue are lacking because a biopsy offers only a single snapshot. Here we present one-shot tissue dynamics reconstruction (OSDR), an approach to estimate a dynamical model of cell populations based on a single tissue sample. OSDR uses spatial proteomics to learn how the composition of cellular neighbourhoods influences division rate, providing a dynamical model of cell population change over time. We apply OSDR to human breast cancer data2,3,4, and reconstruct two fixed points of fibroblasts and macrophage interactions5,6. These fixed points correspond to hot and cold fibrosis7, in agreement with co-culture experiments that measured these dynamics directly8. We then use OSDR to discover a pulse-generating excitable circuit of T and B cells in the tumour microenvironment, suggesting temporal flares of anticancer immune responses. Finally, we study longitudinal biopsies from a triple-negative breast cancer clinical trial3, in which OSDR predicts the collapse of the tumour cell population in responders but not in non-responders, based on early-treatment biopsies. OSDR can be applied to a wide range of spatial proteomics assays to enable analysis of tissue dynamics based on patient biopsies.",

Here we report a metagenomic survey to model microbiome transmission in the nursery setting among babies attending the first year, their educators and their families (n = 134 individuals). We performed dense longitudinal microbiome sampling (n = 1,013 faecal samples) during the first year of nursery and tracked microbial strain transmission within and between nursery groups across 3 different facilities. We detected extensive baby-to-baby microbiome transmission within nursery groups even after only 1 month of nursery attendance, with nursery-acquired strains accounting for a proportion of the infant gut microbiome comparable to that from family by the end of the first term. Baby-to-baby transmission continued to grow over the nursery year, in an increasingly intricate transmission network with single strains spreading in some classes, and with multiple baby-acquisition and species-transmissibility patterns. Having siblings was associated with higher microbiome diversity and reduced strain acquisition from nursery peers, while antibiotic treatment was the condition that most accounted for the increased influx of strains. This study shows that microbiome transmission between babies is extensive during the first year of nursery, and points to social interactions in infancy as crucial drivers of infant microbiome development.",

          "abstract": "The recent discovery of altermagnetism was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases, which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. Here we review the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We describe the spontaneously broken and retained symmetries that delineate altermagnetism as a distinct phase of matter with d-, g- or i-wave compensated collinear spin ordering. In materials ranging from weakly interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators, the microscopic crystal-structure realizations of the altermagnetic symmetries feature a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities. These symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin–orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout, we compare altermagnetism with traditional ferromagnetism and Néel antiferromagnetism, and with magnetic phases with symmetry-protected compensated non-collinear spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions with references to relevant experiments.",

          "abstract": "At every scale they occupy, magnetic fields affect various phenomena, including star formation, cosmic-ray transport, charged-particle acceleration, space weather, transport in planetary atmospheres and laboratory plasmas. These fields are often generated and sustained by turbulent flows in a process called the dynamo. In 1955, E. N. Parker parameterized the effects of small-scale turbulence to propose a mean-field dynamo theory1. The widely used theory reproduces observed large-scale fields but suffers from difficulty in tuning parameters as they are not justified from first principles: studies of turbulent flows show tangled magnetic fields, which are folded and fragmented into small-scale structures owing to shear-flow straining2,3. Here, considering a shear flow that is unstable and driven, we develop analytic theory and perform three-dimensional, advanced computer simulations of turbulence with up to 4,096 × 4,096 × 8,192 grid points, showing ab initio generation of quasi-periodic, large-scale magnetic fields. The generation occurs via the mean-vorticity effect—an additional mean-field dynamo process postulated4 in 1990. Crucial to this dynamo is the prior generation of large-scale three-dimensional jets, robustly produced as topologically protected and exact nonlinear solutions of the magnetohydrodynamic equations. The jet-driven dynamo applies to shear-driven laboratory and astrophysical systems. These include binary neutron star mergers5,6, where the reported dynamo probably operates on microsecond timescales to produce in milliseconds some of the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe7, providing signals for multi-messenger astronomy8.",

          "abstract": "Human cortical neurogenesis involves conserved and specialized developmental processes during a restricted window of prenatal development. Radial glia (RG) neural stem cells shape cortical cell diversity by giving rise to excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as well as olfactory bulb interneurons (INs) and a recently characterized population of cortical INs 1,2 . Complex genetic programs orchestrated by transcription factor (TF) circuits govern the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, and between different cell fates 3–8 . Despite progress in measuring gene regulatory network activity during human cortical development 9–12 , functional studies are required to evaluate the roles of TFs and effector genes in human RG lineage progression. Here we establish a human primary culture system that allows sensitive discrimination of cell fate dynamics and apply single-cell CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening 13,14 to examine the transcriptional and cell fate consequences of 44 TFs active during cortical neurogenesis. We identified several TFs with new roles in cortical neurogenesis, including ZNF219 —previously uncharacterized—that represses neural differentiation and NR2E1 and ARX that have opposing roles in regulating RG lineage plasticity and progression across developmental stages. We also detected convergent effector genes downstream of multiple TFs enriched in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders and observed conserved mechanisms of RG lineage plasticity across primates. We further uncovered a post-mitotic role for ARX in safeguarding IN subtype specification through repressing LMO1 . Our study provides a framework for dissecting regulatory networks driving cell fate consequences during human neurogenesis.",

Here we report an extreme barocaloric effect in NH4SCN aqueous solutions enabled by pressure-tuned dissolution and precipitation. This mechanism delivers an exceptionally large cooling capacity and markedly enhanced cooling efficiency. We obtain an in situ temperature drop of 26.8 K in the solution at room temperature, surpassing all known caloric materials. A Carnot-like cycle is designed to deliver 67 J g−1 cooling capacity per cycle with a second-law efficiency of 77%, benefiting from the extremely large temperature drops and direct heat transfer due to the self-circulating aqueous solution.

Fundamental questions remain regarding their structure and origin. Although super-Earths have a rocky composition 3 , sub-Neptunes form a distinct population at larger radii and are thought to consist of a rocky core overlain by a hydrogen-rich envelope 4,5 . At the extreme conditions of the core–envelope interface (exceeding several gigapascals and several thousand kelvin 4,6 ), reaction between core and envelope seems possible, but the nature and extent of these reactions are unknown. Here we use first-principles molecular dynamics driven by density functional theory to show that silicate and hydrogen are completely miscible over a wide range of plausible core–envelope pressure–temperature conditions. We find the origin of miscibility in extensive chemical reaction between hydrogen and silicate, producing silane, SiO and water species, which may be observable with ongoing or future missions. Core–envelope miscibility profoundly affects the evolution of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, by dissolving a large fraction of the hydrogen of the planet in the core and driving exchange of hydrogen between core and envelope as the planet evolves.",

Central to this process is the fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network, which forms a highly organized conduit system that facilitates the movement of and interactions between dendritic cells and T cells 3–6 . Previous studies have partly characterized how FRCs support these interactions 7,8 . However, the molecular mechanisms that operate under physiological conditions remain unknown. Here we show that the viral protein m11, encoded by the herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (CMV), inhibits antiviral immunity by targeting the FRC network and interfering with a critical function of cellular CD44. We found that m11 binds to CD44 and established that m11 perturbs the molecular interactions of CD44 with its natural ligand, hyaluronic acid. The interaction of m11 with CD44 impairs the trafficking of dendritic cells within the spleen, thereby impeding efficient priming of naive T cells and the initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. The targeting of CD44 by CMV reveals CD44 as a molecule that is essential to the functioning of the FRC network and uncovers a previously unrecognized stroma-based mechanism that is critical for the generation of effective T cell responses.",

CytoTape reveals that divergent transcriptional trajectories correlate with transcriptional history and signal integration, and that distinct immediate early genes (IEGs) exhibit complex temporal correlations within single cells. We further extended CytoTape into CytoTape-vivo for scalable, spatiotemporally resolved single-cell recording in the living brain, enabling simultaneous weeks-long recording of doxycycline- and IEG promoter-dependent gene expression histories across up to 14,123 neurons spanning multiple brain regions per mouse.

          "abstract": "Earth’s early mantle probably existed as a deep, vigorously convecting magma ocean, and its solidification is considered central to the long-term chemical and dynamical evolution of the planet. Yet a notable uncertainty is the grain size of bridgmanite—the dominant lower-mantle phase—whose nucleation behaviour at extreme pressure has remained experimentally inaccessible. Here we show, using a combination of cutting-edge techniques, including large-scale molecular dynamics simulations consisting of up to 1 million atoms driven by machine learning potentials (MLPs), seeding and enhanced sampling, that crystal–melt interfacial energies of MgSiO3 bridgmanite increase substantially with pressure, surpassing those of silicate–liquid systems at ambient pressure by a factor of up to ten (refs. 1,2,3). In a deep basal magma ocean (BMO), this amplified interfacial energy, combined with the potential sluggish cooling, may permit the formation of unusually large bridgmanite crystals, up to centimetre-to-metre-scale sizes. Such potentially large crystals could drive efficient fractional crystallization and cause substantial chemical differentiation and mantle compaction. If operative, this mechanism would provide a new physical pathway linking lower-mantle material properties to early Earth stratification and it motivates future geodynamic models that explicitly incorporate supercooling, compositional convection and elemental partitioning. Our findings thus offer a plausible hypothesis connecting microscopic nucleation processes with macroscopic planetary structure, refining present views of how the Earth’s interior acquired its initial compositional architecture.",

Measured median concentrations over the ocean are 27 times lower than over the land (0.003 and 0.08 particles m −3 , respectively). Applying a simple scaling method, we estimate that oceanic emissions are lower in number than land-based emissions.

We demonstrate the transformative nature of the Sidewinder technique with highly robust and accurate construction of a 40-piece multifragment assembly, complex DNA sequences of both high GC content and high repeats, parallel assembly of multiple distinct genes in the same reaction and a combinatorial library with a large number of diversified positions across the entire length of the gene for high coverage of a library of 442,368 variants.

Here we identify the transcription factor odd-skipped related 2 (osr2) as a specific marker and regulator of muLEC differentiation and maintenance. osr2 controls the transition of muLECs from interconnected endothelial cells to individual scavenger cells in part by means of control of cadherin-6. muLECs are more transcriptionally similar to BAMs than to other mammalian meningeal cells and share several functions in tissue homeostasis. However, BAMs are absent from zebrafish and muLECs from mice and humans. Analysis of osr2, lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) and BAM markers in diverse vertebrate species reveals muLECs as an ancient lineage and BAMs a recent mammalian specialization. muLECs and BAMs share functional analogies but are not homologous, providing an example of convergent evolution. This highlights the physiological importance of meningeal scavenger cells and the developmental plasticity of LECs in generating specialized cell types throughout evolution.",

          "abstract": "Neural tissues are exceptionally sensitive to oxygen deprivation and rely on a dense network of blood vessels to support their extraordinarily high metabolic demands for oxygen, nutrients and clearance of waste products1,2,3,4. In birds, one of the metabolically most demanding neural tissue—the retina—lacks internal blood vessels5,6. This raises the question of how such a metabolically demanding neural tissue can function without blood perfusion. Here we show that, while the photoreceptor outer segments in the outer retina have access to oxygen, the inner bird retina operates under chronic anoxia, supported by anaerobic glycolysis in the retinal neurons. We provide evidence that the pecten oculi—a uniquely vascularized structure in the vitreous humour of birds, the function of which has been debated for centuries5,6,7,8,9—supplies the anoxic inner retina with glucose and removes lactic acid. We suggest that the pecten’s metabolic support of the bird retina’s anoxia tolerance enabled first the evolution of a thick cell-dense, avascular retina, which secondarily served as an exaptation enabling retinal function during high-altitude migrations.",

          "abstract": "The quantum superposition principle is a fundamental concept of physics 1 and the basis of numerous quantum technologies 2,3 . Yet, it is still often regarded counterintuitive because we do not observe its key features on the macroscopic scales of our daily lives. It is, therefore, interesting to ask how quantum properties persist or change as we increase the size and complexity of objects 4 . A model test for this question can be realized by matter-wave interferometry, in which the motion of individual massive particles becomes delocalized and needs to be described by a wave function that spans regions far larger than the particle itself 5 . Over the years, this has been explored with a series of objects of increasing mass and complexity 6–9 and a growing community aims at pushing this to ever larger limits. Here we present an experimental platform that extends matter-wave interference to large metal clusters, a qualitatively new material class for quantum experiments. We specifically demonstrate quantum interference of sodium nanoparticles, which can each contain more than 7,000 atoms at masses greater than 170,000 Da. They propagate in a Schrödinger cat state with a macroscopicity 10 of μ = 15.5, surpassing previous experiments 5,9,11 by an order of magnitude.",

          "abstract": "Vertebrate vision is mainly accommodated by a pair of lateral image-forming camera-type eyes and is supplemented in non-mammalian vertebrates by a dorsal pineal complex (pineal and parapineal organs) functioning as photoreceptive and/or endocrine organs1. The pineal complex shares a common genetic and embryological basis with the lateral eyes, both derived from evaginations during the development of diencephalon2. Despite being widely heralded as the ‘third eye’ in crown vertebrates3, the nature of the pineal complex and its presumed visual capability in early vertebrates2 remain unknown. Here we describe two pigmented features situated between the lateral eyes in two species of myllokunmingids, the earliest known fossil vertebrates (approximately 518 million years ago), and interpret these as pineal/parapineal organs. In both myllokunmingid species, the pineal complex contains abundant melanin-containing melanosomes identical to those in the retinal pigment epithelium in the lateral eyes, together with a distinctive, regularly ovoid structure interpreted as a lens. Our results indicate that the lateral eyes and pineal complex in myllokunmingids probably functioned as camera-type eyes capable of image formation. Thus, we propose that the four camera-type eyes represent an ancestral vertebrate character, corroborating hypotheses about the deep homology between the eyes and pineal complex.",

Despite the intense investigation of orthosteric thalidomide derivatives, little is known about alternate binding sites on CRBN. Here we report an evolutionarily conserved cryptic allosteric binding site on CRBN. Small-molecule SB-405483 binds the allosteric site to cooperatively enhance the binding of orthosteric ligands and alter their neosubstrate degradation profiles. A survey of over 100 orthosteric ligands and their degradation targets reveals trends in the classes of compounds and neosubstrates in which degradation outcomes are enhanced or inhibited by SB-405483. Structural investigations provide a mechanistic basis for the effects of the allosteric ligand by shifting the conformational distribution of CRBNopen to a novel CRBNint and increasing the CRBNclosed state. The discovery of a cryptic allosteric binding site on CRBN that alters the functional effects of orthosteric ligands opens new directions with broad implications for improving the selectivity and efficacy of CRBN therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "The Indonesian archipelago is host to some of the earliest known rock art in the world1,2,3,4,5. Previously, secure Pleistocene dates were reported for figurative cave art and stencils of human hands in two areas in Indonesia—the Maros-Pangkep karsts in the southwestern peninsula of the island of Sulawesi1,3,4,5 and the Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat region of eastern Kalimantan, Borneo2. Here we describe a series of early dated rock art motifs from the southeastern portion of Sulawesi. Among this assemblage of Pleistocene (and possibly more recent) motifs, laser-ablation U-series (LA-U-series) dating of calcite overlying a hand stencil from Liang Metanduno on Muna Island yielded a U-series date of 71.6 ± 3.8 thousand years ago (ka), providing a minimum-age constraint of 67.8 ka for the underlying motif. The Muna minimum (67.8 ± 3.8 ka) exceeds the published minimum for rock art in Maros-Pangkep by 16.6 thousand years (kyr) (ref. 5) and is 1.1 kyr greater than the published minimum for a hand stencil from Spain attributed to Neanderthals6, which until now represented the oldest demonstrated minimum-age constraint for cave art worldwide. Moreover, the presence of this extremely old art in Sulawesi suggests that the initial peopling of Sahul about 65 ka7 involved maritime journeys between Borneo and Papua, a region that remains poorly explored from an archaeological perspective.",

          "abstract": "Biases in information gathering are common in the general population and reach pathological extremes in paralysing indecisiveness, as in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Here we adopt a new perspective on information gathering and demonstrate an information integration bias whereby there is over-weighting of most recent information via evidence strength updates (ΔES). In a crowd-sourced sample ( N = 5,237), we find that a reduced ΔES weighting drives indecisiveness along an obsessive–compulsive spectrum. We replicate this attenuated ΔES weighting in a second lab-based study ( N = 105) that includes a transdiagnostic obsessive–compulsive spectrum encompassing OCD and generalized anxiety patients. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we trace ΔES signals to a late neural signal peaking at ~920 ms. Critically, highly obsessive–compulsive participants, across diagnoses, show an attenuated neural ΔES signal in mediofrontal areas, while other decision-relevant processes remain intact. Our findings establish biased information weighting as a driver of information gathering, where attenuated ΔES is linked to indecisiveness across an obsessive–compulsive spectrum.",

          "abstract": "Our experiences contain countless details that may be important in the future, yet we rarely know which will matter and which will not. This uncertainty poses a difficult challenge for adaptive decision-making, as failing to preserve relevant information can prevent us from making good choices later on. One solution to this challenge is to store detailed memories of individual experiences that can be flexibly accessed whenever their details become relevant. By allowing us to store and recall specific events in vivid detail, the human episodic memory system provides exactly this capacity. Yet, whether and how this ability supports adaptive behaviour is poorly understood. Here we aimed to determine whether people use detailed episodic memories to make decisions when future task demands are uncertain. We hypothesized that the episodic memory system’s ability to store events in great detail allows us to reference any of these details if they later become relevant. We tested this hypothesis using a novel decision-making task in which participants encoded individual events with multiple features and later made decisions based on these features to maximize their earnings. Across 5 experiments (total n = 535), we found that participants referenced episodic memories during decisions in feature-rich environments and that they did so specifically when it was unclear at encoding which features would be needed in the future. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental adaptive function of episodic memory, showing how its rich representational capacity enables flexible decision-making under uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing assumption in the language sciences is that the mental representation of language is based on constituents—that is, hierarchical structures rooted in grammar. We provide evidence from English for a more basic kind of linguistic representation involving smaller, linear chunks of structure akin to sequences of parts-of-speech elements—such as verb preposition determiner shared between the strings added to a and defined by the. Across four preregistered phrasal decision experiments (total N = 497), we show that it is possible to prime such linear structures, even in the absence of constituents. In two additional corpus analyses of eye-tracked reading (N = 68) and conversation (N = 358), we establish the external validity of the effect. These results provide evidence of multiword language structures that are not explainable in terms of constituents as traditionally construed. This poses a challenge for accounts of linguistic representation, including generative and constructionist approaches.",

          "abstract": "Although the distinction between episodic and semantic memory is supported by numerous neuropsychological studies, neuroimaging data have shown considerable overlap between regions that are activated during semantic and episodic remembering. This might indicate similar or shared mechanisms but might also result from inadequate task designs or poor functional magnetic resonance imaging signal coverage. Here we compared neural activations and representations associated with successful retrieval of episodic and semantic memories, using tasks that are more closely matched. A total of n = 40 participants recalled pairings between logos and brand names, where the pairings corresponded to real-world knowledge (semantic task) or were learned in an initial study phase (episodic task). Neither a priori-defined networks nor clusters generally activated by our task provided evidence for any difference between successful semantic and episodic retrieval, with the Bayes factor for the a priori networks supporting the null hypothesis of no difference.

          "authors": "Armin Granulo, Andreas Raff, Christoph Fuchs",
          "abstract": "AI is expected to reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Large-scale survey data ( N = 37,079; 38 European countries) indicate that the public tends to view AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for technology-related, political, and sociodemographic factors, these data further show that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Two preregistered, nationally representative experiments ( N = 1,202, United Kingdom; replication study N = 1,200, United States) provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democracy and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may decrease democratic legitimacy and public engagement in shaping the future of AI.",

          "authors": "Young Mie Kim, Ross Dahlke, Hyebin Song, Richard Heinrich",
          "abstract": "In light of continued foreign interference in the US presidential elections, where undisclosed digital voter suppression advertising has been deployed, this study addresses the questions of who is exposed to these ads and whether and how such exposure influences voter turnout. Using a sample that resembles the US voting-age population, the study directly measures each individual’s ad exposure through a user-level real-time ad tracking tool, which is merged with the same individual’s survey responses to identify voter suppression content and its targeting patterns. By further matching individual-level exposure to voter suppression ads with the same individual’s verified voter turnout records, the study estimates the effects of voter suppression on actual turnout. The study findings from the 2016 US Presidential Election reveal clear geo-racial targeting patterns in voter suppression: non-Whites residing in the racial minority counties of battleground states were exposed to substantially more voter suppression ads than their counterparts. Moreover, exposure to voter suppression ads was associated with decreases in voter turnout at the population level, albeit small. The sharpest declines were observed among non-Whites residing in minority counties of battleground states, suggesting that the intensified turnout suppression among the targeted segments of the electorate may have played a role in shaping turnout.",

          "abstract": "Civil society has long been a catalyst for social change by reshaping structures, influencing values, and challenging power dynamics; however, its role in driving transformative change for biodiversity remains underexplored. To address this gap, we analyze 2,801 socio-environmental mobilizations documented in the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas). These mobilizations produce diverse outcomes that reveal distinct spatial, temporal, and sectoral patterns and proactively and reactively respond to environmental impacts across the globe. Notably, about 40% of these mobilizations occur within the top 30% of global priority lands for species conservation and their actions contribute to the achievement of key Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework targets focused on ecosystem protection, restoration, sustainable use, and inclusive spatial planning. Yet, one-third of mobilizations face repression, criminalization, or violence—pressures that are even more common in high-priority conservation areas. Moreover, mobilizations facing repressive outcomes contest environmental threats relevant for the KMGBF targets more extensively than those with progressive outcomes, underscoring the risks faced by movements driving biodiversity protection in critical regions. To amplify the transformative potential of socio-environmental mobilizations, we emphasize the importance of recognizing, strengthening, and protecting them through coordinated action among diverse social actors. By fostering collaboration and targeted resource allocation, these efforts can empower socio-environmental mobilizations to catalyze meaningful and lasting change for biodiversity conservation.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists have long sought to investigate whether the predictors of educational attainment (EA) have changed across time. Here, we provide insights by incorporating genetic predictors of education in three nationally representative British birth cohorts born in 1946, 1958, and 1970. We investigated whether individual characteristics as proxied by polygenic indexes (PGIs) for EA and cognition have become more relevant to educational success over time and whether returns to genetic predisposition were moderated by early life socioeconomic background. We present three findings. First, associations between the EA PGI and attainment increased over time, with increasing incremental variance explained by the EA PGI. Second, associations between the cognition PGI and attainment were broadly consistent across cohorts, and there was no clear change in explained variance. Since the EA PGI captures multiple traits related to educational success, factors other than those related to cognition may have become more relevant over time. Third, we observed strong evidence of interaction: Associations between the EA PGI and EA were disproportionately larger among those from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. The strength and pattern of associations varied when using EA PGIs that were less conservatively filtered for SNPs. Our findings suggest EA is influenced by social and genetic factors both independently and jointly. Genetic liability and social background could be considered as two forms of inherited advantage which synergistically influence education attainment.",

          "abstract": "After widespread extirpation, conservation efforts have restored large carnivores to portions of their former range. Substantial research has since focused on their ability to alter ecological communities through effects on herbivores and mesocarnivores, but the principles governing competition among multiple apex carnivores remain unclear. While mesocarnivore scavenging of apex carnivore kills drive “enemies with benefits” dynamics, subordinate apex carnivores seldom rely on scavenging. Instead, they proficiently hunt prey themselves that dominant apex carnivores can steal, fundamentally altering the dynamics of their interactions. We used 9 y of contemporaneous GPS telemetry and 3,929 potential kill site investigations from a reconstituted community of sympatric wolves and cougars in Yellowstone National Park to test whether such apex–apex dynamics instead follow an “enemies without benefits” framework. Wolf movement and resource selection were strongly linked to cougar kills, resulting in carcass theft (i.e., kleptoparasitism) that drove their interactions and led to cougar mortalities. In contrast, cougars avoided wolf kills, were tied to escape terrain, and did not kill wolves, producing an asymmetric dynamic that persisted across distinct seasonal contexts. However, as elk (the shared primary prey) declined longitudinally, cougars shifted their diets to smaller-bodied deer that were kleptoparasitized by wolves at one-sixth the rate of elk kills. Our findings demonstrate that prey diversity and landscape structure are critical for subordinate apex carnivores who experience severe interference competition from their dominant counterparts. This dynamic extends trophic theory and provides a framework for predicting the coexistence outcomes of carnivore restoration and the ongoing recolonization of wolves.",

          "abstract": "The global transition to sustainable energy demands efficient lithium extraction from brines. While electrochemical lithium extraction using LiMn 2 O 4 (LMO) holds great promise, its practical application is hindered by mechanical degradation caused by anisotropic volume changes and stress accumulation during cycling. Herein, we present an entropy-driven amphiphilic self-assembly strategy that engineers stress-homogenized multilayer core–shell architectures, which innovatively mitigates stress accumulation by tuning the internal geometric structure to optimize stress–strain behavior, thereby synergistically enhancing ion distribution, transport kinetics, and electrochemical stability. This hierarchical interlayer architecture ensures uniform Li + distribution and redistributes internal stresses, mitigating localized stress concentrations and lattice expansion to preserve structural integrity throughout cycling. The optimized LMO establishes a dual benchmark for both capacity and cycling stability in hybrid capacitive deionization, achieving a remarkable lithium extraction capacity of 4.78 mmol g −1 with 96% retention over 100 cycles, outperforming both its unoptimized counterpart and other reported materials of the same type. Finite element simulations further elucidate a 48% reduction in maximum stress compared to disordered counterparts, underscoring the critical coupling between ion diffusion and stress evolution. This paradigm provides a pathway for developing advanced materials with intrinsically stable architectures for sustainable lithium extraction.",

In this work, we introduce near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) to investigate dopamine dynamics in meadow voles, a rodent species that exhibits distinct changes in social behavior and neurobiology across photoperiods. We observe increased dopamine release and release site density in voles housed in short photoperiods (which induce a social phenotype), suggesting adaptations linked to environmental changes. Moreover, pharmacological and extracellular manipulations demonstrate that short photoperiod/social voles exhibit heightened responsiveness to dopamine-increasing interventions and resilience against suppressive conditions. These findings highlight a significant association between dopamine signaling and photoperiod-driven changes in social behavior and establish nIRCats as an effective tool for expanding our understanding of dopamine dynamics across nonmodel organisms.",

While previous work has shown that membrane-bound organelles regulate metabolic activities and that membrane-less condensates conduct metabolic reactions, the coordination between these two organizations remains unaddressed. By using a combination of proximity labeling, superresolution fluorescence microscopy, and metabolite analyses using isotopic tracing, we investigated the relationships between these metabolic hotspots. Here, we show that nutrient deficiency elongates mitochondria and transforms the ER from a tubular to sheet-like morphology, coinciding with increased mitochondrial respiration and inosine 5′-monophosphate levels. These structural changes promote the colocalization of purinosomes with these organelles, enhancing metabolic channeling. Disruption of ER sheet formation via MTM1 knockout destabilizes purinosomes, impairs substrate channeling, and reduces intracellular purine nucleotide pools without altering enzyme expression. Our findings reveal that organelle morphology and interorganelle contacts dynamically regulate the assembly and function of metabolic condensates, providing a structural basis for coordinated metabolic control in response to nutrient availability.",

However, how the high diversity of bumblebees in the QTP evolved and contributed to their diversification in adjacent and far-reaching regions remains unclear. Here, we explored this question using a widespread bumblebee species, Bombus pyrosoma . Phylogenomic analysis revealed a history of dispersal out of the QTP and distinct lineage divergence along elevations within the species. Four major chromosomal inversion variants were identified, and shifts in their frequency with altitude were consistent with patterns of lineage divergence. The highland bumblebees showed stronger metabolic robustness and better flight performance under cold environments, whereas lowland ones excelled under warm conditions. Forty-one percent of the positively selected genes were located in the inversion regions and were mostly associated with fatty acid metabolism and information processing. Mutation with a strong candidate gene, elovl6 , possibly modulated long-chain fatty acid elongation, which facilitated bumblebee flight under thermal stress. Finally, genomic inversion analyses across 22 bumblebee species–17 native to the QTP–corroborate the widespread involvement of inversions in the elevational diversification of bumblebees. Overall, our findings revealed that chromosomal inversions play a pivotal role in facilitating local adaptation and dispersal out of the QTP in a bumblebee, providing insights into the genomic underpinnings of bumblebees’ diversification.",

          "abstract": "The low-complexity domain of Fused in Sarcoma (FUS-LC) undergoes phase separation, forming a dense, liquid-like phase that gradually matures into an ordered, gel-like state over long-time scales. During the maturation process, specific regions of the FUS-LC sequence-core-1, core-2, and core-3-become structured, giving rise to nonpolymorphic fibrils. Coarse-grained simulations predict that kinetically the least stable fibril-like core-3 forms first while the most stable core-1 appears last, in accord with Ostwald’s rule of stages. The fibril structure of the C-terminal core-3, predicted using AlphaFold, shows that a β -strand appears in this region early during droplet formation and triggers FUS-LC assembly. Multichain simulations, which ensure the equality of the chemical potentials between the phases, show that the dense phase forms through nucleation and coarsening, resembling Ostwald ripening. The approaches developed here are broadly applicable and could help uncover assembly mechanisms in other intrinsically disordered proteins like TDP-43, which shares key features with FUS-LC.",

          "abstract": "Bacteriophages have applications in biotechnology, including human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety, and biosecurity. One example of resurging importance is phage therapy, the use of phages to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Phage therapy currently requires screening of environmental phages against the infecting strains for each individual patient, a laborious process that limits the development of standardized treatments. To overcome limitations of narrow host range inherent to many native phages, a robust genomic engineering platform is required which permits rapid and dependable genome production and engineering for nonmodel phage. Here, we describe an engineering platform for a phiKMV-like Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage, 41S1 that builds on previous work in the rapid assembly of small genomes through one-pot, High Complexity Golden Gate assembly (HC-GGA). This system divides the 41S1 genome into DNA fragments small enough to be conveniently synthesized and to avoid toxicity during DNA propagation, with all but one maintained in Escherichia coli . These fragments are readily assembled in a high accuracy, one-pot reaction; phages can be rescued by direct transformation into P. aeruginosa PAO1 or E. coli 10-beta cells. We demonstrate the precise generation of point mutations, DNA insertions, deletions, and the addition of fluorescence reporter genes that are expressed during phage replication. All viable genotypes could be generated with near 100% success rate with minimal screening. This system demonstrates the potential of HC-GGA for the rapid production and engineering of phages and provides a chassis for the development of phages that broadly target the opportunistic human pathogen P. aeruginosa .",

Using ex vivo whole-organ culture, small interfering RNA cell culture methods, transwell assays, and a genetic mouse model to disrupt ERK signaling in gonadal cells, we found that the ERK pathway promotes testis cord formation via early growth response 1 -mediated cell migration and regulates the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in FLCs via activating the transcription factor cAMP responsive element binding protein 1.

Here, we report catalytic activity for a single-domain ERP, Gt EXPN_133317, from the brown-rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum , which is highly expressed in the early phase of spruce colonization. We demonstrate enzyme-dependent formation of xylan-derived products, such as glucuronylated xylo-oligosaccharides, using high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. Structure-based multiple sequence alignment of ERPs with GH45 endoglucanases showed that, next to a single conserved aspartate (Asp87 in Gt EXPN_133317) present in all ERPs and GH45s, fungal ERPs contain a second conserved acidic residue (Asp25 in Gt EXPN_133317). Mutation of these two conserved amino acids, Asp87 and Asp25, led to a nearly complete loss of xylanolytic activity.

          "abstract": "Aquatic photosynthetic systems account for approximately one-half of all global carbon assimilation and could be a significant source of renewable fuels and feedstocks. However, rapid growth and biomass production in algae have not always translated into high product yields, partly because central metabolism is context specific, with metabolic fluxes being influenced by nutrient conditions and other environmental factors. In the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas), mixotrophic cultures (acetate + light) grow far faster than phototrophic (light only) or heterotrophic (acetate + dark) cultures, even though acetate partially suppresses photosynthesis. Here, an isotopic dilution strategy with unlabeled acetate was combined with 13 CO 2 transient labeling to perform isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA) and to directly compare autotrophic and mixotrophic metabolism in Chlamydomonas supported by data from transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. INST-MFA indicated that acetate induces a synergistic rewiring of metabolism, conserving carbon by using the glyoxylate cycle and suppressing gluconeogenesis, the latter of which was discordant with omics results and prior models. Additionally, our data provide a plausible rationale for the well-known suppression of photosynthesis by acetate. We propose that reduced total protein content in mixotrophic versus phototrophic cells, much of which is attributed to reduced levels of photosynthetic proteins, decreases the costly metabolic burden of protein synthesis and represents a growth rate optimization strategy.",

          "abstract": "Expansion of nucleotide repeat sequences is linked to a growing number of neuromuscular degenerative disorders. Metabolic changes, including disruptions in mitochondrial function and dynamics, characterize these disorders and are believed to contribute to organismal toxicity. To investigate how toxic RNA repeats affect mitochondria, we used a Caenorhabditis elegans model that expresses expanded CUG repeat RNAs in muscle cells and recapitulates muscle dysfunction. We found that the RNA-binding protein Muscleblind-like 1 (MBL-1) is essential for normal mitochondrial function and regulates organelle morphology. In animals expressing expanded CUG repeats, where MBL-1 function is impaired, we identified two distinct mechanisms of mitochondrial disruption: altered mitochondrial morphology regulated by MBL-1, and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) dysfunction occurring independently of MBL-1. Our data further show that changes in mitochondrial morphology are specifically linked to nuclear MBL-1 dysfunction, which affects cpt-3 expression, a gene encoding carnitine palmitoyltransferase—an enzyme required for fatty acid transport into mitochondria. This mechanism is conserved, with similar disruptions observed in patients with Myotonic Dystrophy type 1. Importantly, our findings indicate that increased organelle fragmentation is not central to cellular pathogenesis. Instead, OxPhos dysfunction appears to be a primary contributor to organismal toxicity.",

          "abstract": "Two major mechanisms of axon degeneration have been identified. The first, a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway, is a major mediator of developmental axon degeneration triggered by loss of trophic support. The second, a caspase-independent pathway mediated by the sterile alpha and HEAT/Armadillo motif containing 1 (SARM1) NADase, was found in studies of injury-induced Wallerian degeneration; it is also implicated in degeneration associated with traumatic brain injury, as well as some neurodegenerative diseases and neuropathies. Recent studies suggest that SARM1 functions as a metabolic sensor for the cellular nicotinamide mononucleotide/NAD+ ratio through its autoinhibitory armadillo repeats (ARM) domain. Here, we show a tight link between apoptotic and SARM1-dependent degeneration by demonstrating that SARM1 is activated during and contributes to apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, macrophages, and T cells. Mechanistically, the key apoptotic protease caspase-3 cleaves SARM1 within its ARM domain, relieving its autoinhibition and activating its NAD+ hydrolase activity. Using a knock-in (KI) mouse model with a SARM1 mutation that prevents caspase-3 cleavage, we show that apoptosis promotion by SARM1 in macrophages and T cells requires its cleavage, whereas in neurons deprived of trophic support, activation of SARM1 occurs both with and without cleavage. Our study identifies a central role for SARM1 in apoptosis in some cells that is mediated by SARM1 activation through caspase-3 cleavage; it provides a model for dissecting the contributions of the two modes of SARM1 activation in different cellular contexts; and it has implications for the selection of ortho- versus allosteric SARM1 inhibitors for treating neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "Liquid water can be supercooled up to about 50 K below the melting point before undergoing homogeneous ice nucleation. Based on experimental thermodynamic observations and computer simulations, it was hypothesized that below this temperature and at pressures of several kbar, water undergoes a liquid–liquid phase transition (LLPT) and the transition line ends at a second critical point. However, challenges in experiments and simulations at such deep cooling leave doubts about the nature of the LLPT and the existence of the critical point. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations with a highly accurate and computationally efficient polarizable water model to establish the character of the LLPT and identify the location of the second critical point. Our microsecond-long simulations provide direct evidence of a well-defined moving interface between low-density and high-density water at conditions near the phase boundary. This provides decisive proof of a first-order transition between two liquid phases with distinct free energy basins separated by a barrier, taking a major step toward resolving this long-standing debate. These results offer new perspectives on supercooled water under pressure simulated with an accurate and realistic model suitable for studies of water in confined geological and biological environments.",

We found that S. maltophilia forms large protective multicellular aggregates upon exposure to P. aeruginosa secreted factors. Experimental evolution for lack of aggregation selected for fimbrial mutations and we found that fimbriae are required on both interacting S. maltophilia cells for aggregation. Untargeted metabolomics and targeted validations revealed that the quorum-sensing molecule Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) directly induced S. maltophilia aggregation, and colocalized with the aggregates. Further, in coculture with P. aeruginosa , wild-type S. maltophilia formed aggregates, resulting in up to 75-fold increased survival from P. aeruginosa competition compared to fimbrial mutants. Finally, multiple other bacterial species similarly aggregated upon exposure to P. aeruginosa PQS, indicating a more general response. Collectively, our work identifies a multispecies interaction where a quorum-sensing molecule from a coinfecting pathogen is sensed as a “danger” signal, thereby inducing a protective multicellular response.",

From ~200 pg of HeLa digest—approximately 80% of a cell—the technology identified 1,035 proteins with high reproducibility in quantification (coefficient of variation &lt;15% across technical triplicates). With microprobe sampling in vivo, we quantified 808–1,022 proteins from opposite poles of the dorsal–animal (D1) blastomere before division, and we traced how these spatial distributions are retained or remodeled in the descendant D1.1 (neural-fated) and D1.2 (epidermal-destined) cells. To decouple subcellular distributions from dorsal–ventral axis cues, we perturbed patterning by ultraviolet ventralization. These results establish microprobe CE–MS for deep subcellular proteomics in intact embryos and reveal spatially distinct protein distributions during early fate specification. These spatial proteome differences appear consistent with early lineage tendencies yet precede and likely bias, rather than fix, later fate decisions that depend on gastrula-stage inductive signals.",

          "abstract": "Intracellular transport of macromolecules is crucial for the proper functioning of most cellular processes. Although intracellular crowding is known to strongly alter macromolecule mobility, how cytoplasmic structures physically modulate diffusion remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic crowding controls diffusivity using live-cell experiments and porous media modeling approaches. Confocal microscopy combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements revealed an anticorrelation between free-green fluorescent protein diffusivity and the heterogeneous cytoplasmic structure abundance in live mammalian cells. This motivated the development of a multiscale model, where the cytoplasm is treated as a hierarchical porous medium with nanometric and micrometric obstacles. Numerically solving the model allowed us to predict the effective cytoplasmic diffusion coefficient for various obstacle volume fractions, and to identify tortuous and porous hydrodynamic hindrances as key diffusion reduction mechanisms. Comparison with our experimental results highlighted the importance of hydrodynamic interactions between diffusing molecules and nanometric obstacles. Importantly, we found that the effective cytoplasmic diffusivity was not dependent on specific intracellular regions but rather on the local intracellular obstacle volume fraction. Finally, the model was extended to predict the diffusivity of larger macromolecules, showing excellent agreement with literature data for several macromolecules and cell lines. This study provides insights into the physical mechanisms impeding intracellular diffusion, demonstrating the potential of porous media modeling approaches to predict transport mechanisms in dynamic or heterogeneous intracellular structures, as in cell motility, blebbing, and apoptosis.",

          "abstract": "Nitrate serves both as an essential nutrient and a key signaling molecule that shapes plant growth. In legumes, high nitrate concentrations suppress symbiotic nitrogen fixation, a process mediated by MtNLP1 (NIN-like protein1). Although nitrate minimally affects NLP transcript levels, it strongly controls their nuclear localization. How posttranslational modifications regulate MtNLP1 function, however, has remained unclear. Here, we show that nitrate induces SUMOylation of MtNLP1 at lysine 589 and 795 and that this modification is essential for its biological activity. Loss of these SUMO sites compromises nitrate-mediated inhibition of nodulation and weakens MtNLP1 interactions with MtNIN and itself. Components of the SUMOylation machinery in Medicago truncatula physically interact and are essential for both nodulation and nitrate responsiveness, indicating broader roles for SUMOylation in symbiosis. A SUMO-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana AtNLP7 3KR mutant fails to complement the Atnlp7-1 phenotype, demonstrating that SUMOylation is a conserved regulatory mechanism among NLPs. Together, our findings reveal SUMOylation as a previously unrecognized layer of regulation that integrates nutrient signaling with root nodule symbiosis.",

To investigate the mechanism of StopGo, we determined the cryo-EM structure of a mammalian ribosome positioned at the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A (F2A) site. The structure shows how interactions between the F2A nascent chain (NC) and the ribosomal exit tunnel induce a conformational change in the peptidyl transferase center that precludes further translation elongation but instead pre-exposes the P-tRNA:F2A-NC ester bond for hydrolysis and NC release. Additionally, we bioinformatically characterized variation and host association across nearly 10,000 StopGo sequences identified in virus genomes. We expanded the canonical core motif to (D/G/C/N)(V/I)ExNPGP and identified additional rare but functional variants. We also revealed several distinct upstream motifs that we showed biochemically to be important for StopGo activity. Interestingly, although StopGo is known to be functionally active in plants, we found no evidence for natural utilization of StopGo by plant viruses. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights into a unique translation recoding mechanism, and lay foundations for further optimization of multigene expression in biotechnology.",

For multiple BLTPs, we observe the ability to extract and solubilize lipids without lipid selectivity, and we identify membrane destabilization as a critical parameter to achieve effective lipid desorption. We rationally design a mutant BLTP with altered ability to destabilize lipid bilayers, and we show that this abolishes lipid desorption in silico and protein function in vivo.

Viral replication occurs independently from HBV and relies primarily on host RNA polymerase(s). Bulevirtide, a viral entry inhibitor, is the only approved treatment for chronic HDV but has a low cure rate as a monotherapy, and most patients rebound following cessation of therapy. It is likely that an inhibitor targeting HDV replication is necessary to achieve HDV cure, but the paucity of HDV-derived elements and limited understanding of HDV replication presents a significant therapeutic challenge. Understanding the precise mechanism of interactions between HDAg and viral RNA, and how it is packaged within the virion can inspire structure-guided drug design targeting replication. Using cryoelectron tomography and single particle cryoelectron microscopy, we present reconstructions of the virion and viral RNPs. We observed multiple binding configurations in vitro that suggest a propensity to arrange four RNA segments around repeating units of HDAg in a ladder-like formation. The oligomerization domains of a homo-octameric HDAg complex are directly involved in RNA binding by utilizing the vertices and sides of its square-shaped architecture to bind RNA in a sequence-promiscuous fashion. Structure–function analysis reveals that these RNA contact sites are important for viral replication and their disruption may be a potential avenue for next-generation antivirals to treat HDV.",

Here, we present the earliest handheld wooden tools, identified from secure contexts at the site of Marathousa 1, Greece, dated to ca. 430 ka (MIS12). Through a systematic morphological, microscopic, taphonomic, and taxonomic analysis of the sampled wood macroremains, two specimens were securely identified as modified by hominins: one small alder ( Alnus sp.) trunk fragment bears clear working and use-wear traces consistent with a multifunctional stick likely used in digging at the paleolakeshore; and one very small willow/poplar ( Salix sp./ Populus sp.) artifact exhibits signs of shaping and potential use-wear. A third specimen, a large alder trunk segment, shows deep, nonanthropogenic striations interpreted here as claw marks from a large carnivoran. The wooden tools were excavated together with butchered elephant remains, small lithic artifacts and debitage, and worked bone, underscoring the diversity of engagement with a variety of different raw materials for technological purposes at Marathousa 1. These finds extend the temporal range of early wooden tools. They represent both the use of expedient larger handheld tools as well as a much smaller, likely finger-held wooden tool, which is uniquely small for the Pleistocene, expanding known functional purposes of early wood technologies.

Phylogenetic analysis linked K315 to high-mortality hosts (≥50% lethality) vs. R315 in resistant species (≤25% lethality).

These bacteria rapidly spread through the water-transporting xylem where they grow prolifically and produce abundant biofilm that clogs xylem vessels. To understand RSSC biofilm behavior in planta, we examined their complex fluid mechanics. Rheological analyses revealed that unlike all previously analyzed microbial biofilms, RSSC biofilms are shear-thinning, viscoelastic fluids at physiologically relevant shear forces. To determine which factors confer these unique mechanics, we analyzed biofilms of bacterial mutants with altered biofilm components. Genetic analysis demonstrated that development of the viscous-dominant biofilms required production of EPS-I, an amphiphilic exopolysaccharide that is a major virulence factor for all RSSC pathogens. We show that EPS-I confers “biofilm mobility”, which allows wild-type RSSC colonies to passively expand when deformed. Despite its high metabolic cost, bioassays demonstrated that EPS-I production conferred a net fitness benefit where biofilm mobility allowed the pathogen to spread and access more nutrients in complex environments like xylem vessels. The RSSC are a monophyletic lineage of aggressive plant wilt pathogens, and our evolutionary hypothesis testing suggests the origin of the eps biosynthetic gene cluster coincides with the emergence of wilt pathogenesis in the RSSC ancestor. Furthermore, comparative physiological assays demonstrated that biofilm mobility is unique to the RSSC within the genus Ralstonia . In summary, EPS-I production is a key evolutionary innovation that enables RSSC dispersal and virulence by conferring unique biofilm mechanics.",

In contrast, DIMPLE labeling was absent in adult virgin males but present both prior to weaning and following mating. Surgical removal of gonads (ovariectomy or orchiectomy) did not alter the labeling pattern of DIMPLE in either sex. Interestingly, a single intraperitoneal injection of prolactin, a hormone that increases in males after mating, induced DIMPLE labeling in virgin males. However, treatment with cabergoline, a potent inhibitor of prolactin secretion, did not prevent DIMPLE labeling in females or in postmating males. Given the established role of the MeApd in social and reproductive behaviors, we hypothesize that DIMPLE may support neural mechanisms underlying female-typical behavior and potentially contribute to postmating behavioral shifts in males.",

          "abstract": "Lions and tigers, as dominant apex predators, likely became competitors when lions expanded from Africa into Eurasia approximately one million years ago (Ma), forming a lion–tiger transition belt from the Middle East through Central Asia to the Russian Far East. At the easternmost edge of this zone, the Japanese Archipelago has long been considered a Late Pleistocene tiger refugium, supported by large felid subfossils traditionally attributed to tigers ( Panthera tigris ), though their taxonomic identity remained unresolved. To clarify the origin, evolutionary history, and biogeography of Japan’s Pleistocene felids, we analyzed 26 ancient specimens previously assumed to be tigers. Using mitochondrial and nuclear genome hybridization capture and sequencing, paleoproteomics, Bayesian molecular dating, and radiocarbon dating, we found that all ancient Japanese “tiger” remains yielding molecular data were, unexpectedly, cave lions ( Panthera spelaea ). One specimen from Yamaguchi Prefecture, western Japan, was radiocarbon dated to 36,000-34,891 cal. BP. These cave lions likely dispersed to the Japanese Archipelago between ~72.7 and 37.5 thousand years ago (ka), when a land bridge connected northern Japan to the mainland during the Last Glacial Period. Our findings challenge the long-held view that tigers once took refuge in Japan, showing instead that cave lions were widespread in northeast Asia during this period and were the Panthera lineage that colonized Japan, reaching even its southwestern regions despite habitats previously thought to favor tigers.",

          "abstract": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) can be either temporary or permanent, depending on the intensity and duration of noise exposure. Excessive noise exposure activates various cellular mechanisms in the cochlea, including oxidative stress, immune responses, and apoptosis. Still, the mechanisms underlying hearing recovery after transient threshold shift (TTS) and lack of recovery after permanent threshold shift (PTS), as well as their therapeutic implications for NIHL, remain unknown. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of longitudinal changes in the cochlear transcriptome of TTS and PTS mouse models. Our analysis revealed that noise-induced ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). Notably, the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) branch of the UPR returned to baseline levels following TTS but showed sustained activation following PTS. In addition, the proapoptotic factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was selectively induced in hair cells following PTS. Administering a PERK inhibitor prior to and following noise exposure hindered hearing restoration after TTS, indicating a requirement for PERK activation in hearing recovery. Inhibition of sustained PERK activation via a PERK inhibitor or reduction of CHOP expression via pharmacological chaperones facilitated partial hearing recovery following PTS. Together, these findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying NIHL and its prevention, highlighting UPR modulation as a promising therapeutic strategy.",

          "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria have long been thought to confine primary glycerophospholipid synthesis to the inner membrane (IM). Here, we challenge this paradigm by identifying ClsO, an outer membrane (OM) lipoprotein from Acinetobacter baumannii that functions as a cardiolipin synthase. In contrast to canonical cardiolipin synthases, which are restricted to the IM, ClsO is surface-exposed and deposits cardiolipin into the outer leaflet of the OM, colocalizing with Acinetobacter lipooligosaccharide. Loss of ClsO sensitizes cells to membrane disrupting agents, such as bile salts, and key antibiotics, implicating ClsO in OM barrier integrity. ClsO activity increases when mislocalized glycerophospholipids accumulate at the cell surface, such as in cells lacking Mla (maintenance of lipid asymmetry) system, consistent with a surface-active site mechanism. Engineering mutations in ClsO that prevent its trafficking to the OM was found to abolish nearly all enzymatic activity. Remarkably, we found that ClsO homologs are widespread across Proteobacteria and confirmed several to be functional cardiolipin synthases, indicating a conserved strategy of surface lipid remodeling. These findings redefine the spatial organization of lipid metabolism in Gram-negative bacteria and reveal an adaptive mechanism to maintain OM integrity when membrane asymmetry is compromised.",

          "abstract": "Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death, is characterized by massive cell swelling and plasma membrane rupture. Although swelling was recently shown to occur in two steps, the molecular and biophysical mechanisms driving this process remained unclear. Using fast quantitative microscopy, we reveal that between the two swelling phases, cell volume transiently stabilizes despite sustained plasma membrane permeability to ions and small molecules. From a biophysical perspective, the existence of such a plateau is puzzling, as ion pumps should not be able to regulate cell volume under these conditions. To address this, we developed a physical model based on an ion pump and leak framework that incorporates the dynamics of nonselective pore formation. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the plateau phase is controlled by the dynamics of the gasdermin D (GSDMD) pore enlargement, which is modulated by ninjurin-1 (Ninj1) activation, possibly through intracellular calcium. Ninj1-mediated lesions are also required for the second swelling phase. We further show that fully opened GSDMD pores display an effective hydrodynamic radius slightly above 1.9 nm, providing an in situ upper bound for pore size. Together, our findings demonstrate that pyroptotic volume dysregulation emerges from the successive and interdependent actions of GSDMD and Ninj1, each imparting distinct permeability regimes associated with increased water filtration and decreased ion selectivity due to pore opening. These insights bridge molecular and biophysical perspectives on lytic cell death and may inform the broader understanding of membrane rupture in inflammatory and pathological contexts.",

In the current conceptual framework, the initial stone nidus is thought to include the aggregation of inorganic crystallites, the formation of which is favored by elevated concentrations of dissolved constituents. Here, we show that this highly prevalent stone type comprises a form of organic–inorganic polycrystalline biocomposite with integrated bacterial biofilms. Evidence from electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy reveal the unanticipated internal structure of kidney stones from human patients, where bacterial biofilms are intercalated between polycrystalline mineral layers, even in stones identified as “noninfectious” clinically, including those in patients without underlying urinary tract infections. We observe similar bacterial biofilm architectures on the surfaces of stone fragments obtained due to lithotripsy, suggesting that bacteria are intrinsic to the process of nephrolithiasis. Crystallites proximal to biofilm layers exhibit significantly smaller grain sizes, which indicate a larger local concentration of nucleation sites. Staining reveals that biofilm areas of these stones are enriched with bacterial DNA. That bacteria are now observed so broadly in kidney stones (including even in less prevalent struvite stones) may be conceptually salient: Based on the evidence adduced here, we propose a model in which the urine-rich environment of the kidney can impinge on bacterial calcium homeostasis and amplify bacterial production of nucleation templates such as extracellular DNA. The resultant counterion condensation intrinsic to polyelectrolytes charged beyond the Manning criterion (such as DNA) drastically enhances the probability of heterogeneous nucleation, thereby amplifying calcium oxalate stone formation.",

While their steady-state flow behavior is reasonably well understood, their response to complex flow histories, as encountered in operations like pumping or mixing, remains poorly known. Using a custom multiaxis shear apparatus that enables arbitrary changes in flow direction, we investigate how shear history influences the mechanical behavior of a model soft glassy system. We uncover a transient shear response orthogonal to the applied shear direction, together with an anisotropic yield surface. These effects point to an underlying anisotropic distribution of internal stresses imprinted by previous deformation. To rationalize this behavior, we use a mesoscopic elastoplastic model, demonstrating that local mechanical disorder governs the emergence of macroscopic stress–flow misalignment. Our findings offer a route to experimentally probe the distribution of local yield stresses in soft glassy materials.",

          "abstract": "Compacting chromatin within the cellular nucleus presents a significant challenge for biology. Chromosomes must be both condensed and spatially organized to enable essential processes such as transcription and replication. Chromosome conformation capture experiments (e.g., Hi-C) provide valuable information about the spatial organization and, therefore, the connectivity between different genomic regions. These experiments inspired polymer models that describe the physical mechanism of the chromosomal energy landscape. The Full-Inversion Chromatin model (FI-Chrom), a data-driven approach for modeling genome organization, uses Hi-C contact maps to infer pairwise interaction potentials between all chromosomal loci. It combines Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-accelerated simulations with efficient training of tens of millions of parameters derived from the maximum-entropy principle to determine 3D structures of chromosomes that accurately reproduce Hi-C-like data. FI-Chrom does not make any a priori assumptions regarding chromosome architecture, making it applicable to any chromosome conformation capture experiment. Its derived structural ensembles capture all essential features from the short- and long-range interactions of typical chromosome organization, such as segregated compartments, chromosome territories, and fully or partially formed loops. Although Hi-C contains only structural information, FI-Chrom extends these data by revealing an emergent dynamical mechanism encoded in the inferred energy landscape. For example, simulations show that chromatin loops are not static architectural features but rather transient structural elements. Statistical analyses further indicate that loops confined within a single compartment occur more frequently than those spanning multiple compartments, highlighting the dynamic and compartment-dependent nature of chromatin organization.",

          "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation induces pyrimidine dimers in DNA, which block replication, but are efficiently removed by excision, allowing replication restart. Interestingly, soon after restart, the cells become capable of inducible stable DNA replication (iSDR) without new origin-initiations—suggesting unusual replication topology. The original idea was that the preexisting forks remain dormant even after UV-lesion removal, and when the new origin-initiated forks arrive, they rear-end the dormant forks, creating potential for iSDR. While there is origin-overinitiation after UV, the current idea is that preexisting forks are restarted—making the iSDR potential unclear. We used replication profiling of post-UV cells to investigate reactivation of UV-blocked forks. To compare profile time-sequences, we developed indexation procedure generating nested profile sets. Wild type nested set shows: 1) no replication during the first 30 min post-UV; 2) overinitiation from the origin combined with restart of preexisting forks during the next 30 min post-UV. The restart required RecBCD enzyme to repair double-strand breaks, confirming that the UV-stalled forks disintegrate and need recombinational repair to restart. Preexisting fork restart is separate from new origin-initiations by DnaA, as the dnaA (Ts) mutant at 42 °C restarts preexisting forks normally. Remarkably, the absence of powerful replication wave from origin-initiations in the dnaA mutant reveals a restart-initiated replication wave toward the origin, indicating that the restart mechanism causes fork triplication—potentially explaining the SDR phenomenon. There is no post-UV replication in the dnaA recBC double mutant, consistent with only two pathways of replication resumption in post-UV cells: restart or new origin-initiation.",

Here, we establish the universal symmetry principles governing the topology of polar textures in large polarons. Using a group-theoretic analysis, we identify four distinct classes of polar textures in time-reversal-invariant systems, and we show that they carry integer topological charges. We validate this classification by performing state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of materials representative of each class.

Basal land plants such as bryophytes and pteridophytes have motile sperm, whereas most seed plants have nonmotile sperm, delivered by a pollen tube. Despite being seed plants, gymnosperm cycads and ginkgo uniquely form highly multiflagellated and large motile sperm within pollen tubes. However, the evolutionary state of these male reproductive cells remains unknown. We clarified the gene expression profiles of Cycas revoluta pollen tubes and motile sperm swimming toward female reproductive cells. Male cycad cells expressed fewer genes associated with transcription, translation, and related processes, which is consistent across land plants. We compared the distinctive orthologous groups (OGs) of the genes specifically expressed in sperm and pollen tubes with those in other plants. Cycad pollen tubes shared several OGs with angiosperms but possessed significantly fewer gene copies and lacked cell wall remodeling and plasma membrane-localized receptor genes that contribute to rapid and guided growth. The growth mechanism of cycad pollen tubes might be largely different from angiosperm pollen tubes. In contrast, despite their morphological uniqueness, cycad sperm shared representative OGs with angiosperm sperm cells to the same extent as egg cells. In addition, a sperm-specific histone variant may contribute to transcriptional regulation via chromatin condensation like other male gametes. As an extant gymnosperm that retains zooidogamy with pollen tubes, the cycad represents a molecular intermediate state in the transition from zooidogamy to siphonogamy, providing insight into the evolution of land plant fertilization.",

On the other hand, human replication protein A (hRPA) plays a central role in stabilizing single-stranded DNA and resolution of secondary structures. Understanding how hRPA interacts with TNR hairpins has become crucial to uncovering the mechanisms that regulate TNR stability. Here, we employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to investigate the interaction between hRPA and CTG repeat hairpins of varying lengths. We found that blunt-end hairpins impede hRPA resolution, while the presence of a short overhang facilitates initial binding followed by invasion. At higher repeat lengths, hRPA binding induces partial hairpin resolution, followed by conformational slippage that restores blunt-end hairpin structures and hinders further progression. Hairpin resolution is coordinated by the interplay of the multiple dynamic binding modes of hRPA and the slippage reconfiguration of the TNR hairpins. Moreover, our results reveal a concentration- and stoichiometry-dependent resolution process, herein full resolution of TNR hairpins with pathologically relevant repeat lengths requires protein concentrations exceeding physiological levels, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis.",

Applying our framework to cortical activity in humans, we find that the vast majority of variance in activity is explained by a small number of correlations. This means that the brain is highly compressible: Only a sparse network of correlations is needed to predict large-scale activity. We find that this compressibility is strikingly consistent across different individuals and cognitive tasks and that, counterintuitively, the most important correlations are not necessarily the strongest.

Much of the virulence of these OMVs is mediated by the metalloprotease PrtA. While Yulü/Shenshu do not display any protease inhibition activity, the detection of an association between Yulü and the Drosophila complement thioester-containing protein 2 (Tep2) led to the finding that both Tep2 and Tep4 mutants are sensitive to the injection of PrtA while their overexpression significantly protects wild-type flies from the effects of this protease. Both Tep2 and Tep4 are able to inhibit the activity of PrtA in a thioester- and yulü/shenshu -dependent manner. Thus, these Teps may also function as α2-macroglobulins.",

Whether and how the passage and accompanied modification of these proteins across the Golgi is controlled remains unclear. Here, we show that leptin receptor overlapping transcript (LEPROT) and LEPROT-like 1 (LEPROTL1) regulate TM receptor activation by securing their sufficient Golgi retention. LEPROTs localize to cis and medial Golgi in a coat protein complex I (COPI)-dependent manner. LEPROTs interact directly with COPI coats and simultaneously engage a variety of integral membrane proteins with relatively long TM domains at acidic pH. Deletion of LEPROTs in cells causes expedited release of TM receptors transiting through the Golgi. Loss of LEPROTs dysregulates receptor signaling activity, including that of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and transferrin receptor (TFRC), due to defective modification. Collectively, LEPROTs serve as a class of COPI cargo receptors for TM receptors, ensuring adequate preparation, which is vital for subsequent action on the PM.",

Here, we invented a live-attenuated broad-spectrum coronavirus vaccine (cb1) by changing the codon usage bias of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which maintained amino acid conservation but reduced virulence. A single intranasal dose of cb1 vaccine elicits remarkably broad and potent immunity that overcomes existing parenteral vaccine’s limitations. cb1 induced robust neutralizing antibody and T cell responses that translated into complete protection in animal models, including prevention of viral transmission to unvaccinated contacts. Notably, cb1 provided cross-protection not only against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern but also against more divergent SARS-CoV-1 and hCoV-OC43, a breadth of immunity unparalleled by current vaccines. These findings highlight the potential of cb1 to address urgent needs for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines that elicit mucosal immunity with broad, long-lasting efficacy, eliminating the necessity for frequent updates.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning holds great promise for classifying and identifying fossils, and has recently been marshaled to identify trackmakers of dinosaur footprints and address long-standing debates over whether some dinosaur tracks are the oldest birds or ornithopods (duck-billed herbivores and kin) in the fossil record, or alternatively were made by nonavian theropods. Existing methods in paleontology, however, require supervision and a priori labeling of training data by researchers, which can lead to bias. We employ an unsupervised machine learning technique for recognizing inherent patterns in shape data, using a disentangled variational autoencoder network, to a database of 1,974 footprints, spanning a diversity of dinosaurs across their evolutionary history, including modern birds. Our neural network identified eight features of shape variation that most differentiate these tracks: overall load and shape (amount of ground contact area), digit spread, digit attachment, heel load, digit and heel emphasis, loading position, heel position, and left–right load. With the unsupervised process finished, we a posteriori labeled each track based on published expert judgments, plotted them into morphospace, and applied distance metrics to group means and nearest neighbors, which showed 80 to 93% agreement with expert identifications. Controversial Late Triassic-Early Jurassic bird-like tracks group with fossil and modern birds and some Middle Jurassic three-toed tracks with ornithopods, supporting an older origin for these groups than recorded by body fossils. We provide an app, DinoTracker, to make this process accessible, and source code that can be adapted to other cases where paleontologists or biologists are studying patterns of shape variation.",

However, most eTPD receptors are expressed broadly or are restricted to the liver, limiting specific degradation in other tissues. Cytokine receptor–targeting chimeras (kineTACs) are genetically encoded bispecifics for eTPD that fuse a natural ligand like CXCL12 to an antibody, directing soluble or membrane proteins for lysosomal degradation using the widely expressed chemokine receptor CXCR7 (K. Pance et al. , Nat. Biotechnol. 41 , 273–281 (2023)]. Here, we dramatically expand the kineTAC toolbox by constructing 81 different kineTACs based on an unbiased list of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Remarkably, 55 of these expressed at suitable levels for analysis without any optimization. Many of these kineTACs bind receptors that have unique cell-type expression profiles, allowing for eTPD in specific cells and tissues, and some were more potent than the original CXCL12-based kineTAC against specific targets. We further show the internalizing capability of a kineTAC can enhance the performance of antibody drug conjugates. We believe these simple, genetically encoded tools will be useful for expanding the applications for optimized or cell type–selective eTPD.",

While numerous studies have explored the mechanisms and functions of body coloration as a sexual signal, the role of another essential property of light—polarization—remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the question of whether and how polarization signals achieve high conspicuousness under sexual selection, including their visibility and associated behavioral and morphological adaptations, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we identified a strikingly conspicuous polarization signal used specifically during courtship in the cuttlefish Doratosepion andreanum and investigated the underlying optical mechanism. The signal consists of a pattern of adjacent horizontally and vertically polarized areas, optimizing signal detectability for cephalopod polarization vision. This pattern is generated by reflective cells called iridophores and transparent muscle: light becomes horizontally polarized when reflected by iridophores, and its angle of polarization is then rotated to vertical when transmitted through a birefringent muscle layer. Our findings show the significant contribution of polarization of light to animal communication and reveal that polarization signals—like colorful sexual ornaments—can achieve high conspicuousness through fundamentally different optical mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Lineages undergoing rapid evolutionary diversification may evolve a set of mixed traits as a result of hybrid speciation, gene flow, or incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). However, how best to quantify these alternative processes impacting phenotypic variation remains unclear. Here, we examined trait evolution in two sister genera of endangered Asian primates, Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus . By assembling a de novo genome of the Trachypithecus pileatus group, which is geographically located in a transitional zone between these two genera, our integrated phylogenomic analyses clarified the evolutionary relationship of the T. pileatus group with other Trachypithecus species. We also identified that morphological similarities shared between this species group and Semnopithecus are the result of ILS, rather than gene flow or hybrid speciation. Across all chromosomes of the T. pileatus group, ILS contributed 8.9% of whole genome segments. Across these segments, we distinguished 77 genes such as FGFBP1 and FOXO1 that are involved in pathways of bone development and osteoblast differentiation. Functional experiments indicate that FGFBP1 genotypes shared by species of the T. pileatus group and Semnopithecus appear to enhance osteogenic capability and mineralization, possibly resulting in larger body size and similarities in skull morphology compared with other species of Trachypithecus . The study reveals that ILS has shaped the evolution of mixed traits within gene-regulatory networks, driving phenotypic diversity during periods of rapid species divergence in this highly successful primate radiation. ILS appears to be more common than previously thought and represents a critical step in accurately assessing the phylogeny of closely related taxa.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for the global optimization of a possibly multimodal continuous function in a bounded rectangular domain. We first show that global optimization is equivalent to an optimal (sampling) strategy formation in a two-armed decision model with known distributions, based on the strategic law of large numbers we establish. There are many optimal strategies in general. We show that a concrete strategy using the sign of the partial gradient of the unique solution to a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) is asymptotically optimal. Motivated by these results, we propose a class of Strategic Monte Carlo Optimization (SMCO) algorithms, which uses a simple strategy that makes coordinate-wise two-armed decisions based on the signs of the partial gradient (or practically the first difference) of the objective function, without the need of solving PDEs. Under some sufficient conditions, we establish that our SMCO algorithm converges to a local optimizer from a single starting point, and to a global optimizer under a growing set of starting points. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate the suitability of our SMCO algorithms for global optimization well beyond the theoretical guarantees established herein. For a wide range of deterministic and random test functions with challenging landscapes (multimodal, nondifferentiable, discontinuous), our SMCO algorithms perform robustly well, even in high-dimensional ( d = 200 ∼ 1 , 000 ) settings. In fact, our algorithms outperform many state-of-the-art global optimizers, as well as local algorithms (with the same set of starting points as ours).",

          "abstract": "Cystobactamids are nonribosomal peptide natural products that function as DNA gyrase inhibitors, exhibiting significant antibacterial activity. They are isolated from Cystobacter sp. Cbv34 and contain various alkoxy groups on para-aminobenzoic acid moieties, which are believed to play a crucial role in antibacterial functions. The alkoxy groups are generated by iterative methylations on a methoxy group by the cobalamin (Cbl)-dependent radical S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme CysS. CysS catalyzes up to three methylations to give ethoxy, isopropoxy, sec-butoxy, and tert-butoxy groups. For each methylation, CysS uses a ping–pong mechanism in which two molecules of SAM are consumed. One SAM is used to methylate cob(I)alamin, while another generates a 5′-deoxyadenosyl 5′-radical to initiate substrate methylation. However, little is known about how the enzyme promotes both Cbl methylation and iterative substrate methylation, which occur by polar S N 2 and radical processes, respectively. Here, we report three X-ray crystal structures of a homolog of CysS from Corallococcus sp. CA054B . Two were determined in the presence of methoxy- and ethoxy-containing substrates, showing how CysS accommodates substrates and products during iterative methylation. The third structure, determined in the absence of a substrate, exhibits structural changes that reorient the SAM’s conformation to allow for the methylation of cob(I)alamin.",

We postulated that NRF2 high PDAC can be selectively targeted by C29h, a prodrug that is activated by the NRF2-induced enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), which is elevated in human pancreatic tumors. Initial evaluations of C29h alone or together with the standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine were conducted on NQO1 high human and mouse PDAC cell lines and patient-derived organoids. As PDAC is enriched in collagen-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) that activates NRF2 and induces NQO1 expression, we examined the ECM effect on the response to C29h, as well as in vivo tumor control in IKKα-deficient Kras G12D /Ikkα ΔPEC mice in which NRF2 is strongly activated, immunocompromised Nu/Nu mice orthotopically transplanted with human PDAC cells and C57BL/6n and NOD/SCID mice transplanted with mouse PDAC. C29h led to NQO1-dependent killing of human and mouse PDAC cell lines and organoids and acted additively with gemcitabine. Furthermore, ECM-plated PDAC cells were more susceptible to C29h cytotoxicity than cells grown on plastic. Importantly, C29h treatment induced tumor regression and increased the survival of PDAC-bearing mice and optimal C29h-induced tumor regression was dependent on CD8 + T lymphocytes whose tumoral recruitment was enhanced by drug treatment. This study supports the use of C29h alone or as part of a drug combination as an effective and promising strategy for selective eradication of NRF2 high PDAC.",

Using 94,515 samples from 0 to 200 cm depth, combined with subregional classification (such as soil type, land use, climate, geomorphology, and soil texture) which helps address spatial heterogeneity, we obtain relatively accurate global distribution data for EC (Electrical Conductivity) and SIC. EC of 0 to 40 cm layer positively influences SIC in most taxonomic subregions, which may be due to the inorganic CO 2 absorption influenced by pH and salinity. EC of 80 to 100 cm layer sometimes negatively influences SIC due to the increase of soil depth. When EC is below 4 dS/m, EC often positively influences SIC. When EC increases by 2 to 4 dS/m, the mean global SIC in 0 to 20, 20 to 40, and 80 to 100 cm layers increases from 66.15, 78.75, and 117.39 to 174.47 to 190.38, 132.76 to 154.98, and 149.14 to 161.37 g/kg, respectively.

          "abstract": "Whiteflies pose a major threat to crops worldwide, primarily because they transmit begomoviruses with which they have evolved intricate mutualistic relationships. The mutualisms are known to exacerbate whitefly invasions and drive widespread plant virus pandemics. Yet, certain plant genotypes are able to resist both the whiteflies and the viruses and a good understanding of the underlying mechanisms could help to develop more resistant varieties. Here, we show that the viruliferous whitefly Bemisia tabaci induces an early and strong release of the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene in cultivated tomato plants. This volatile functions as an airborne signal that primes neighboring conspecifics for enhanced resistance to begomoviruses, including Tomato yellow leaf curl virus and Papaya leaf curl China virus. These results challenge the view that whitefly-induced volatile emissions primarily benefit the insect vector, suggesting instead that the plant prioritizes antiviral defense over antiherbivore resistance. β-Caryophyllene exposure was also found to enhance the emission of β-Caryophyllene, methyl salicylate and β-myrcene upon whitefly attack, increasing plant attractiveness to the parasitoid Encarsia formosa . Using a β-caryophyllene overproducing transgenic tomato line and synthetic β-caryophyllene dispensers, we confirmed that β-caryophyllene exposure primes antipathogen defenses in tomato plants and confers improved plant fitness under sustained infestation by viruliferous whiteflies. Importantly, this defense priming is genotype-specific and limited to certain tomato cultivars, suggesting that β-caryophyllene-mediated resistance can be harnessed through selective breeding. Our findings reveal a volatile-based mechanism by which tomato plants may counteract the virus–vector mutualism, offering promising avenues for integrated pest and disease management.",

Our findings reveal that HearNPV triggers a calcium response in enteroendocrine cells, leading to the release of midgut-derived tachykinin (TK). Released TK activates its receptor (TKR) in the brain, thereby promoting phototaxis and climbing behavior. Additionally, HaTTD14 functions as a downstream regulator of the TK–TKR signaling pathway.

However, the dynamics of nesprins within physiological forces and loading rates remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ magnetic-tweezers-based single-molecule manipulation alongside molecular dynamic simulations and AlphaFold structural predictions to comprehensively investigate the dynamics of force-bearing spectrin repeat (SR) domains of the giant nesprin-2 protein. Through direct quantification, we unveil that the numerous SRs undergo mechanical unfolding and refolding dynamics with distinct transition rates within several pN scale. Furthermore, we show that the giant nesprin-2 could act as an effective molecular absorber adeptly maintaining forces on the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton linkage within a few pN across displacement spans exceeding one μm.

          "abstract": "Realization of unusual particle-to-wave-like crossover in phonon transport and understanding its fundamental structural origin can guide the design of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity. Here, we report such a crossover from particle-like phonon propagation to wave-like coherence with increasing temperature in the zero-dimensional (0D) metal halide, Tl 2 AgI 3 . Composed of discrete (Tl 6 I) 5+ and (Ag 3 I 8 ) 5− subunits, the structure exhibits intrinsic lattice instability governed by Pauling’s third rule where face-sharing of polyhedra drives Coulombic cationic repulsion causing local distortion of Ag atoms, as confirmed by synchrotron X-ray pair distribution function (X-PDF) analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Anharmonic low-energy rattling of Tl is evidenced within the (Tl 6 I) 5+ framework. These structural disorders generate low-frequency localized and anharmonic optical phonons that hybridize with acoustic branches, strongly suppressing lattice thermal conductivity ( κ l ). Consequently, κ l drops to ~0.18 W/m.K at 125 K and remains nearly temperature independent, signaling a breakdown of the phonon-gas model, attributed to phonon localization and wave-like coherence, modeled using the linearized Wigner transport equation (LWTE). The phonon localization in the 0D crystal structure results in a crossover from populations conductivity ( κ p ) associated with particle-like phonon propagation to coherence conductivity ( κ c ) through wave-like tunneling, at 175 K. Our study reveals 0D structural confinement along with anharmonic local structural dynamics can enable particle-to-wave-like phonon crossover, establishing a pathway to mixed phononic regimes and suppressed thermal transport.",

          "abstract": "Structural dynamics are fundamental to protein functions and mutation effects. Current protein deep learning models are predominantly trained on sequence and/or static structure data, which often fail to capture the dynamic nature of proteins. To address this, we introduce SeqDance and ESMDance, two protein language models trained on dynamic biophysical properties derived from molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses of over 64,000 proteins. Both models can be directly applied to predict dynamic properties of unseen ordered and disordered proteins. SeqDance, trained from scratch, has attentions that capture dynamic interaction and comovement between residues, and its embeddings encode rich representations of protein dynamics that can be further utilized to predict conformational properties beyond the training tasks via transfer learning. SeqDance predicted dynamic property changes reflect mutation effect on protein folding stability. ESMDance, built upon ESM2 (Evolutionary Scale Model II) outputs, substantially outperforms ESM2 in zero-shot prediction of mutation effects for designed and viral proteins which lack evolutionary information. Together, SeqDance and ESMDance offer a framework for integrating protein dynamics into language models, enabling more generalizable predictions of protein behavior and mutation effects.",

          "abstract": "Biological polymers often face a trade-off between stiffness, strength, and extensibility: Materials that are strong and stiff tend to be brittle, while those that are elastic and extensible usually lack strength. Here, we show that netcasting spiders (Deinopidae) overcome this trade-off by forming mixed-silk metastructures, which enable both high elastic deformation and load resistance. These spiders have evolved a unique predatory strategy, casting a sticky silk web over prey, which subjects the web radii to extreme strains far exceeding those sustained by typical spider silk fibers. The radii consist of a compound filament with an elastomeric core surrounded by looped bundles of thin fibers. This architecture results in an unusual mechanical profile: The threads are initially compliant and highly extensible, but they stiffen as the fiber loops straighten, enhancing load-bearing capacity. Notably, spiders control this compound architecture through a reel-spinning technique, controlling loop formation and fiber mixture to establish an elasticity gradient across the web—stiff and strong in the main frame lines, yet soft and hyperelastic in the lower radii that undergo the greatest deformation during prey capture. These findings represent a unique case of behavioral modulation of silk processing to circumvent biomaterial trade-offs, enabling extraordinary dynamics and specialization of web architecture. The herein described principle of looped fiber-reinforced elastomers may also be transferred to the design of artificial materials for applications that require both high elasticity and strength.",

          "abstract": "The quadratic bound (QB) principle proposed by Böhning and Lindsay in 1988 is an important special case of the majorization–minimization or minorization-maximization optimization principle. The quadratic upper-bound (QUB) principle is pertinent to minimization; the analogous quadratic lower-bound principle is pertinent to maximization. Unfortunately, in minimizing a loss f ( θ ) , the QUB principle is limited by the difficulty of finding a constant positive definite matrix B such that B − d 2 f ( θ ) is positive semidefinite for all θ . This paper proposes a generalization of the QB principle that avoids this limitation. In particular, we construct QUB algorithms by replacing the matrix B by a continuous matrix-valued function B n ( θ ) that dominates the Hessian d 2 f ( θ ) and depends on the both the current iterate θ n and the next potential iterate θ . In practice, we require B n ( θ ) to be diagonal with its diagonal entries separated in θ . In other words, the i th diagonal entry of B n ( θ ) depends on θ only through its i th entry θ i . Theoretical analysis confirms that this class of generalized QB algorithms enjoys global convergence in favorable circumstances. For the scalar case, the tangency condition that the second derivative equals the bound function at the current point promotes superlinear convergence. Several numerical experiments implemented in Julia illustrate the power of the generalized QB principle.",

          "abstract": "The ocean is thought to be the terminal sink for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), persistent organofluorine chemicals used widely in modern commerce for decades. Industry and stewardship programs phased out the most abundantly produced legacy PFAS in the early 2000s due to toxicity concerns. However, they have since been replaced by shorter carbon chain and “novel” chemistries, and past work hypothesized likely increases in these replacement PFAS that were not previously quantifiable. To address this gap, we measured bulk extractable organofluorine (EOF) in archived liver and muscle tissues from pelagic Subarctic pilot whales over the last several decades. Results show EOF concentrations peaked in 2011 and declined by over 60% by 2023. Among a broad suite of targeted and suspect PFAS measured using high-resolution mass spectrometry, only one was consistently increasing through 2023. Tissue concentrations of four main legacy PFAS that accounted for over 75% of EOF were all decreasing by 2023. The timing of peak concentrations depended primarily on whether they were transported to the subarctic by ocean circulation or atmospheric deposition, with the latter declining much faster. Oceanic transport and bioaccumulation modeling suggests that decadal-scale lags between production and food web bioaccumulation are primarily driven by marine transport processes. Large declines in tissue concentrations in this study reinforce the effectiveness of phase-outs in chemical production. However, other work showing stable or increasing EOF in human serum suggests many emerging PFAS with more neutral physicochemical properties may be preferentially accumulating in terrestrial and nearshore environments compared to legacy PFAS.",

However, molecular pathways that safeguard mitochondrial homeostasis in the aging heart remain poorly understood. Here, we identify MTFR1L as a regulator of mitophagy that binds p-S65-Ub, a key signal amplifying the PINK1/Parkin axis. We find that MTFR1L is enriched in metabolically active tissues, particularly in the heart, where it regulates Parkin signaling. Genetic deletion of Mtfr1l in mice impairs stress-induced mitophagy and Parkin activation, leading to accumulation of damaged mitochondria, increased inflammation and senescence, and accelerated age-related cardiac dysfunction. Strikingly, cardiac expression of MTFR1L progressively decreases along with aging in mice, primates, and humans, coinciding with cardiomyocyte senescence and lipofuscin accumulation. Together, these findings uncover a role for MTFR1L in regulation of the p-S65-Ub/Parkin mitophagy axis and maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis during cardiac aging and suggest that age-associated loss of MTFR1L may contribute to age-related cardiac dysfunction. Based on these findings, we propose a therapeutic paradigm for the prevention of heart aging by restoring MTFR1L function.",

Here, utilizing in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy, we find a dense liquid layer mediated deposition of AuNPs at the pyrite–water interface in parts per billion-level gold-bearing solutions, a concentration that resembles crustal abundances. Real-time imaging reveals that a dense liquid layer forms at the pyrite–water interface, and it is proposed that AuNPs nucleate and grow in this layer. Results from in situ atomic force microscopy and ex situ transmission electron microscopy indicate that the growth kinetic process of AuNPs involves monomer-to-cluster aggregation, further enriching gold at the pyrite–water interface. Thermodynamic modeling demonstrates that precipitation of AuNPs is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity decrease in the dense liquid layer due to pyrite dissolution. These findings reveal a localized gold concentration mechanism to interpret adsorption and nucleation of AuNPs on pyrite during its dissolution–precipitation cycles, which significantly enhances our understanding of the highly effective gold scavenging from fluid by pyrite. The mechanism of nanoparticle formation in the dense liquid layer at dissolving mineral–fluid interfaces represents a fundamental process that could be common in nature.",

However, generating functional HSCs in vitro remains challenging, underscoring gaps in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, we identify GPR171, a P2Y-family G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), as a critical regulator of vertebrate embryonic HSC specification. Gpr171 is highly expressed in hemogenic endothelium and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. A deficiency in Gpr171 results in severe embryonic HSC deficits but does not impair vasculogenesis and primitive hematopoiesis. We further find that its endogenous ligand, coded by pcsk1nl , cooperates with Gpr171 to enhance HSC generation. Mechanistically, Gpr171 activates ERK1/2 and Notch signaling pathways independently and synergistically to promote HSC generation. Pharmacological treatment of zebrafish embryos with the human GPR171 ligand BigLEN significantly increases HSC numbers. Moreover, GPR171 signaling is evolutionarily conserved, as GPR171-deficient murine embryos also exhibit a significant reduction in functional HSCs. Overall, our findings reveal GPR171 as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of embryonic HSC specification and suggest its potential for translational applications in stem cell–based therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that spread by horizontal transfer and shape bacterial evolution. Plasmids are typically present at multiple copies per bacterial cell, and these extra copies increase the supply of plasmid mutations, potentially accelerating their evolution. However, the segregation of plasmid copies to daughter cells is random, introducing an additional layer of genetic drift, termed segregational drift, that might delay plasmid evolution. The interplay between plasmid mutational supply and segregational drift determines the evolutionary rate of plasmid-encoded genes, yet the relative contribution of these opposite forces in plasmid evolution remains unclear. Here, we develop a population genetics framework to predict the rate of plasmid mutations in bacterial populations and validate these predictions using computational, experimental, and bioinformatic approaches. Our findings show that plasmid mutation rates scale logarithmically with copy number and that the supply of new mutations consistently surpasses the impact of segregational drift across all copy numbers. These results underscore plasmids as powerful drivers of bacterial evolvability, where they can potentiate the evolution of critical traits such as antibiotic resistance.",

In vivo, sensory stimulation evoked a smaller and delayed capillary RBC flow in aged mice. Although activity-evoked PO 2 dips were diminished in aged mice; experimentally reducing PO 2 to comparable levels did not restore capillary flow in aged mice, consistent with diminished RBC O 2 responsiveness observed ex vivo. Notably, RBCs from aged mice in heterochronic parabiosis pairs (young-aged) displayed faster responses to low PO 2 compared to those from aged mice in isochronic pairs (aged-aged).

However, their evolutionary origins are poorly understood. Early birds and their closest relatives like Microraptor had a multiwinged configuration featuring long pennaceous feathers on their arms, legs, and tail, a configuration not seen today. The skill of these early flyers has been debated, centering around what was driving the evolution of this multiwing configuration and its loss in favor of the modern two-winged configuration. In this context, the aerodynamics and wing–wing interactions of Microraptor during gliding flight are investigated. The gliding flight mechanics of Microraptor exhibit flow patterns consistent with those observed and quantitatively assessed in volant living animal species. We analyze leading edge vortices on the forewing and hindwing including beneficial wake interactions between them as well as tip vortices on the distinct distally flared hindwing. The latter is unique in Microraptor as the hindwing’s characteristic outer span flare provides the necessary surface for the tip vortex to be bound to and thus contribute additional lift. These findings suggest that Microraptor evolved toward utilizing leading edge and tip vortices and their aerodynamic interactions. This implies that such utilization was also being exploited by other early multiwinged theropods to differing extents as part of a crucial milestone in early flight evolution.",

Protein folding has been one of the strongest constraints in sequence evolution. The method we propose compares the perturbations caused by local sequence variants to the energetics of the protein folding process and to the corresponding change to the apparent selection landscape of sequences over the evolutionary time scale. The difference between the physical folding free energies and the evolutionary free energies can be called a “dark energy.” We analyze various protein sets and thereby show that dark energy is largely localized at functional sites, which are also often energetically frustrated from the point of view of folding. Overall, we find that about 25% of the positions of the folded globular proteins display some significant dark energy. When a function relies on a free energy that can be thermodynamically quantified, such as the binding energy to a partner, the relationship of this physical free energy with dark energy can be used to define a functional selection temperature, just as there is a selection temperature for folding. We show that selection for folding and binding functions bear similar weights in specific protein–protein interactions.",

Here, we present the functional and structural characterization of two camelid antibody fragments, or nanobodies, F1 and E6, that inhibit α7 activity by acting as negative allosteric modulators, an underrepresented class of ligands. Cryo-EM structures of the nanobodies in complex with α7 show that both nanobodies form a pentameric bundle at the apex of the receptor, each nanobody interacting through a conserved set of residues at α7 subunit interfaces. Electrophysiological experiments suggest that E6 inhibits the activity of α7 by stabilizing its resting conformation, and that internanobodies interactions are key to its activity.

One of the crucial factors turns out to be the cushioning effect of the gas surrounding the droplet. This fact, together with the observation that almost all of the relevant literature was done in air, triggers the question what would happen when the liquid was a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid in thermal equilibrium with its own vapor, as is the case during transport of cryogenic liquids such as liquid hydrogen. To investigate precisely this question, we experimentally generate droplets in thermodynamical equilibrium with their own vapor, even before impact, such that minute energy exchanges of the droplet with its surroundings can trigger phase change. Using a frustrated total internal reflection setup, we make the exciting observation that depending on the impact speed and vapor conditions, the entrapment of vapor can be completely suppressed under boiling liquid conditions. We create a simplified model based on scaling arguments and perform numerical simulations considering both the compressible and condensable properties of the vapor layer that are in very good agreement with our experimental findings.

          "abstract": "Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) unifies a broad class of machine learning techniques from the perspectives of symmetries, offering a framework for introducing problem-specific inductive biases like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the current formulation of GDL is limited to global symmetries. We propose to relax GDL to allow for local symmetries, specifically fibration symmetries, which only require isomorphic input trees—a property that is much more common in real-world graphs. We show that GNNs apply the inductive bias of fibration symmetries and derive a tighter upper bound for their expressive power. Additionally, by identifying symmetries in networks, we compress network nodes, thereby increasing their computational efficiency during both inference and training of deep neural networks. The mathematical extension introduced here applies beyond graphs to manifolds, bundles, and grids for the development of models with inductive biases induced by local symmetries that can lead to better generalization.",

          "abstract": "Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor has transformed the treatment of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and the predominant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) variant F508del by delivering the faulty channel to the plasma membrane and potentiating its activity. However, the action of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on the molecular behavior of F508del-CFTR is unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on individual human F508del-CFTR Cl − channels using the patch-clamp technique and cells heterologously expressing F508del-CFTR. Chronic treatment of F508del-CFTR-expressing cells with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, but not pairs of CFTR modulators, stabilized F508del-CFTR, preventing channel deactivation in cell-free membrane patches and conferring upon it the current amplitude of wild-type CFTR with channel activity sustained at a level one-third that of wild-type CFTR. By incubating cells with different drug concentrations, we demonstrated that elexacaftor stabilizes the open-channel conformation of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR, while acute treatment of wild-type CFTR with elexacaftor increased current flow through the channel and potentiated channel gating. Of note, acute treatment of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR Cl − channels with elexacaftor and ivacaftor restored wild-type levels of channel activity to the CFTR variant, albeit its gating pattern was distinct from that of wild-type CFTR and characterized by infrequent prolonged bursts of channel openings. In conclusion, chronic treatment with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor plus acute treatment with elexacaftor and ivacaftor robustly corrects the processing, stability, and gating defects of F508del-CFTR. Our results reveal that elexacaftor is a triple-acting CFTR modulator with corrector, potentiator, and conduction activities, making it a valuable therapeutic to rescue CFTR variants with distinct molecular mechanisms of CFTR dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "Type III secretion systems (T3SS) are critical virulence machines in many Gram-negative bacteria, enabling hierarchical secretion of translocases followed by effectors. In the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS, the regulatory protein InvE (SctW) enforces this order. Here, we show that InvE assembles into tetramers and higher-order oligomers and that oligomerization is essential for function. A 2.4 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals a tetramer built as a dimer of antiparallel dimers. Photocrosslinking maps one set of residues to the interdimer seams in this tetramer, while crosslinks from additional sites suggest lateral docking between dimers in alternative registries in vivo. Blue-native electrophoresis and SEC–MALS detect native high-molecular-weight species consistent with such assemblies. DNA-PAINT superresolution microscopy confirms the presence of higher-order InvE oligomers in vivo. Charge-reversal mutations that disrupt oligomerization collapse InvE to monomers and abolish secretion, effector translocation, invasion, and virulence. Together, these data define an oligomerization-based switch in which InvE reuses the dimeric face to form higher-order contacts that govern the transition from translocase to effector secretion.",

However, how working memory content evolves and is transmitted across cortical regions remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the flow of working memory information across the cortex using time-resolved fMRI decoding. Across multiple regions in visual and parietal cortex, we found that decoded working memory content drifted over time from the memoranda toward the later errors in memory reports, consistent with the dynamics of memory drift predicted by attractor models. These behaviorally predictive neural memory errors emerged earliest in higher-order dorsal visual area (V3AB) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS0) and then later in early visual cortex (V1), suggesting a propagation of mnemonic information originated in higher-level visual area. Interareal correlation analyses revealed that during memory maintenance, information flowed predominantly in a top–down manner—from higher to lower visual areas, whereas during passive viewing, feedforward dynamics prevailed. Together, our findings demonstrate that working memory maintenance involves temporally structured drift dynamics and feedback-dominated information flow across the cortical hierarchy, providing a mechanistic link between neural population dynamics and the formation of memory errors.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive changes in organ size and function occur in most animals, but how these changes are regulated is not well understood. Previous research found that mating in Drosophila females promotes intestinal stem cell proliferation and increases the overall size of the endodermal portion of the intestine (the “midgut”). Other studies reported mating-dependent changes in feeding behavior, midgut gene expression, and whole-body lipid storage, suggesting altered metabolism. Here, we show that mating dramatically alters female midgut metabolism and digestive function. Mating increased relative levels of TCA cycle intermediates, fatty acids, and ceramides in the gut, increased total midgut lipids and protein, and reduced relative carbohydrate levels. Mating also enhanced the efficiency of protein digestion relative to carbohydrate digestion. Corroborating a previous report [M. A. White, A. Bonfini, M. F. Wolfner, N. Buchon, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118 , e2018112118 (2021)], we found that the expression of genes that mediate protein and carbohydrate and metabolism was similarly altered. In addition, we noted a mating-dependent downregulation of oxidative stress response and autophagy genes. Mating-dependent increases in ecdysone receptor (EcR) signaling were important for increasing TCA cycle intermediates, protein, and ceramides in the female midgut, but had minimal effects on bulk lipid accumulation. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the physiological changes that occur during adaptive intestinal growth, and how they are regulated.",

          "abstract": "Topoisomerase enzymes are essential for the regulation of DNA topology. Human topoisomerase IIIα is a Type 1A topoisomerase that exists as a complex with RMI1 and RMI2, known as TRR. The TRR complex can unlink entwined DNA strands and is known to be important for resolving DNA replication and recombination intermediates. It has recently been proposed that TRR can also relax transient negatively supercoiled loops of DNA generated by the translocase PICH and that this activity may help to facilitate the resolution of ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs) between segregating sister chromatids. However, the mechanism by which TRR interacts with, and processes, negatively supercoiled DNA is not well understood. Here, we establish a single-molecule strategy to simultaneously measure real-time changes in supercoiling density and visualize the interactions of TRR with underwound DNA using a combination of optical tweezers and fluorescence imaging. We demonstrate that TRR relaxes highly negatively supercoiled DNA in a processive manner and that the timescale for relaxation is less than the expected lifetime of the negatively supercoiled loops generated by PICH. We also show that in the absence of free protein in solution, TRR remains bound to the DNA for long time periods after the torsional stress has been released. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for how TRR can relax negative supercoils, consistent with its proposed role in UFB resolution. Moreover, our assay could also be widely applied to study the interactions of other families of topoisomerases with negatively supercoiled DNA.",

Here, we theoretically examine the transport of bacteria close to surfaces, isolating how the key processes of bacterial motility and fluid flow interact and alter surface adhesion. We exploit the disparity between the fluid velocity and the swimming velocity of common motile bacteria and, using a hybrid asymptotic-computational approach, we systematically derive the coarse-grained bacterial diffusivity close to surfaces as a function of swimming speed, rotational diffusivity, and shape. We calculate an analytical upper bound for the bacterial adhesion rate by considering the scenario in which bacteria adhere irreversibly to the surface on first contact. Our theory predicts that maximal adhesion occurs at intermediate flow rates: At lower flow rates, increasing flow increases surface adhesion, while at higher flow rates, adhesion is decreased by shear-induced cell reorientation.",

          "abstract": "Some mammals develop amyloid plaques and type 2 diabetes, much like humans, depending on the sequence of their islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). In humans, IAPP forms a toxic oligomer with a parallel β-sheet across residues 23 FGAIL 28 S. Using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, we monitor the structure of IAPP from seven different mammals, five of which are from species that can develop type 2 diabetes (ferret, raccoon, cat, baboon, and human) and three from those that do not (hamster, rat, and pig). G24 is isotope labeled to monitor for the presence of the oligomeric β-sheet previously found in human IAPP. For the species that develop type 2 diabetes, their IAPP is cytotoxic, and a β-sheet at G24 is observed during the lag phase prior to fibril formation. In contrast, the species that do not develop type 2 diabetes have nontoxic IAPP, and their IAPP does not form this β-sheet structure. Pig IAPP forms oligomers, but with a different structure that is nontoxic. Thus, an oligomer with a parallel β-sheet at G24 that resembles that of the known human IAPP oligomer correlates with cytotoxicity and propensity for type 2 diabetes. These results indicate that the sequence within the 20 to 29 region of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), long known to correlate with type 2 diabetes in mammals, determines the structure and toxicity of an oligomer, supporting the oligomer hypothesis for type 2 diabetes and providing an explanation other than plaque formation for why some mammals develop insulin deficiency in late-stage type 2 diabetes, and others do not.",

Here, we show that time evolution responds strongly to details of the dynamics by changing the speed of time flow: It has time-reparameterization softness. This finding reconciles both views: While local constraints reparameterize the flow of time, the global landscape determines relationships between different correlations at the same times. We show that modern algorithms developed to accelerate the relaxation to equilibrium act by changing the time reparameterization. Their success thus relies on their ability to exploit reparameterization softness. We conjecture that these results extend beyond the realm of glasses to the optimization of more general constraint satisfaction problems and to broader classes of algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Paleoclimates provide examples of past climate change that inform estimates of modern warming from greenhouse-gas emissions, known as Earth’s climate sensitivity. However, differences between past and present climate change must be accounted for when inferring climate sensitivity from paleoclimate evidence. The closest paleoclimate analog to near-term warming from greenhouse-gas emissions is the Pliocene (5.3 to 2.6 Ma), a warm epoch with atmospheric CO 2 concentrations similar to today. Recent reconstructions indicate the Pliocene was 1 °C warmer than previously thought, implying higher climate sensitivity, which is also supported by recent reconstructions showing more cooling with reduced CO 2 at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 19 to 23 thousand years ago). However, large-scale patterns of paleoclimate temperature change differ strongly from modern projections. Climate feedbacks and sensitivity depend on temperature patterns, and such “pattern effects” must be accounted for when using paleoclimates to constrain modern climate sensitivity. Here we combine data-assimilation reconstructions with atmospheric general circulation models to show Earth’s climate is more sensitive to Pliocene forcing than modern CO 2 forcing. Pliocene ice sheets, topography, and vegetation alter patterns of ocean warming and excite destabilizing cloud feedbacks, and LGM feedbacks are similarly amplified by the North American ice sheets. Accounting for paleoclimate pattern effects produces a best estimate (median) for modern climate sensitivity of 2.8 °C and 66% CI of 2.4 to 3.4 °C (90% CI: 2.1 to 4.0 °C), substantially reducing uncertainty in projections of 21st-century warming.",

At birth, cerebellar Purkinje cells receive inputs with similar synaptic strengths from multiple climbing fibers (CFs).

Here, we report that deleting metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) or protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ) in mice disrupts this selective strengthening and territory expansion of “winner” CFs during early development. This impairment leads to weaker synaptic transmission and diminished dendritic innervation territory of “winner” CFs at later stages. Notably, “winner” CF synapses in these mutants exhibit impaired long-term potentiation, reduced AMPA receptor expression, and simpler postsynaptic organizations. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for mGluR1–PKCγ signaling, besides its established role in eliminating “loser” CFs, in promoting the functional and structural maturation of “winner” CF synapses.",

We train a neural classifier to spot AI-generated Python functions in over 30 million GitHub commits by 160,097 software developers, tracking how fast, and where, these tools take hold. Currently AI writes an estimated 29% of Python functions in the US, a shrinking lead over other countries. We estimate quarterly output, measured in online code contributions, consequently increased by 3.6%. AI seems to benefit experienced, senior-level developers: they increased productivity and more readily expanded into new domains of software development. In contrast, early-career developers showed no significant benefits from AI adoption. This may widen skill gaps and reshape future career ladders in software development.",

Osmium (Os) and strontium (Sr) isotopic ratios are key tracers of past continental weathering and LIP eruptions. However, limited Cretaceous seawater Os and riverine Os–Sr data have hindered quantitative reconstructions. In this study, we present a long-term Os isotopic record from the Cretaceous to the present, revealing ~10– to 20–million-year cycles during the Cretaceous that align with rhythmic LIP eruptions. Seawater Os–Sr isotopic trends indicate transitions in continental weathering patterns during the Late Cretaceous [~90 million years ago (Ma)] and Paleogene (~35 Ma) ascribed to intensified weathering of interior Gondwana during the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and the uplift and glaciation of the Himalaya, respectively. Our Os isotopic record highlights its utility in tracing long-term LIP cycles and identifying major paleogeographic turning points.",

          "abstract": "Couple-close as a synthetic paradigm has the potential to change the way that synthetic organic chemists approach cyclic scaffold construction. One class of cyclic molecules that has been increasingly sought after is semisaturated cyclic scaffolds, whose specific blend of Csp 2 - and Csp 3 -hybridized components confers distinct properties to these species. However, existing methods to construct these scaffolds are limited, often relying on arene saturation or annulations that require lengthy de novo syntheses. Herein, we describe a unified and highly modular couple-close strategy for the synthesis of semisaturated scaffolds. This approach installs bifunctional linkers onto aromatic rings through a range of bond-forming reactions, and subsequent cyclization furnishes semisaturated bicyclic adducts. Key to this approach is a mechanistically distinct cobalt-catalyzed dehydrogenative radical cyclization that proceeds efficiently even on electronically unbiased arenes, enabling a broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions.",

By contrast, continued maintenance of the stem-cell pool within the apical meristem is unresponsive to environmental cues. Through a combination of modeling and experimentation in Arabidopsis , we reveal a negative feedback loop that buffers environmental signals. This loop comprises the determinacy-promoting pioneer transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) and the indeterminacy-promoting transcriptional co-repressor TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1). At the transition to the flower-producing reproductive phase, LFY directly and quantitatively up-regulates expression of TFL1 . TFL1 in turn negatively feeds back on LFY to prevent LFY overaccumulation. This blocks inflorescence termination even under strong florally inductive signals. Our work uncovers a mechanism for robust environmental buffering involving differential responses of two cell populations to the same environmental stimulus.",

Our results show that OPCs attempt to differentiate throughout the adult central nervous system with spatial and temporal regularity. The differentiation rate was not influenced by myelin demand or oligodendrocyte loss and declined with age and in response to acute inflammation. The results suggest that OPC differentiation is governed primarily by constitutive processes and might be negatively influenced by aging and inflammation.",

Depleting MLT2A1 resulted in a failure in embryo development and a reduction in ZGA gene expression. Mechanistically, MLT2A1s synthesized chimeric transcripts with downstream coding and noncoding sequences, predominantly with heterologous retro–transposable elements. These diverse fusion sequences expanded the genome-targeting spectrum of MLT2A1 RNAs. Nevertheless, the shared MLT2A1 sequences partnered with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU) to recruit RNA polymerase II, promoting global transcription of ZGA genes and autoamplification of the MLT2A1 subfamily. Thus, MLT2A1 chimeric RNAs formed an interlocking network that acts synergistically to boost human ZGA and early embryogenesis.",

By splitting a spin-squeezed ensemble, we created an atomic sensor array featuring intersensor entanglement that can be flexibly configured to enhance measurement precision of multiple parameters jointly. Using an optimal estimation protocol, we achieved substantial gains over the standard quantum limit in key multiparameter estimation tasks, thus grounding the concept of quantum enhancement of field sensor arrays and imaging devices.",

Here, we report the discovery of a pan-Brassicaceae SRK-interacting interspecific pollen signal (SIPS). On B. rapa stigmas, SIPSs from Arabidopsis and other Brassicaceae species target Br SRK and recruit the female fertility regulator FERONIA receptor kinase to increase stigmatic reactive oxygen species and reduce interspecific pollen viability. Arabidopsis thaliana sips mutant pollen failed to trigger interspecific incompatibility responses. Unlike self-incompatibility, which is controlled by the polymorphic S locus, different genetic variants of SRK interacted comparably with SIPS. This study establishes SIPS-SRK as a Brassicaceae-specific ligand-receptor pair that broadly maintains the stigmatic interspecific barrier in self-incompatible species.",

We investigated interlayer exciton diffusion in tungsten diselenide–tungsten disulfide heterobilayers at ultralow exciton density and low temperatures to examine how charges affect exciton mobility. Near the electronic Mott insulator phase, we observed a giant thousand-fold enhancement of exciton diffusion relative to charge neutrality. We attribute this to mobile valence holes, which experienced a suppressed moiré potential due to charge order and recombined nonmonogamously with conduction electrons. Our results show exciton diffusion as a probe of correlated electron states and Bose-Fermi interplay.",

          "abstract": "Neuro- and retinal degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, stroke, age-related macular degeneration, and central retinal artery occlusion, rob millions of their independence. Studying these diseases in human retinas has been hindered by the rapid loss of neuronal activity after death. While some CNS activity has been restored postmortem, synchronized neuronal transmission beyond 30 min has remained elusive. We overcome this barrier by reviving and sustaining light signal transmission in human retinas recovered up to 4 hours after death and stored for up to 48 hours. We also introduce infrared-based ex vivo imaging for precise sampling, a closed perfusion system for drug testing, and an ex vivo ischemia-reperfusion model in mouse and human retina. This platform enables testing of neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of drugs targeting oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity. Our advances question the irreversibility of ischemic injury, support preclinical studies in vision restoration, offer insights into treating CNS ischemia, and pave the way for human donor eye transplantation.",

For thermoelectric devices, researchers principally focused on chemical reactivity and mechanical properties of material components, whereas precise control of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) remains elusive. Here, we propose an innovative strategy using negative-thermal-expansion (NTE) particles to regulate CTE and resolve interfacial incompatibility. Incorporating predesigned interface reaction–free NTE particles into Bi 2 Te 3 -based, Mg 3 Sb 2 -based, and PbTe-based materials effectively improves thermoelectric performance, alleviates thermal stress, and enhances interfacial stability across a broad temperature range (300 to 800 kelvin). Notably, the NTE-modified Mg 3 (Sb,Bi) 2 /Bi 0.4 Sb 1.6 Te 3 two-pair module achieves a record-high conversion efficiency (η) of 8.4% at Δ T  = 350 K with a 71% interfacial thermal stress reduction, maintaining a stable interface and unchanged η throughout 1000-hour (42 days) thermal cycling. Our strategy establishes a universal approach for improving interfacial compatibility in high-temperature functional modules including thermal-barrier coatings and solar thermophotovoltaic devices.",

However, the contribution of inflammatory forms of cell death in lung carcinogenesis and their effects on the composition of the tumor-immune microenvironment remain unclear. Our multi-omics analyses of samples from patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma revealed that necrosome signaling is repressed because of reduced expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 ( RIPK3 ). Distinct methylation signatures, both in the RIPK3 promoter and nonpromoter regions, correlated with lower transcription levels of RIPK3 . This resulted in limited expression of inflammatory genes, advanced histologic features, reduced immune cell invasion, and decreased patient survival. Mechanistically, we confirmed the tumor-suppressive role of necrosome signaling through the genetic deletion of Ripk3 in two independent, clinically relevant mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. Functionally, RIPK3 shaped a diverse immune environment by promoting the invasion of innate and adaptive immune cells in patient samples and experimental mice. Thus, RIPK3-mediated inflammatory signaling enhances a diverse immune microenvironment and hinders progression in lung adenocarcinoma.",

Here, we present a 2.5-Å cryogenic electron microscopy structure of NEP bound to the IAV polymerase and demonstrate that NEP alone is sufficient to promote vRNP export, with the viral matrix protein 1 enhancing export efficiency. NEP forms a four-helix bundle that binds at the interface of the PA C-terminal domain and PB1 N terminus of the polymerase. The NEP binding site at this interface overlaps with those for the host ANP32 and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, indicating that it functions as a regulatory hotspot coordinating transitions of the viral polymerase between RNA synthesis and nuclear export, revealing a critical layer of control in the IAV replication cycle.",

Two-dimensional (2D) material-based membrane technology provides an energy-efficient approach; however, the existing 2D lamellar membranes and nanoporous membranes struggle with low permeability and complex preparation procedures. Here, we constructed 2D lamellar nanosheet membranes with intrinsic size-sieving nanopores by assembling nanoporous polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) nanosheets into a lamellar membrane. These membranes exhibit high selectivity and permeance and ease of preparation. By applying MXene as the strong interaction patch for covering and repairing defects on PCN nanosheets, the resultant membranes demonstrated an ultrahigh H 2 permeance of 870 to 8046 GPU, considerable selectivity, and superior long-term stability, outperforming most current state-of-the-art membranes. Economic analysis revealed that MXene/PCN membranes achieved ultralow energy consumption and minimal membrane area demands for practical applications. This study inspires the construction of 2D lamellar membranes with intrinsic nanopores and provides a simple and scalable approach to preparing high-performance 2D nanosheet membranes for hydrogen separation.",

          "abstract": "Mathematical modeling is key to understanding cellular metabolism. Two common approaches are kinetic modeling and constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA). COBRA models analyze steady-state fluxes using linear constraints but lack kinetic detail. Kinetic models offer mechanistic descriptions via differential equations but require (often unknown) kinetic parameters and enzyme concentrations. To bridge this gap, we introduce COBRA-k, a framework integrating nonlinear kinetic rate laws into COBRA models to consistently constrain metabolic fluxes, enzyme abundances, and metabolite concentrations. COBRA-k enables flexible exploration of metabolic steady states with optimization techniques, even with incomplete parametrization. COBRA-k models require solving computationally demanding mixed-integer nonlinear programs. We therefore developed a dedicated iterative algorithm, implemented in an open-source Python package. We applied COBRA-k to a large-scale Escherichia coli model, demonstrating its effectiveness and revealing holistic metabolic insights. For example, it accurately predicts and explains the phenomenon of high intracellular glutamate concentration. COBRA-k combines the flexibility of COBRA with kinetic precision, offering a powerful tool for predictive metabolic modeling and engineering.",

Traditionally, these protocols have been implemented and validated with a single entanglement source, as in the paradigmatic Bell scenario. However, advancing these protocols to support more complex configurations involving multiple entanglement sources is key to building robust architectures and realizing large-scale quantum networks. Here, we show how to certify randomness in an entanglement-teleportation experiment, the building block of a quantum repeater displaying two independent sources of entanglement. Using the scalar extension method, we address the challenge posed by the nonconvexity of the correlation set, providing effective bounds on an eavesdropper’s knowledge of the shared secret bits. Our theoretical model characterizes the certifiable randomness within the network and is validated through the analysis of experimental data from a photonic quantum network.",

Here, a metabolomic screen in naïve glioblastoma cells treated with dexamethasone revealed the accumulation of N 1 -methylnicotinamide, a nicotinamide N -methyltransferase (NNMT) product, through glucocorticoid receptor activation. Using stable isotope-assisted metabolomics in patients with glioblastoma, we showed that nicotinamide conversion into N 1 -methylnicotinamide exceeds that into NAD + , leading to a ~7-fold accumulation of N 1 -methylnicotinamide in tumor compared to surrounding brain tissue. In orthotopic models, NNMT activity was enhanced by dexamethasone selectively in glioblastoma tumors but not in contralateral brain. Leveraging the tumor-specific activity of NNMT, we developed a novel 11 C-nicotinamide–based positron emission tomography (PET) approach to visualizing glioblastoma tumors. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the dexamethasone-induced methionine-dependent nicotinamide methylation becomes detrimental for glioblastoma when combined with a methionine-restricted diet. These results show that steroids rewire methionine and nicotinamide metabolism, enabling the development of innovative PET imaging and metabolic therapies for glioblastoma.",

          "abstract": "Residential wood combustion (RWC) is a primary heating fuel in just 2% of US homes. However, the 2023 release of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emissions Inventory (NEI) found that RWC contributes ~28% of total wintertime fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) emissions, suggesting that ambient PM 2.5 concentrations could be substantially reduced if RWC were curtailed. Despite its contribution to PM 2.5 emissions, an assessment of the air quality, health, and distributional impacts of RWC using the updated NEI has not been performed. Here, we use a high-resolution (4 kilometers) air quality model and the updated NEI to evaluate wintertime RWC impacts over the contiguous United States. We find that RWC contributes 2.43 micrograms per cubic meter (21.9%) of winter population-weighted mean PM 2.5 concentrations, leading to ~8600 (confidence interval: 6500 to 9600) premature deaths annually. Moreover, nonwhite communities are disproportionately affected by RWC-related PM 2.5 and associated mortality, especially in urban areas. We suggest that policies targeting RWC could substantially reduce air pollution, improve health, and address distributional disparities.",

Here, a capacitively coupled electrode with an adaptable coupling layer is developed for noninvasive, month-long electrophysiological monitoring on diverse plants. The adaptable coupling layer is formed by in situ sol-gel transition, followed by dehydration of thermoresponsive hydrogel on plants, achieving high conformability to complex surfaces and stable electrical coupling. For 1 month on trichome-covered plant surfaces, the electrode maintains a high signal-to-noise ratio comparable to a gold-standard noninvasive electrode, which typically lasts a few hours. Long-term monitoring reveals drought-specific signal features that correlate with plant water status. Physiological investigations indicate an essential role of calcium and reactive oxygen species, highlighting the potential of our electrode in generating biological insights and inspiring plant sensing innovations.",

To overcome this limitation, we propose a piezoelectric surface acoustic wave (SAW) memristor that integrates an Ag/SiO 2 /Au memristor with an acoustoelectric phase shifter. Operating at shorter wavelengths than EM waves, it offers a compact footprint and encodes tunable neural network parameters via nonvolatile programmability and the acoustoelectric effect. A proof-of-concept SAW memristor neural network was experimentally demonstrated on a vector classification task, achieving 91.7% accuracy on par with software while reducing footprint by 10 5 times versus EM systems and energy consumption by 37 times versus digital systems.

          "abstract": "Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene drive non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Oncogenic EGFR mutants are ligand-independent and more stable, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that EGFR mutants selectively leverage cellular stabilizers to evade degradation. Genome-wide RNA interference screens identified genes (encoding for stabilizers) responsible for mutant EGFR stability, with P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2) emerging as a bona fide stabilizer. Mechanistically, high extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels transactivate EGFR mutants via P2Y2 activation, previously shown to signal through Src kinase–dependent EGFR phosphorylation. Our study reveals that ATP-driven P2Y2 activation stabilizes EGFR mutants by forming a P2Y2-integrin β1-EGFR complex enriched in endosomes. Targeting this axis destabilizes EGFR mutants and offers a strategy against drug resistance. Elevated P2Y2 and integrin β1 expression in patients with NSCLC implies clinical relevance. Our results provide previously unidentified insight that EGFR mutants enhance extracellular ATP levels to activate P2Y2-integrin for enhanced stability of EGFR mutants to drive the oncogenic program.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation accompanied by oncogene hypertranscription, leading to transcription stress, a key source of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that jeopardize genomic stability. Despite its importance, the landscape and consequences of transcription stress remain underexplored. Here, we used maps of DSBs identified through sBLISS (in-suspension break labeling in situ and sequencing) with transcription stress markers to delineate the transcription stress landscape in cancer. We found that transcription stress sites are shaped by the superenhancer regulatory landscape. Notably, γH2AX is enriched at transcription stress sites; however, not all DSB-enriched genes show similar γH2AX marking. Instead, genes with DSBs tied to transcription stress are distinctly marked. Genes with high DSBs marked by γH2AX exhibited substantially higher DSB turnover and repair than those with low γH2AX, and are associated with vulnerability to mutagenesis. These findings underscore superenhancer activity as a determinant of the transcription stress landscape in cancer, posing a threat to the genomic stability of oncogenes.",

This evidence is limited to indirect inferences based on shared cultural traits, “art” styles, and symbolic items, while lithic raw material movements are mostly local and regional, with few cases exceeding 300 kilometers. We provide geochemical evidence for the largest confirmed distance between the source and discard location of a knapped lithic object in Palaeolithic Europe. Solutrean artifacts discarded at Peña Capón, Central Iberia, were sourced in Southwest France, 600 to 700 kilometers away. This demonstrates social networks of unprecedented geographic scale maintained during ∼1400 years during the Last Glacial Maximum. It also suggests that stone tools were exchanged as symbolic items to solidify social contacts and sustain far-reaching networks as risk-buffering mechanisms among widely dispersed hunter-gatherers.",

Here, selective expression of CD318 on a subset of activated human CD8 + T cells, but not CD4 + T cells, is shown, defining suppressor function of this cell population. CD318 + CD8 T cells exhibited reduced PD-1 and KLRG-1 expression, diminished interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor–α production, and potent suppression of autologous CD4 and CD8 T cell activation in vitro. Notably, CD8 T cells from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) showed reduced CD318 induction compared with controls.

The ubiquitous trans-translation system and several alternative rescue factors rescue the stalled ribosomes caused by truncated mRNAs lacking the stop codons. On the other hand, protein release factor homolog (PrfH) is the only known factor to rescue the stalled ribosome damaged by ribotoxins. Here, we show that a subfamily of PrfH, exemplified by PrfH from Capnocytophaga gingivalis ( Cg PrfH), rescues both types of stalled ribosomes. Biochemical assays demonstrate that Cg PrfH hydrolyzes the peptides attached to P-site transfer RNAs when in complex with both the damaged and intact ribosomes. Cryo-EM structures revealed that Cg PrfH uses distinct regions to recognize two stalled ribosomes to orient the GGQ motif for peptide hydrolysis. Thus, using a combination of bioinformatic, biochemical, and structural characterization, we have uncovered a family of ribosome rescue factors that have dual activities to resolve two distinct stalled protein translation events in bacteria.",

Using paleographically constrained global mantle convection models, we reproduce the present-day location of the Hawaiian hot spot and the associated spatiotemporal geochemical evolution. The composition of the plume conduit shows conventional concentric zoning prior to the Hawaiian-Emperor Bend and gradually evolves to a north-south bilateral zoning pattern afterward, corresponding to the subparallel Loa-Kea trends. Further analysis suggests that the plume originates from ridges of large low-velocity province (LLVP) induced by the push of slabs. Upwelling at the intersections of ridges is more energetic than at the middle of the ridge, causing bottom-up splitting of plume conduit in the lower mantle that propagates upward, forming bilateral zoning and eventually two independent plumes. This process suggests that bilateral zoning is transient and more common in the Pacific than Africa due to the circum-Pacific subduction.",

These immune systems are easily gained and lost, allowing adaptation to threats. However, the mechanism of mobilization of chromosomally encoded defense genes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that phage- and phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI)–mediated lateral transduction (LT), a highly efficient horizontal gene transfer mechanism, facilitates the transfer of these defense genes between bacteria. Using several bacterial models, we demonstrate that defense systems are often positioned near phage or PICI attachment sites, allowing them to exploit LT for their mobility. In addition, LT diversifies defense genes carried by prophages and PICIs, driving immune system evolution and turnover. These processes provide phage resistance to new bacterial hosts and profoundly affect population genomics. Our findings reveal LT as a crucial mechanism shaping bacterial evolution and influencing the trajectory of pathogenic clones in nature.",

Although TCR-T cells were more sensitive at detecting low-density pHLA, TCR-T cells exerted only transient in vivo antitumor efficacy followed by tumor relapse due to deficient TCR-T cell proliferation and persistence that was associated with a more differentiated and dysfunctional phenotype.

Insufficient TCR-T cell durability was overcome by coengaging 41BB or IL-2 signaling pathways, thereby enhancing tumor control in vivo.

To dissect its tissue-specific functions, we generated a humanized floxed Gpr75 mouse model with conditional deletions in the brain and adipose tissue. Mice with brain-specific Gpr75 deletion using Nestin-Cre were resistant to diet-induced obesity, primarily through suppressed food intake and modest increases in energy expenditure. In contrast, adipocyte-specific deletion of Gpr75 had minimal effects on systemic metabolism but modestly enhanced mitochondrial oxygen consumption in brown adipose tissue under cold exposure. Gpr75 expression was up-regulated in key brain regions and down-regulated in white adipose tissue under high-fat diet conditions, supporting a predominant central role in metabolic adaptation. Histological and transcriptomic analyses further revealed depot-specific effects on adipocyte morphology and hepatic lipid accumulation in global knockouts. These findings position GPR75 as a critical regulator of central energy balance and provide a mechanistic framework for developing brain-targeted therapies against obesity.",

However, the increasing severity of fungicide resistance necessitates urgent clarification of its evolutionary mechanisms to optimize disease management and delay resistance development. The DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs)–mediated base editing in oomycetes confirmed that the PsCytb S33L mutation is sufficient to confer ametoctradin resistance in Phytophthora sojae . We clarified that low-resistant and medium-resistant mutants serve as transitional populations during the resistance evolution process, with high-resistant mutants eventually becoming the dominant population. We revealed the dynamic changes in mitochondrial heterogeneity under fungicide selection, proving that the gradual increase of mutated mitochondria drives resistance evolution. There is a trade-off between ametoctradin resistance and fitness. While the PsCytb S33L mutation confers this resistance, it impairs mitochondrial function and thereby reduces fitness. Up-regulation of TFAM1 , however, can partially offset this fitness cost. Resistance evolution in plant pathogens involves not only standing variation but also de novo mutations, providing unique insights into the “chicken-and-egg” dilemma.",

An additional challenge of real-world vision is that it is dynamic, causing the appearance of objects (e.g., their size and orientation) to change as we move. Notably, however, these changes are predictable from the three-dimensional structure of the surrounding scene. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, we find that the visual cortex dynamically updates object representations using this predictive contextual information. First, visual cortical representations of objects were enhanced when they rotated congruently (versus incongruently) with the surrounding scene. Second, the inferred orientation of the object could be decoded from visual cortex activity even when the object was fully occluded. These findings indicate that predictive processes in the visual cortex follow the geometric structure of the environment, providing a mechanism to support object perception in dynamic natural vision.",

Here, we studied primary patient tumors and cell line models to identify molecular drivers of this hybrid state. Our data reveal that hybrid EwS cells are induced and maintained by a transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling positive feedback loop. Hybrid cells derepress TGFBR2 and up-regulate expression and secretion of TGFβ2 to sustain pathway activation and ECM deposition. Although TGFβ ligands can potently induce growth arrest in cells of epithelial origin, we show that TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 promote cell invasion of EwS cells without affecting proliferation.

However, the impact of disrupting antiferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments.

Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4 and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or T reg cells specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting T reg cell immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses.

Using an ex vivo human tonsillar tissue model, we profile NK cell responses to early HIV infection and uncover distinct subsets with specialized functions. We identify a previously uncharacterized memory-like NK population (CD16 +/− CD69 + CD49a + CD103 + NKG2C + ) associated with reduced viral burden and enriched in cytotoxic mediators (GNLY, PRF1, and GZMB), apoptotic ligands (FASLG and TRAIL), cytokine receptors (IL2RA, IL2RB, IL2RG, IL12RB2, and IL18R1) and trafficking molecules (CCL3–5, CCR7, and SELL). Although functionally capable of clearing HIV-infected CD4 + T cells in a tissue-mimetic environment, they show impaired cytotoxicity and transcriptional signs of exhaustion after infection. Conversely, HIV drives the reprogramming of immature CD16 − CD69 + NK cells toward a more cytotoxic and migratory effector phenotype. These findings reveal dynamic NK cell adaptations in lymphoid tissue during early HIV infection and highlight tissue-resident NK cells as promising targets for immunotherapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "Previous evidence suggests that higher prepubertal adiposity protects against breast cancer risk. Whether this protection extends into early adulthood remains uncertain. We conducted genome-wide association studies on body mass index (BMI) in nulliparous women from menarche to &lt;40 years across five cohorts, with additional analyses in three subintervals of this life stage. Results were meta-analyzed, and two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization was applied within a lifecourse framework to assess the effect of BMI on breast cancer risk. Between menarche and &lt;40 years, we observed heterogeneity in genetic effects. Genome-wide correlations further suggest that BMI during this early adult period may be partly influenced by distinct genetic factors compared with adiposity at other life stages. Higher genetically proxied BMI between menarche and 40 years reduced breast cancer risk. This protective effect attenuated after adjusting for prepubertal adiposity. These findings refine our understanding of adiposity’s role in breast cancer and highlight earlier life stages as critical windows for risk modulation.",

Furthermore, symmetries of particle physics are naturally reflected in holonomies, making them ideally suited for quantum simulation of quantum chromodynamics and grand unified theories. Yet, practically designing quantum holonomies with the required properties and scale is challenging. Here, we construct a new class of holonomies by increasing the particle number. We show that multiparticle holonomies can even exist in systems devoid of any single-particle holonomies. We present a comprehensive framework for multiparticle quantum holonomies and experimentally realize various two-particle holonomies in integrated photonics.

We use ocean redox, iron isotope (δ 56 Fe), and phosphorus phase partitioning records from shelf and deep-ocean settings to evaluate the drivers behind this major reshaping of the pelagic marine ecosystem. A marked decrease in mesopelagic graptolites coincided with a stepwise negative δ 56 Fe shift on the shelf, driven by partial seawater Fe drawdown resulting from episodic intensification of mid-depth euxinia. Subsequently, a positive δ 56 Fe shift in both deep-ocean and shelf sediments reflects extensive seawater Fe removal during the development of more widespread euxinia. This led to enhanced sedimentary phosphorus recycling from sediments, which ultimately fueled the radiation of epipelagic graptolites. Thus, wide-scale changes in Fe cycling, linking the global oceanic redox state to phosphorus cycling, were ultimately responsible for the initial demise and subsequent radiation of select graptolite species.",

Here, we investigate the affinity of Prototaxites by contrasting its organization and molecular composition with that of Fungi. We report that fossils of Prototaxites taiti from the 407-million-year-old Rhynie chert were chemically distinct from contemporaneous Fungi and structurally distinct from all known Fungi.

The granuloma’s necrotic core, where bacteria reside extracellularly in humans, is difficult to assess in many experimentally tractable models. Here, using necrotic mycobacterial granulomas in adult zebrafish, we develop dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) across different host genotypes to identify the transcriptional alterations that enable bacteria to survive within this key microenvironment. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we find that neutrophils within mature, necrotic granulomas promote bacterial growth, in part through up-regulation of the bacterial devR regulon. We identify conserved suites of bacterial transcriptional programs induced only in the context of this unique necrotic extracellular niche, including bacterial modules related to K + transport and rpf genes. Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains across diverse lineages and human populations suggests that granuloma-specific transcriptional modules are targets for bacterial genetic adaptation in the context of human infection.",

By optimizing nanowire morphology and nanocrystal interdigitation, the platform achieves high charge injection densities (tens of microcoulombs per square centimeter) at low NIR intensities (&lt;1 milliwatt per square millimeter). The nanoassembly was subretinally placed in an ex vivo blind rat retina, where it elicited repeatable and robust responses in retinal ganglion cells under NIR pulses.

          "abstract": "Marine habitability for complex life on Earth and Earth-like planets requires bioavailable nutrients and dissolved oxygen. The cycling of nutrients and oxygen is controlled by physical ocean circulation. However, our understanding of how circulation has varied through time and space is incomplete for Earth and unconstrained for Earth-like exoplanets. Earth’s rotation has slowed over time, affecting ocean circulation by modifying the Coriolis effect. We use a three-dimensional Earth system model to explore how slowing planetary rotation influences ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. We show that slower rotation enhances wind-driven upwelling and global circulation. Nutrient recycling is consequently more efficient, increasing photosynthetic productivity. Additionally, enhanced ocean oxygenation improves habitability for aerobic life under a well-oxygenated atmosphere. However, under a poorly oxygenated atmosphere, slowing rotation increases oxygen fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere. Therefore, Earth’s rotational history may have been a long-term background control on surface oxygenation and the evolution of animals.",

We show that deep-projecting retinal ganglion cells serve as the first synaptic relay to the brain, requiring Lrrn2 and Lrrn3a for precise axonal targeting within the optic tectum. Using a new reporter line, we achieved high-resolution mapping of this previously undercharacterized vertebrate visual circuit. Genetic disruption of Lrrn CAMs leads to disorganization of the circuit and impairments in brightness and contrast sensitivity, resulting in deficits in visually guided behavior. Additionally, ultrastructural circuit reconstruction and functional imaging analysis identified both its synaptic partners and revealed its critical role in luminance processing. These studies define a core visual processing pathway and establish Lrrn CAMs as essential molecular drivers of its assembly.",

Expanding the alphabet beyond the canonical base pairs can therefore be the key to push the technology to the next level. Here, we describe examples of DNA nanostructures built from an “anthropogenic evolvable genetic information system (AEGIS).” Because AEGIS uses the same backbone as DNA, the existing rules for designing DNA nanostructures can be readily applied to AEGIS nanostructures, which also show greater stability, both thermal and enzymatic, greater control over autonomous assembly, and good phase separation. AEGIS can have as many as 12 different units and six different pairs with Watson-Crick-Franklin geometry. Thus, if further developed, then these nanostructures may represent a previously unexplored frontier in DNA nanoscience and nanotechnology, expanding the space of “soft” biomaterial design.",

          "abstract": "Virus-induced inflammation and programmed cell death (PCD) are critical antiviral defenses, prompting viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to develop PCD regulation mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that RSV orchestrates the temporal and sequential regulation of distinct PCD pathways in human macrophages to optimize replication and dissemination. During early stages of infection, RSV activates the PI3K-Akt pathway to induce cFLIP expression, effectively suppressing TNF-driven extrinsic apoptosis. Simultaneously, viral degradation of ZDHHC9 prevents GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis downstream of NLRP3 activation, thereby sustaining an intracellular environment permissive to viral propagation. In contrast, following the completion of replication, RSV subverts caspase-1 signaling to trigger the intrinsic apoptotic cascade via the Casp-1–BID–APAF1–Casp-9 axis, and subsequently promotes GSDME-mediated secondary pyroptosis. This late-stage PCD reprogramming enables synchronized release of virions and pro-inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating pulmonary pathology. These findings delineate a temporally resolved strategy by which RSV balances early immune evasion with subsequent viral dissemination and immunopathology, and identify discrete stage-specific molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in RSV-induced lung disease.",

Regulatory T cells (T regs ) are pivotal for establishing and maintaining immune tolerance. In this study, we demonstrate that mice with T reg -specific deletion of Tdrd3 exhibit severely impaired iT reg , but not thymic T reg , differentiation. Moreover, iT regs , but not thymic T regs , derived from these mice fail to suppress colitis in adoptive transfer models, indicating compromised inhibitory capacity. Aged Tdrd3 -deficient mice also show spontaneous autoinflammation. Mechanistically, TDRD3 is recruited by the transcription factor FOXO1, presumably in a methylation-dependent manner, to activate Klf2 expression, which is essential for T reg differentiation. Notably, the enforced expression of Klf2 in Tdrd3 -deficient CD4 + T cells rescue both iT reg development and suppressive function. Collectively, our findings identify TDRD3 as a central transcriptional regulator of iT reg differentiation and immune homeostasis, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target for modulating immune tolerance.",
