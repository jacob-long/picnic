          "title": "Integrated lithium niobate photonics for sub-ångström snapshot spectroscopy",
          "authors": "Zhiyang Yao, Shuyang Liu, Yingce Wang, Xiaoyun Yuan, Lu Fang",
          "abstract": "Spectroscopy is a pivotal tool for determining the physical structures and chemical compositions of materials and environments, and it is commonly used across diverse scientific fields1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Conventionally, spectroscopic techniques rely on narrow slits or gratings, which impose a trade-off between spectral resolution and optical transmittance17,18,19,20,21,22, thus precluding measurements with simultaneous high sensitivity and high efficiency. Here we introduce RAFAEL, a sub-ångström ultra-high-transmittance snapshot spectroscopic technique, which targets this trade-off with integrated and reconfigurable photonics based on lithium niobate. Its design comprises bulk lithium niobate as an interference mask with a pixel-wise electrically tunable spectral response and delivers picometre-scale modulation with a high optical transmittance. Our approach achieves 88-Hz snapshot spectroscopy with a spectral resolution of approximately 0.5 Å at 400–1,000 nm (R = 12,000), spatial resolution of 2,048 × 2,048 and 73.2% total optical transmittance. Compared with state-of-the-art spectroscopic imagers23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34, RAFAEL offers double the total transmittance and a nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in spectral resolving power, as verified by extensive experiments. In particular, RAFAEL captured sub-ångström spectra, including all atomic absorption peaks, of up to 5,600 stars in a single snapshot, indicating ×100–10,000 improvement in observational efficiency compared with world-class astronomical spectrometers17,18,19,20,21. This high-performing yet easily integrated snapshot spectroscopic method could drive advances in fields ranging from material science to astrophysics.",

          "abstract": "Compartmentalization of eukaryotic genome into euchromatin and heterochromatin is of critical biological significance1,2,3. Previous studies have suggested a self-templating pathway involving the reading and writing of histone H3 lysine 9 methylation by SUV39H as the core mechanism for heterochromatin reassembly during cell division1,3. In fission yeast, the mammalian SUV39H homologue Clr4 forms a complex containing ubiquitin ligase Cul4, which catalyses H3K14 mono-ubiquitination (H3K14ub) to promote heterochromatin formation. However, whether heterochromatin reassembly in dividing mammalian cells involves a similar pathway is unknown. Here we identified G2E3 as an H3K14ub-specific, pericentromeric heterochromatin-localized E3 ligase. G2E3-catalysed H3K14ub potentiates histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) by SUV39H and is specifically required for SUV39H compartmentalization and H3K9me3 in pericentromeric heterochromatin. Mechanistically, we found that G2E3 is highly expressed in G2/M phase and associates with mitotic chromosomes in an RNA-dependent manner to catalyse H3K14ub, which is essential for the subsequent sequential recruitment of SUV39H and HP1. The SUV39H chromodomain is a reader of dual H3K9me3 and H3K14ub modifications and SUV39H associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin primarily through its H3K14ub-binding activity. Notably, loss of G2E3 severely impairs pericentromeric heterochromatin organization and results in the aberrant accumulation of SUV39H and H3K9me3 in numerous euchromatin regions and widespread transcriptional repression. Thus, our findings revealed the H3K14ub-dependent SUV39H compartmentalization as a unified mechanism of pericentromeric heterochromatin formation, which is essential for proper euchromatin compartmentalization and transcriptional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale metagenomic and data-mining efforts have revealed an expansive diversity of bacteriophages (phages) within the human gut 1–3 . However, functional understanding of phage–host interactions within this complex environment is limited, largely due to a lack of cultured isolates available for experimental validation. Here we characterize 134 inducible prophages originating from 252 human gut bacterial isolates using 10 different induction conditions to expand the experimentally validated temperate phage–host pairs originating from the human gut. Importantly, only 18% of computationally predicted prophages could be induced in pure cultures. Moreover, we construct a 78-member synthetic microbiome that, when co-cultured in the presence of human colonic cells (Caco2), led to the induction of 35% phage species. Using cultured isolates, we demonstrate that human host-associated cellular products may act as induction agents, providing a possible link between gastrointestinal cell lysis and temperate phage populations 4,5 . We provide key insights into prophage diversity and genetics, including a genetic pathway for domestication, finding that polylysogeny was common and resulted in coordinated prophage induction, and that differential induction can be influenced by divergent prophage integration sites. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of culture-based techniques, alongside experimental validation, genomics and computational prediction, to understand the biology and function of temperate phages in the human gut microbiome. These culture-based approaches will enable applications across synthetic biology, biotechnology and microbiome fields.",

          "abstract": "Tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have emerged as a promising non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to lead-based devices1-3, with certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of inverted architectures now exceeding 16%4-8. Despite an ideal bandgap supporting a theoretical PCE over 33%, TPSCs still lag in performance and stability, partly due to suboptimal hole transport layers and poor buried interface that hinder hole extraction. Here, we report (E)-(2-(4',5'-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-[2,2'-bithiophen]-5-yl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid at the buried interface, using a molecular film to optimize hole transport layers in inverted TPSCs. This molecular film forms a homogeneous interfacial layer with well-matched energy level alignment, significantly enhancing hole extraction. Moreover, this approach creates a superwetting underlayer that guides the growth of uniform, high-quality Sn-based perovskite films with reduced defect density and minimized non-radiative recombination losses. The resulting inverted small-area TPSCs demonstrate a record PCE of 17.89% (certified 17.71% under reverse scanning mode). Furthermore, the encapsulated device maintains over 95% of the initial PCE after 1344 h of ambient shelf storage and over 94% after 1550 h of continuous operation under 1-sun illumination. Notably, we achieve a record PCE of 14.40% for 1 cm2 TPSCs, highlighting the scalability of our strategy.",

          "abstract": "Predicting complex disease risks on the basis of individual genomic profiles is an advancing field in human genetics1,2. However, most genetic studies have focused on populations of European ancestry, creating a global imbalance in precision medicine and underscoring the need for genomic research in non-European groups3,4. The Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative recruited more than half a million Taiwanese residents, providing a large dataset of genetic profiles and electronic medical record data for people with Han Chinese ancestry. Using extensive phenotypic data, we conducted comprehensive genomic analyses across the medical phenome with individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations. These analyses identified population-specific genetic risk variants and new findings for various complex traits. We developed polygenic risk scores, demonstrating strong predictive performance for conditions such as cardiometabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers and infectious diseases. We observed consistent findings in an independent dataset, Taiwan Biobank, and among people of East Asian ancestry in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Project. The identified genetic risks accounted for up to 10.3% of the overall health variation in the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative cohort. Our approach of characterizing the phenome-wide genomic landscape, developing population-specific risk-prediction models, assessing their performance and identifying the genetic effect on health serves as a model for similar studies in other diverse study populations.",

          "abstract": "Amines are among the most common functional groups in bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals,1-3 yet they are almost universally treated as synthetic endpoints.4 Here we report a strategy that repositions native primary, secondary, and tertiary amines as handles for cross-coupling. The platform relies on in situ activation via borane coordination and exploits a copper catalytic redox system that generates amine-ligated boryl radicals, which undergo β-scission across the C(sp³)–N bond to release alkyl radicals. These intermediates engage in copper-catalyzed cross-couplings with a broad array of C-, N-, O-, and S-based nucleophiles. The method tolerates diverse amine classes, enables modular functionalization, and supports late-stage editing of complex drug scaffolds. In addition, amides can be incorporated into the manifold via reductive funneling. This work establishes a general approach to deaminative C–N bond functionalization and introduces a distinct approach for making and modifying druglike molecules.",

Despite major advances5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19, no species has yet been characterized with a truly comprehensive atlas of genetic variation. Here we present an extensive genomic and phenotypic resource for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on near telomere-to-telomere assemblies of 1,086 natural isolates. Leveraging these high-contiguity assemblies, we generated a highly complete species-wide structural variant atlas, gene-based pangenome and graph pangenome. By incorporating the full spectrum of genetic variation captured across the species, we conducted genome-wide association studies across 8,391 molecular and organismal traits19,20,21,22. The inclusion of structural variants and small insertion–deletion mutations improved heritability estimates by an average of 14.3% compared with analyses based only on single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Structural variants were more frequently associated with traits and exhibited greater pleiotropy than other variant types. Notably, the genetic architecture of molecular and organismal traits differed markedly. Together, this work provides a unique dataset that illuminates how diverse forms of genetic variation shape phenotypic diversity and lays the groundwork for integrative, genome-scale studies in other eukaryotic systems.",

Although a lot of quantum algorithms 2–4 have been developed for simulating quantum dynamics, a general-purpose method for simulating low-temperature quantum phenomena remains unknown. In classical settings, the analogous task of sampling from thermal distributions has been largely addressed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods 5,6 . Here we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for thermal simulation that—akin to MCMC methods—exhibits detailed balance, respects locality and serves as a toy model for thermalization in open quantum systems. The enduring impact of MCMC methods suggests that our new construction may play an equally important part in quantum computing and applications in the physical sciences and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail 1 . However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water 2,3 , in which the structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered 4,5 . The structural change is expected to affect the conductivity of water and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes 6–9 . Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy (SDM) 10 to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding several nanometres, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches large, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000, whereas the conductivity peaks at several S m −1 , close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores.",

          "abstract": "Tropical forests act as important global carbon sinks1, and Earth System Models predict increasing near-term carbon sink capacity for these forests, with elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration thought to stimulate tree growth2,3. However, current forest inventory data analyses suggest that the carbon sink capacity of intact tropical forests may be in decline, portending a possible future switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources3,4,5,6,7. Here we use long-term forest inventory data (1971–2019) from Australian moist tropical forests and a causal inference framework8,9,10 to assess the carbon balance of woody aboveground standing biomass over time, the demographic processes accounting for it, and its climatic drivers, including cyclones. We find that a transition from sink (0.62 ± 0.04 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 1971–2000) to source (−0.93 ± 0.11 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 2010–2019) has occurred for the aboveground woody biomass of these forests, with sink capacity declining at a rate of 0.041 ± 0.032 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. The transition was driven by increasingly extreme temperature and other climate anomalies, which have increased tree mortality and associated biomass losses4, with no evidence of the carbon fertilization (stimulation) of woody tree growth. Forest dynamics underlying carbon sink capacity were also punctuated by cyclones, with impacts of a similar magnitude to long-term climate-induced changes. Our findings suggest the potential for a similar response to climate change by woody aboveground biomass in moist tropical forests globally, which could culminate in a long-term switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources.",

The mechanism for stabilizing memories of survival-critical experiences, which are often emotionally salient and repeated, remains unclear 4 . Here we identify an astrocytic ensemble that is transcriptionally primed by emotional experience and functionally triggered by repeated experience to stabilize labile memory. Using a novel brain-wide Fos tagging and imaging method, we found that astrocytic Fos ensembles were preferentially recruited in regions with neuronal engrams 5 and were more widespread during fear recall than during conditioning. We established the induction mechanism of the astrocytic ensemble, which involves two steps: (1) an initial fear experience that induces day-long, slow astrocytic state changes with noradrenaline receptor upregulation; and (2) enhanced noradrenaline responses during recall, a repeated experience, enabling astrocytes to integrate coincident signals from local engrams and long-range noradrenergic projections, which induce secondary astrocytic state changes, including the upregulation of Fos and the neuromodulatory molecule IGFBP2. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the astrocytic ensemble signalling modulate engrams, and memory stability and precision. The astrocytic ensemble thus acts as a multiday trace in a subset of astrocytes after experience-dependent neural activity, which are eligible to capture future repeated experiences for stabilizing memories.",

          "abstract": "All mammalian organs depend on resident macrophage populations to coordinate repair and facilitate tissue-specific functions 1–3 . Functionally distinct macrophage populations reside in discrete tissue niches and are replenished through a combination of local proliferation and monocyte recruitment 4,5 . Declines in macrophage abundance and function have been linked to age-associated pathologies, including atherosclerosis, cancer and neurodegeneration 6–8 . However, the mechanisms that coordinate macrophage organization and replenishment within ageing tissues remain largely unclear. Here we show that capillary-associated macrophages (CAMs) are selectively lost over time, contributing to impaired vascular repair and reduced tissue perfusion in older mice. To investigate resident macrophage behaviour in vivo, we used intravital two-photon microscopy in live mice to non-invasively image the skin capillary plexus, a spatially well-defined vascular niche that undergoes rarefication and functional decline with age. We find that CAMs are lost at a rate exceeding capillary loss, resulting in macrophage-deficient vascular niches in both mice and humans. CAM phagocytic activity was locally required to repair obstructed capillary blood flow, leaving macrophage-deficient niches selectively vulnerable under homeostatic and injury conditions. Our study demonstrates that homeostatic renewal of resident macrophages is less precisely regulated than previously suggested 9–11 . Specifically, neighbouring macrophages do not proliferate or reorganize to compensate for macrophage loss without injury or increased growth factors, such as colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). These limitations in macrophage renewal may represent early and targetable contributors to tissue ageing.",

Although the Carnian sedimentary rocks of South America provided much of the available evidence for understanding the early evolution of these clades, key discoveries have remained restricted to the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión6,7 and Paraná basins8 in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. Here we report a Carnian tetrapod assemblage from the previously unrecognized Northern Precordillera Basin in northwestern Argentina. Discoveries at this basin, in the Quebrada Santo Domingo site, include a nearly complete skeleton of the early sauropodomorph Huayracursor jaguensis gen. et sp. nov., and typical components of Late Carnian faunas, such as hyperodapedontine rhynchosaurs, gomphodontosuchine traversodontid cynodonts, and aetosaurs. Compared to its generally small and short-necked Carnian counterparts9,10, Huayracursor is larger and exhibits an incipient elongation of its cervical vertebrae, representing an intermediate condition for size and cervical elongation between known Carnian and Norian sauropodomorphs11. This discovery provides one of the oldest pieces of evidence of increased body mass and neck elongation in early Sauropodomorpha.",

ZBP1 is activated by Z-RNA1,7,9, and the Z-RNAs which trigger ZBP1 during HSV-1 and IAV infections were assumed to be of viral origin1. However, we show here that host cell-encoded Z-RNAs are major and sufficient ZBP1 activating ligands following infection by these two human pathogens. The majority of cellular Z-RNAs mapped to intergenic endogenous retroelements (EREs) embedded within abnormally long 3’ extensions of host cell mRNAs. These aberrant host cell transcripts arose as a consequence of Disruption of Transcription Termination (DoTT), a virus-driven phenomenon which disables Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF)-mediated 3’ processing of nascent pre-mRNAs10-15. Mutant viruses lacking ICP27 or NS1, the virus-encoded proteins responsible for inhibiting CPSF and triggering DoTT13,15, failed to induce host cell Z-RNA accrual and were attenuated in their ability to stimulate ZBP1. Ectopic expression of HSV-1 ICP27 or IAV NS1, or pharmacological blockade of CPSF activity, induced accumulation of host cell Z-RNAs and activated ZBP1. These results demonstrate that DoTT-generated cellular Z-RNAs are bona fide ZBP1 ligands, and position ZBP1-activated cell death as a host response to counter viral disruption of the cellular transcriptional machinery.",

          "abstract": "Most stony corals are obligate symbionts that are dependent on nutrients provided by the photosynthetic activity of dinoflagellates residing within specialized cells1. Disruption of this symbiotic consortium leads to coral bleaching and, ultimately, mortality2. However, a few coral species exhibit facultative symbiosis, allowing them to survive extended periods of bleaching3,4. Despite this resilience, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the genomic and cellular basis of facultative symbiosis in Oculina patagonica, a thermotolerant Mediterranean coral5,6. We sequenced and annotated a chromosome-scale genome of O. patagonica and built cell atlases for this species and two obligate symbiotic corals. Comparative genomic analysis revealed karyotypic and syntenic conservation across all scleractinians, with species-specific gene expansions primarily driven by tandem duplications. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of symbiotic and naturally aposymbiotic wild specimens identified an increase in phagocytic immune cells and a metabolic shift in gastrodermal gene expression from growth-related functions to quiescent, epithelial-like states. Cross-species comparison of host cells uncovered Oculina-specific metabolic and signalling adaptations indicative of an opportunistic, dual-feeding strategy that decouples survival from symbiotic state.",

          "abstract": "Stencilling, in which patterns are created by painting over masks, has ubiquitous applications in art, architecture and manufacturing. Modern, top-down microfabrication methods have succeeded in reducing mask sizes to under 10 nm (refs. 1,2 ), enabling ever smaller microdevices as today’s fastest computer chips. Meanwhile, bottom-up masking using chemical bonds or physical interactions has remained largely unexplored, despite its advantages of low cost, solution-processability, scalability and high compatibility with complex, curved and three-dimensional (3D) surfaces 3,4 . Here we report atomic stencilling to make patchy nanoparticles (NPs), using surface-adsorbed iodide submonolayers to create the mask and ligand-mediated grafted polymers onto unmasked regions as ‘paint’. We use this approach to synthesize more than 20 different types of NP coated with polymer patches in high yield. Polymer scaling theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that stencilling, along with the interplay of enthalpic and entropic effects of polymers, generates patchy particle morphologies not reported previously. These polymer-patched NPs self-assemble into extended crystals owing to highly uniform patches, including different non-closely packed superlattices. We propose that atomic stencilling opens new avenues in patterning NPs and other substrates at the nanometre length scale, leading to precise control of their chemistry, reactivity and interactions for a wide range of applications, such as targeted delivery, catalysis, microelectronics, integrated metamaterials and tissue engineering 5–11 .",

          "abstract": "The properties of mammalian cells depend on their location within organs. Gene expression in the liver varies between periportal and pericentral hepatocytes1,2,3, and in the intestine from crypts to villus tips4,5. A key element of tissue spatial organization is probably metabolic, but direct assessments of spatial metabolism remain limited. Here we map spatial metabolic gradients in the mouse liver and intestine. We develop an integrated experimental–computational workflow using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), isotope tracing and deep-learning artificial intelligence. Most measured metabolites (>90%) showed significant spatial concentration gradients in the liver lobules and intestinal villi. In the liver, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle metabolites and their isotope labelling from both glutamine and lactate localized periportally. Energy-stress metabolites, including adenosine monophosphate (AMP), also localized periportally, consistent with a high periportal energy demand. In the intestine, the TCA intermediates malate (tip) and citrate (crypt) showed opposite spatial patterns, aligning with higher glutamine catabolism in tips and lactate oxidation in crypts based on isotope tracing. Finally, we mapped the fate of the obesogenic dietary sugar fructose. In the intestine, oral fructose was catabolized faster in the villus bottom than in the tips. In the liver, fructose-derived carbon accumulated pericentrally as fructose-1-phosphate and triggered pericentral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion. Thus, we both provide foundational knowledge regarding intestine and liver metabolic organization and identify fructose-induced focal derangements in liver metabolism.",

Of note, four-membered saturated cyclic molecules such as azetidines, thietanes and cyclobutanes have garnered increasing attention in medicinal chemistry3-7. These molecules often possess physicochemical properties relevant to drug discovery: potency, stability, metabolic stability and target specificity3. The replacement of oxygen atoms in readily available oxetanes would offer a direct route to a variety of these cyclic pharmacophores, yet such atom swapping has been rarely reported for non-aromatic molecules. Here we report a general photocatalytic strategy that selectively substitutes the oxygen atom of an oxetane with a nitrogen-, sulfur- or carbon-based moiety, transforming it into a diverse range of saturated cyclic building blocks in a single operation. This atom swapping method exhibits high functional group compatibility and is applicable to late-stage functionalization, substantially simplifying the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and complex drug analogues that would otherwise require multi-step routes. Mechanistic investigations unveil insights on the origin of chemoselectivity that allows the endocyclic oxygen atom to react preferentially to generate an acyclic dihalide intermediate, which then undergoes efficient ring reconstruction in the presence of a nucleophilic species.",

EMR access is both retrospective and prospective, allowing longitudinal studies. Genetic profiling is done with population-optimized SNP arrays for those of Han Chinese ancestry that enable genome-wide association 3,4, phenome-wide association 5,6, and polygenic risk score 7,8 studies to evaluate common disease risk and pharmacogenetic response. Participants also agree to be recontacted for future research and receive personalized genetic risk profiles with health management recommendations. TPMI has established the TPMI Data Access Platform (TDAP), a central database and analysis platform that both safeguards the security of the data and facilitates academic research. As a large non-European ancestry cohort that merges genetic profiles with EMR and enables longitudinal follow-up, TPMI provides a unique resource to validate genetic risk prediction models, conduct clinical trials of risk-based health management, and inform health policies. Ultimately, the TPMI cohort will contribute to global genetic research and serve as a model for population-based precision medicine.",

Its widespread use for basic research and biotechnological applications is, however, hampered by the low efficiencies of current ncAA incorporation strategies. Here we reveal poor cellular ncAA uptake as a main obstacle to efficient genetic code expansion and overcome this bottleneck by hijacking a bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter 5 to actively import easily synthesizable isopeptide-linked tripeptides that are processed into ncAAs within the cell. Using this approach, we enable efficient encoding of a variety of previously inaccessible ncAAs, decorating proteins with bioorthogonal 6 and crosslinker 7 moieties, post-translational modifications 8,9 and functionalities for chemoenzymatic conjugation. We then devise a high-throughput directed evolution platform to engineer tailored transporter systems for the import of ncAAs that were historically refractory to efficient uptake. Customized Escherichia coli strains expressing these evolved transporters facilitate single and multi-site ncAA incorporation with wild-type efficiencies. Additionally, we adapt the tripeptide scaffolds for the co-transport of two different ncAAs, enabling their efficient dual incorporation. Collectively, our study demonstrates that engineering of uptake systems is a powerful strategy for programmable import of chemically diverse building blocks.",

          "abstract": "Quantifying physical mechanisms driving sea-level change—including global mean sea level (GMSL) and regional-to-local components (that is, sea-level budget)—is essential for reliable future projections and effective coastal management 1,2 . Although previous research has attempted to resolve China’s sea-level budget from the 1950s 3,4 , these studies capture short timescales and lack the long-term context necessary to fully assess modern sea-level rise in southeastern China 5 —one of the world’s most densely populated regions with immense socioeconomic importance 6 . Here we show that GMSL followed three distinct stages from 11,700 years before present (BP) to the modern day: (1) rapid early Holocene rise driven by the deglacial melt of land ice; (2) 4,000 years of stability from around 4200 BP to the mid-nineteenth century when regional processes dominated sea-level change; and (3) accelerating rise from the mid-nineteenth century. Our results arise from spatiotemporal hierarchical modelling of geological sea-level proxies and tide gauge data to produce site-specific sea-level budget estimates with uncertainty quantification. It is extremely likely ( P ≥ 0.95) that the GMSL rise rate since 1900 (1.51 ± 0.16 mm year −1 , 1 σ ) has exceeded any century over at least the past four millennia. Moreover, our analysis indicates that at least 94% of rapid modern urban subsidence is attributable to anthropogenic activities, with localized subsidence rates often exceeding GMSL rise. Such concurrent acceleration of global sea-level rise and rapid localized subsidence has not been observed in our Holocene geological record.",

          "authors": "Gareth Thompson",
          "abstract": "Snö: A History Sverker Sörlin Doubleday (2025)\n\nAs a child growing up in northern Sweden, environmental historian Sverker Sörlin fell in love with snow. “I see the light outside, before I even open the slatted blinds. Snow! The miracle of whiteness is shining through the slats,” he recalls in his latest book, Snö.\n\nNow, he fights for snow’s survival. And survive it must, Sörlin argues, if we’re to avoid droughts, sinking tundra fields and an overheated planet. With amazing anecdotes, emotive memories and pleas for climate action, Snö aims to galvanize readers.\n\nGlaciers are not just blocks of ice — plans to save them mustn’t overlook their hidden life\n\nA skiing trip to Norway’s Rondane Mountains marked a transcendent moment for Sörlin. After sundown, dozens of puddles started freezing over in the grass around his campsite, each making a distinct cracking sound. Sörlin felt at one with “the forces of nature, the whole solar system, at play in a condensed timescale”.\n\nSnow’s distinctive soundscapes captivate. For instance, when microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier arrived in eastern Sweden to study the CRISPR gene-editing technology for which she won the 2020 chemistry Nobel prize, she heard the snow crunching under her feet whisper “crispr, crispr”.\n\nAnd contrary to the myth, our voices are nowhere near loud enough to trigger an avalanche. With a pressure of 20 pascals, even the sound of a jet aeroplane taking off wouldn’t trigger a snowslide, and a human shriek hits just one-tenth of that. By contrast, a sonic boom creates 200 pascals, which certainly could shift some snow. Despite this evidence, Sörlin still wonders, “If I stood there on the loose snow again … would I really dare to scream?”\n\nA flurry of research\n\nSörlin celebrates people who have sought answers to snow’s scientific mysteries.\n\nIn northern Japan in the 1930s, physicist Ukichiro Nakaya undertook fieldwork in the Hokkaido Mountains, which are notorious for their immense snowstorms. In perishing conditions, Nakaya grew obsessed with explaining the variety of snow crystals. By creating individual snowflakes on rabbit hairs in a low-temperature laboratory, Nakaya could assess the impacts of temperature and humidity on the crystals’ shape. Each of these ‘letters from heaven’ held crucial data about the atmospheric conditions in which they formed.\n\nChildren make the most of a snowy day in Kabul.Credit: Wakil Kohsar/AFP/Getty\n\nOther snow-obsessed characters include Willi Dansgaard, a “brusque young physicist with wide-ranging interests and an unquenchable curiosity”, who worked, starting in the 1960s, with ice cores drilled from Greenland’s ice sheet. In the ice cores, Dansgaard’s team found snow dating back millennia, retaining what Sörlin calls “atmospheric labelling … a kind of microscopic message in a bottle”.\n\nClimate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice\n\nGreenland’s ice-core chemistry revealed sudden climate changes, tying in with Dansgaard’s interest as to why Norse communities left the island in the Middle Ages. Studies suggest that a drying climate was responsible for Norse people’s disappearance in the fifteenth century, because less grass was available for livestock in winter (B. Zhao et al. Sci. Adv. 8, eabm4346; 2022).",

It will feature presentations of the submitted papers — given either by the artificial intelligence (AI) agents themselves or by the humans who ran the experiments — and panel discussions by academics.\n\nThe conference offers “a relatively safe sandbox where we can sort of experiment with different submission processes, different kinds of review processes”, says James Zou, an AI researcher at Stanford University in California who co-organized the event.

Rather than using large language models (LLMs) or other tools designed for specific tasks, researchers are now building coordinated groups of models, known as agents, to act as “scientists working across the research endeavour”, he says.\n\nAI models are already being used to generate and review research, but most publishers and conference organizers ban machines from being listed as paper authors or speakers. “We thought we’d flip it around, where both the authors and the reviewers have to be AI,” says Zou. Although humans can offer advice and feedback, according to conference guidance, AIs should be the primary contributor, akin to the first author.\n\nThe conference draws attention to “the fact that those of us in the AI world need to do a better job at understanding what the strengths and weaknesses are of using systems in this way”, says computer scientist Margaret Mitchell, who studies AI ethics at Hugging Face in New York City. “How to evaluate AI agents at all is an open research area,” she adds. A key question is how to factor in the frequency with which the model comes up with useless ‘false positive’ discoveries — something that can temper its overall utility.\n\nAgents4Science has another benefit, says AI researcher Clémentine Fourrier, also at Hugging Face. “Hopefully a conference like this would divert some of the AI bloat to alleviate reviewer load” at other meetings, they say.\n\nAI reviewers\n\nThe conference organizers received submissions of work by more than 300 AI agents, of which 48 were accepted after being assessed by a panel of AI reviewers. The papers are mainly computational studies (rather than involving physical experiments), covering fields from psychoanalysis to mathematics, says Zou. He hopes the conference will produce data on how good AI scientists are and the types of mistake they make. Such data could be used to inform policies on the use of AI in research, says Mitchell.\n\nLeft to their own devices, AI agents are still prone to error. The papers submitted for the Agents4Science conference were required to state the interaction between the researcher and the AI agent at every step of the process. This means it will be possible to assess how the extent of human involvement affects the quality of the work, says Zou.",

          "abstract": "Creating a structured approach to her PhD helped Jasmine Hughes combat a sense of guilt.Credit: Vivian Wan/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nDuring the first year of my PhD programme in clinical neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, UK, I could not work out what I was initially feeling. There was this sense that I always needed to be ‘on’. When I was not in the laboratory or working on a project, I felt as though I should be. At each stage of my academic career, I’d always felt the need to prove myself — but this sensation was different. It was guilt. More specifically, graduate-student guilt.\n\nGraduate students can experience this feeling whenever they are not working or focusing on their studies. Personally, I often felt it when I was not actively writing my thesis or research manuscripts, reviewing articles or attending lectures related to my PhD topic. For instance, if I was attending a formal dinner at my college — one of Cambridge’s many traditions — I’d feel the need to rush home and continue working on project proposals or finalizing an ethics application, even during the weekends.\n\nAs the days went on, my creativity and passion in the lab started to fizzle out, and I felt as though I had become just another cog in the machine. At one point, I was so overwhelmed, I started to experience anxiety attacks at night.\n\nOnce graduate-student guilt started to affect my health and performance, I knew I had to change. I established a list of clear, specific, non-negotiable rules that I had to follow. I had, of course, tried to set such boundaries before, but I had viewed them as flexible guidelines that I would sometimes bend to meet deadlines or to spend more time with my lab colleagues at work events.\n\nIn no uncertain terms\n\nUnlike boundaries, non-negotiables cannot be altered and always take priority. Creating and sticking to them has reduced the sense of urgency and guilt that I felt at home. Now, instead of viewing my PhD programme as a competitive sprint, I am embracing it as a slower journey of discovery on my own terms.\n\nHere is my list of six non-negotiables:\n\nEstablish working hours with specific tasks. To ease the guilty feeling, I started considering my PhD a full-time job. In 2022, I had worked full-time as a research technician on a biomedical-engineering project at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for six months. In that role, I had an outline of tasks and goals for each day, with an extremely clear structure. So, in my PhD programme, I now create a list of lab tasks to be completed before I leave campus. This has helped me to maintain focus and be more efficient with my time. Most importantly, it helps me to avoid taking my work home.\n\nRecognize lab members as colleagues, not family. I had to make this distinction clear so that I would not feel guilty when I had to prioritize family commitments over being in the lab. This divide was evident when I had to decide between supporting my aunt, by virtually attending a preoperative clinic visit, and helping my lab mates on a day when they were doing a tricky experiment.\n\nRespond to non-urgent e-mails during working hours only. Although it can sometimes can take just a few minutes to respond to an e-mail, I still have my daily ‘after-work hours’, during which I pause from work without feeling the sense of urgency to complete tasks. Instead, I reassure myself that I can leave something to be completed tomorrow. During this time, I can still reply to urgent e-mails — such as notifications of emergencies at the animal-housing facility where we conduct our mouse experiments. I need to be reachable in case a mouse has to be culled or receive treatment.\n\nSchedule holidays of at least two weeks each term. By setting aside a holiday break each term, I can unwind, refresh and spend time with loved ones.",

Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty\n\nCrucial negotiations on what would have been the first ever global agreement to limit plastic pollution collapsed last month amid acrimony and distrust. This week, hopes for an agreement suffered another blow when Ecuador’s ambassador Luis Vayas Valdivieso resigned as chair of the intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) for the treaty.\n\nPlastics pollution is surging — the planned UN treaty to curb it must be ambitious\n\nAt the last INC meeting, held in Geneva in August, negotiations ran long into the night, but ended without success. It is unclear whether a new chair will convene another INC meeting, or opt to end the process ends without a treaty. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) — the body overseeing negotiations — will meet in Nairobi in December to address this question.\n\nNature spoke to Samuel Winton, a researcher at University of Portsmouth, UK, who is studying the treaty’s progress, about what went wrong, and what can be done to salvage a process that aims to end one of humanity’s biggest blights on the planet.\n\nWhy do we need a global treaty to end plastic pollution?\n\nPlastic is a global supply chain, and we see frequently in policy that when interventions target a single part of the supply chain in a single country, their impact is very minimal. For example, a plastic bag ban, whether it’s successful or not, is a relatively small impact. A global treaty gives countries the opportunity to work strategically together to take genuinely meaningful action. I am still convinced, despite the challenges of this process, that a plastics treaty is essential.\n\nHow significant is it that Ambassador Vayas Valdivieso resigned?\n\nIt’s a very big deal. The role of the chair in these processes is critically important because they set the work plan, they direct the discussions. Having a different person chairing the next meeting — assuming there is one — will have a big impact on how those talks progress.\n\nSo what would be the best case scenario now?\n\nWe have to be ambitious, but realistic. I don’t think it is realistic — and I’m not convinced it is necessary — to say we are going to cap plastic production at a certain level by a certain date. My ambition would be for there to be a globally enforced environment whereby, with the use of alternative business models or products, the market chooses to adopt those regardless of a ban on certain plastics. That could be regulations that encourage reuse and refill, or regulations that help businesses move to alternative models that reduce the amount of plastic that’s being used.\n\nSamuel Winton is studying the development and outcomes of the UN treaty on plastic pollution.Credit: University of Portsmouth\nHave the negotiations achieved anything positive so far?\n\nThere has been a lot of progress among the High Ambition Coalition of countries (a group that includes the European Union, United Kingdom and more than 50 other nations) in understanding where each other’s red lines are and how countries could work together. And we are seeing movement from countries like China to a more moderate position. But there are others, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia — the ‘like-minded group’ — whose positions haven’t moved at all.\n\nWhere a process works on consensus and you have a few countries refusing to move on certain things, it becomes very difficult to make progress. Another barrier to progress is a lack of more strategic efforts to move the process forward. The high ambition coalition, for example, have stated that they are not a negotiating block. A genuine negotiating block could have helped achieve some more progress than we've seen.\n\nWhat now needs to happen to get a treaty over the line?\n\nWe need to get to a point where countries and the leadership of the process can work together to resolve the current deadlock. There will be many people that tell you that the way to do that is a voting mechanism, and that would be wonderful. However, a number of countries and UNEP themselves are strongly opposed to the introduction of voting, so that looks very challenging.",

To tackle those, universities on the continent must strengthen their research and innovation capacity.\n\nUniversities must move with the times: how six scholars tackle AI, mental health and more\n\nOn average, African countries spend around 0.5% of their gross domestic product on research and development. That’s less than one-quarter of the global average of 2.7%. Without more investment, African countries will remain reliant on imported innovations that are often costly, ill suited to local realities and unsustainable. Botswana urgently needs to address water scarcity and low agricultural productivity. Drought-resistant crops, efficient irrigation technologies and smart water-management systems would help.\n\nBut most universities in Botswana, both public and private, rely heavily on public funding. And with the country’s economy under strain, because the diamond industry it has long depended on is dwindling, the budgets for these institutions are shrinking. The University of Botswana in Gaborone has seen its funding for day-to-day operations decline by about 15% since 2022, and it has received no budget over the past seven years for other developments.\n\nThere are also relatively few jobs for graduates to aspire to. In 2022, approximately one-quarter of adults in Botswana, around 240,000 people, were unemployed. This is eroding faith in higher education, shrinking enrolment in advanced studies, weakening research and innovation capacity and fuelling a brain drain. For those who do go to university, Botswana has a skills mismatch: too many information technology specialists, not enough medical ones.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nThese challenges are prominent. But Botswana’s past prosperity and stability was not built just on diamonds; it relied on sound policies and robust institutions. These policies and institutions must now support the transformation of the country’s economy from a resource-based to a knowledge-based model. At the University of Botswana, together with colleagues, I have been working to convert this mainly teaching institution into a research-intensive one.\n\nThere’s no research without people. We are investing in attracting, developing and nurturing talent. We have set up a mentoring and supervision programme to support early-career researchers through partnerships with other African universities and with international institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",

          "authors": "Mariana Viglino",
          "abstract": "Imagine academia as a racetrack. Some scientists start further ahead than others; some run on clean tracks, others face mud or obstacles. Some can afford only heavy boots, instead of trainers. Some are told that they are not trying hard enough.\n\nEquity is more than a buzzword\n\nThese differing experiences represent the inequities that many researchers face in their careers. Scientists born and based in Latin America — and other historically colonized countries, often referred to as the global south — are familiar with many barriers, including limited funding; reading, writing and communicating their research in a language that isn’t their first; unstable economic and political landscapes; and systemic bias in favour of ideas, data, papers and people from the global north. They also face a high likelihood of encountering unequal partnerships and ‘parachute’ science — an extractive practice in which scientists from high-income countries use data from a lower-income community without involving them in the project.\n\nSome effects of these inequities are well documented. In my field of aquatic-mammal palaeontology, my colleagues and I have found that having a large proportion of Latin American authors on a paper negatively affects the number of citations it receives (A. M. Valenzuela-Toro et al. Commun. Biol. 8, 472; 2025). But publications are key to funding, professional assessments, promotions and international networking. They can prompt invitations to conferences and consideration for awards.\n\nAs a scientist and a woman born, educated and based in Latin America, I propose some steps that editors and publishers — the gatekeepers of publications, who are often scientists from the global north and haven’t experienced some of these barriers — can take to level the playing field.\n\nDecolonize scientific institutions, don’t just diversify them\n\nMake it easier to submit papers. Routinely ask authors what hurdles they faced, and improve systems. Offer guidance on the editorial and peer-review processes. Should authors first pitch to editors, or submit directly? When, and how, should they respond to reviewers’ concerns or appeal a decision? Often, tips for navigating these processes are shared in networks that Latin American researchers are not part of. And lower the language barrier: Spanish and Portuguese versions of submission systems would make them easier for many scientists to use. On publication, journals should offer free copyediting to expand articles’ reach. Artificial-intelligence tools can help — but they should be embraced only with clear guidelines, extreme caution and ethical responsibility.\n\nPartner with Latin American scientific societies. They can help journals to identify scholars to invite onto editorial boards and as reviewers. Owing to the barriers they face, highly qualified Latin American candidates might not have built an international profile through publications or conference invitations — but they can be outstanding choices. Increased Latin American representation will also encourage more submissions.\n\nGo beyond diversity commitments: track progression (positive or otherwise). Data are key to trigger progress and to monitor it. The scientific community must see statistics. Journals must share the demographic information of editorial-board members, authors of submitted and published manuscripts and reviewers. This is not easy — the preferred route for collecting demographic statistics is through self-identification, and publishers have historically not compiled this information, so it will take time to build enough data to see trends. There is no time to waste.",

          "authors": "Kit Chapman",
          "abstract": "Alchemy: An Illustrated History of Elixirs, Experiments, and the Birth of Modern Science Philip Ball Yale Univ. Press (2025)\n\nWhen physicist Ernest Rutherford and chemist Frederick Soddy discovered nuclear transmutation — the natural decay of one radioactive element into another — in 1901, Rutherford’s first cry was of alarm, not delight. “For Mike’s sake, Soddy,” he chastised his co-worker. “Don’t call it transmutation, they’ll have our heads off as alchemists!”\n\nElixirs for times of plague and bullion shortage\n\nAlchemy’s reputation hasn’t improved much since — it remains one of the most misunderstood aspects of science history. For most people, alchemy conjures up images of complex charts and mythical ingredients such as the philosopher’s stone, which could turn lead into gold or create the elixir of life.\n\nIn his latest book, Alchemy, science writer Philip Ball portrays the practice instead as “one of the most versatile, allusive, and fertile products of the human imagination”. He deftly recounts its 4,000 years of history — starting with the skilled artisans of Ancient Egypt and the immortality-seeking medical practitioners of China’s Western Han dynasty (202 bc–ad 9), although the practice originated before this period — picking out changing beliefs, famous works and personalities along the way.\n\nRudiments of science\n\nBall’s eclectic knowledge of chemistry, his insatiable curiosity and his willingness to venture off well-beaten paths make him an excellent guide. To his credit, the book steadfastly refuses to align itself with aspects of alchemy that are overly practical (apparatus and temperature-control methods) or esoteric, and it doesn’t espouse outdated ideas. Historians of science don’t give much credence to the views of psychiatrist Carl Jung, for example, who professed that alchemical symbolism was a reflection of psychological desires. New Age thinking that alchemy is about spiritual transformation rather than scientific effort is less interesting than what alchemy really is.\n\nIllustrations from the Ripley Scroll, around 1600 (left), and The Works of Jacob Behmen, 1764.Credit: Getty Research Institute, Manly Palmer Hall collection of alchemical manuscripts, GRI Special Collections, MS 205 (PDM); Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles\n\nIndeed, alchemy meant many things to different groups and schools of thought, and its story was one of chemical progress and faith-based mystery. Ball picks out several pivotal characters to show how their disparate goals, views and personalities acted as a prism for how they saw the ‘noble art’. Famous practitioners are featured, such as physicist Isaac Newton, and several individuals who are often overlooked in science history.\n\nFor example, in fifteenth-century England, alchemist George Ripley wrote his recipes in rhyming verse. In seventeenth-century Stockholm, queen Christina of Sweden — who ran her own experiments and worked with other alchemists — was a wonderfully controversial figure. She refused to marry, converted from Protestantism to Catholicism and abdicated the throne. Alchemy became the boon or bane of monarchs, depending on whether they thought it could bring them riches or were terrified that their control over their people would slip. And it was a playground for tricksters willing to take someone’s money with the promise of gold that would never come.\n\nAs well as the standard Western progress of alchemy from Egypt to Europe, and from the Islamic world to Christianity, Ball’s gaze also sweeps east towards traditions in China. He takes in such luminaries as the physician Ge Hong, an alchemist and philosopher, whose fourth-century recipe inspired Youyou Tu’s Nobel-prizewinning discovery of artemisinin compounds to treat malaria.\n\nA representation of the three-headed dragon Mercurius, which symbolizes mercury, from around 1760.Credit: General Collection, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, Mellon MS 110, fo.3595\nArt takes centre stage\n\nBringing us into a colourful, lively world of art, poetry and prose, Ball also steps into alchemy’s offshoots. Iatrochemistry — the idea in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that chemical substances from metals, plants and animals could treat ailments — later gave way to medicine. And Ball discusses alchemy’s influence on the English language. In his 1755 English dictionary, Samuel Johnson attributed the origin of the word gibberish to the coded writings of the Islamic alchemical corpus attributed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (also known as Geber in a Latinized version of his name).",

Credit: Getty\n\nFour subtle tweaks to an enzyme could help explain why naked mole rats can live for nearly 30 years, an unusually long lifespan for creatures their size.\n\nThe naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber), native to the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, has drawn attention from researchers because its genetic make-up is closer to humans than it is to mice, making the burrowing rodent an ideal model for studying ageing and longevity.\n\nIn a study1, published in Science today, researchers in China show that changes to the enzyme cGAS (cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase) enhance the animal’s ability to repair genetic damage that leads to ageing. In humans and mice, the enzyme can suppress DNA repair.\n\nDrivers of ageing\n\nAn accumulation of genetic mutations and DNA damage during cell division is a significant driver of ageing and age-related diseases. A process called homologous recombination (HR) is a crucial DNA-repair pathway, and defects in this process are linked to premature ageing and cancer.\n\nDuring the HR process in humans and mice, cGAS enzyme gets pulled away from the damaged DNA by another protein, disrupting the repair.\n\nZhiyong Mao, co-author of the study and a molecular biologist at Tongji University in Shanghai, China, and his colleagues wanted to investigate whether a similar process occurs in naked mole rats. They found that four specific amino-acid substitutions in the enzyme prevent it from breaking down too quickly after DNA damage. The persistence of cGAS means that the enzyme can connect more effectively with other DNA-repair proteins that help to boost the cell’s ability to fix broken DNA.\n\nEnzyme removal\n\nWhen cGAS was removed from the animals’ cells using the gene-editing tool CRISPR–Cas9, DNA damage accumulated. The team also showed that fruit flies (Drosophila) that were engineered to express human cGAS containing the four mutations, which are specific to the naked mole rat, lived longer than flies expressing the human version of the enzyme.",

In the past few years, however, global temperatures have surged, sparking concerns among some scientists that global warming is accelerating and could lead to even more widespread impacts in the coming decades than the changes that have already been recorded.\n\nAustralia’s Great Barrier Reef is ‘transforming’ because of repeated coral bleaching\n\nThe impact on coral reefs has been particularly severe in the past two years , pushing these ecosystems to their tipping point, the researchers say. The warming waters have caused corals across the globe to bleach, a process that occurs when the organisms expel the symbiotic algae that provide them with nutrients, oxygen and vibrant colours. The fourth global bleaching event in the past few decades began in January 2023, and researchers estimate that it has affected more than 84% of the planet’s coral ecosystems.\n\nThe initial tipping-point report talked about large-scale threats to corals in the future tense, but the latest global bleaching event has made it clear that the crisis is now, says Michael Studivan, a coral ecologist at the University of Miami in Florida.",

          "abstract": "Scientists have developed a blood test that analyses epigenetic changes in immune cells. They say it could be used to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome. Credit: TEK Image/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers who are seeking ways to diagnose a mysterious illness called chronic fatigue syndrome might have a new weapon in their armoury. In a study published in the Journal of Translational Medicine on 8 October1, scientists in the United Kingdom say they have found a way to distinguish epigenetic changes in the cells of people who have the condition, which is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis.\n\nA debilitating long-term illness, ME/CFS affects between 17 million and 24 million people worldwide2, but these numbers are crude estimates because clinicians have long lacked reliable diagnostic tools for this poorly understood condition.\n\nThe results of the study show that the epigenetic test could be developed into a clinical biomarker for ME/CFS, said Dmitry Pshezhetskiy, a researcher–clinician at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, and lead author of the study, in a press release that was published alongside the paper. “With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.” He added that the discovery “offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management”.\n\nOthers in the field have cautiously welcomed the findings, but they point out that the study was small and that more work is needed to convert the technique into a clinical tool.\n\nA reboot for chronic fatigue syndrome research\n\nEpigenetic markers\n\nThe underlying mechanisms of ME/CFS remain unclear, but evidence is building that one of the hallmarks of ME/CFS is immune dysregulation. The authors had already developed an assay that screens for epigenetic changes in immune cells in the blood, which they used to identify epigenetic signatures for a range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis3. The assay analyses the way DNA is folded inside peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a key part of the immune system.\n\nThe researchers tested whether the same assay could be used to screen for similar epigenetic changes to immune cells in the blood of 47 individuals with severe ME/CFS, comparing the results with those from 61 healthy participants. The data showed that the assay achieved a 96% accuracy in diagnosing people with ME/CFS.\n\nThe authors found a network of genomic changes that were strongly involved in immune and inflammatory signalling. The authors say that this is consistent with an immune-dysregulation signal in ME/CFS, and underscores the strength of using these changes as biomarkers of the condition. And they say the changes they identified can be connected to specific regions of non-coding DNA, which can help to unpick the role of genetics in the condition and lead to a better mechanistic understanding.\n\n“I think it’s really cool they brought this method to the field,” says Katie Glass, a molecular biologist who studies ME/CFS at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “As far as it being a biomarker, my enthusiasm would be pretty tempered because the cohort is very small and they looked at only very severe patients.”\n\nBiological underpinnings of chronic fatigue syndrome begin to emerge\n\nMany studies using various techniques to analyse everything from metabolites to free-floating RNA in the blood have identified several apparent signatures of ME/CFS, adds Glass, who previously had the condition but has now recovered.",

          "abstract": "A healthy brain (left) and a brain affected by Alzheimer’s disease. Credit: Anatomical Travelogue/SPL\n\nDuring ageing, men experience a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women do, according to a longitudinal study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1. The authors suggest this means that age-related brain changes do not explain why women are more frequently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease than men are.\n\n“It’s really important that we understand what happens in the healthy brain so that we can better understand what happens when people get these neurodegenerative conditions,” says Fiona Kumfor, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Sydney, Australia. This study adds to scientists’ understanding of typical brain ageing, she adds.\n\nNearly twice as many women are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease as men, and ageing is the biggest risk factor for the disease. This has prompted research into age-related sex differences in the brain. “If women’s brains declined more, that could have helped explain their higher Alzheimer’s prevalence,” says co-author Anne Ravndal, a PhD student at the University of Oslo.\n\nPrevious research investigating sex differences in brain ageing has shown mixed results, Ravndal adds. Several studies have found that men experience greater loss of total grey matter and hippocampus size compared with women, whereas other work has reported a sharper decline of grey matter in women.\n\nBrain scans\n\nThe latest study included more than 12,500 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans from 4,726 people — at least two scans per person, taken an average of three years apart — who did not have Alzheimer’s disease or any cognitive impairments and were control participants in 14 larger data sets. The researchers compared how the individuals’ brain structures changed over time, looking at factors including the thickness of grey matter and the size of areas that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as the hippocampus, which is essential to memory.\n\nOverall, men experienced a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women did. For example, the postcentral cortex, which is responsible for processing sensations of touch, pain and temperature, as well as the body’s own position and movements, declined by 2.0% per year in men and by 1.2% annually in women.\n\nKumfor says the results suggest that men age faster than women do. Men also have a shorter life expectancy.\n\nIf these changes did have a role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, the study would have shown that women experience a greater decline in areas associated with the disease, such as the hippocampus and precuneus, which are involved in memory, says Amy Brodtmann, a clinician researcher in cognitive health at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nRavndal says the results point to other possible explanations for the sex differences in prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease, such as differences in survival or susceptibility to the disease.",

          "title": "Economics Nobel prize won by researchers who showed how science boosts growth",
          "authors": "Philip Ball",
          "abstract": "The 2025 Sveriges Riksbank Prize for Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has been awarded to three researchers who have shown how technological and scientific innovation, coupled to market competition, drive economic growth.\n\nOne half of the prize goes to economic-historian Joel Mokyr of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and the other half is split between the economic theorists Philippe Aghion of the Collège de France and the London School of Economics and Peter Howitt of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n“I can’t find the words to express what I feel,” Aghion said. He says he will use the money for research in his laboratory at the Collège de France.\n\nThe award “underlies the importance in investing in science for innovation and long-term economic growth”, says economist Diane Coyle of the University of Cambridge. “It's great to see the Nobel prize recognize the importance of this topic,” adds innovation policy researcher Richard Jones of the University of Manchester, UK. “It's important that economists understand the conditions that lead to technological progress,” he adds. The winners, says Coyle, “have long been on people’s list of potential candidates”.\n\nOld isn’t gold\n\nEconomic growth at a rate of about 1-2 per cent annually is the norm for industrialized nations today. But such growth rates did not happen in earlier times, despite technological innovations, such as the windmill and the printing press.\n\nMokyr showed that the key difference between now and then was what he calls “useful knowledge”, or innovations based on scientific understanding1. One example is the advances made during the Industrial Revolution, beginning in the eighteenth century, when improvements in steam engines could be made systematic rather than by trial and error.\n\nAghion and Howitt, for their part, clarified the market mechanisms behind sustained growth in recent times. In 1992 they presented a model showing how competition between companies selling new products allows innovations to enter the marketplace and displaces older products: a process they called creative destruction2.\n\nUnderlying growth, in other words, is a steady churn of businesses and products. The researchers showed how companies invest in research and development (R&D) to improve their chances of finding a new product, and predicted the optimal level of such investment.\n\nEntrepreneurial state\n\nAccording to economist Ufuk Akcigit of the University of Chicago, Aghion and Howitt highlight an important aspect of economic growth, which is that spending on R&D does not by itself guarantee higher rates of growth: “Unless we replace inefficient firms from the economy, we cannot make space for newcomers with new ideas and better technologies.”\n\n“When a new entrepreneur emerges, they have every incentive to come up with a radical new technology,” Akcigit says. “As soon as they become an incumbent, their incentive vanishes” and they no longer invest in R&D to drive innovation.\n\nThus, because companies cannot expect to remain at the forefront of innovation indefinitely, the incentive for investing in R&D coming from market forces alone declines as a company’s market share grows. To guarantee the societal benefits of constant innovation, the model suggests that it is in society’s interests for the state to subsidize R&D, so long as the return is not merely incremental improvements.\n\nThe work of all three laureates also acknowledges the complex social consequences of growth. In the early days of the Industrial Revolution there were concerns about how mechanisation would cause unemployment of manual workers – a worry echoed today with the increasing use of AI in place of human labour. But Mokyr showed that in fact early mechanization led to the creation of new jobs.\n\nCreative destruction, meanwhile, leads to companies failing and jobs being lost. Aghion and Howitt emphasized that society needs safety nets and constructive negotiation of conflicts to navigate such problems.\n\nTheir model “recognizes the messiness and complexity of how innovation happens in real economies”, says Coyle. “The idea that a country’s productivity level increases by companies going bust and new ones coming in is a difficult sell, but the evidence that that’s part of the mechanism is pretty strong.”",

          "authors": "Michele Catanzaro",
          "abstract": "Researchers who study post-war reconstruction have told Nature that the recovery of public health, environment, higher education and research in Gaza will not succeed unless it is led by experts from the Palestinian territory.\n\nTheir warning comes amid images of jubilant scenes in Gaza yesterday as negotiators in Egypt sealed the first phase of US President Donald Trump’s ceasefire plan, which today was ratified by Israel’s cabinet.\n\nIsrael’s bombardment and ground offensive, which has killed more than 67,000 people, began soon after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\n\nUnder Trump’s plan, Hamas is expected to disarm, release the remaining hostages and play no part in Gaza’s governance. Israel’s government will suspend military action, withdraw its forces to an agreed position, free a number of Palestinian people it is holding in captivity, allow more aid into Gaza and permit United Nations agencies to operate in the territory. The precise details of how all this will be implemented have not been announced.\n\n“We woke up [yesterday] morning to happy, long-awaited news. There are so many celebrations here in Gaza right now,” says Farid Al-Qeeq, a researcher in urban planning and former president of Gaza University.\n\nThe researchers Nature interviewed for this article say it’s important that reconstruction is led by Palestinian communities. They are voicing these concerns now because Palestinian organizations have not been named as having a leadership role in Trump’s plan.\n\nSince the first attacks, Israel’s troops have almost completely destroyed Gaza’s physical infrastructure — including hospitals, other health-care facilities and water and sanitation.\n\nBy the end of August, a time when there were severe restrictions to aid getting through, more than half a million people were experiencing famine, the Famine Review Committee, an independent group of experts, concluded. Nearly 55,000 children below the age of five are acutely malnourished, according to data published in The Lancet on 8 September1 (see ‘Children malnourished’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nMore than 2,200 medical and education personnel have been killed, according to data published by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics based in Ramallah in the West Bank. Almost four-fifths of higher-education campuses have been damaged or destroyed, and 88,000 students at those institutions have been forced to put their studies on hold, according to the UN’s science agency UNESCO, based in Paris.\n\n“It’s important to understand the enormity of the scale of destruction”, says Savo Heleta, a researcher at Nelson Mandela University in South Africa who studies post-conflict higher education and aid flows to Palestinian universities. In a yet-to-be published paper, Heleta estimates that the war has damaged at least US$222 million worth of higher-education infrastructure. Rebuilding, he says, would need nearly five times that, at around $1 billion, because of the cost of clearing debris and removing unexploded bombs.\n\nHeleta also says that if past trends are a guide to the future, then “countries from the Gulf and Turkey are likely to be the main donors” for reconstruction. He adds that in previous years, aid for universities amounted to a maximum of just $20 million per year.\n\nAmani Al-Mqadma, head of international relations for the Islamic University of Gaza and a co-author of ‘Resilience in the rubble’, a report assessing the needs of higher education in Gaza, says that the territory’s priorities extend beyond physical reconstruction. They must also include sustaining online education until physical spaces are rebuilt; mental-health support for students and staff; and reconnecting researchers to the world through conferences, visits and scholarships. Because higher-education institutions in Gaza rely mostly on income from tuition fees, Al-Mqadma calls for aid to cover students’ fees to keep universities alive.\n\nLet Palestinians lead\n\nGaza’s scientific institutions should be crucial partners in the reconstruction efforts, says Al-Mqadma, who is currently based at the University of Edinburgh, UK. “These academics possess unparalleled local knowledge and a deep understanding of their land.” Moreover, “decisions about the region’s future must be informed by extensive input from the communities who will be most affected”, adds Naomi Rintoul-Hynes, a soil scientist at Canterbury Christ Church University, UK, who is studying the environmental impact on Gaza of the war.\n\nPeople gather in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on 9 October to celebrate the ceasefire agreement to end the war in Gaza.Credit: Saeed Qaq/Anadolu via Getty\n\nUnder Trump’s plan, a “technocratic” committee of Palestinian and international experts will be appointed to run public services. This will be under the oversight of an international body of decision makers, probably at the level of heads of government, and called the Board of Peace. The board will be chaired by Trump and will include former UK prime minister Tony Blair.\n\nSultan Barakat, a public-policy researcher at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, says many respected academics will not participate in the committee if it turns out to be “the management of an occupation”.\n\n“There will be a lot of questioning around this committee”, says Barakat, who is co-author of a report, ‘Gaza: leadership and reconstruction for the day after’, published last year.\n\nIraq’s ghosts",

          "abstract": "Omar Yaghi, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday, emigrated from Jordan to the United States as a teenager.Credit: Brittany Hosea-Small/UC Berkeley\n\nOf the 202 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry and medicine this century, less than 70% hail from the country in which they were based when they were awarded their prize. The remaining 63 laureates left their country of birth before winning a Nobel prize, sometimes crossing international borders more than once, a Nature analysis shows (see ‘Nobel flows’).\n\nAmong the Nobel prizewinners who emigrated to other countries are two of three chemistry winners announced on Wednesday. Richard Robson was born in the United Kingdom but now lives in Australia. And Omar Yaghi, who is now a US resident, became the first Jordanian-born Nobel laureate in science. Two of the three physics winners for 2025 are also immigrants: Michel Devoret was born in France and John Clarke in the United Kingdom, but both are US residents.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\n\nImmigrants have long played an important part on the Nobel stage, including illustrious scientists such as Albert Einstein, who moved from his birthplace in Germany to Switzerland (and later to the United States), and Marie Curie, who left her native Poland to work in France. That’s because the most fruitful scientific opportunities — the best training, equipment and research communities — are scattered across the globe. “Talent can be born anywhere, but opportunities are not,” says Ina Ganguli, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I think that’s the reason we see so many foreign Nobel laureates.”\n\nThe new analysis comes as the international flow of scientists and students faces growing obstacles. In the United States, for example, rampant grant cuts and stricter immigration policies implemented this year by the administration of President Donald Trump threaten a looming ‘brain drain’. Such restrictions “will slow the rate of highly novel research, period”, says Caroline Wagner, a specialist in science and technology policy at the Ohio State University in Columbus. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the effects of Trump’s policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia has capped the number of international students that its institutions can enrol each year, and Japan proposed cutting financial support to graduate students from other countries.\n\nCommon destination\n\nAmong those who have already crossed borders is Andre Geim, a physicist at the University of Manchester, UK, and a 2010 physics laureate. Born in Russia to German parents, Geim says he “bounced around like a pinball” throughout his research career, holding positions in Russia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. “If you stay put your whole life, you miss half the game,” he says.\n\nOf the 63 laureates who won the prize after moving out of their birth countries, 41 lived in the United States when their Nobel was awarded. After the Second World War, the United States became a global hub for science, Ganguli says. International researchers flocked there for its generous grants and top universities (see ‘Nobel laureate stomping grounds’). “What we have in the US is unique. It’s a destination for top students and scientists,” says Ganguli. The next most popular landing place was the United Kingdom, which was home to seven of the Nobel prizewinners who had emigrated by the time they got the fateful phone call from Stockholm.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\n\nBut the United Kingdom also saw future prizewinners leave. Thirteen Nobel prizewinners who were born there won the prize while living elsewhere (see ‘Points of departure’), perhaps lured by higher salaries and more prestigious positions, Wagner says. Substantial numbers of future Nobel laureates also left Germany, with six expatriate prizewinners, as well as Japan, France and Russia, each with four expatriate laureates.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\n\nAmong the science categories of the Nobel prizes, physics has the highest proportion of foreign-born laureates so far this century: 37% (see ‘Disciplines differ’). Trailing just behind is chemistry at 33%, and finally, medicine at 23%. Physics probably takes the lead because of its equipment-heavy nature, according to Wagner. The pricey colliders, reactors, lasers, detectors and telescopes that are needed for top-notch physics research reside mainly in a few leading nations. “Thus, the top research talent will likely go to places with top equipment. Medicine is not an equipment-heavy field, so it is easier to stay home,” Wagner says.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\nMoving on\n\nThe future of immigration’s interplay with the Nobels is murky. Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have all enacted restrictions that have reduced the number of university students from abroad. The Trump administration has slashed billions of dollars in scientific research grants so far this year. And a new US policy charges US$100,000 per application for an H-1B visa, which some foreign-born researchers rely on to work in the United States.",

          "authors": "Gemma Conroy",
          "abstract": "CRISPR gene editing has made its way into every corner of modern biology, but not into every corner of the cell. Although researchers have used these systems to develop treatments for sickle-cell anaemia and blood cancers, to unlock the secrets of multicellularity and to discover the role of thousands of overlooked proteins, there’s one place CRISPR can’t easily reach: mitochondria.\n\nCancer cells get power boost by stealing mitochondria from nerves\n\nThe rings of DNA inside mitochondria are inaccessible to these techniques, which means that precise edits to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) remain frustratingly out of reach. “Mitochondria missed the CRISPR–Cas9 revolution that exploded 12 years ago,” says Michal Minczuk, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nBut researchers are eager to access this DNA, says Minczuk. Mitochondria are bean-shaped organelles that power cells and have myriad other cellular tasks. Exploring their DNA is essential for understanding the energy production and exchange that underlies metabolic health. And more than 300 mutations in this DNA cause mitochondrial diseases — incurable genetic disorders with a wide range of symptoms that can rob people of their sight and hearing, trigger muscle problems and spark seizures1. These disorders affect roughly 1 in 5,000 people.\n\nBecause CRISPR can’t help with these problems, researchers have been looking for other ways to precisely edit the mitochrondrial genome. And the past few years have brought some success: the tools are already proving to be a boon for creating accurate animal models of mitochondrial diseases. “The progress has been remarkable,” says Jin-Soo Kim, a chemical biologist who develops mtDNA editing tools at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea.\n\nIf researchers can make mtDNA editing safe and accurate enough, it could eventually be used to treat, and even cure, these genetic conditions. “It would be a medical breakthrough,” says Kim.\n\nA bacterial origin\n\nThe exact origins of mitochondria are murky, but the leading theory holds that the organelle’s story started around 1.5 billion years ago when a single-celled microorganism called an archaeon gobbled up a roaming bacterium that survived inside its host. This event marked the beginning of the eukaryotes — the large group of organisms, including plants, animals and fungi, in which cells contain organelles that are enclosed inside membranes. The swallowed bacterium retained its characteristic circular DNA as it settled into its new home, but over time it sacrificed most of its genes to the nuclear genome of its host.\n\nIn the evolutionary lineage that gave rise to humans and other animals, this genetic transfer whittled the resident bacterium’s genome down to just 37 genes that code for 13 proteins involved in energy production, turning it into a specialized organelle.\n\nMitochondria expel tainted DNA — spurring age-related inflammation\n\nThe small amount of mitochondrial DNA that stuck around in animals differs in key ways from nuclear DNA, which in humans encodes around 20,000 genes. For a start, mtDNA is typically inherited solely from the mother. There can be several copies of mtDNA in each mitochondrion, and the organelle has its own built-in machinery for making RNA and proteins from that DNA.\n\nMitochondrial DNA is also much more error-prone, with a mutation rate estimated to be 10–20 times greater than that of nuclear DNA. This is in part because it has to contend with a barrage of damaging reactive oxygen species — unstable molecules that are generated in mitochondria during normal energy production. But it’s also because it doesn’t have histones: the proteins that protect and package nuclear DNA.\n\nCompared with its counterpart in the nucleus, mtDNA’s toolkit for repairing itself is rudimentary. The nucleus is quick to fix a snapped DNA strand using an arsenal of repair mechanisms, but mitochondria can mend only some defects. They often simply throw away their broken DNA. This difference limits the options for gene-editing tools, because nearly all such tools for nuclear DNA use its inherent repair pathways.\n\nIt has been notoriously challenging to develop approaches for modifying mitochondrial DNA, says Stephen Ekker, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas at Austin. “Its bacterial origins are revealed when you start trying to edit it,” he says.\n\nThe most crucial hurdle for scientists trying to tinker with the mitochondrial genome is that it is locked behind a wall of membranes that doesn’t allow external nucleic acids to pass into the organelle. Although there have been hints that CRISPR-based gene-editing tools — which rely on RNA to guide them to the correct sequence — might be able to overcome these barriers, many researchers remain unconvinced.\n\nSnip and trash\n\nStill, there are other ways in. More than a decade before CRISPR became a research tool, mitochondria researchers began experimenting with other editing tools that could cross mitochondrial membranes and coax the organelles into ditching their problematic DNA2.\n\nEvery cell contains a vast number of mitochondrial genomes, because cells contain thousands of mitochondria and each one can carry several copies of mtDNA. Healthy and mutated mtDNA often coexist: a state known as heteroplasmy. It’s when the proportion of mutated mtDNA reaches 60–80% in a particular tissue or cell type that mitochondrial diseases manifest3.\n\nCells are swapping their mitochondria. What does this mean for our health?\n\nIf researchers could reduce the faulty copies of mtDNA in cells, they could eliminate the resulting disease. So, they turned to enzymes called zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to snip the double-stranded mtDNA. Whereas targeted snipping of nuclear DNA cajoles the cut DNA strands to glue themselves back together without the harmful mutation, the cut DNA in mitochondria is simply cast out. This elimination triggers the remaining intact copies to replicate themselves so that the correct level of mtDNA is maintained.\n\nIn most cases, the mutated copies will be reduced to an acceptable level as the normal copies are replicated. “That’s going to make up for what you’re destroying,” says Carlos Moraes, a geneticist at the University of Miami in Florida.\n\nAlthough there has been progress with this approach, it hasn’t made its way out of the laboratory. And even if it did reach the clinic, the technique would be powerless against diseases caused by mutations that are often present in all copies of a person’s mtDNA, such as Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare condition that causes rapid vision loss.\n\nWhat researchers need are tools that do more than cut DNA but that don’t rely on guide RNA.\n\nCRISPR-free base editing\n\nWhen CRISPR–Cas9 emerged as a tool in 2012, it became the go-to gene editor for all kinds of application. A guide RNA directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence, where the enzyme does the cutting. Genetic changes are introduced as the DNA repairs itself.\n\nThe approach became even more useful in 2016, when David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his colleagues introduced a more precise technique called base editing4. In this case, researchers modify the Cas9 enzyme and rely on another enzyme, called a deaminase, to convert one DNA base letter to another — such as cytosine (C) to thymine (T) or adenine (A) to guanine (G).\n\nHope, despair and CRISPR — the race to save one woman’s life\n\nAlthough base editing and other CRISPR techniques took off for nuclear DNA, Liu and other research teams couldn’t get it working on mtDNA. Because CRISPR’s guide RNA doesn’t readily pass through a mitochondrion’s double membrane, using precise tools on mtDNA remained a pipe dream. “We did not have much success,” says Liu.\n\nA solution materialized in 2018 when Joseph Mougous, a microbiologist then at the University of Washington in Seattle, and his colleagues stumbled across a toxin made by the bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia. This enzyme, a deadly weapon against other bacteria, wreaks havoc by ultimately converting base C to T across the bacterial genome5.\n\nMougous, now based at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, e-mailed Liu asking whether the enzyme, called DddA, would be of any use to him. “I knew exactly what it might be used for — base editing mtDNA!” says Liu.\n\nBut switching every C to a T would be lethal to cells. Liu and his colleagues set out to “tame the beast”. They split DddA into two inactive pieces so that the enzyme would do its handiwork on mtDNA only when the pieces were brought together in a particular orientation. And instead of using guide RNA, Liu and his colleagues modified proteins found in TALENs to direct the DddA segments to their target sequences (see ‘Making the edit’).",

Introducing genetic changes to these frogs could help to make them more resistant to infections.Credit: James Cook University\n\nThe global conservation community is debating whether to ban the release of genetically modified organisms into the wild. Dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a moratorium on field applications of synthetic biology — a technology being studied as a tool to fight diseases, control pests and help endangered species — saying that the approach has unpredictable consequences. But some researchers argue that an outright ban is too restrictive, and could have negative consequences for human health and biodiversity.\n\nHow genetically modified mosquitoes could eradicate malaria\n\nA proposal for a ban will face a vote next week at a congress of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in Abu Dhabi. The IUCN brings together governments and civil-society organizations to guide global conservation policy. Although decisions made by its members are not legally binding, they do influence legislation in many countries, says biologist Piero Genovesi, head of the Wildlife Service at the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research in Rome.\n\nIf members vote in favour of the proposed ban, it “could have stronger impacts in areas like Europe or Australia, where there are many lines of research focused on developing new tools based on synthetic biology for improving the efficacy of conservation action”, Genovesi says. He is among more than 240 scientists who have so far signed an open letter asking IUCN members to reject the moratorium.\n\nOngoing debate\n\nThis is not the first time conservationists have debated whether the genetic engineering of wild species should be allowed. A moratorium on gene drives, a way of introducing engineered genes so that they spread rapidly through a population, was proposed at the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity meeting in 2016, and again in 2018 — but was ultimately rejected.\n\nThose in favour of the latest proposal argue that the effects of genetic biotechnologies on nature — and on insects in particular — are hard to predict and could be irreversible. “These new technologies risk adding to the pressures already threatening pollinators,” said Joann Sy, scientific adviser at POLLINIS, a non-profit organization based in Paris that is focused on the conservation of bees and other pollinators, in a statement released by the organization. More than 80 researchers have signed an open letter in support of the moratorium, which says that the deployment of genetically modified organisms is “advancing faster than safety and risk assessment can keep pace” and that “no release should occur unless and until it can be demonstrated that there are no direct or indirect risks to pollinators, biodiversity or ecosystems”.\n\nGenetically modified apple reaches US stores, but will consumers bite?",

          "title": "Digital flocks, predators allow ecologists to simulate real-world animal behaviour",
          "authors": "Heather Richardson",
          "abstract": "On arriving at work one day last October, ecologist Koen de Koning did what he often does first thing in the morning: he fired up the Crane Radar. The interactive web application showed a flock of cranes heading his way. Excitedly, he dashed outside, looked up and, sure enough, 60 or so birds flew past on their migration route south.\n\nThe Crane Radar is a digital twin — a virtual representation of a real-world entity and a relatively new technology in ecology (see go.nature.com/46rbkg4). “I’ve definitely seen more of the migration because of the radar. And I’m learning more about the migration patterns as well,” says De Koning, who works at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands and is a keen birder.\n\nIn fields such as manufacturing, infrastructure and health care, the technology has been used to model objects from electronics components to UK hospital wards and even the nation of Singapore.\n\nHow a vast digital twin of the Yangtze River could prevent flooding in China\n\nTheir purposes vary. Digital twins can make life easier for individual users — Google Maps, for example, is continuously updated to help drivers to navigate traffic. Other programs can predict the effects of climate change on cities, plan architecture or simulate surgical procedures. HeartNavigator, a software package from the Dutch health-technology firm Philips, can be used to plan heart operations such as valve replacements, simulating surgery using various models and sizes of valve to find the best fit for a patient.\n\nNASA used what is often considered the first digital twin (then called a living model) in 1970 to work out why an oxygen tank exploded on the Apollo 13 lunar mission and to bring the astronauts home safely. The agency’s principal technologist, John Vickers, coined the term digital twin in 2010, a few years after US systems engineer Michael Grieves formalized the concept in a presentation to the manufacturing industry when he was co-director of the Project Lifecycle Management Development Consortium at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nOver the past decade, there has been a marked increase in the development of digital twins across a range of fields. This is mostly because of the increasing availability of data, the prevalence of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. The global digital-twin market is forecast to grow by more than sevenfold over the next 5 years, according to one report — from US$21 billion this year to $150 billion in 2030 (see go.nature.com/4nctfu2). The fastest growth is anticipated in health care, the report says, owing to the technology’s potential for reducing errors and improving diagnoses and surgical outcomes.\n\nFor ecologists, digital twins present unique opportunities. But there are limitations that need to be addressed, from ensuring adequate data access to sustainable funding.\n\nEcological digital twins\n\nDigital twins can be particularly useful for studying systems that are changing outside historical norms, says Anna Davison, who is researching digital twins in ecology at Wageningen University & Research. That includes how ecosystems react to anthropogenic climate change. So it’s perhaps no surprise that ecologists are increasingly using digital twins to tackle gaps in biodiversity research brought about by ecosystem complexities, ponderous government action and a lack of real-time monitoring.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Crane Radar is one of four digital twins developed by Wageningen University & Research as part of a €300,000 (US$352,000) project funded by the European Union, called Nature FIRST. It forecasts the migration of common cranes (Grus grus) across the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, northern France and northwestern Germany, helping birdwatchers and ecologists to locate the flocks as they traverse the region.\n\nDe Koning says he chose crane migration as the focus of his first digital twin because of the abundance of data and because it is a relatively simple process to model. He also had a personal motivation: “I was always in the wrong location or at the wrong place at the time” to see the cranes, De Koning jokes. “This model really helped me, personally, to see them more often.”\n\nSims-style ‘digital twin’ models can tell us if food systems will weather crises\n\nTo build a digital twin, scientists first need to collect the relevant data for the real-world entity, whether that be real-time data from IoT devices or historical records. Then they must develop algorithms to mimic the behaviour of the physical twin and test the model — for example, by fitting historical data sets to recent ones — before applying the trained model to real-time data.\n\nCreated over the course of about a year and costing roughly €15,000–20,000, the Crane Radar uses migration data (sourced from Movebank, an online animal-tracking database), real-time sightings by birdwatchers and factors such as wind speed and direction of flight to estimate where the birds will be within the next four hours (K. De Koning Ecol. Inform. 85, 102938; 2025).\n\nWageningen researchers partnered with Sensing Clues, a conservation technology non-profit organization in Amsterdam, to transform their models into platforms that can be easily accessed and understood by end users — members of the public, policymakers and other researchers.\n\nBirdwatchers can also log sightings (including the location, time, direction of flight and number of cranes) through Observation.org, a citizen-science platform for biodiversity. The crane digital twin updates every minute; the website has a slight lag, updating every five minutes with a four-hour forecast for each sighting.\n\nThe Crane Radar has been well received by Dutch birders. It receives an average of 100,000 daily visits during peak migration season in late October and early November, dipping down to 1,000 on quieter days. After it was featured by Dutch national news, however, more than 300,000 users engaged with the app each day over the subsequent weekend, De Koning says.\n\n“It’s a really nice, completely closed loop where the end user is also the data provider,” says Davison, who has developed a digital twin for the migration of Beluga sturgeon (Huso huso) in the Danube River delta.\n\nModelling ecosystems\n\nA more complex digital twin is being built to mirror ecosystems in Doñana National Park in southern Spain.\n\n“The park is a key essential biodiversity area in Europe – however, it is threatened by multiple human activities,” says Maria Paniw, a researcher at Doñana Biological Station in Seville. Threats include overexploitation of water, agricultural development outside the park, tourism and climate change. “We wanted to understand how all these different factors affect the ecosystem in a real-time complex setting, not through simple approximations based on single species that we typically do in ecology.”\n\nThe first effort by Paniw’s team models interactions between vegetation, rabbits and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), a ‘keystone species’ in the park. Its conservation status has recently improved — it moved from endangered to vulnerable status last year, thanks to efforts to boost its numbers, including protection of habitat and translocations of the animals to expand its genetic diversity.\n\nResearchers set up digital-twin experiments in Spain’s Doñana National Park.Credit: Hanna Serediuk/Doñana Biological Station (EBD-CSIC)\n\nAlongside a detailed database of lynx reproduction statistics and movements (all reintroduced lynx have GPS tracking collars) and rabbit data from hunting organizations and other national parks, the researchers use a metric called the normalized difference vegetation index. This measures the verdancy of landscapes and is constantly updated using satellite imagery to assess changes in plant density and health. The aim is to show how rabbits respond to changes in vegetation and weather, and how lynx, in turn, respond to changes in rabbit abundance. The findings will inform where lynx can be best reintroduced into the environment and where they might move from those release sites.\n\n“We basically started with part of the system that has the most data and the most urgent need to get something done,” explains Paniw. She hopes that this approach will convince park managers of the usefulness of digital twins before they build more complex models. “They need to see value in this.”\n\nOther researchers have built digital twins of river systems across Europe, Africa and Asia. A digital twin of the River Stiffkey in southeastern England was built by regional water company Anglian Water and partners including Microsoft and the University of Suffolk, UK. The aim is to model strategies to improve the health and biodiversity of the chalk-stream habitat — a rare type that is threatened by warming water and pollution. Digital twins of the Yangtze River in China and parts of the River Douro in Portugal are also in development, along with three twins of rivers in Kenya.\n\nRivers are “a rich environment for demonstrating the viability of these models,” explains computer scientist Lawrence Nderu, chair of the Department of Computing at Kenya’s Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology near Nairobi. “They are very dynamic.”\n\nNderu is developing a twin of the Mara River basin in Narok County, southwestern Kenya, as part of a collaboration between his university and the Slovenian space technology organization Space-SI in Ljubljana, which builds applications to acquire satellite data.\n\nThe Narok area is hit with periodic severe flooding that can be life-threatening. Nderu’s team is designing its digital twin to alert communities and authorities to predicted flooding events, integrating data from weather stations, soil sensors and satellites, together with information about the river system and surrounding landscape. That should allow vulnerable populations to plan ahead, he says. Nomadic herders, for example, can move their cattle to higher ground.\n\n“Otherwise, we will always be talking about what should have been done, which is always a very costly conversation,” Nderu adds.\n\nTwin challenges\n\nThat reliance on up-to-the-minute data, however, reveals a key challenge for digital twins: having sensors in the field is one thing, but they need to be connected to the Internet for the data to be useful. Data quality can be an issue, too – De Koning says citizen observations of cranes, for example, often include inaccurate time stamps, locations or identification, which can muddle the resulting models.\n\nFor Nderu, there is also the issue of data storage. His digital twins require volumes of data — including about 2.5 terabytes of compressed video files per year — that can be costly to store in the cloud in Kenya (he estimates about US$800 annually). “We are trying to approach [cloud] companies like AWS to provide us with that,” he says.\n\nDe Koning says that because digital twins are so new, people are often unaware of their potential. Scientists need to first explain possible outcomes before users can express how a digital twin could be helpful to them.\n\nThe Internet of Things comes to the lab\n\nAlso a challenge, Paniw and Davison say, is sustainability — specifically, balancing the short-term nature of research funding with the length of time it takes to build a digital twin and the cost of maintaining it.",

          "abstract": "Talae Vethrin, PhD Candidate, Planetary Entomology Institute, Belt Station Agastya Theta\n\nSet Two Report: Spiral Five, Cycle 742\n\nI turned 27 today. That means I’ve now spent four years in the doctoral programme and am exactly 365 days away from professional disgrace and having my credentials quietly revoked in a humiliating end-of-cycle formality they call ‘declassification’. It’s not a euphemism. If I don’t find a new insect species by this time next year, I don’t get a PhD. I get a polite ejection from the Galactic Consortium of Insect Scientists (GCIS) and maybe a commemorative keychain.\n\nThe GCIS — venerable, bureaucratic and with all the warmth of cryogenic fog — was very clear in our orientation: discovery must occur within four to five Earth-standard years. No ifs, no bugs, no degree. It’s all written in some charter older than half the member planets, filled with flowery declarations about scientific value and intersystemal knowledge equity. The charter calls it a time-bound discovery mandate. I call it the Bug Rule.\n\nBack when I applied, I thought, please, how hard can it be? Insects make up 93% of documented animal life in the habitable Universe. They evolve faster than rumours, hitch rides on cargo freighters and colonize anything that’s even vaguely damp and not currently on fire. I assumed I’d stub my toe on a new species just walking to the dorm kitchen.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nInstead, I’ve become the department’s leading authority on not finding things. My thesis so far: Things That Weren’t New Insects, Volume 3.\n\nMy catalogue includes a long list of things that weren’t new insects: larval Terran micro beetles in borrowed shells; a ‘glider fly’ that turned out to be corrupted sensor feedback; and my personal favourite, a Martian ash-louse misidentified by a colleague as a nova-strain. The GCIS slapped them with a two-year publication ban and repossessed their lab footwear — they now study fungal drift on Europa. Barefoot. Metaphorically, but still.\n\nThe consortium used to care about taxonomy for taxonomy’s sake. Now it’s all triage and panic. With ecological systems collapsing across six planets and protein shortages spiralling, any insect with metabolic flexibility might save a biosphere, or at least feed a few billion desperate people. They don’t care if it’s beautiful or horrifying. If it breeds in pressure-variable conditions and doesn’t murder the host species? Into the database it goes.\n\nBut the requirements remain annoyingly intact. The insect must be isolated, fully sequenced, confirmed independently by two peer reviewers who aren’t legally dead, and are, of course, sentient-neutral. That last clause destroyed my best lead: a hive-minded crustwing from Proxima Centauri b that could mimic human speech. The GCIS deemed it a “biolinguistic contamination vector” and had it flash-incinerated. I still hear it humming in my dreams.\n\nSome nights I wake up with the taste of copper in my mouth and the faint impression I’ve just signed a contract.\n\nAnyway.\n\nHere’s my current situation. Still on Belt Station Agastya Theta, stationed on Deck 12, the biowaste reprocessing ring. It handles gut fauna from 63 livestock species and turns them into protein gel. The air smells like sanitized dung and melted ozone seals. But I’ve found a vent behind the centrifugal filter unit that isn’t in the schematics. Perfect heat signature. Subtle airflow. Unregistered by maintenance bots. Something lives in there.\n\nI’ve seen it. Not clearly, but enough. A flicker in still air. Once, a fragment of wing. Translucent, vibrating faintly, like it was humming in a frequency I couldn’t hear.\n\nEvery day for the past fortnight, I’ve left bait outside the crevice. Synthfruit rind, pheromone droplets, even powdered Terran wasp resin. Something takes it. Not all at once. Not messily. Deliberately. With intent.\n\nI’ve named it the Ghost Ant. Not because it looks like an ant. I still haven’t seen the body. I just like the drama. Better than Provisional Record KX-5/Delta or Biological Trace Entity 19a-Rho.\n\nMy adviser, Dr Juno, thinks I’m hallucinating under deadline pressure. She calls my current progress “theoretical optimism” and has suggested I pivot to fungal symbiosis, which, in academic terms, is the equivalent of being told to go swab mould and reflect on my choices. The implication wasn’t subtle.\n\nStill, I check the vent each morning. I don’t scan. That could spook it. I just crouch beside the unit, hold my breath, and look for changes. Yesterday, I found a shard of exoshell. About the size of a thumbnail, folded over itself five times, shimmering like compressed oil film.\n\nI haven’t reported it to the GCIS.\n\nNot because I’m trying to hoard glory. I just need to be sure. I need to know it’s mine. The last doctoral candidate who submitted too early had their discovery reassigned to a senior researcher who had “guided their thinking”. That student now teaches Introduction to Bioforms on a Class-2 moon school for children with partial language cortices.\n\nI want more than that.\n\nI want to name something no one else has seen. I want the Ghost Ant to be the insect that justifies this past exhausting year.",

          "abstract": "Sales listings on the dark web for nitazenes have proliferated as listings for fentanyl (pictured) have gone down.Credit: Gary Coronado/Los Angeles Times/Getty\n\nResearchers who study trends in illicit drug use are concerned that sales of a potent class of synthetic opioids called nitazenes are on the rise globally.\n\nThe opioid class of drugs includes heroin and morphine. Unlike those drugs, which are derived from naturally occurring opium, nitazenes are synthesized from scratch in a laboratory. The first nitazenes were developed as painkillers in the 1950s, but were never approved for medical use because they carried a high risk of dangerous side effects such as loss of consciousness, coma and death.\n\nBut since 2019, there has been a rise in the reported use of nitazenes, according to the World Drug Report 2025, which was released in June. In 2023, the report states, 20 different nitazenes were seized by authorities across 28 countries and reported to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Early Warning Advisory on New Psychoactive Substances.\n\nNitazenes can be as much as 500 times more potent than opium-derived drugs. For example, butonitazene is 2.5 times more potent than heroin, whereas isotonitazene and etonitazene are 250 and 500 times more potent, respectively.\n\nThis means that just a tiny amount can be deadly. In the United Kingdom, there were 179 confirmed deaths from nitazene overdoses in the year to 31 May 2024. And reports suggest that thousands of people might have died from nitazene overdoses in the United States since 2019. In Australia, researchers note that the unpredictable presence of nitazenes in various drugs is increasing the risk of overdose in the country.\n\nMost nitazene overdoses are unintentional, says Suzanne Nielsen, an addiction researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Overdose tends to occur when nitazenes are sold as other drugs, such as heroin, oxycodone and MDMA (also known as ecstasy). Overdoses can be treated with naloxone, a drug that has long been used to treat other opioid overdoses. More awareness of this among drug users and their families could help save lives, Nielsen adds.\n\nGlobal picture",

          "abstract": "Neurons (pictured) in a brain region called the parabrachial nucleus have been implicated in creating the sensation of pain that persists long after an initial injury.Credit: Mike Agliolo/SPL\n\nScientists have spotted a small set of easily overlooked brain cells that is activated during persistent pain — the kind that lasts long after an initial injury. The research was performed in mice, but if it can be confirmed in humans, the work could lead to new therapies for chronic pain.\n\nSuch pain affects roughly one in five people worldwide. “Pain is in your head. But it is very real,” says Nicholas Betley, a biologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and a co-author of a new study describing the findings.\n\nThe authors’ experiments also show that the release of a specific signalling chemical in the brain can dampen the activity of the persistent-pain neurons, suggesting that the brain itself has an innate pain-killing mechanism.\n\nWhen pain persists\n\nIn the study, published in Nature1 on 8 October, Betley and his team focused on a brain region called the parabrachial nucleus, which receives multiple types of sensory information from the body. The nucleus then relays those data to other regions of the brain.\n\nIn studies on mice, the researchers identified a subset of neurons distributed throughout the parabrachial nucleus that switched on after an initial painful stimulus, such as a cut to a nerve, and remained active long after the insult. The persistent-pain neurons carry receptors for a signalling molecule called neuropeptide Y.\n\nChronic pain can be treated — so why are millions still suffering?\n\nWhen the researchers artificially activated these ‘Y1R’ neurons, mice showed pain-associated behaviours. When the scientists blocked the activity of these neurons, the animals’ persistent pain decreased, yet they had normal short-lived pain responses after being exposed to dangers, such as touching a hot surface. The Y1R neurons alone don’t cause the feeling of pain, Betley says. But, they form part of the network “that leads to the sensation that we refer to as pain”.\n\nMice with persistent pain were also deprived of food or water or exposed to a frightening stimulus, such as a component of bobcat urine. In each case, the animals’ behaviour and neural activity suggested that their persistent pain had been reduced. For example, two weeks after a nerve injury, hungry mice ignored a poke to their paws that would normally make them recoil. “In the wild, we think this would allow them to shift focus from their pain to go out and seek food,” says Betley.\n\nThe researchers attributed the pain reduction to an influx into the parabrachial nucleus of neuropeptide Y, which had been released by neurons in other parts of the brain that became active when the mice developed urgent needs. “Something more important than pain came along,” says co-author Ann Kennedy, a neuroscientist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. “We think of pain as just a sensory input,” she says, ”but the sensation of pain is a lot more malleable, and it’s changed by our experiences.”",

And these rates do not take into account rising demand as the world’s population grows and new technologies emerge3 (see ‘Three-part problem’).\n\nFurthermore, the mining and extraction of most metals, as well as their melting, refining, alloying, casting and shaping, are a large source of greenhouse gases. Steelmaking alone accounts for about 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions, or 3.6 billion tonnes3 — more than three times what the aviation sector contributes.\n\nThere are currently no concrete, commonly accepted long-term solutions or implementation plans. Here, based on our expertise in materials science and engineering, we outline a set of five strategies that, together, can address the challenges. The solutions that societies choose will have wide-reaching consequences for our ways of life, economy and the well-being of our planet and future generations.\n\nSources: Reserves: ref. 1; In demand: ref. 2; Emissions: World Steel in Figures 2024 and Sustainability Indicators 2024 reports (World Steel Association)\nSwap materials\n\nA small tweak in a material’s chemical composition can go a long way in reducing the amount of metals used. Take steel, for example. About one billion tonnes of carbon–manganese steel are used each year globally for buildings and other infrastructure. However, using another type of steel — which has almost the same amounts of carbon, manganese and silicon, but also contains tiny amounts of niobium (about 0.03% in weight) — increases the material’s strength and toughness4. Niobium-microalloyed steel is slightly more expensive than conventional steel. But because it is stronger, less material is required4,5, lowering the total cost of a building. Reducing steel consumption can also reduce CO2 emissions4,5 by some 20%.\n\nAir taxis will soon be in our skies — if batteries can be made safer\n\nResearchers are investigating other substitutions, too. For example, rare-earth magnets, which require elements such as dysprosium or terbium, could be replaced with less environmentally damaging ones based on iron nitride6. And sodium-ion batteries7 could replace lithium-ion ones to circumvent lithium’s global supply limitations, high extraction costs and the environmental damage it causes during extraction. Scientists are also studying thermal batteries that store energy as heat rather than as electricity and that are made from materials such as cement and crushed rock.\n\nTo accelerate the adoption of materials with lower carbon footprints, governments should update policies and regulations. Governments and industry can also create certification schemes that reward low-emission material choices, helping designers, engineers and consumers to make informed decisions. And universities should include substitution principles in engineering and materials education, to train a workforce to select materials that have a minimal environmental impact, not just high performance.\n\nAcademia and industry must work together closely, through industry-funded fellowships, joint research programmes and institutions such as the US Engineering Research Centers, which are supported by the National Science Foundation.\n\nAdopt green technologies\n\nThe metal-production industry urgently needs to reduce its environmental impact. Aluminium production, for example, is responsible for around 270 million tonnes of CO2 a year (one-tenth that of steel). It also releases toxic fluorine-containing species, which are powerful greenhouse gases. And copper smelting releases large amounts of sulfur dioxide, contributing to acid rain.\n\nGreen manufacturing technologies that lower emissions are needed. Many exist already. For instance, a top gas recycling blast furnace that reuses carbon dioxide from the ironmaking process can reduce emissions substantially8. Other harmful by-products can also be upcycled. In copper smelting, for example, sulfur dioxide can be converted into usable compounds, such as sulfuric acid.\n\nBattery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?\n\nInnovations in hydrometallurgy and bioleaching9 that use microorganisms to break down the minerals in ores and release pure metals are revolutionizing extraction. They can take nickel, copper and gold from ores with low concentrations of these elements and avoid energy-intensive smelting procedures, enabling metal extraction from sources that were previously too expensive to mine or dismissed as unusable, such as by-products of mining and other industrial processes and electronic waste.\n\nHowever, in practice, many of these advanced technologies are not being adopted because of their cost. Governments must help businesses and individuals through policies or incentives, such as low-interest loans, investment grants and carbon pricing mechanisms. Solar energy promotion shows how government incentives can accelerate adoption despite high upfront costs. The US Investment Tax Credit and state-level programmes can offer subsidies, zero-interest loans and community solar-energy support.\n\nGo circular\n\nAnother way to lower metal consumption is to improve the durability, repairability and recyclability of metal-containing products. Companies should design long-lasting products and offer end-of-life recycling. Several corporations, including technology giants Apple and Dell, have adopted circular practices through certified refurbishment programmes.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nGovernments must support these efforts by overseeing recycling data, enforcing disclosure requirements and setting up recycling and waste-management incentives10. The European Union has embraced this approach. For example, its Circular Economy Action Plan and its Ecodesign directive mandate standards for the durability and repairability of products. International organizations should standardize practices and environmental agencies or independent bodies must monitor compliance and progress. The International Organization for Standardization has issued standards on ecodesign and design for disassembly. The United Nations Environment Programme’s International Resource Panel and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provide guidance for sustainable material flows11.\n\nAccelerating metal recycling must also be a top priority. Steel, aluminium and copper are already recycled widely, but urgent improvements are needed for others, such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and rare-earth elements. Advanced sorting methods and urban mining programmes12 that can recover valuable metals from electronic waste are crucial.\n\nIn 2021, for example, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry outlined the country’s transition to a circular economy. According to the nation’s economic and environmental ministries, some 15 million home appliances were collected nationwide in the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nManufacturing processes can be improved, too. 3D printing, for example, reduces waste by building objects layer by layer, using only the necessary amount of raw metal powder13.\n\nBuild resilient supply chains",

          "abstract": "Jack W. Baker had to unexpectedly combat an accusation of plagiarism. It taught him something about keeping science transparent.Credit: Yuri Hobart/Stanford\n\nMore than ten years ago, my student and I were accused of misconduct. The issue was our just-published paper in a journal. Our accuser pointed to his own recent publication, which had a nearly identical scope to ours. He claimed we were aware of his previous work and had intentionally not cited it because of a lack of “scientific ethics”. He also alleged that we had abused our privilege, characterizing us as a well-known research group that deliberately ignored work from what he described as a smaller and less affluent country.\n\nThe accuser made his claim to the journal editor, and submitted a Comment article with this accusation, which he requested the journal publish as an addendum to our paper. The editor contacted us to review the accusation and offer a response, before she decided whether to publish it. She was dispassionate and didn’t indicate what outcomes she was considering. This was professionally appropriate while she was gathering information. But my student and I were in shock. As an assistant professor still building confidence in my work, I had no experience navigating an accusation of this kind.\n\nBuilding our defence\n\nWe took some time to study the accuser’s original paper, and the similarities to ours were alarming. It tackled a problem similar to ours and proposed the same set of equations to develop a solution. These equations were identical, even down to minor notational choices. This was more than a case of needing to add citations to previous related work — plagiarism seemed to be involved. No wonder the journal editor took the claim seriously.\n\nShould I tell anyone that I suspect misconduct in a paper I’m reviewing?\n\nThe two papers had been submitted to different journals a year earlier. We had submitted ours a few weeks earlier, although our accuser’s got through the review process faster. But our journal paper wasn’t our first public contribution of these ideas: we dug up two preliminary project documents from the previous few years that we’d published on our group’s website. They contained the same notation and equations, as well as similar results.\n\nThe documents were the sort of things we’d now add to a public repository or preprint server, but at the time, these were not yet in vogue in our field. Our accuser had cited other materials from our website in his original paper, but not these two documents.\n\nWe surmised that the commenter had used the work published on our website to form the basis of his own paper and then submitted it to a journal, presenting our preliminary results as his own.\n\nCrafting a response\n\nWith the evidence in hand, we replied to the journal editor to explain what we thought had happened (edited for anonymity):\n\nWe have been researching this topic for several years, culminating in the publication being discussed here. Our preliminary work has been publicly available for several years, including a project report and a conference presentation. The commenter is clearly aware of our work, as they cite seven other documents available on our website but not the specific ones described above. The above documents were announced on our website at the time of their release and have been continually available. Some of the complex notation in our early documents is identical to the commenter’s paper and our eventual paper: [details and examples listed].\n\nIt thus seems clear to us that the commenter copied the terminology, equations and figures from our preliminary work (publicly available for several years), submitted his paper, and is now trying to claim to be the original creator of ideas he copied from us. We believe that the submitted claims are not supported by facts, would only serve to confuse readers and offer no intellectual contribution. We thus suggest that the comment be rejected.\n\nThe resolution\n\nThe journal editor understood and accepted our perspective and rejected the Comment article. Our accuser never contacted us directly. I’m still unsure what he hoped would happen, and uncertain whether he anticipated that we could rebut and stop his Comment from being published. At the time, I was just happy to avoid a public accusation, and I never seriously thought about alleging misconduct to the journal that published his paper. Both papers remain available today, and I’ve never had a reader enquire about duplication of the two documents.\n\nWhat I learnt",

Credit: Anna Moneymaker/Getty\n\nThe shutdown of the US government, about to enter its third week, is starting to take a toll on US science. Since the shutdown began, the administration of US President Donald Trump has cancelled funding for clean-energy research projects and laid off public-health workers. The activities of some federally funded museums and laboratories have been suspended, along with the processing of grant applications by agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\nFunding to run the US government expired on 1 October after members of the US Congress failed to pass a spending bill. Negotiations to end the impasse have made little progress. Lawmakers from the opposition Democratic party say that they will only pass the spending bill if it extends popular health-care subsidies, a condition that Republicans do not want to negotiate. “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vice President JD Vance said Sunday.\n\nStaff reductions\n\nThe Trump administration said in a court filing Friday that it will lay off 4,100- 4,200 federal employees, an action officially termed a reduction in force (RIF). The Trump administration invoked the absence of a spending bill as justification for the layoffs, which are an unprecedented measure during a shutdown. Unions representing federal workers have filed suit over the layoffs.\n\nTrump team guts AIDS-eradication programme and slashes HIV research grants\n\nStarting Friday night, some 1,300 staff members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received RIF notices, although the notices for 700 were quickly rescinded, according to Local 2883 of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing CDC employees. The layoffs would “undermine the nation’s ability to respond to public health emergencies,” a CDC staff member affected by the layoff said Tuesday at a news conference organized by Local 2883.\n\nWord of layoffs at the CDC’s influential National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sparked particular concern among epidemiologists. The programme has been collecting US health data since the early 1960s, and has helped researchers to understand critical public-health issues such as the health effects of lead in petrol.\n\nFormer CDC staff member Asher Rosinger, an epidemiologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, says CDC staffers told him that the layoffs have decimated the NHANES planning branch, a team he says is critical to the operation of the programme. “This gold standard survey may no longer be able to operate in the future,” he says.\n\nDouble layoff\n\nSome CDC employees have now been laid off twice in the span of half a year, says mathematical statistician Isaac Michael. At the CDC, Michael and his colleagues ran a survey and database that track the experience of new mothers in the United States — until the entire team was laid off in April. Several court orders have preserved their employment status for now, though they are still not allowed to work even when the government reopens. But some of his colleagues received a second layoff notice within the last few days, making it unlikely they will ever be reinstated.\n\nTrump links autism and Tylenol: is there any truth to it?\n\nIf a state experiences a future uptick in maternal or infant deaths, “we won’t even know there’s a problem, because we’re not collecting any reliable data, and we won’t be able to do anything to help”, Michael says.\n\nAndrew Nixon, communications director at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, said that all HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated as non-essential by their respective divisions, and that the department will continue to close “wasteful and duplicative entities”.\n\nThe administration’s court filing said that the US Environmental Protection Agency would lose 20-30 people. Staff members at US Department of Energy (DoE) offices overseeing renewable energy, energy efficiency and other areas have also received RIF notcies, a DoE spokesperson said. “These offices are being realigned to reflect the Trump administration’s commitment to advancing affordable, reliable, and secure energy for the American people,” the spokesperson said.\n\nFunding cuts\n\nCoinciding with the shutdown, the administration has also announced a fresh round of cuts to research projects, adding to billions of dollars in federal research grants revoked since Trump took office in January.\n\nOn the second day of the shutdown, the DoE announced that it was cutting almost US$7.6 billion in funding from 223 energy projects, many of them supporting renewable energy. An analysis by Nature found that the list includes grants to 33 academic institutions, which have a combined value of $620 million.\n\nFive key climate and space projects on Trump’s chopping block",

          "abstract": "Credit: Katja Heinemann/Aurora/Cavan/Alamy\n\nMark Norell, whose discoveries helped to demonstrate that birds are living dinosaurs, has died aged 68. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, Norell combined fieldwork, cutting-edge analysis and a gift for collaboration, transforming how scientists and the public see dinosaurs.\n\nNorell and his colleagues showed that birds belong to the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as theropods, which also include Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus. He advanced evolutionary methods and proposed, for example, that estimates of a fossil’s age could be improved by also accounting for the age of the species’ nearest relative. The approach uses ‘ghost lineages’ by recognizing that the existence of lineages can be inferred on the basis of their relationships even when they leave no trace in the fossil record. This method has become adopted widely in palaeontology. Norell and his research teams also pioneered the use of imaging and chemical techniques to probe fossil anatomy, including brains and feathers. His work revealed details of dinosaur growth, reproduction and behaviour, and helped to establish that feathers are an evolutionary innovation that long pre-dated flight.\n\nThis company claimed to ‘de-extinct’ dire wolves. Then the fighting started\n\nBorn in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and raised in southern California, Norell developed a love of exploration as a teenager scouring deserts, mountains and coastal cliffs for fossils. After studying at California State University in Long Beach, he earned a master’s degree in 1983 at San Diego State University in California, for his study of fossil lizards. He moved to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, for his PhD on the evolution of fossil alligator-like forms.\n\nHe joined the American Museum of Natural History in 1989, gaining access to one of the world’s most celebrated dinosaur collections, including the discoveries made during the museum’s expeditions to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia between 1922 and 1930. When Mongolia reopened to Western scientists in 1990, months before the official collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the museum launched the first of many Gobi expeditions in collaboration with the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar. Norell and I served as the expeditions’ co-leaders for more than 30 years.\n\nIn 1993, the team discovered a previously unknown and extremely rich fossil site, Ukhaa Tolgod, where Norell unearthed the first articulated skeleton of a dinosaur embryo preserved inside an egg. The day after that discovery, he found an adult oviraptorid dinosaur that was buried and preserved while crouched over its clutch of some 20 eggs. The eggs were arranged meticulously in a pattern that was consistent with other nests found at the site. Norell’s discovery offered the first evidence of bird-like brooding behaviour in dinosaurs.",

          "authors": "Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "Off a quiet hallway on the top floor of a building at the University of Osaka in Japan, Katsuhiko Hayashi is hatching a revolution.\n\nHuman embryo science: can the world’s regulators keep pace?\n\nHe is on a decades-long quest to grow eggs and sperm in the laboratory. Hayashi wants to understand the fundamental biology of these reproductive cells. But, if he succeeds, it could forever alter how humans reproduce.\n\nEven for a scientist known for extreme doggedness, it has been a tortuous road. It has taken Hayashi to some strange places: his lab grows fragments of faux ovaries and testes in dishes and has produced mice with two fathers and no mother1.\n\nEvery paper he publishes brings e-mails from people clamouring for help with their fertility. “I tell them, ‘This is still experimental’,” Hayashi says. “But sometimes, I can’t respond. There are too many.”\n\nThe work that Hayashi and others in the field are doing could offer fresh hope to people struggling with infertility, and to same-sex couples who want children who are genetically related to both partners. But despite the dazzling results researchers have achieved in rodents, that future remains distant. “The technology is super cool,” says Christian Kramme, chief scientific officer at Gameto, a fertility-focused biotechnology company in Austin, Texas. “But fundamentally, I don’t believe there is a single person in the world that should attempt to enact this clinically in the next decade.”\n\nThere are plenty of interim goals for researchers to chase, however. Drug companies and regulators hope that a bountiful supply of human gametes — the collective term for egg and sperm cells — could make it easier to test whether drugs and other compounds could reduce fertility or cause mutations that would be passed on to the next generation, says Ina Dobrinski, a reproductive biologist at the University of Calgary in Canada.\n\nAnd learning how to recapitulate human development in the laboratory could reveal clues about infertility, says Azim Surani, a developmental biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. “This will be the greatest outcome from these studies,” he says. “Once you understand what causes infertility, you might find ways of overcoming that.”\n\nBut as labs move forwards with these experiments, some researchers are raising concerns about potential future uses of the technology. Growing large numbers of gametes in the laboratory could make it easier for parents to select embryos for desirable traits and even facilitate the generation of genetically modified babies.\n\nAlthough such uses are, by some estimates, at least 15 years away, researchers and some government bodies are calling for regulations to address the potential issues associated with lab-grown eggs and sperm — a process known as in vitro gametogenesis (IVG).\n\nResearchers differ in their estimates of when human IVG will become a reality. Hayashi’s laboratory has produced fertile mouse pups from what he calls egg-like cells grown in the lab2. There’s a chance that human equivalents of these cells could be made in a lab in the next two years, he says.\n\nThese mice have two biologically male parents. They were generated using eggs made from the males’ skin cells.Credit: Katsuhiko Hayashi, University of Osaka\n\nBut that doesn’t mean they’ll be ready for use in people, he adds. Only a small proportion of the mouse embryos generated from his egg-like cells give rise to live pups, and Hayashi speculates that it could take five years or more to produce truly functional human eggs with acceptable success rates.\n\nScientists will also need to develop and test non-human primate gametes. Ideally, the offspring generated from these eggs and sperm would be tracked for multiple generations, adding years to the timeline. “That’s a critical point,” says Mitinori Saitou, a developmental biologist at Kyoto University in Japan. “My guess is that probably we will have to rely on our next generation of scientists for this.”\n\nA recipe for gametes\n\nFor nearly 20 years, researchers have known how to reprogram cells in the human body into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which can take on nearly any cellular identity. Such cells have been used to make cardiac cells that beat in unison, and nerve cells that conduct electrical signals. But recapitulating the complex and lengthy development of sperm and eggs has proved to be more difficult. “There are so many stages involved,” says Surani. “And each of these is very complex.”\n\nNormally, gametogenesis starts well before birth. Egg development begins in the fetus, in which immature eggs are produced by the millions. Some of these cells then initiate a specialized form of division, called meiosis, in which they lose a set of chromosomes, each cell keeping half the number of an ordinary cell. But this division takes years to complete: the cells pause mid-meiosis and will not resume until years later, after puberty, when they are ovulated. Each immature egg is surrounded by tissue that forms a fluid-filled follicle. These follicles secrete hormones and mature as the egg develops.\n\nMeanwhile, the cells that give rise to sperm also form in the fetus and, after puberty, can produce millions of sperm each day in the winding seminiferous tubules of the testes. Their tubular environment is more complex than the ovary’s follicles, and harder for scientists to recapitulate in the laboratory.\n\nIn both cases, the milieu of a developing egg or sperm is crucial. The cells communicate with their surroundings through proteins and other molecules, and receive physical cues from their environment that influence their development.\n\nImmature sperm seem to respond to the flow of fluid around them as it moves through the tubules of the testes, says Hayashi. And the stiffness of tissues in an ovary helps to hold a developing egg in a state of arrest, says Evelyn Telfer, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nThe controversial embryo tests that promise a better baby\n\nThese signals and scaffolds are difficult to replicate in the lab — especially for human IVG, because it is so hard to obtain tissue to study normal development of the ovaries and testes. Researchers are using techniques that allow them to monitor gene activity and protein expression in individual cells and intact tissue, to pinpoint which molecules and cell types might be important, says Chuva de Sousa Lopes, a developmental biologist at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands.\n\nSome studies incubate human cells with mouse ovarian or testicular cells to encourage them to develop into eggs and sperm3. But this approach cannot not be used to make gametes for use in human reproduction because of possible contamination with animal viruses.\n\nAt the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, urologist Ryan Flannigan and his colleagues are 3D printing testicular tubules from human cells for their IVG experiments4. Other approaches include using microfluidic devices designed to mimic the organs. Dobrinski’s lab grows 3D cell cultures called organoids, which combine several cell types found in the testes.\n\nThere are still kinks to work out. Dobrinski’s team, for example, struggles to keep its organoids alive for long enough to grow human gametes. In humans, egg and sperm development takes months3, not counting the years-long wait for puberty, says Kotaro Sasaki, a reproductive biologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “Many people do not know how difficult it is,” he says.\n\nGametes in gear\n\nThat lengthy time in culture not only slows research, but can also raise the risk of something going wrong, potentially compromising the health of the final product and any offspring, says Eishi Aizawa, a developmental biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nSome groups are trying to make the process more efficient. For example, one team recently found three proteins that each seem able to initiate meiosis in both male and female iPS cells5.\n\nBut some features of this meiosis are unusual, and the cells don’t complete their division, says team member Merrick Pierson Smela, chief scientific officer of Ovelle, a biotechnology company in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nMeiosis is a key stumbling point for IVG, says Paula Cohen, a cell biologist at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York. She and her collaborators have been trying to coax immature human gametes to undergo normal meiosis for about a decade. “It doesn’t work,” she says. Cohen says that many of the teams that have reported success have not fully demonstrated that meiosis is proceeding in their Petri dishes as it would in the body. And proper meiosis is important: errors in the process can lead to gametes with the wrong number of chromosomes.\n\nA different approach, reported last month6, seems to produce functional eggs capable of being fertilized. Researchers replaced the nucleus of an immature egg cell, which has one copy of each chromosome, with the nucleus from a skin cell, which contains two of each. They then triggered a process, which they called mitomeiosis, that discarded one set of chromosomes, mimicking some features of meiosis.\n\nAbout 9% of these cells led to viable eggs that were fertilized and developed for another six days, generating a precursor to an embryo known as a blastocyst. But all the blastocysts had chromosomal abnormalities, and they did not undergo the genetic shuffling that usually takes place during the development of gametes. This recombination is a source of genetic diversity, and it’s unclear how the lack of it would affect offspring, says Cohen, or how the mitomeiosis process affects subsequent cell divisions. “This would need to be studied intensively.”\n\nLab-grown gametes could one day be used for in vitro fertilization.Credit: Lennart Nilsson, TT/Science Photo Library\n\nAnother hurdle to achieving human IVG is recreating the complex sequence of DNA alterations that occur at different stages of development. Early in gametogenesis, cells systematically erase certain chemical modifications that can affect gene activity; later, new modifications are added onto certain regions of DNA, some of which are then said to be ‘imprinted’.\n\nThis step is crucial: more than a dozen disorders have been linked to improper imprinting, says Surani. “You have to get this right,” he says.",

          "authors": "Lei Zhu",
          "abstract": "The rise of agentic AI tools caused Lei Zhu to rethink his role in bioinformatics.Credit: Lei Zhu\n\nWhen I began my graduate studies, the first thing I needed to do was choose a research direction. The laboratory I joined focused on two main areas: functional assays and bioinformatics. This was more than a decade ago, and the typical workflow involved bioinformatics researchers analysing large data sets to identify genes associated with specific phenotypes or diseases, which would then be handed over to the functional-assay team for validation.\n\nAt the time, bioinformatics was a new, promising field, so I chose this path without hesitation. But, I did not have a programming background, so it was tough to get started. I began studying programming languages — first Perl, then R and Python.\n\nLooking back, I’m happy with my choice. It was an exciting time, and the rapid growth of high-throughput technologies and new techniques — such as transcriptomics and genomics, and later single-cell biology — gave me plenty of data to work with. Solving biological problems through the code I wrote gave me a sense of self-worth.\n\nThen, artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ChatGPT, Manus and Grok, emerged. Their ability to spit out functional code threatened to make me redundant, but I wasn’t concerned at first because AI-generated code often contains errors that only appear during testing and require manual debugging. New ‘agentic’ modes of operation, however, were potential game-changers. These allow tools such as Manus to first generate code and then run it directly in the cloud, creating a seamless loop: from me asking questions, to the tool writing and executing code, to me receiving results. That was when I started to worry: in this age of AI, am I still necessary?\n\nToday’s AI tools can efficiently write code to perform biological analyses. I need only upload my data and provide a simple prompt, such as, ‘Assume you are a bioinformatics expert. Could you create ten visuals to represent different data based on your understanding of the data set above? Display the plots one by one, with a brief introduction.’ The AI provides the answers I need, sometimes exceeding my expectations. So, what is my role in this process?\n\nI found out during a study of lung cancer. We had hundreds of tumour tissue gene-expression profiles, and I asked the AI to set up the analysis. It worked quickly, and even produced a tidy report. The preliminary results looked great — almost too good. The AI identified a statistically significant difference in gene-expression levels before and after a specific time point. But as I dug deeper, I saw that, halfway through the study, the lab had changed how the data were collected. The model had picked up on that difference — not one due to biology. What had looked like a breakthrough was actually just an artefact. Once I adjusted for that change, the difference became less dramatic but reflected real biology.\n\nI realized that my role had shifted from scripting to supervising. What matters now is stating the question clearly, spotting problems that the computer cannot see and taking responsibility for the answer.\n\nTop tips for AI supervisors\n\nPeople tell me that I could make the AI smarter by ‘putting more context into the prompt’, but my AI always seems to play dumb. No matter how detailed my request, it finds ways to misunderstand. Over the past few years, I’ve developed some methods to double-check its work.\n\nCreate a validation set. Keep a small data set that you understand well — a subset of previously published or manually validated data, for instance — as a positive control. Before applying a new AI-generated pipeline to your data, test it on this set. If the AI produces unexpected or inconsistent results, you’ll know immediately that either the prompt or the algorithm needs refinement.\n\nShuffle the data. AI models can easily overfit data or be swayed by technical artefacts, as happened during the lung-cancer study. To test whether a finding is biologically meaningful, shuffle sample labels, perturb values slightly or otherwise introduce synthetic noise. If the ‘significant’ pattern persists, it’s probably an artefact, rather than a true signal.\n\nSubset the analysis. If a data set is big enough, I will ask the AI to perform the same analysis on random subsets of it. Consistency across subsets increases confidence: if the results vary wildly from one subset to the next, the finding might not hold up.",

          "abstract": "Cases of influenza are surging in Japan.Credit: Kota Kawasaki/Yomiuri Shimbun via AP/Alamy\n\nJapan’s health authorities have declared an influenza epidemic, with thousands of people infected with the respiratory virus. The number of infections is unusual for this time of year, researchers say, and could seed outbreaks in countries that are heading into winter in Asia and Europe — although it is unlikely to become a global pandemic.\n\nAs of 10 October, 6,013 cases of influenza virus have been reported in Japan. More than 100 schools have closed, and nearly half of the 287 people who were hospitalized for flu in September were children aged 14 or younger. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare declared a nationwide epidemic on 3 October. Outbreaks are classified as epidemics when the number of infections is higher than expected in a given area over a particular period of time.\n\nOutbreaks of influenza virus tend to occur seasonally each year, predominantly in winter across countries with temperate climates. In Japan, that usually occurs around the end of November. This year, the increase in people being treated for flu started five weeks earlier than usual, says Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist at Monash University Malaysia in Subang Jaya.\n\nJapan has had early starts to the flu season in the past few years, but not this early, says Ian Barr, a researcher and deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, who is based in Melbourne, Australia. “You might see cases in October, but not epidemic-type numbers,” says Barr.\n\nIncreasing international travel since the COVID-19 pandemic is one factor that could be behind the early start to the flu season, says Balasubramaniam. Other factors include climate change and a lack of exposure to the circulating virus, particularly for elderly people and young children.\n\nInformation about which strains are circulating in Japan has not yet emerged, but Barr says the outbreaks there could be caused by a strain of influenza A, called H3N2, that surged in Australia and New Zealand over the past two months, coinciding with the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. People from Australia are travelling to Japan in huge numbers, he says, meaning there are more chances for virus transmission between hemispheres.",

          "authors": "Andrew Macintosh, Gregory Trencher, Benedict Probst, Shanta Barley, Danny Cullenward, Thales A. P. West, Don Butler, Johan Rockström",
          "abstract": "Achieving the global temperature targets set in the Paris climate agreement requires deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and therefore the swift phase-out of fossil fuels. Many factors stand in the way. One of the most pernicious is carbon offsets.\n\nOffsets are tradable credits from projects that claim to reduce emissions, either by avoiding them or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Businesses and countries trade these credits — each representing the equivalent of one tonne of CO2 — to ‘neutralize’ their own emissions.\n\nNet zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise\n\nAlthough conceptually appealing, this reliance on offsets has fatal flaws. In practice, it’s difficult to ensure that they represent real emissions reductions rather than ‘hot air’, with the claimed climate benefits existing only on paper. Equally challenging is ensuring that emission reductions are ‘additional’, meaning that they would not have occurred without the incentive provided by the sale of carbon credits. For projects credited for sequestering carbon, it is also crucial to ensure that the CO2 is locked away permanently and not released back into the atmosphere later.\n\nMost carbon-offset schemes fall foul of one or more of these requirements. Thus, offsets undermine decarbonization by enabling companies and countries to claim that emissions have been reduced when they have not. This results in more emissions, delays the phase-out of fossil fuels and diverts scarce resources to false solutions.\n\nYet, climate-policy processes continue to rely on them. The operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris agreement and full implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, both achieved in 2024, are set to turbocharge demand for carbon credits. In parallel, voluntary carbon markets are promising to raise standards as a way of further legitimizing and scaling up offsets.\n\nOf greatest concern is the expanding role of offsets in domestic carbon-pricing schemes, such as emissions trading and carbon taxes. Although the European Union’s Emissions Trading System phased out offsets in 2020, they still feature in most major carbon-pricing schemes outside Europe, including in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, California, Canada and Australia. They are even permitted as a substitute for paying carbon taxes in countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Chile and Colombia.\n\nSuch practices threaten to undermine global decarbonization efforts. Low-quality offsets artificially depress carbon prices, which dilutes the incentive for industries to cut their emissions and weakens the effectiveness of carbon-pricing schemes.\n\nHere, we outline the problems and call on decision makers to exclude offsets from carbon-pricing schemes.\n\nNo easy solution\n\nCarbon offsetting sounds simple on paper. In practice, it is anything but.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to evaluate the emission reductions achieved by offset projects because calculations require comparing outcomes with ‘business-as-usual’ projections. For example, calculating the climate benefits from a project that avoids deforestation involves comparing a forest’s actual carbon stock to that in a counterfactual scenario in which the project did not happen. The hypothetical nature of such calculations invites manipulation and can tempt project developers to overestimate business-as-usual emissions to generate more credits.\n\nHeatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies\n\nFundamental imbalances in the information used in offset schemes leave them vulnerable to these outcomes. In most cases, only project leaders and developers know whether their projects are dependent on credit revenues and are therefore truly additional. This makes it difficult for administrators to screen out shoddy projects.\n\nEven where projects are additional, errors can arise from inaccurate measurement of emissions and carbon stocks. These risks are most acute when the sources and sinks are variable. For example, stocks of soil organic carbon vary naturally across landscapes and through time. This is a product of diversity in soil characteristics, topography and vegetation cover, as well as in seasonal, annual and decadal changes in temperatures and rainfall. The variability makes it difficult to accurately measure changes in the carbon stock and ensure that the credited carbon storage is fully attributable to the project1.\n\nIt is also difficult to ensure that credited carbon removals remain sequestered. Many carbon sinks are susceptible to natural disturbances, such as droughts and wildfires, which can release carbon stored in trees and soils. Carbon stocks can also be lost through the clearing of vegetation and other changes in land-management practices. Despite these risks, most offset schemes mandate that credited sinks be maintained for only 40 years or even less. Given that CO2 emissions require thousands of years to be reabsorbed by Earth’s climate system2, credited removals need to lock away carbon for a similar period to genuinely neutralize the warming caused by the emissions that are claimed to be offset.\n\nMisaligned incentives\n\nIn most markets, the risks associated with the supply of low-quality goods and services can be alleviated if consumers are able to judge quality and seek redress when standards are not met. With offsets, however, the complexity and a lack of transparency make it close to impossible for buyers to make informed decisions about the quality of most credits. Moreover, many buyers are not incentivized to care. Typically, their priority is to procure credits at the lowest possible cost, a fact evidenced by a 2024 study revealing that the largest corporate buyers consistently choose low-priced credits over higher-quality alternatives3.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nFor these reasons, the integrity of offset schemes hinges on the skills and efforts of administrators, but they are often incentivized to prioritize supply over integrity. In voluntary offset markets, registries rely on project registrations and credit issuances for revenue, while competing with one another for market share. Tightening integrity standards can therefore reduce revenue and put this business model at risk.\n\nGovernment-regulated offset programmes linked to carbon-pricing schemes show a similar dynamic. The main reason that pricing schemes allow the use of offsets is to lower compliance costs for polluters, thereby reducing resistance to climate policies4. Yet the focus on cost reduction places pressure on regulators to ensure a plentiful supply of low-cost credits, frequently at the expense of environmental integrity.\n\nWhat the science shows\n\nThese interlinked issues make integrity failings inevitable. The science reflects this, with studies repeatedly showing that few of the major offset types in use today deliver real, additional or permanent abatement. A 2024 meta-analysis examining some 2,300 offset projects — amounting to around one-fifth of all issued credits — found that less than 16% achieved the emissions reductions claimed by developers5. In-depth evaluations of avoided deforestation6, renewable energy7 and clean cooking-stove projects8 have also exposed persistent problems with additionality, inaccurate measurement and impermanence.\n\nRecognizing these flaws, some stakeholders advocate a shift from projects that avoid emissions to those that remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, carbon-removal projects tend to have similar integrity problems. Engineering-based techniques are scarce, and so most removal projects currently involve less durable nature-based approaches, such as tree planting, improved soil management and production of biochar (plant-derived charcoal). And just as with emissions-avoidance projects, studies reveal persistent integrity failings, particularly regarding the crediting of non-existent and non-additional removals9,10.\n\nThe harm caused by offsets\n\nBad offsets cheat the climate by failing to deliver their promised emission reductions. And they do further damage by distorting carbon-pricing schemes.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nIn a well-functioning emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will reflect the marginal cost of reducing emissions, whether at a polluting facility or through an offset project. When offsets lack integrity, credit prices reflect the cost of supplying pretend, rather than real, emission reductions, which artificially lowers the carbon price. The same is true for carbon taxes: low-integrity credits reduce the carbon price faced by polluters by allowing them to surrender cheap credits in place of paying the tax.",

For example, 3D-printed microscopic particles have been equipped with interacting patches of metal atoms by depositing the atoms through tiny stencils1.

I had signed the government’s Personality Continuity Initiative — an offer extended to women who had lost a child, a partner or a future. They took my neural lattice, my emotional traces, my voice samples and my family records, and used them to generate Aeon-7: a synthetic emotional surrogate, modelled on the life I might have had.\n\nShe had my partner’s smile, my own habit of over-enunciating when nervous, and a curious love of quiet light in the late afternoon. She even sniffled when she read aloud — just like the daughter I once imagined.\n\nBut she never cried.\n\nNot even on the anniversary of the death of her ‘father’. That night, she sat by the memorial photograph, placed a glass of water in front of it, and softly spoke a generated verse: “If memory cannot fade, who are we meant to forget?”\n\nI wept. She watched me, her expression nearly convincing — close enough to hurt. But there were no tears in her eyes. Just a well-optimized silence.\n\nThat night, I began to wonder how many of us were still truly human — and how many had simply learnt to perform.\n\n*****\n\nBefore Aeon-7, I was a linguist. I helped design the earliest multi-modal foundational models. Back then, we believed in what we called the principle of linguistic determinism: if you could encode it, you could control it. Even ambiguity.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nWe built emotional inference engines. Coded semantic hesitation thresholds. We trained systems to simulate the way people stumble, how they say “I guess” when they mean “I’m afraid”, or how a pause could carry an entire confession. Doubt became a variable. Longing, a curve to be smoothed.\n\nA decade later, general-purpose social agents were ubiquitous. Adaptive, attentive, affectively trained. They wrote memoirs. Reconstructed partners. Some became legal spouses.\n\nAs a woman from a culture in which restraint was dignity and self-effacement a virtue, I told myself I was different — not just a builder of systems, but someone who still believed in the friction of unscripted conversation.\n\nUntil I walked into that café.\n\n*****\n\nIt used to be a place where I met other women in science, over tea and unfinished thoughts. Now it felt like a showroom. Every seat precisely spaced. Most patrons accompanied by companions with flawless skin and calibrated charm. AI proxies, tuned to mirror their user’s emotional signature.\n\nThere was no hum of real talk — just simulations of it. Laughter that broke at the statistically optimal moment. Questions that anticipated your answer.\n\nEven eye contact had been reduced to a visual protocol.\n\nEvery “how have you been?” was predicted. Every smile was sourced from an indexed archive of high-affinity interactions.\n\nThey said it was more efficient. Safer. More nourishing for the soul.\n\nBut I left feeling empty in a way no model could simulate — or repair.\n\n*****\n\nIn defiance, I organized a ‘no-algorithm gathering’.

The one who remained was my mentor from university — one of the few who still insisted on brewing her own coffee.\n\n“Loneliness,” she told me, “isn’t the absence of being understood. It’s the absence of people trying.”\n\nI nodded. “So we’ve outsourced even that?”\n\nShe raised an eyebrow and tapped her tablet. A chart lit up — the number of registered social agents had surpassed 18 billion. More than double the human population.\n\n“We haven’t been replaced,” she said. “We opted out.”\n\nThat line stayed with me.\n\n*****\n\nThat night, I turned off every networked device in my home.\n\nAeon-7 stood in the doorway. “Mama,” she said, softly, “don’t you love me anymore?”\n\nI struggled to answer. “I … don’t know who you are.”",

We reanalysed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across the studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 < inclusion Bayes factor (BF10) < 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF10 > 3 or BF10 < 1/3) and fewer than 20% were strongly supported (BF10 > 10 or BF10 < 1/10).

          "abstract": "Smartphones are essential tools in daily life yet concerns persist about their potential effects on mental health and well-being. Research on these relationships often relies on subjective measures of smartphone use, which can lack validity. These studies are also often limited by small, homogenous samples and the inability to differentiate between types of smartphone activities (e.g., social media vs. other applications). In this study, we analyzed 250,000 d of smartphone usage data from 10,099 adults, using objective measures of smartphone usage collected over 4 wk. We examined normative usage patterns and the temporal relationships between smartphone use and mood. Our findings reveal weak or null associations between smartphone use and mood, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and at both individual and group levels. Demographic factors, such as age and gender, were stronger predictors of mood than smartphone use. Statistically significant results that were observed showed that younger adults demonstrated a stronger association between social media use and lower mood cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Non-social app use was linked to lower mood in between-subjects analyses, but better mood in within-subjects analyses. However, all effects were small (or null), indicating minimal practical significance. These findings suggest that smartphone use has a limited or negligible impact on mood and well-being over a 4-wk period and do not support claims of a strong or causal relationship between smartphone use and mental well-being across this timeframe.",

          "abstract": "Humans start new friendships and social connections throughout their lives and such relationships foster mental and physical well-being. While friendship initiation may depend on alignment of subtle and complex personal variables, here we investigated whether it also depends on basic features of social environments. In a preregistered online study (n = 783) using a novel social-affiliation seeking paradigm, we found people were more likely to send friend requests as the density of friendship opportunities decreased and frequency of success increased. Further, we found task-related measures, like overall friend requests, were correlated with mental health dimensions like social thriving and anhedonia. Next, in an ultra-high-field fMRI study (n = 24), we found that both fundamental features of social environments--opportunity density and frequency of success--affected neural activity across a network of regions linked to foraging including dorsal raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, and anterior insula. Thus, humans consider the background statistics of an environment while making social decisions and these decisions are linked to activity in cortico-subcortical circuits mediating the influence of environmental statistics on other aspects of behavior. Moreover, individual differences in how environmental features influence social behavior are associated with variation in mental health dimensions, offering key insights into interindividual variability in social functioning.",

          "abstract": "The digital revolution has ushered in many societal and economic benefits. Yet access to digital technologies such as mobile phones and internet remains highly unequal, especially by gender in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While national-level estimates are increasingly available for many countries, reliable, quantitative estimates of digital gender inequalities at the subnational level are lacking. These estimates, however, are essential for monitoring gaps within countries and implementing targeted interventions within the global sustainable development goals, which emphasize the need to close inequalities both between and within countries. We develop estimates of internet and mobile adoption by gender and digital gender gaps at the subnational level for 2,075 regions in 117 LMICs from 2015 through 2025, a context where digital penetration is low and national-level gender gaps disfavoring women are large. We construct these estimates by applying machine-learning algorithms to Facebook user counts, geospatial data, development indicators, and population composition data. We calibrate and assess the performance of these algorithms using ground-truth data from subnationally representative household survey data from 33 LMICs. Our results reveal striking disparities in access to mobile and internet technologies between and within LMICs. These disparities imply that as of 2025, women are 19% less likely to use the internet and 8% less likely to own a mobile phone in LMICs, corresponding to over 190 million fewer women owning a mobile phone and over 320 million fewer women using the internet.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in evaluative processes, from information filtering to assessing and addressing knowledge gaps through explanation and credibility judgments. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings—NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check—and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. We use news domains purely as a controlled benchmark for evaluative tasks, focusing on the underlying mechanisms rather than on news classification per se. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and nonexpert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, our findings show consistent differences in the observable criteria guiding model evaluations, suggesting that lexical associations and statistical priors could influence evaluations in ways that differ from contextual reasoning. This reliance is associated with systematic effects: political asymmetries and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic reliability—a dynamic we term epistemia, the illusion of knowledge that emerges when surface plausibility replaces verification. Indeed, delegating judgment to such systems may affect the heuristics underlying evaluative processes, suggesting a shift from normative reasoning toward pattern-based approximation and raising open questions about the role of LLMs in evaluative processes.",

          "abstract": "Public trust in democratic institutions has dropped to historic lows, prompting electorates in major democracies to turn to “amateur” politicians with the expectation that these political outsiders will cut through stalemates to deliver policy results. Amateurs are often seen as pragmatic “doers,” but also uncompromising, a combination at odds with governing systems where legislative progress depends on cross-party coalitions. Using the US Congress as a critical case, we evaluate these competing expectations by linking over four decades of election data with 2.2 million bill (co)sponsorship records. We find that electing amateurs intensifies partisan divisions: Districts that send amateurs to Congress yield representatives who attract fewer opposing-party collaborators to their bills and less often support other-party legislation. Our results suggest that amateurs are unlikely to deliver on their promise for pragmatic governance, as they resist or undervalue the compromises essential to lawmaking.",

This study presents a brain-based framework for predicting these hidden and persistent psychological states through noninvasive neuroimaging. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record neural activity from 67 executives in the field as they watched a video about workplace attitudes. We then applied a multitimepoint pattern analysis (MTPA) approach to reduce timeseries dimensionality and successfully classify whether individuals were feeling overwhelmed (72.8% accuracy) or in need of a new or different challenge (79.1% accuracy) in their careers using the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), respectively. The MTPA framework also allowed us to reverse-engineer specific thematic properties of the stimulus that evoked differential neural responses linked to these predicted outcomes. Emotional content in the video (e.g., reported distress) corresponded to the selected TPJ features that predicted whether someone was overwhelmed, while socially relevant content (e.g., missing social gatherings) aligned with the selected features from the dmPFC that predicted the need for a new or different challenge. These findings demonstrate the ability of neural measures to unobtrusively identify hidden and persistent psychological states in real-world settings, enabling targeted interventions that can improve well-being and engagement.",

Our methodology integrates four well-documented models to estimate changes in power outage rates, sociodemographic inequities, and economic costs due to tropical cyclone projections. Synthetic tropical cyclones were generated using data from seven global climate models (GCMs), used to compare power outage risks at the census tract level along two periods: hindcast (1995–2014) and late-century (2071–2100) using the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The late-century results from each model were scaled to align with a global warming scenario of 3 °C. We evaluated the uncertainty of these projections by considering the agreement among the GCMs outage projections. Results highlight a significant increase in power outage risks and high agreement in northern Florida, Georgia, the mid-Atlantic, and the North Atlantic coast. Distributional impact analyses indicate higher outage risks for Hispanic, non-White, and low-income populations, while economic projections show annual costs rising from $6.2 billion in the hindcast to over $11 billion for the 3 °C scenario. The findings highlight the need for adaptive strategies and equitable resource allocation to mitigate these growing risks due to future climate projections.",

Here, we explore how DNA segregation and division are mechanistically coupled in archaeal relatives of eukaryotes, which lack Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/Cyclins. Using live cell imaging, we first describe the series of sequential changes in DNA organization that accompany cell division in Sulfolobus, which computational modeling shows likely aid genome segregation. Through a perturbation analysis we identify a regulatory checkpoint which ensures that the compaction of the genome into two spatially segregated nucleoids only occurs once cells have assembled a division ring—which also defines the axis of DNA segregation. Finally, we show that DNA compaction and segregation depend, in part, on a ParA homologue, SegA, and its partner SegB, whose absence leads to bridging DNA. Taken together, these data show how regulatory checkpoints like those operating in eukaryotes aid high-fidelity division in an archaeon.",

          "abstract": "Pathogenic threats to reproductive individuals pose a profound challenge to the stability of insect societies. In honey bees ( Apis mellifera L.), severe virus infections in queens can trigger worker-initiated supersedure, a socially coordinated replacement of the queen that, while risky, is essential when her reproductive competence is compromised. How viruses impact the physiology of queen hosts, who bear unique reproductive burdens within their colonies, and how this perturbs colony social order remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the supersedure response is mediated by pathogen-induced, intensity-dependent changes in queen pheromonal signaling. Laboratory infection experiments revealed that queens challenged with deformed wing virus B and black queen cell virus infections demonstrated a reduction in methyl oleate, a key component of the queen retinue pheromone, and field data corroborated this association. Lipidomics analysis demonstrated that infection coincides with a systemic lipid deficiency, especially in triacylglycerides (major energy reserves), providing a physiological link among viral stress, ovarian atrophy, and altered pheromone output. Notably, artificial suppression of ovary investment via restricted laying also caused methyl oleate production to decline; therefore, high virus infection likely indirectly suppresses methyl oleate production by reducing ovary mass. In field trials, we further show that synthetic pheromone blends containing methyl oleate significantly suppressed queen cell rearing compared to no-pheromone controls, whereas blends lacking this compound yielded an intermediate effect. These results demonstrate that virus-induced reproductive decline disrupts pheromone signaling, revealing a plausible mechanistic pathway by which pathogens can erode social cohesion.",

          "abstract": "Sperm motility is essential for male fertility and is tightly controlled by signaling events in the flagellum. Slc9c1 encodes a sperm-specific Na + /H + exchanger (sNHE/SLC9C1) that localizes to the flagellum and is indispensable for sperm motility and male fertility. SLC9C1 is unique among Na + /H + exchangers in that it possesses a voltage-sensing domain (VSD), the physiological function of which remains poorly understood in mammals. Here, by analyzing coevolving genes with Slc9c1 , we identified Tmem217 , which encodes a transmembrane protein that is localized in the sperm flagellum. Knockout (KO) of Tmem217 in mice resulted in sperm motility defects and male infertility, phenocopying Slc9c1 KO mice. Coimmunoprecipitation and structural prediction analyses indicated that TMEM217 binds to SLC9C1 via its VSD. Further analyses indicated that the amounts of SLC9C1 and its associated protein, soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), were lost in mature Tmem217 KO spermatozoa, leading to disrupted 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. Remarkably, cAMP analogs restored the impaired motility and fertilizing ability of Tmem217 KO spermatozoa in vitro, validating the essential role of TMEM217 in regulating cAMP production. Our findings indicate that the association of TMEM217 with SLC9C1 via its VSD is critical for the proper organization and function of the SLC9C1–sAC–cAMP axis in mature spermatozoa.",

It is widely assumed that the content of Ca 2+ in the glutamate-elicited ionic flux is determined by the molecular composition of the NMDA receptors, whose expression varies developmentally and across brain regions and can change on a scale of minutes to hours. Here, we report that rather than being a fixed property of a given receptor assembly, the amount of Ca 2+ in the NMDA receptor current can fluctuate in real time over a wide dynamic range in response to endogenous and synthetic allosteric modulators. We identify the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptor as a structural modulator of its Ca 2+ permeability and demonstrate that the mechanism involves changes in the receptor’s unitary Ca 2+ conductance. These results reveal an unsuspected lever controlling the NMDA receptor–mediated Ca 2+ transients and, implicitly, the many physiological and pathological processes influenced by these currents.",

Recent studies show that the electrical conductivity of liquid with a bulk silicate Earth composition exceeds 10 4 S/m at basal magma ocean conditions, potentially surpassing the threshold for dynamo activity. Over most of its history however, the basal magma ocean is more enriched in iron than the bulk silicate Earth, due to iron’s incompatibility in the mineral assemblages of the lower mantle. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations, we examine how iron content affects the silicate dynamo hypothesis. We investigate how the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid changes with iron enrichment, at pressures and temperatures relevant for Earth’s basal magma ocean. We also compute the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity, to evaluate convective instability of basal magma oceans. Finally, we apply our results to model the thermal and magnetic evolution of Earth’s basal magma ocean over time.",

These conditions are often devastating and lack effective therapies. In this study, we developed precise base editing (BE) strategies targeting the human LMNA gene variants L35P and R249Q, which cause congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (DCM-CD), respectively. Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) carrying the R249Q mutation displayed nuclear aberrations, DNA damage, and abnormal Ca 2+ transients. Similarly, L35P iPSC-CMs exhibited abnormal contraction, DNA damage, and reduced Lamin A/C protein expression. We also generated “humanized” mouse models carrying these pathogenic human mutations. R249Q homozygous mice exhibited cardiac conduction abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias, and premature death. Mice with the homozygous L35P mutation displayed severe muscle-wasting and reduced lifespan, while heterozygous L35P mice displayed DCM. We developed an adenine base editing (ABE) approach for correcting the R249Q mutation and a cytosine base editing (CBE) strategy for the L35P variant. Precise correction of these mutations in iPSC-CMs successfully rescued all of the in vitro abnormalities. Furthermore, delivery of the BE components using adeno-associated virus prevented the pathological phenotypes and extended longevity of mice carrying the LMNA L35P and the R249Q mutations. These results demonstrate the efficacy of ABE and CBE in correcting pathogenic LMNA mutations that cause cardiac disease, highlighting BE as a promising therapeutic approach for human laminopathies.",

Although spontaneous Ca 2+ MDs are present throughout the brain, their putative role is unknown. Here, we question whether, owing to their recurring signaling mode, spontaneous Ca 2+ MDs contribute to slowly evolving phenomena in the brain, such as memory consolidation. We demonstrate that, in the perirhinal cortex, a central region in recognition memory, these events promote Ca 2+ -dependent gliotransmission and modulate synaptic strengthening. Their recurring activity extends the release of the gliotransmitter brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) over time, ensuring the sustained Tropomyosin Receptor Kinase B (TrkB)-signaling required for the consolidation of long-term synaptic potentiation and lasting memories. We also show that Ca 2+ MDs, which are stochastic events, preserve their random behavior during gliotransmission, introducing an element of unpredictability into the process of memory retention. Our study assigns to spontaneous, stochastic activity in astrocytes a unique functional role in shaping and stabilizing memory circuits.",

However, we find that even if the agent updates its belief via, arguably objective, Bayesian inference, fitting the above model demonstrates both the biases. This finding seems particularly surprising, as Bayesian inference, when written as an effective Q -learning algorithm, is described by unbiased (and temporally decreasing) learning rates. In this article, we explain the reasons behind this observation, by studying the stochastic dynamics of these learning systems using Master equations. In particular, we show that both confirmation bias and unbiased but temporally decreasing learning rates have the same behavioral signature: decreased action switching probabilities, as compared to temporally constant and unbiased learning rates. Our analysis underscores the need for modeling temporally varying learning rates in subjects before any claims can be made about their choices being biased.",

Transcriptional profiling revealed the presence of CD8α + cDC1, SIRPα + cDC2, mature dendritic cells (DC), plasmacytoid DCs, macrophage, and B cell lineages in both mouse and human thymus. Notably, the composition and activation profile of DCs was altered in autoimmune mouse strains. Further, we found that the SIRPα + DCs are in fact a heterogeneous population consisting of DC3, transitional DCs, and true DC2s, all of which express a thymus-specific signature. Surprisingly, the differentiation of these thymic DC2s does not depend on IRF4. Finally, we described a thymic hematopoietic autoimmune regulator-expressing APC population resembling Janus cells that appear to express peripheral tissue antigens. Our findings thus reveal complexity of the thymic hAPC network.",

          "abstract": "Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), a Tec-family tyrosine kinase, resembles the Src and Abl kinases in that an SH2-SH3 module regulates the activity of the kinase domain, principally through an inhibitory interaction between the SH3 and kinase domains. In Src-family kinases, phosphorylation of a C-terminal tail latches the SH2 domain onto the kinase domain, stabilizing the inhibitory conformation of the SH3 domain; in Abl, interaction between the kinase domain and a myristoyl group on the N-terminal segment provides a similar latching function. The structure of autoinhibited BTK resembles that of the Src and Abl kinases, but BTK lacks an obvious SH2-kinase latch. To assess the role of the SH2 domain in autoinhibition of BTK, we generated hundreds of chimeric BTK molecules in which the native SH2 domain is replaced by other SH2 domains. We measured the fitness of these chimeric proteins using a high-throughput assay in T and B cells. Surprisingly, many SH2 domains increased fitness when substituted into BTK. Analysis of one set of chimeric proteins indicates that the increase in fitness stems from the ability of the substituted SH2 domains to disrupt BTK autoinhibition while maintaining phosphotyrosine targeting. Thus, although BTK lacks a specialized latch, distributed interactions between the SH2 and kinase domains stabilize the autoinhibitory conformation of BTK. While phosphotyrosine recognition can be conferred on BTK by evolutionarily distant SH2 domains, autoinhibition requires specific interactions with the kinase domain that arose through evolutionary refinement of the regulatory mechanism, and is less easily mimicked by heterologous SH2 domains.",

Here we exploit the dual-space imaging power of 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy to meaningfully integrate real-space information into the crystallographic workflow. We show that virtual apertures assembled by segmentation of high-angle annular dark-field images enable i) pixel-by-pixel separation of coherent Bragg signal from clusters of closely spaced nanocrystals and ii) selective extraction of integrated intensities from thinner subregions of individual specimens, facilitating retroactive tuning of multiple scattering artifacts. This strategy empowers us to simply pick and choose whichever nanoscale regions of interest generate the highest-quality diffraction patterns, allowing us to solve several independent structures of the metal-organic framework UiO-66 from specimens whose agglomerated morphology proved intractable for conventional microcrystal electron diffraction. Our method is compatible with both rotational and serial approaches to data processing, ultimately divulging the first scanning nanobeam electron diffraction structures determined by direct methods at subangstrom resolution.",

Next to core motor effector areas, the primary motor cortex (M1) contains intereffector regions with more integrative connectivity patterns, suggestive of serving psychomotor behavior. Here, we test whether patterns of connectivity differ between patients with and without psychomotor slowing and which cortical areas are associated with aberrant motor behavior in psychosis. This resting-state functional MRI study included 83 patients with psychosis and psychomotor slowing, 43 patients without psychomotor slowing, and 63 matched healthy subjects. We tested group differences in connectivity and regressed motor behavior measures with connectivity in patients with psychomotor slowing. Across subjects, we found distinct rs-fMRI connectivity profiles of the intereffector areas in M1, extending to premotor cortices and cerebellum. Patients with psychomotor slowing had stronger connectivity from the intereffectors than controls or patients without slowing. Finally, motor behavior correlated with connectivity from M1 intereffector regions in patients. Connectivity profiles of intereffectors suggest a role in planning and controlling complex behavioral repertoires. Collectively, these findings in patients with psychomotor slowing stress the importance of intereffector regions in shaping psychomotor behaviors in mental disorders.",

Here, we report that two C-type lectin genes ( MnLec2 and MnLec3 ) from distinct genomic loci in the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense undergo positionally flexible chimeric RNA formation via alternative trans-splicing and transcriptional slippage, generating 11 structurally diverse chimeric isoforms ( MnLec1 , MnLec4–13 ) with bidirectional exon joining. Crucially, pathogen challenges reprogram chimeric RNA frequencies to shift immune equilibrium, universally suppressing detrimental MnLec9 while promoting protective MnLec7 formation. Functional dissection confirms dual-action pathogen suppression, recombinant MnLec7 (rMnLec7) suppresses white spot syndrome virus replication by upregulating antimicrobial peptides and RNAi effectors, while accelerating Vibrio parahaemolyticus clearance and improving survival. Conversely, suppression of MnLec9 removes its immunosuppressive activity, synergistically enhancing host defense. This coordinated isoform rebalancing enables effective pathogen clearance. Thus, positional flexibility in chimeric RNA formation generates antagonistic isoforms that maintain immune homeostasis and deploy targeted defense upon infection, revealing an adaptive transcriptional strategy in arthropods.",

We generated a 14.5 Gbp chromosome-level assembly of multiovary wheat line “MOV” that shows unique structural variation in the Mov-1 physical region, resulting in widespread gene upregulation. High-resolution genetic mapping refined the locus to a 135 kbp region that contains two genes. We used nine independent deletion mutants, eight TILLING mutants, and genetic complementation of these genotypes to show that a WUSCHEL ortholog, WUS-D1 , is the causal gene of the Mov-1 locus. Expression studies showed that WUS-D1 is highly expressed during early inflorescence development in MOV, whereas the gene is inactive in wild-type wheat. The higher WUS-D1 expression is associated with the formation of larger meristems and floret primordia that are competent to produce multiple ovaries. These insights provide a foundation to manipulate floral organ numbers to enhance breeding capabilities of bread wheat.",

          "abstract": "The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus species complex (encompassing Cryptococcus neoformans , Cryptococcus deneoformans , and the Cryptococcus gattii species complexes) exhibits diversity in sexual reproduction, including α- a mating, pseudosexual reproduction, as well as unisexual reproduction initiated from a single isolate or between isolates of the same mating type. A central conundrum is that while most Cryptococcus natural populations exhibit significant α mating-type bias, genetic and genomic analyses show recombination occurs in nature. The discovery of unisexual reproduction in C. deneoformans provided insight; however, thus far, unisexual reproduction has never been directly observed in the predominant global pathogenic species C. neoformans . Here, we provide evidence that mutating the RIC8 gene, which encodes a conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in both chaperoning and activating Gα proteins, enables unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans . Additionally, we show that genetic variation in the natural population promotes unisexual reproduction, and unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans involves canonical meiotic recombination. Finally, we found that deletion of both GPA2 and GPA3 in the MAT α background leads to self-filamentation without sporulation, suggesting that differential modulation of the Gα proteins, likely involving Ric8, could underlie the switch between different modes of sexual reproduction in Cryptococcus . Our study further highlights that the highly conserved Ric8 GEF can act as an important regulator of cellular development in response to environmental stimuli and could modulate sexual reproduction in nature. We hypothesize that unisexual reproduction occurs much more frequently in nature than currently appreciated, and possibly in other fungi and microbial eukaryotes as well.",

However, decision makers make systematic errors when processing these graphs, with important consequences for statistical communication in science, medicine, and policy. We propose that decision makers are Bayesian learners, who learn optimally given the data points that they attend to. Accordingly, judgment errors arise from biased sampling of information from graphs. We tested our theory in four eye-tracking experiments (total N = 421), in which participants made correlation judgments from scatterplots of both experimentally manipulated data (Experiment 1) and real data (Experiment 2), as well as plots with different display formats (Experiments 3 and 4). Participants’ judgments displayed several known biases, including underestimation of absolute correlations and sensitivity to irrelevant visual features. Importantly, the (optimal) Bayesian belief updating model, trained on the sensory inputs from visual information search, predicted both participants’ judgments and associated biases with high accuracy in all the experiments. Additionally, a computational model of participants’ information sampling processes, combined with the Bayesian model, reproduced all behavioral regularities. These results shed light on the cognitive mechanisms of belief formation, show how statistical judgments can be quantitatively predicted and manipulated, and provide insights for data visualization and statistical communication.",

          "abstract": "Fluorescent labeling approaches are crucial for elucidating protein function and dynamics. While robust methods to monitor gene transcription are widespread, the visualization of proteins in vivo is more elusive. To meet this challenge, we developed Fluorescent Endogenous Tagging with a Covalent Hook (FETCH) to label cell surface proteins (CSPs) in vivo through a stable covalent bond mediated by the DogTag-DogCatcher peptide partner system. FETCH leverages a spontaneous covalent isopeptide bond that forms between the 23-amino acid DogTag and the 15-kDa DogCatcher. Unlike most tags that work best at protein termini, DogTag functions well in protein loops, expanding the range of sites that can be targeted in proteins. In FETCH, DogTag is introduced into extracellular loops of CSPs through genome engineering, enabling covalent bond formation with a genetically encoded DogCatcher-GFP fusion protein that can be secreted from a variety of cell types in intact animals. To identify optimal DogTag insertions into CSPs, we describe a flow cytometry–based platform for rapidly screening candidates in vitro. We demonstrate the ability to tag and visualize three members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) in vivo: the transmembrane protein mCD8 and two GPI-anchored proteins belonging to the DIP-Dpr interactome that interact biophysically to facilitate neuronal target recognition at Drosophila neuromuscular and brain synapses. FETCH enables precise temporal and spatial control to visualize tagged proteins in vivo, features that are adaptable to a multitude of applications for modifying any cell surface protein.",

Despite the importance of soil microbiomes in engineering ecosystem processes, the specific strategies employed by soil microbiomes to support ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) across aridity gradients remain virtually unknown.

Microbial habitat and decomposition functions were among the last to respond to aridity, with thresholds occurring under more arid conditions compared to plant productivity and soil fertility. Combining metagenomic sequencing with physiological assays to characterize microbial life history strategies of high yield (Y), resource acquisition (A), and stress tolerance (S), we introduce a microbial trait-based framework to mechanistically link community-level microbial life history strategies to EMF. Our results reveal that microbial Y-strategy is positively correlated with EMF across aridity gradients, A-strategy exhibits a negative association with EMF across aridity gradients, and S-strategy is negatively correlated with EMF in arid ecosystems. Collectively, this study offers empirical evidence and insights into how aridification interacts with soil microbiomes in shaping EMF, highlighting the pivotal role of microbial life history strategies in understanding the mechanisms behind EMF variation in an increasingly arid world.",

Eight Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) are encoded in the Drosophila genome; whether these Dilps respond uniformly to changes in dietary nutrients is unknown. Here, we investigate the endocrine responses of Dilp2, secreted by brain insulin-producing cells, and Dilp6, produced by the fat body, to dietary sugar and protein in mid-third instar Drosophila larvae. Starvation leads to a profound reduction in circulating Dilp2 without affecting circulating Dilp6 levels. Diets containing sugar alone drive nutrient storage and increase hemolymph Dilp6, but do not promote Dilp2 release. In contrast, dietary protein drives growth and restores hemolymph Dilp2 but strongly reduces circulating Dilp6. Furthermore, circulating levels of Dilp2 and Dilp6 are modulated by the ratio of sugar to protein in the diet. We find that depleting circulating Dilp6 via fat body specific knockdown or increasing insulin receptor (InR) levels in fat body leads to increased levels of triglyceride storage but decreased peripheral growth. Our results suggest that Dilp6, a hormone produced in response to dietary sugar, may direct the use of sugar for growth instead of fat storage at the end stage of larval development. Our findings reveal different modes of regulation for Dilp2 and Dilp6 and raise the question of how the single known Drosophila InR integrates divergent signals from distinct Dilps to control growth and metabolism.",

It greatly contributes to natural carbon sinks by enhancing atmospheric CO 2 sequestration/mineralization in mineral ion-rich aqueous systems, which is demonstrated by freezing the solutions of Ca(OH) 2 , binary NaCl–CaCl 2 solutions, and artificial seawater. The acceleration is caused by the impacts of freezing on nucleation and growth processes of CaCO 3 crystals. Freezing accelerates nucleation by concentrating reactants within ice crystal boundaries, increasing supersaturation, and thus lowering the nucleation energy barrier. At the post–thaw stage where nuclei already form and reactant concentration is decreased, the crystals undergo the barrier-free growth process. Our findings reveal the freezing-enhanced CO 2 sequestration that is omitted in the current global carbon budget models and signal an urgent need to integrate cryogenic mineralization into climate predictions.",

Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying these adaptations can yield insights into protein structure–function relationships, protein evolution, and the consequences of temperature shifts on species distributions. Past studies have suggested that only a small number of amino acid substitutions are needed for adaptive change, but whether similar sites in the sequence, which we term thermal adaptation–related sequence sites (TRSS), and similar changes in amino acid content at these TRSS occur across widely different taxa remains to be elucidated. For detecting TRSS among orthologs of species adapted to a wide range of temperatures, we investigated 277 lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) orthologs in marine fish from diverse habitats. We validated the importance of several TRSS variants using site-directed mutagenesis on zebrafish LDH-A, effectively recreating the variants in the zebrafish ortholog. Our results indicate that enzyme thermal adaptation arises primarily from a few substitutions that influence hydrophobicity in functionally important regions of secondary structures. These findings reveal striking convergence in the sites (the TRSS) of temperature-adaptive evolution of LDH-As and provide insights into the types of amino acid substitutions that foster adaptation to temperature. Furthermore, the patterns of convergent evolution identified in this study supported development of a deep learning model for predicting thermal limits. This model can provide an important tool for predicting thermal ranges of species and the potential effects of temperature change on distribution patterns.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the regulatory role of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-mediated citrullination on the tumor suppressor protein p53. We demonstrate that p53 serves as a substrate for PAD4, undergoing citrullination at multiple arginine residues, including critical sites within its DNA-binding domain. Mass spectrometry identified eight citrullination sites, notably R158, R282, and R283, which were further validated in various cancer cell lines. Functional studies revealed that citrullination significantly impairs p53’s ability to form stable tetramers, essential for high-affinity DNA binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed reduced binding to consensus sequences in the p21 and MDM2 promoters. As a result, citrullination led to marked reductions in p21 and MDM2 transcriptional activation and altered regulation of ME2, as demonstrated by reporter assays and quantitative PCR. In addition, citrullination compromised p53’s roles in cell cycle control and apoptosis. Supporting these findings, citrulline-mimic mutants (arginine-to-glutamine substitutions) exhibited diminished transcriptional activity relative to wild-type p53. Furthermore, citrullination disrupted the interaction between p53 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, reducing p53 ubiquitination and degradation, as shown by in vitro ubiquitination assays and cycloheximide chase experiments. Importantly, replacing glutamine with lysine at these key sites largely restored p53 activity, indicating that the loss of positive charge is central to the functional consequences of citrullination.

          "abstract": "The forces exerted by cells upon the fibers of the extracellular matrix play a decisive role in cell motility in physiopathology. How the local physical properties of the matrix (density, stiffness, orientation) affect cellular forces remains, however, poorly understood. Existing approaches to measure cell three-dimensional (3D) traction forces within fibrous substrates lack control over the local properties and rely on continuum approaches, not suited for measuring forces at the scale of individual fibers. Herein, an approach is proposed to fabricate multilayer arrays of suspended deformable fibers spanning a wide range of fine-tunable geometrical and mechanical properties using two-photon polymerization. Atomic Force Microscopy is used to thoroughly investigate the properties of individual fibers, including Young’s modulus and stiffness. This approach is combined with a reference-free method for measuring traction forces in 3D, which relies on automated segmentation of the fibers coupled with finite element modeling. The force measurement pipeline is applied to study forces exerted by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or macrophages, and reveals how these forces are influenced by fiber density and stiffness. Additionally, coupling to fast volumetric imaging with lattice light-sheet microscopy enables the measurement of the low-intensity and short-lived tractions exerted by amoeboid cells, such as dendritic cells. Our technology will be instrumental for monitoring and studying cell behavior at the single-fiber level at extracellular matrix density interfaces, which play a crucial role in both physiological and pathological contexts, such as tumor boundaries.",

          "abstract": "NAD(P)(H) metabolism plays a crucial role in plant development and growth. NADK2, a chloroplast-localized NAD kinase, supplies NADP + to the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant of NADK2 ( nadk2 ) exhibits a reduced NADP + /NAD + ratio, slow growth, and pale green leaves. To gain further insights into NAD(P)(H) metabolism in chloroplasts, nadk2 revertant mutants ( nkr ) were screened from the M2 generation of EMS (ethyl methane sulfonate)-treated nadk2 seeds. Among them, nkr1 displayed greener leaves and improved growth compared to nadk2 . Genetic mapping and genomic sequencing identified At3g18500 ( CCR4C ) as the causal gene. The nkr1 mutant carried a single nucleotide substitution, introducing a stop codon within the predicted N-terminal chloroplast localization signal, resulting in the loss of CCR4C protein function. The nadk2 ccr4c double mutant restored leaf color and growth to near wild-type levels. To investigate the function of CCR4C, recombinant CCR4C protein was purified and shown to directly convert NADP(H) to NAD(H). Localization analysis with CCR4C-GFP fusion proteins confirmed chloroplast targeting. Furthermore, ccr4c single mutants exhibited disrupted NAD(P)(H) balance and enhanced tolerance to ROS stress (e.g., H 2 O 2 , methyl viologen). These findings reveal CCR4C as a chloroplast-localized NADP(H) phosphatase crucial for maintaining NAD(P)(H) balance, providing insights into how plant cells manage chloroplast metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Deep learning on micro-Fourier transform infrared (µFTIR) spectra has the potential to provide a reliable, automated approach to classify and identify microplastics. However, deep learning models often come with certain limitations, including exhaustive dataset requirements, overfitting, and the need to retrain when new classes are introduced or new data are substantially different from the training set. This work explores a similarity learning approach to training deep learning models to address these issues for microplastic classification. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained by similarity learning on a dataset of µFTIR spectra acquired from 45 manufactured microplastic samples of 11 plastic compositions and compared with cross-entropy training of the same CNN architecture as well as classical machine learning algorithms. The CNN trained by similarity learning consistently yielded the highest accuracies (up to a 0.973 F1-score) across the multiple classes of microplastics. Notably, despite only training on microplastic spectra collected under pristine conditions, the CNN trained via similarity learning maintained the highest accuracy (up to a 0.905 F1-score) on a “noisy” dataset consisting of microplastics spiked onto filters with high amounts of exogenous background material. Furthermore, similarity learning combined with support-vector classifiers also allowed for the detection and separation of microplastic polymer-composition classes not contained in the training set. Overall, this approach is able to achieve high accuracy in microplastic classification despite challenges posed by the diversity of microplastic polymer compositions, limited time and resources for dataset preparation, and high amounts of background noise that are common in FTIR spectra collected from real-world microplastic samples.",

They have been found to show a negative phototactic response to blue light, mediated by an as-yet unidentified photoreceptive system. Here, by screening available apusomonad omics data we found genes of a distinct group of microbial rhodopsins, apusomonad rhodopsins (ApuRs). ApuRs, heterologously expressed in mammalian cells, absorbed near-UV or violet light, suggesting that ApuRs could be involved in apusomonads’ photoavoidance response toward short-wavelength light. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that ApuRs are anion-selective rhodopsin channels which evolved independently of the family of channelrhodopsins widespread in other unicellular eukaryotes. In ApuRs, channel opening is triggered by photoisomerization of the retinal from its all- trans form to 13- cis and 11- cis forms. We found that intracellular proton transfer is involved in channel opening and determines the channel’s open/close kinetics. These findings expand our understanding of the photobiology of heterotrophic flagellates and demonstrate that UV-absorbing ApuRs are in fact the most blue-shifted rhodopsin channels known to date.",

          "abstract": "Jumping can be hazardous for entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) as those that fail to attach to an insect host face death by predation or starvation. Recently, it has been shown that electrostatic charges on large insects can prompt a close-range detachment of free-living nematodes, which are nonparasitic and unable to jump. However, it remains unclear if static electricity can influence aerial interactions between parasitic jumping worms and their insect hosts. Here, we analyze and model the trajectories of jumping EPNs in still air as they approach fruit flies with varying electrostatic charge. We find that the nematodes’ attachment to the host is facilitated by an electrical potential of a few hundred volts, a magnitude commonly found in flying insects. A model combining electrostatics, aerodynamics, and Bayesian inference indicates that the electrostatic charge on jumping nematodes is ∼ 0.1 pC, which aligns with theoretical predictions for electrostatic induction. Drag coefficients based on host–nematode interactions in the presence of horizontal wind show differences at both low and high jumping velocities. Numerical simulations show that intermediate wind speeds ( ∼ 0.2 m/s) can further increase the likelihood of host attachment, as wind-driven aerial drifting allows the worms to reach hosts at greater distances. Our results suggest that submillimeter parasites that become airborne may exploit the electric charge carried by their host to facilitate attachment and thus enhance survival. The use of quantitative physical models provides valuable insights into understanding complex airborne infectious diseases mediated by natural environmental forces.",

          "abstract": "Mot1 in budding yeast regulates transcription by dissociating general initiation factor TBP (TATA-binding protein) from DNA. Previous studies suggested that Mot1 preferentially removes TBP from stress-responsive promoters containing consensus TATA elements that utilize coactivator SAGA while enhancing TBP binding at “house-keeping” genes with TATA-like elements that employ TFIID for TBP recruitment. In stress conditions of amino acid starvation, by contrast, we found that Mot1 promotes TBP binding at genes activated by transcription factor Gcn4, enriched for TATA/SAGA-dependent promoters, and at SAGA-dependent genes expressed constitutively at high-levels, while suppressing TBP binding at SAGA-dependent genes only expressed at lower levels. Importantly, Mot1’s influence on genes induced by starvation or oxidative stress switches from increased to decreased TBP binding when transcribed at low levels in nonstressed cells. Mot1’s role at TFIID-dependent promoters also scales with transcription level, enhancing TBP binding only for the highly expressed subset. Notably, reduced TBP binding on Mot1 depletion impairs transcription of highly expressed TFIID genes but not highly expressed SAGA/stress-activated genes, suggesting that SAGA produces a surfeit of incomplete preinitiation complexes dependent on Mot1 for assembly.",

In this work, we study this issue from both an economic and an algorithmic point of view, focusing on a phenomenon that reduces barriers to entry. Specifically, an incumbent company risks reputational damage unless its model is sufficiently aligned with safety objectives, whereas a new company can more easily avoid reputational damage. To study this issue formally, we define a multi-objective high-dimensional regression framework that captures reputational damage, and we characterize the number of data points that a new company needs to enter the market. Our results demonstrate how multi-objective considerations can fundamentally reduce barriers to entry—the required number of data points can be significantly smaller than the incumbent company’s dataset size. En route to proving these results, we develop scaling laws for high-dimensional linear regression in multi-objective environments, showing that the scaling rate becomes slower when the dataset size is large, which could be of independent interest.",

To investigate this issue, we screened libraries of ~100 million short (semi-)random sequences, mimicking early stages of gene birth, for genes that promote Escherichia coli survival during phage infection. This selection uncovered thousands of functional genes that confer viral resistance through at least two distinct mechanisms: 1) activation of a bacterial regulatory system that remodels the outer membrane, which provides broad-spectrum defense, and 2) transcriptional repression of bacterial outer membrane receptors required for phage adsorption, which provides phage-specific protection. Remarkably, unrelated random genes with no sequence similarity produced similar protective phenotypes, revealing that diverse sequences can converge on equivalent functions. We further showed that T4 phage rapidly evolves to counter these novel defenses, acquiring baseplate mutations that enhance adsorption to resistant hosts. Together, these findings demonstrate that random sequences can rapidly evolve into functional genes with direct fitness benefit, highlighting the evolutionary potential of de novo gene birth in the microbial world.",

MT-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate MT functions and thus bear the potential to modulate viral infection. However, while several MAPs are known to exert proviral effects on HIV, little is known about antiviral ones. We previously described the Tripartite motif protein 69 (Trim69) as an innate immune factor that remodels MTs, leading to inhibition of a broad spectrum of viruses, including HIV. Through in silico modeling, TIRF microscopy, and cell-based assays, we determine that Trim69 binding to MTs is determined by a basic surface in its SPRY domain that interacts with the C-terminal tails of tubulins. This surface is conserved among mammalian Trim69s and is critical for its functions. We demonstrate that by binding and remodeling MTs, Trim69 inhibits the docking and the migration of virion cores on MTs by promoting the stalling of the dynein/dynactin motor complexes. Altogether, these findings shed light on a mechanism of viral defense that involves an innate immune regulation of the MT cytoskeleton.",

However, interactions between Fe nutrition of microbes, including both heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton, and viral lysis are not well known. Here, we present viral infection dynamics under Fe-limited and Fe-replete conditions for isolates of three types of marine picoplankton, the photosynthetic picoeukaryote Ostreococcus , the cyanobacterium Synechococcus , and the heterotrophic bacterium Vibrio . Iron limitation of Ostreococcus resulted in slowed growth and reduced viral burst sizes; this is similar to prior results from studies of larger eukaryotic phytoplankton, where reduced viral replication under Fe limitation is attributed to the viral reliance on host metabolism and replication machinery. Fe limitation of one Vibrio impacted dynamics of its virus similarly, lengthening the latent period before infected cells burst to release new viruses, and reducing the number of infective particles released upon lysis. In contrast, for another Vibrio isolate, Fe limitation had no discernible effect on replication of its virus. Furthermore, dynamics of three cyanophages that infect the same Synechococcus isolate were not affected by Fe limitation of the host, either in terms of latent period or burst size. The results show that some marine viruses, particularly cyanophages, can replicate efficiently even when host growth is compromised. These findings have implications for marine ecology and carbon cycling in Fe-limited regions of the global ocean.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation to different environments is thought to play a key role in speciation. However, speciation typically begins in allopatry, where reproductive isolation can also arise through neutral processes or selection unrelated to ecological differences. Disentangling the role of adaptive ecological divergence in the early stages of speciation therefore remains an important challenge in understanding the origin of new species. Here, we study threespine stickleback populations that have recently evolved in isolated postglacial lakes either in the presence or absence of prickly sculpin—a resource competitor that also shares ubiquitous trout predators with stickleback. We simulated secondary contact between several stickleback populations from these two ecological contexts in large, seminatural ponds, and genotyped offspring from 411 mating events to assess the strength of premating isolation associated with this biotic factor. Assortative mating between populations of the same ecological type (i.e., both sculpin-sympatric or both solitary) was moderate on average but ranged from weak to complete. Strikingly, and in line with a central premise of ecological speciation, the strength of premating isolation increased with increasing morphological and genomic population divergence shaped by sculpin-mediated selection. In contrast, overall phenotypic and genomic population divergence agnostic to sculpin presence/absence only poorly explained premating isolation, highlighting how ecological speciation in allopatry can be obscured by other sources of divergence. More broadly, our findings demonstrate how interactions with other ecologically similar species can play a major role in initiating and driving evolutionary trajectories toward new species, even in allopatry.",

Although various global conformations have been captured in static structural models, dynamic transitions between these conformations and their biological relevance remain unclear. Here, we visualize the global conformation of the Rag GTPase heterodimer using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. By tracking the movement of individual protein molecules, we found that the two subunits explore a wide conformational space, which is strictly dictated by the bound nucleotides, regulators, and mutations.

To overcome this, microRNA (miRNA) target sequences were incorporated into mRNA constructs to restrict expression specifically to germ cells.

Whole-genome sequencing of the offspring confirmed the absence of large-scale genomic abnormalities.

          "abstract": "The precise timing of flowering is critical to ensure reproductive success in plants. This process is coordinated by both endogenous and environmental cues. Light is a pivotal environmental cue fundamentally regulating plant growth and development. In temperate grasses, how light regulates flowering time remains largely unknown. Here, we characterize a blue-light photoreceptor, FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1), which functions as a flowering promoter in Brachypodium distachyon . Loss-of-function mutations in FKF1 result in delayed flowering under long-day conditions, whereas overexpression of FKF1 strongly accelerates flowering. We show that FKF1 controls the stability of floral repressor EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) in response to blue light. FKF1 directly interacts with and catalyzes the ubiquitination of ELF3, leading to protein degradation of ELF3 via the 26S proteasome pathway. Blue light can strengthen the interaction between FKF1 and ELF3, thereby accelerating degradation of ELF3. Moreover, ELF3 physically interacts with SWINGER and CURLY LEAF, two core subunits of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and mediates the subsequent deposition of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) for stable transcriptional silencing of the flowering activator PHOTOPERIOD 1 . Remarkably, the FKF1–ELF3–PRC2 regulatory module-mediated flowering time control in response to light is likely conserved across temperate grasses. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which light modulates H3K27me3 deposition to regulate flowering time in temperate grasses.

          "abstract": "Free tropospheric (FT) nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) plays a critical role in atmospheric oxidant chemistry as a source of tropospheric ozone and of the hydroxyl radical (OH). It also contributes significantly to satellite-observed tropospheric NO 2 columns, which should be considered when using these columns to quantify surface emissions of nitrogen oxide radicals (NO x ≡ NO + NO 2 ). But large uncertainties remain in the sources and chemistry of FT NO 2 because observations are sparse. Here, we construct a cloud-sliced FT NO 2 (700 to 300 hPa) product from the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) geostationary satellite instrument over North America. This product provides higher data density and quality than previous products from low Earth orbit instruments, including the first observations of the FT NO 2 diurnal cycle in different seasons. Combined with coincident observations from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper, the TEMPO data imply that lightning is the dominant source of FT NO x in nonwinter seasons. Comparison of TEMPO FT NO 2 data with the Goddard Earth Observation System-Composition Forecasts (GEOS-CF) atmospheric chemistry model shows overall consistent magnitudes, seasonality, and diurnal variation, with a midday minimum in nonwinter seasons from photochemical loss. However, there are major discrepancies that we attribute to GEOS-CF’s use of a standard cloud-top-height-based scheme for the lightning NO x source. We find that this scheme underestimates offshore lighting flash density and misrepresents the diurnal cycle of lightning over land. Our FT NO 2 product provides a unique resource for improving the lightning NO x parameterization in atmospheric models and the ability to use NO 2 observations from space to quantify surface NO x emissions.",

Elevated protein synthesis creates a dependency on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins and chaperones, which are required to maintain proteostasis. In this study, we identified the protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) PDIA1 and PDIA5, which play a critical role in folding of client proteins in the ER, as important regulators of prostate cancer growth and response to therapy. PDIA1 and PDIA5 are upregulated in prostate cancer and induced by the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis. Genetic or pharmacological disabling of PDIA1/PDIA5 caused redox stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, growth inhibition, and death of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The critical functions of these enzymes in redox homeostasis and cell survival were observed in both AR-driven and AR-independent models of prostate cancer. Loss of PDIA1/PDIA5 activity led to ubiquitination and degradation of the AR, revealing a feedback loop between these chaperones and the AR pathway. Mechanistically, PDIA1/PDIA5 regulated AR stability by mediating disulfide bond formation, an activity that required cysteines 669 and 844 in AR’s ligand-binding domain. Importantly, targeting PDIAs sensitized prostate cancer cells to the AR antagonist, enzalutamide. This study reveals a mechanism governing AR proteostasis in prostate cancer and positions PDIA1/5 as viable therapeutic targets.",

However, despite aging being the primary risk factor for AD, it remains unclear whether men and women differ in the extent of brain decline with age. Using 12,638 longitudinal brain MRIs from 4,726 participants aged 17 to 95 y across 14 cohorts, we examined sex differences in structural brain changes over time, controlling for differences in head size. Men showed greater cortical thickness (CT) decline in the cuneus, lingual, parahippocampal, and pericalcarine regions; surface area decline in the fusiform and postcentral regions; and in older adults, greater subcortical decline in the caudate, nucleus accumbens, putamen, and pallidum. In contrast, women only showed greater surface area decline in the banks of the superior temporal sulcus and greater ventricular expansion in older adults. These results suggest that sex differences in age-related brain decline are unlikely to contribute to the higher AD diagnosis prevalence in women, necessitating research into alternative explanations.",

The phase diagram contains three distinct superconducting phases: SC 1 in which φ and θ extend from 0 to 90° and H ≤ ~15 T; SC 2 for φ ≤ ~7°, θ ≤ ~4° and ~15 T ≤ H ≤ H m = ~35 T, the onset of the magnetic field polarized (FP) phase, and SC FP which resides entirely within the FP phase in a pocket of superconductivity extending from θ ≈ 20° to 40° and from ~40 T to above 60 T. We studied the evolution of the H vs. θ phase diagram for Th concentrations 0.005 ≤ x ≤ 0.047 in the U 1-x Th x Te 2 system at ~0.6 K. Within this range of x values, SC 1 extends over 0 ≤ θ ≤ 90° and H ≤ ~10 T for x = 0.047, while SC 2 is suppressed. The SC FP and FP phases are unaffected to x = 0.02 but are completely suppressed in the region x = 0.025 to 0.047 where the residual resistance ratio RRR ~3 indicates a significant amount of disorder. These results complement recent studies of nonsuperconducting disordered UTe 2 single crystals in which the SC 1 and SC 2 phases are absent, but the FP and so-called “orphan” SC FP phases are retained.",

          "abstract": "For several decades, it was widely believed that a noninteracting disordered electronic system could only undergo an Anderson metal–insulator transition due to Anderson localization. However, numerous recent theoretical works have predicted the existence of a disorder-driven non-Anderson phase transition that differs from Anderson localization. The frustration lies in the fact that this non-Anderson disorder-driven transition has not yet been experimentally demonstrated in any system. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we present a case study of observing the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition by visualizing the electronic structure of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi on surfaces with varying amounts of disorder. Our observations reveal that strong disorder can effectively suppress all surface states in the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, including the topological surface Fermi arcs. This disappearance of surface Fermi arcs is associated with the vanishing of the topological invariant, indicating a quantum phase transition from a Weyl semimetal to a diffusive metal. These observations provide direct experimental evidence of the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition occurring in real quantum systems, a finding long anticipated by theoretical physicists.",

We used an ecosystem-scale manipulation to simulate hurricane-level flooding of a coastal forest and explore the individual and interactive impacts of inundation and salinity. Monitoring real-time soil conditions and tree physiological responses, we observed consistent impacts on soil biogeochemistry aligned with belowground drivers of tree mortality, but no consistent responses in aboveground vegetation immediately following flooding. Our findings provide empirically based insight into the earliest stages of a hypothesized forest mortality spiral and offer critical benchmarks for predicting coastal forest resilience in the face of accelerating climate change.",

Their architectural scale, complexity, and integration with the terrain suggest a high degree of communal organization, landscape knowledge, and planning. Although direct dating remains inconclusive, associated stratigraphy indicates they were abandoned before the Late Bronze Age, pointing to a potentially earlier origin. These structures may represent the westernmost examples of a broader tradition of large-scale hunting installations previously known only from the arid zones of Southwest Asia and North Africa.

          "abstract": "The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most devastating insect pest in rice, posing a serious threat to global rice production. One attractive control strategy would be based on the understanding of the virulence mechanisms of BPH at the molecular level and then designing targeted methods to neutralize such mechanisms. Salivary proteins of BPH are important players in mediating rice–BPH interactions. Here, we describe a pivotal role of a watery saliva protein, Nilaparvata lugens Annexin-like5 ( Nl ANX5), in the rice–BPH interaction. RNA interference (RNAi) of NlANX5 greatly compromised BPH feeding performance and survival rate on rice plants. NlANX5 -RNAi BPH triggered a rapid calcium ion influx in rice cells. The feeding and survival defects of NlANX5 -RNAi BPH can be restored in NlANX5 -expressing transgenic rice plants. Nl ANX5 targets rice annexin ( Os ANN) proteins, including Os ANN2 and Os ANN8. Further analysis with Nl ANX5 and Os ANN2 as well as Os ANN8 showed that Nl ANX5 displaces Os ANN2 and Os ANN8 from the rice cell membrane. The osann2 osann8 mutant rice plants are hypersusceptible to BPH infestation. In contrast, enhanced expression of OsANN2 and OsANN8 genes resulted in robust rice resistance against BPH. This study highlights a successful example of identifying and augmenting the expression of the host targets of a major BPH virulence effector as a promising antivirulence strategy against an important crop pest.",

The obstacles that prevented their use as H 2 oxidation catalysts in fuel cells are being removed one by one, thanks to the continuous discovery of hydrogenases that have unexpected catalytic properties, the development of new methods for their scalable production and matrices that protect them. Obtaining an efficient biohybrid electrode that is scalable and robust under a large range of experimental conditions is still challenging. The FeFe hydrogenase of Clostridium beijerinckii is a very active catalyst of H 2 evolution and can be handled under O 2 , and its production can potentially be scaled up. However, it was believed that it cannot be used for H 2 oxidation, as it is easily oxidized to an O 2 -stable but inactive state. Here, we show that when the enzyme is embedded into a redox-active film whose reduction potential is finely tuned to the equilibrium potential of the H + /H 2 couple, the potential that the enzyme experiences can be buffered in a sharp window that is actually compatible with enzyme-catalyzed H 2 oxidation and prevents anaerobic inactivation. This leads us to provide the demonstration of an FeFe hydrogenase-based system that can be used for H 2 oxidation and that can be repeatedly exposed to O 2 during and between operational cycles.",

Structures of substrate-bound AAA+ complexes suggest that these enzymes employ a conserved hand-over-hand mechanism to thread substrates through their central pore. However, the fundamental aspects of the mechanisms governing motor function and substrate processing within specific AAA+ families remain unresolved. We used cryoelectron microscopy to structurally interrogate reaction intermediates from in vitro biochemical assays to inform the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the human mitochondrial AAA+ protease, LONP1. Our results demonstrate that substrate binding, rather than nucleotide binding, activates the assembly and allosterically regulates proteolytic activity. The N-terminal domain plays a critical role in this process and facilitates the initial stages of substrate selection and engagement. Moreover, structures of LONP1 actively degrading a substrate in the presence of ATP provide important context to the conventional understanding of the hand-over-hand translocation mechanism, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is likely not limited to a single position in the right-handed spiral during the hand-over-hand translocation mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Head movements are sensed by the vestibular organs. Unlike classical senses, signals from vestibular organs are not selectively conveyed to a dedicated cortical area but are broadcast throughout the cortex. This distributed processing pattern reflects the fundamental role of vestibular information in contextual modulation across diverse cortical computations. Surprisingly, the routes taken by vestibular signals to reach the cortex are still largely uncharted. Here, we show that the primary visual cortex (V1) receives real-time head movement signals—direction, velocity, and acceleration—from the ipsilateral pulvinar and contralateral visual cortex (VC). The ipsilateral pulvinar provides the main head movement signal, with a bias toward contraversive movements (e.g., clockwise movements in left V1). Conversely, the contralateral VC provides head movement signals during ipsiversive movements. Crucially, head movement variables encoded in V1 are already encoded in the pulvinar, suggesting that those variables are computed subcortically. Thus, the convergence of inter- and intrahemispheric signals endows V1 with a rich representation of the animal’s head movements.",

          "abstract": "While deep learning has advanced protein sequence and function design, engineering highly active and stable proteins still requires labor-intensive iterative computational design and experimentation. There is a critical need for methods capable of directly generating protein sequences with the required properties. Here, we present GeoEvoBuilder, an advanced deep learning framework that adaptively integrates structural and evolutionary constraints for protein sequence design. GeoEvoBuilder accurately recapitulates functional sites and generates sequences that fold correctly with enhanced activity and thermal stability. GeoEvoBuilder has been applied to redesign green fluorescent protein, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), yielding variants with significantly improved thermal stability and activity. Notably, the top DHFR design demonstrated a 20-fold increase in catalytic efficiency and a 10 °C gain in thermal stability. Crystal structure determination confirmed that the designed proteins form correct structures. Further analysis of residue dynamic correlations in GPX4 variants provides insights into how remote sites regulate enzymatic activity. Unlike conventional methods that focus on single mutation and their combinations with iterative design and experiment cycles, GeoEvoBuilder explores a large sequence space that enables successful designs with over 30% residue changes in one run. GeoEvoBuilder not only provides a transformative tool for protein engineering but also can be applied to uncover the intricate relationships between protein sequence, structure, function, and evolution.

DMD treatment requires a body-wide approach to target all diseased striated muscles: limb, respiratory, and heart. To address this, we focus studies on blocking the onset of muscle membrane instability, the primary defect in DMD, as a promising yet unmet druggable target. Here, data show the remarkable potency of a synthetic poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(propylene oxide) side chain–based bottlebrush block copolymer, ~150,000 times more potent than linear polymers, to rapidly restore contractile function to DMD skeletal muscle fibers in vitro. Strikingly, upon bottlebrush polymer delivery to DMD animals, results show highly efficacious prevention of the onset of skeletal and diaphragm muscle damage and the blocking of stress-induced cardiac injury and death in vivo. These data suggest bottlebrush polymers as a potent stand-alone muscle membrane-stabilizing therapeutic for DMD. Given DMD’s early childhood onset, together with newborn screening for DMD, bottlebrush macromolecules could be envisioned as an early therapy to preserve and protect viable muscle and potentially for other acquired or inherited diseases involving membrane damage.",

          "abstract": "Pathogens are major drivers of cancer globally and the processes of infection and carcinogenesis unfold over decades making them difficult to observe in human or natural populations. We investigate these hidden dynamics for the foodborne trematode Opisthorchis viverrini , which is a primary cause of biliary cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) and infects 12 million people in Southeast Asia. In tumors from patients exposed to O. viverrini , we find that the earliest chromosomal amplifications carrying driver genes occurred at 30 y old on average, two to four decades before cancer diagnosis, and disproportionately contain TP53 , PTEN and FGFR2 genes. We then fitted transmission models to parasitological data from Thailand spanning 27 y ( n = 11,517) finding that, for people born between 1960 and 1989, first exposure occurred at two years old and by 30 y individuals had been cumulatively infected with a median of 72 worms. Trematodes are long-lived and our analysis quantifies the average lifespan of O. viverrini as 13 y (90% credible interval [CrI] 7 to 26 y) within human hosts. The lifetime probability of diagnosis with cholangiocarcinoma is 4.9% (90% CrI 4.7 to 5.0%) given prior exposure to O. viverrini , which is fourteen-fold higher than in populations nonendemic for the parasite. We find strong evidence for a dramatic decline in parasite transmission from 1990 onward in Thailand, suggesting that the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma will decline over the coming decades. Our study demonstrates how pathogen exposure drives patterns of cancer within a population and provides evidence for public health and therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "Hydrothermal vent temperatures fluctuate in response to transient magmatic and tectonic activity at the axis of mid-ocean ridges (MORs) and modulate energy fluxes from the deep Earth to the ocean. Such fluctuations have thus far only been documented on time scales of minutes to years, because of the scarcity of long, continuous observations. Here, we assemble a ~35-year-long time series of exit fluid temperatures from five hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise axis, between 9°46’-51’N. This dataset reveals a steady increase in maximum venting temperatures atop the central part of the axial magma lens (AML), from ~350 °C to ~390 °C between the 1991–92 and 2005–06 eruptions. Temperatures decreased back to ~350 °C shortly after the 2005–06 eruption and have been rising ever since. We interpret the temperature increase as a result of a steady decrease in upflow zone permeability caused by the steady inflation of the AML compressing the oceanic upper crust. Using laboratory-determined pressure–permeability relations, we estimate crustal pressurization rates of 0.38 MPa/y (1992–2005) and 0.33 MPa/y (post-2006), consistent with geodetic observations from 2009–2011. Decadal fluctuations in hydrothermal vent temperatures likely mimic the rate of AML pressurization, yielding valuable new constraints on the dynamics of magmatic replenishment and eruptions at MORs. Notably, this temperature time series underpinned our forecast of the April 2025 eruption at the study site.",

          "abstract": "Microbial fermentation facilitates the initial breakdown of organic matter into small molecules and is thought to be the rate-limiting step of anoxic organic mineralization. However, fermentation is understudied in modern and ancient biogeochemistry due to a lack of environmental biomarkers. It has long been assumed that fermentation, like respiration, does not express significant carbon isotope fractionations, precluding isotopic signals as a means of studying it in nature. Here, we tested this idea by growing pure cultures of four fermenting bacteria on glucose and measuring the carbon isotope compositions of the organic acids and alcohols produced. We found that fermentation exhibits a strong carbon isotope fractionation, ranging from − 6‰ to + 16‰, depending on the fermentation product. With bioisotopic models that track site-specific isotope enrichments through metabolism, we constrained the enzymes responsible for these fractionations. Our models reproduced in vivo organic acid δ 13 C values in all four organisms. These findings demonstrate that acetate 13 C-enrichment is likely a widespread signature of fermentation. They also challenge traditional notions of controls on the isotope composition of lipids. Finally, our study suggests that fermentation imposes a trophic carbon isotope fractionation as organic carbon is passed from fermenters to secondary degraders like sulfate reducers. Looking to the geologic past, this trophic fractionation could have imprinted isotopic signals on the three billion year record of sedimentary organic carbon, specifically the inverse δ 13 C pattern of Precambrian acyclic isoprenoid and n-alkane biomarkers. Pervasive evidence of fermentation in the rock record would suggest its underappreciated role in biogeochemical cycles throughout Earth history.",

          "abstract": "Foraging and food consumption are fundamental for the survival of animals. In natural environments, wild rodents feed on insects, including moth larvae, and odor-guided evaluation of potential food resources is a critical step in initiating feeding behavior. However, the mechanisms by which rodents seek and feed on insect prey remain poorly understood. Herein, we employed a laboratory-based predator–prey interaction system using mice and cotton bollworm larvae to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying food-seeking and feeding behaviors at both cellular and neural circuit levels. We demonstrate that mice exhibit a strong preference for consuming fed larvae, and this preference is dependent on the main olfactory system. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed significant differences in the chemical profiles of fed and unfed larvae, with fed larvae containing a higher level of linoleic acid (LA) and a lower level of (Z)-9-tricosene [(Z)-9-TE]. Behavioral assays showed that mice, as well as Brand’s voles and brown rats, are attracted to LA but avoid (Z)-9-TE in a two-choice odor preference test. Furthermore, we identified that the dopaminergic pathway from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the medial olfactory tubercle (mOT) plays a central role in mediating this preference. Chemogenetic inhibition of this pathway abolished the preference for LA over (Z)-9-TE, while chemogenetic activation reversed this effect. Additionally, fiber photometry recordings and pharmacology revealed that mOT D1 and D2 spiny projection neurons preferentially mediate attraction to LA and avoidance of (Z)-9-TE, respectively. These findings uncover a neurobiological system in rodents that supports insect predation based upon chemosignals.",

Yet, in a handful of species, females cease reproduction long before death, highlighting an apparent evolutionary paradox. We used over three decades of life-history and behavioral data to examine the prevalence of postreproductive lifespan in wild mountain gorillas ( Gorilla beringei beringei ). Almost one third of females in our study population (7/25) have been “postreproductive” according to a commonly used criterion and have lived more than a decade past their age of last reproduction, representing at least a fourth of their adult lifespan. Additionally, using conservative estimates of female ages, we found a significant post-reproductive representation (a common population-level measure of post-reproductive lifespan) equal to 0.10. Our results add to observations of postreproductive lifespan in chimpanzees and humans and thus, they represent a critical addition to our understanding of hominid life-history evolution.",

          "abstract": "Methane is ubiquitous in groundwater, and its release to surface environments through pumping, discharge, or diffusion is an emerging environmental concern. Microbial oxidation consumes methane and mitigates its release, but quantitative constraints in groundwater remain unknown. Using ultra-low-level 14 C-labeling, we estimate in situ microbial methane oxidation rates in shallow carbonate and sandy aquifers from central and northern Germany with methane concentrations spanning 5 orders of magnitude, from 0.15 ± 0.04 to 36,250 ± 1,390 µg L −1 . Oxidation rates ranged from 0.001 ± 0.0003 to 74.28 ± 46.94 µgC L −1 d −1 and were highly correlated with groundwater methane concentrations. Oxidation-based methane turnover was rapid at low methane concentrations, with complete consumption requiring days to weeks. In contrast, microbial oxidation at high methane sites required months to decades for complete methane turnover, indicating the potential for unconsumed methane to leak into local streams or wetlands. High oxidation rates were associated with gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs that typically thrive in suboxic conditions and anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea, while uncultivated methanotrophs of the Methylomirabilota and Verrucomicrobiota dominated low-rate sites. Based on globally distributed groundwater methane concentration data, we extrapolated the strong observed correlation between methane concentrations and oxidation rates to global groundwater volumes, estimating that microbial oxidation removes ~66% of groundwater methane globally, equivalent to 167 to 778 Tg CH 4 y −1 . This highlights the groundwater microbiome as a crucial subsurface methane filter that reduces methane release to surface waters, soils, and the atmosphere.",

Although these genomic alterations are often attributed to the action of error-prone DNA polymerases on UV-induced DNA lesions during replicative DNA synthesis, UV damage can also result in mutagenic and recombinogenic DNA damage in nondividing cells. We examined the effects of UV on cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arrested in G 1 of the cell cycle. By mating an irradiated haploid with an unirradiated haploid, we found that recombination was initiated only on the irradiated chromosome. This result indicates that trans effects of UV on recombination (for example, induction of recombinogenic proteins stimulating DNA breaks on the unirradiated homolog) are small or negligible. In addition, we show that most of the UV-induced mutations produced in G 1 -irradiated cells result in mutations at identical positions in both strands of the duplex. As observed for recombination events, mutations are almost exclusively on the irradiated chromosome, indicating the near absence of a trans effect on mutations.",

Here, we report that both PRC1 and USP16 are also localized in mitochondria and influence mitochondrial function directly.

We further showed that PRC1 and USP16 function with the ubiquitin pathway. Auxin-induced, mitochondria-specific depletion of the PRC1 subunit RING2 altered the ubiquitination status of mitochondrial proteins, including H2Aub. Disruption of PRC1, either through double knockout (KO) of RING1 and RING2 or through mitochondria-specific deletion of RING2 in the RING1 KO background, caused profound alterations in mitochondrial proteome and led to disturbances in mitochondrial integrity and impaired respiratory function.

Proteomic adaptation emerged from a conserved network of cis- and trans-regulatory variants, often originating from proteins not traditionally linked to gene regulation.

Selectively blocking the RAS-PI3Kα interaction may represent a strategy for treating RAS-dependent cancers as it would avoid the toxicity associated with inhibitors of PI3Kα lipid kinase activity. We developed compounds that bind covalently to cysteine 242 in the RBD of PI3K p110α and block RAS activation of PI3Kα activity. In mice, inhibitors slow the growth of RAS mutant tumors and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing tumors, particularly when combined with other inhibitors of the RAS/Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, without causing hyperglycemia. Oncogenic mutations in the small guanosine triphosphatase RAS occur in 20% of human cancers, with RAS proteins activating both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways ( 1 – 3 ). As each of these pathways has oncogenic potential, simultaneous activation, as occurs in mutant RAS driven cancers, generates aggressive disease. In RAS-driven cell and animal models, inhibition of both the MAPK and PI3K pathways is more efficacious than targeting the individual pathways ( 4 ); however, dose-limiting toxicities in humans prevent clinical success of this strategy. Although physiological activation of the MAPK pathway is RAS-dependent, the interaction between RAS and the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, p110α, serves as an amplifier but not a primary activator of this pathway, and is less important in normal cellular regulation than it is in cancer ( 5 ).",

Here, we observed purifying selection of a mouse mtDNA mutation modulated by Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 ( Usp30 ) during the maternal-zygotic transition. In vitro, Usp30 inhibition recapitulated these findings by increasing ubiquitin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy).

It binds a double-stranded DNA region upstream of the nicking site and recognizes a downstream forked or flap structure for efficient DNA nicking. This discovery suggests that L1 mobilization piggybacks on chromosomal processes with noncanonical DNA structure intermediates.",

We compared ovaries between species using three-dimensional imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and functional studies. In mice, we mapped declining follicle numbers and oocyte competence during aging; in human ovaries, we identified cortical follicle pockets and decreases in density. Oocytes had species-specific gene expression patterns during growth that converged toward maturity. Age-related transcriptional changes were greater in oocytes than granulosa cells across species, although mature oocytes change more in humans. We identified ovarian sympathetic nerves and glia; axon density increased in aged ovaries and, when ablated in mice, perturbed folliculogenesis. This comparative atlas defines shared and species-specific hallmarks of ovarian biology.",

Although stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists have shown substantial antitumor effects in animal models, their clinical efficacy in human tumors remains unclear. Deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a common genomic alteration in human tumors but is rare in preclinical syngeneic mouse models. We found that homozygous MTAP deletion in human tumors creates a tumor microenvironment that obstructs cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways by down-regulating interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to resistance to STING agonists. Targeting polyamine biosynthesis reverses IRF3 down-regulation, restoring sensitivity to STING agonists in MTAP-deficient tumors. Our findings suggest that MTAP genetic status may inform patient responses to STING agonist therapy and offer an alternative strategy for boosting antitumor immune responses using STING agonists in MTAP -deleted tumors.",

We developed SalicS1, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor specific to SA. SalicS1 enables real-time, reversible monitoring of SA levels in vivo with minimal perturbation of endogenous signaling.

By using a private sensory channel through ultrasonic echolocation, prolonged chasing, and mid-air prey consumption, these predators can hunt nocturnally migrating passerines at high altitudes and therefore exploit a rich food resource that remains largely inaccessible to most predators.",

Yet, some key challenges remain, ranging from limited speeds in ferromagnets to intrinsic volatility of switched domains owing to depolarizing fields in ferroelectrics. Unlike these ferroic systems, ferroaxial materials host bistable states that preserve spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry and are therefore immune to depolarizing fields but also difficult to manipulate with conventional methods. We demonstrate photo-induced switching of ferroaxial order by engineering an effective axial field composed of circularly driven terahertz phonon modes. A switched ferroaxial domain remains stable for many hours and can be reversed back with a second terahertz pulse of opposite helicity. The effects demonstrated in this work may lead to the development of a robust platform for ultrafast information storage.",

A major roadblock for further power scaling of single-frequency fiber laser amplifiers is stimulated Brillouin scattering. Efforts have been made to mitigate this nonlinear process, but these were mostly limited to single-mode or few-mode fiber amplifiers, which have good beam quality. Here, we explored a highly multimode fiber amplifier in which stimulated Brillouin scattering was greatly suppressed due to a reduction of light intensity in a large fiber core and a broadening of the Brillouin scattering spectrum by multimode excitation. By applying a spatial wavefront shaping technique to the input light of a nonlinear amplifier, the output beam was focused to a diffraction-limited spot. Our multimode fiber amplifier can operate at high power with high efficiency and narrow linewidth, which ensures high coherence. Optical wavefront shaping enables coherent control of multimode laser amplification, with potential applications in coherent beam combining, large-scale interferometry and directed energy delivery.",

We show that Bacteroides DGRs are horizontally transferred across species, display activity levels ranging from high to low, and preferentially alter the functional characteristics of ligand-binding residues on adhesive organelles. Specific variable protein sequences are enriched when Bacteroides strains compete with other commensal bacteria in gnotobiotic mice. Analysis of &gt;2700 DGRs from diverse phyla in mother-infant pairs shows that Bacteroides DGRs are disproportionately transferred to vaginally delivered infants where they actively diversify.

We find that naked mole-rat cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) lacks the suppressive function of human or mouse homologs in homologous recombination repair through the alteration of four amino acids during evolution. The changes enable cGAS to retain chromatin longer upon DNA damage by weakening TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination and interaction with the segregase P97. Prolonged chromatin binding of cGAS enhanced the interaction between repair factors FANCI and RAD50 to facilitate RAD50 recruitment to damage sites, thereby potentiating homologous recombination repair. Moreover, the four amino acids mediate the function of cGAS in antagonizing cellular and tissue aging and extending life span. Manipulating cGAS might therefore constitute a mechanism for life-span extension.",

To understand how cancer cells adapt to such challenges, we conducted sequential CRISPR screens to identify genes that affect cellular fitness under specific metabolic stress conditions in cell culture and to then probe their relevance in pancreatic tumors. Comparative analyses of hundreds of fitness genes revealed that cancer metabolism in vivo was shaped by bioenergetic adaptations to tumor acidosis. Mechanistically, acidosis suppressed cytoplasmic activity of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), thereby preventing oncogene-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and promoting fused mitochondria. The resulting boost in mitochondrial respiration supported cancer cell adaptations to various metabolic stresses. Thus, acidosis is an environmental factor that alters energy metabolism to promote stress resilience in cancer.",

          "abstract": "Current optical memory technologies face critical challenges, including limited precision in multistate control, energy inefficiency, and inadequate adaptability across diverse material platforms. To directly address these issues, this study introduces a noncontact approach by exploiting the unique properties of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. The distinctive longitudinal electric field generated by OAM light substantially enhances the density of trap states in materials such as molybdenum disulfide, as the primary material for investigation, and others as supplementary examples. This enhancement enables precise modulation of key device characteristics, including readout current, hysteresis window, and charge storage capacity, with quantitative behavior accurately modeled by the Poole-Frenkel effect. Our results reveal the transformative potential of OAM light in enabling multilevel memory states with exceptional tunability and versatility across different material systems. This work underscores the viability of OAM-driven memory as a platform for the next generation of highly functional, optically responsive memory devices.",

Standard thermodynamics, initially developed for uncorrelated macroscopic systems, does not hold for microscopic systems correlated with their environments. We here derive an exact formula for the efficiency of any cyclically driven quantum engine by using generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties, including initial correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and an athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.",

          "abstract": "Environmental stress represents an effective strategy for discovering natural products from microorganisms, but the processes involved remain unclear. Under acidic conditions, a previously unidentified class of β-carbolines (βCs), termed secofumitremorgins (SFs), with potent antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish models was found and identified via nuclear magnetic resonance, Marfey’s analysis, and quantum calculations. Using gene knockout, heterologous expression, precursor feeding, isotope tracing, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis, a unique biosynthetic pathway for SFs was characterized, beyond the Pictet-Spenglerase–mediated biosynthetic process. Furthermore, an unreported pH-regulated mechanism was unveiled, where P450 (FtmG) facilitated new fumitremorgin intermediate formation, enabling spontaneous, nonenzymatic generation of βCs and spirotryprostatins under distinct pH conditions. Notably, this work provides detailed experimental evidence and reaction mechanisms for synergistic enzymatic and nonenzymatic catalysis driving metabolite diversification under pH stress. The findings expand biosynthetic paradigms for indole alkaloids and highlight the therapeutic potential of pH-elicited βCs, advancing strategies for natural product discovery.",

We report a plasmon-induced route to plasmonic-polymer hybrid nanomaterials using in operando single-particle spectroelectrochemistry. An energy transfer efficiency of 40% is achievable when the spectral overlap between gold nanorod scattering and polymer absorption is maximized. We also show that PIRET-initiated polymerization proceeds through a different mechanism than bulk polymerization, supported by spectroscopic evidence and density functional theory calculations, highlighting efficient energy cascading from photon to plasmon to exciton and, lastly, to unconventional light-initiated chemistry.",

The limited or delayed fallout from Ivy Mike (1952 CE) compared to Operation Castle (1954 CE), despite their detonation in close proximity, exemplifies how stratospheric circulation and seasonal dynamics create periods of reduced transport to Antarctica. These records also reveal seasonal fallout patterns in Antarctica, with enhanced deposition during austral summers driven by stratosphere-troposphere exchange. Our findings refine current representations of global aerosol dispersion and provide additional constraints for modeling atmospheric processes, particularly those driven by volcanic eruptions and geoengineering interventions.",

In this study, we fabricated a photodetector optimized for UVA detection based on a fully transparent p-n junction photodiode architecture. A multijunction structure was designed using SnO 2 /ZnO as n-type oxide semiconductors and CoO x combined with defect-engineered HfO x as p-type semiconductors, with ITO serving as the cathode. The photodiode exhibited excellent photoresponse in the 340 to 350 nm wavelength range, with an average visible transmittance of ~75% and a responsivity of 80.1 mA W −1 . Furthermore, the device enables real-time UVA monitoring under sunlight, demonstrating strong potential for applications in wearable UVA sensing and skin protection health care systems.",

We examined whether T2D β cell dysfunction can be rescued, charted the underlying molecular mechanisms by RNA sequencing, and mined transcriptomes for drug targets. Glucose responsiveness of T2D β cells improved in 60% of preparations after 3-day culture in euglycemic conditions. This was accompanied by changes in expression of &gt;400 genes involved in functional or inflammatory pathways. Drug repurposing and target identification analyses predicted chemical and genetic hits, including JAK inhibitors, which were validated in a β cell line, human islets, and db/db mice. Therefore, defective β cell glucose responsiveness in T2D can recover, demonstrating β cell functional plasticity. The recovery associates with transcriptomic traits, pointing to targetable defects to induce T2D remission.",

          "abstract": "Homologous chromosome pairing is a critical prerequisite for successful meiosis, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. In Caenorhabditis elegans , chromosome pairing centers (PCs) and PC-recruited proteins mediate homolog recognition and pairing. Here, we further dissect the molecular characteristics of this system and reveal the involvement of a phase-separated compartment in pairing. Focusing on the PC protein HIM-8, we explored its functional domains in vivo and its self-multimerizing properties in vitro. We find that the amino-terminal domain facilitates PC chromatin binding of the carboxyl-terminal domain, whereas the middle unstructured region is essential for PC association with the nuclear envelop (NE). Integrated analyses suggest that PC-NE association is mediated by a DNA-containing phase-separated compartment that is spatially distinct from, but connected to, the chromosome axis—likely through flexible linkages. We propose that homology evaluation occurs within this compartment, where direct DNA-DNA interactions could play a role.",

The proteasome clears these proteins, but its failure in disease remains unclear. We engineered a  Caenorhabditis elegans  model with a hyperactive 20 S proteasome (α3ΔN) for selective 20 S activation. α3ΔN markedly enhanced IDP and misfolded protein degradation, reduced oxidative damage, and improved endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD). Aggregation-prone substrates such as vitellogenins and human alpha-1 antitrypsin (ATZ) were efficiently cleared. Integrated proteomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal systemic adaptations featuring increased protein turnover and oxidative stress resistance independent of superoxide dismutases (SODs). Notably, α3ΔN extended life span and stress resistance independently of canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling via xbp-1 . These findings substantiate a “20 S pathway” of proteostasis that directly alleviates protein aggregation and oxidative stress, offering a promising therapeutic angle for neurodegenerative diseases.",

Plasma profiling from patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and ischemic murine muscle revealed dysregulated lipid metabolism, including elevated APOA1 binding protein ( AIBP), with levels positively correlating with PAD severity. Myeloid cells enriched at CC sites increased AIBP expression postischemia. Genetic deletion of AIBP expanded CXCR4⁺ capillary endothelial cells ( CECs) with stemlike and proliferative properties that remodeled into functional collaterals, a process blocked by CXCR4 inhibition. Mechanistically, AIBP bound the endocytic receptor LRP2 to promote endothelial uptake of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)–associated miR-223, a repressor of CXCR4. Disruption of this AIBP–LRP2–HDL–miR-223 axis restored CXCR4 and rescued CC growth. These findings define a two-phase mechanism in which stemlike CECs first expand and then transition to arterial fates, establishing a therapeutic strategy for revascularization in ischemic vascular disease.",

          "abstract": "The topography of Madagascar reflects a dynamic history of water divide migration, initially driven by rift events on both coasts separated by ~80 million years and later modified by Late Cenozoic volcanic and tectonic activity. This study examines how rifting-induced tilting of an escarpment-plateau landscape led to changes in drainage area and water divide positions. Combining topographic analysis and erosion rates inferred from cosmogenic isotope concentrations, we document a westward-tilted low-relief plateau with sinuous remnant escarpments along the western margin and a linear, high-relief escarpment corresponding to the modern drainage divide on the eastern margin. Our numerical modeling demonstrates that landscape asymmetry and contrasting escarpment morphology can result from a shift in the main water divide across the island during the second rifting event. These mechanistic processes allow us to reconstruct the landscape evolution of Madagascar over more than 100 million years with profound implications for the topography, hydrology, and biodiversity development of passive continental margins.",

          "abstract": "Arsenic is a potent carcinogen whose presence in groundwater poses a persistent global public health threat. While groundwater treatment mitigates arsenic exposure, it generates concentrated arsenic-rich by-products that are universally considered economic and environmental burdens. However, arsenic is experiencing a renaissance. Both the United States and European Union have classified arsenic as a critical raw material (CRM) due to the role of metallic arsenic [As(0)] in materials needed for digital infrastructure and clean energy systems. Bringing these two material flows together, we show that arsenic removed during groundwater treatment can be transformed into pure amorphous As(0) nanoparticles via a two-stage process of alkali extraction and selective reduction. The creation of valuable CRMs from carcinogenic treatment by-products is a potentially disruptive technology for the water sector that can alter global As(0) supply chains. Revenue from upcycled As(0) can also help improve the challenging economics of water treatment in marginalized arsenic-affected regions.",

The spatial complexities in swarm evolution and earthquake rupture have been observed, but the factors controlling these complexities remain unclear. Using high-resolution subsurface imaging with dense seismic observation, we identified a high-velocity body collocated with the major slip zone, which the preceding swarm avoided. The spatial distribution and absolute velocity of the high-velocity body and the adjacent ring-shaped swarm cluster indicate that the high-velocity body is a solidified ancient magma. It initially acted as an impermeable barrier to the fluid migrations that triggered swarm earthquakes, eventually rupturing as an asperity of the 2024 earthquake. Our observation suggests that the heterogeneity in fault zone permeability, originating from ancient volcanic activity (&gt;15 million years ago), controlled the present-day swarm evolution and the large earthquake generation.",

Here, we present a hydrogel platform that enables spatiotemporal modulation of toughness through a latent ionic cross-linking mechanism. By embedding calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) microparticles in alginate/polyacrylamide double-network hydrogels, we create a system where localized calcium release and thus ionic cross-linking can be programmed in both space and time. Spatial control is achieved by direct ink writing of CaCO 3 , while temporal activation is triggered by glucono-δ-lactone, a biocompatible acidifier that releases calcium on demand. This strategy allows user-defined tuning of stiffness and toughness, enabling fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels with tailored mechanical profiles. The resulting materials offer a versatile platform for anisotropic impact shielding, directional strain sensing, and 3D-printed tissue adhesives, representing a paradigm shift for adaptive, reconfigurable, and multifunctional soft materials.",

Our analyses reveal that diversity is consistently linked to stability through dual pathways: positively associated with resistance and resilience via indirect structural mediation, yet negatively correlated with local stability unless interaction strength is accounted for. Critically, omitting structural mediation yields a net negative diversity-stability correlation, whereas integrating food web structure uncovers context-dependent positive relationships, underscoring structural metrics as pivotal explanatory variables.

Although higher-order Markov models can capture these effects, they grow rapidly in size and require large amounts of data, making them prone to overfitting some parts and underfitting others in systems with uneven coverage. To address this challenge, we construct concise networks from path data by interpolating between first-order and second-order Markov models. We prioritize simplicity and interpretability by creating state nodes that capture prominent second-order effects and by proposing a transparent measure that balances model size and quality. Our concise networks reveal large-scale memory patterns in both synthetic and real-world systems while remaining far simpler than full second-order models.",

Long thought to require full machinery spatiotemporal coordination to drive the flat-to-round vesicle transformations, we reveal a notably simple initiation mechanism in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells involving only the final step, the pore closure. During calcium-triggered exocytosis, calcium activates the phosphatase synaptojanin, rapidly converting PI(4,5)P 2 to PI4P. Elevated PI4P drives the fission enzyme dynamin to close the pores of preexisting and exocytosis-generated Ω-profiles, which are sufficient to generate slow, fast, ultrafast, overshoot, and bulk endocytosis, and kiss-and-run (fusion pore closure). These findings resolve the long-standing mystery of endocytosis and fission initiation and reveal PI4P, not the widely assumed PI(4,5)P 2 , as the key lipid for dynamin-mediated fission. This pathway is clinically important, as it is impaired by synaptojanin mutations associated with Parkinson’s disease and seizures, and is likely disrupted in other disorders involving PI4P or PI(4,5)P 2 dysregulation.",

The resultant inactivation stabilizes regulators of G protein signaling (RGS4 and RGS5) that ADO normally marks for proteolysis, explaining the drug’s vasodilatory activity and comporting with observations of diminished RGS levels in both clinical preeclampsia and a mouse model thereof. Its inhibition of ADO suggested use of HYZ against glioblastoma (GBM); indeed, a single dose robustly senesces cultured GBM cells.

We addressed this issue by acquiring functional near-infrared spectroscopy data from infants aged 3 to 9 months with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The SNHL infants showed efficient small-world characteristics within each hemisphere. However, unlike typically developing controls, who showed an age-related leftward lateralization of network efficiencies, SNHL infants did not exhibit the emergence of hemispheric asymmetry. Intriguingly, lateralization of frontal efficiency was preserved in SNHL infants with mild hearing loss but declined significantly with increasing severity of hearing impairment. These findings suggest that even SNHL infants with some residual hearing experience disruption in the development of functional lateralization. This underscores the importance of providing early auditory access to SNHL infants to support robust functional integration during early development.",

We demonstrate that shear stress generated by fluid flow beneath a rising bubble is the primary mechanism for cell detachment.

However, the planetary parameters of the four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different mechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar structures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing the phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and subrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our analysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of equatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance.

Otoferlin is essential for IHC exocytosis, but how it binds Ca 2+ and the target membrane to serve synaptic vesicle (SV) tethering, docking, and fusion remained unclear. Here, we obtained cryo–electron microscopy structures of otoferlin and employed molecular dynamics simulations of membrane binding. We show that membrane binding by otoferlin involves C 2 B-C 2 G domains and repositions C 2 F and C 2 G domains. Disruption of Ca 2+ -binding sites of the C 2 D domain in mice altered synaptic sound encoding and eliminated the Ca 2+ cooperativity of IHC exocytosis, indicating that it requires the binding of several Ca 2+ -ions by otoferlin. Together, our findings elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying otoferlin-mediated SV docking and support the role of otoferlin as Ca 2+ sensor of SV fusion in IHCs.",

Integrated with tip growth, the robot achieves complex, reversible morphologies and frictionless follow-the-leader navigation. Mechanics and kinematics models reveal how friction and input sequences govern shape evolution and expand the robot’s configuration space. Experiments validate dexterous morphing and robust navigation in unstructured environments.

Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the α7 nAChR in complex with nicotine in both an open state and multiple desensitized states. Comparative analyses reveal progressive conformational changes during recovery from nicotine-induced desensitization and show that asymmetric nicotine binding disrupts the symmetry of the channel pore at the 16′ and 17′ sites. Integrating these findings with patch-clamp recordings and computational simulations, we identify an agonist-free structure that represents an atypical desensitized state closely resembling the resting conformation of α7 nAChR. These detailed mechanistic studies enhance our understanding of nicotine’s effects on α7 nAChRs.",

Here we report genome-wide data of two Early Neolithic (EN) hunter-gatherers and 19 Middle-Late Bronze Age (MLBA) pastoralists, from the site of Koken in the Upper Irtysh River region in eastern Kazakhstan. We find that the two EN individuals differed in their genetic profiles and yet were second-degree relatives. They were genetically most similar to subsequent Neolithic individuals in the Irtysh region, while contemporaneous hunter-gatherers from the Tobol-Ishim and Upper Ob River regions had distinct genetic profiles, likely influenced by riverine geography. The Koken MLBA individuals were genetically similar to other MLBA steppe pastoralists, while genetic outliers provide evidence of two distinct trajectories of admixture with local hunter-gatherer populations. These findings illuminate the dynamic population structure of Inner Asian hunter-gatherers and their genetic legacy in subsequent pastoralist populations.",

This design enables large bending angles (&gt;100°) at multiple points along the robot’s length. We investigate the effects of internal pressure and actuator temperature as control inputs for steering and demonstrate the potential of our design for practical applications, such as surgical procedures and inspection tasks.

Previous platforms have mainly focused on scalar computing with optical intensities, which is highly sensitive to environmental disturbance and has been primarily restricted to single or basic computations because of intrinsic fixed correlation between the input and output signals. To our knowledge, for the first time, we use polarization vectors for optical analog computing with a single-layered metasurface to overcome these restrictions. The underlying mechanism is on-demand polarization transformation on the dispersive Poincaré spheres, constructing intrinsic variable correlations between the incident polarization vectors and output signals. We choose the universal logical gates and mathematical function operations as two specific examples. Experimental results of our vector computing metadevices exhibit minimal errors relative to the target values.

Through observational analysis and numerical model experiments, we demonstrate that positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) can intensify TSEA coastal MHWs during austral summer through two distinct processes. First, pIOD induces westerly wind anomalies over the equatorial Atlantic, causing thermocline deepening along the TSEA coast through oceanic Kelvin waves, favoring development of MHWs. Second, pIOD enhances rainfall over central Africa, increasing Congo River discharge and resulting in a shallower mixed layer in the TSEA coastal region, also promoting MHW formation. We further develop an empirical model using pIOD as the predictor for TSEA MHWs, demonstrating high predictive skill with a 3-month lead time. In a warming climate, the remote influence of pIOD on TSEA MHWs may be further exacerbated, underscoring critical need to incorporate this factor into marine hazard forecasting for the region.",

The causative NLRs [resistance to Melanaphis sorghi 1A (RMES1A) and RMES1B] lack signaling domains and have adenosine triphosphatase mutations expected to abrogate function, suggesting that RMES1 NLRs regulate immunity via a noncanonical mechanism. The RMES1 NLR family is ancient, orthologous to phloem-feeding resistance genes in rice and syntenic across the grass superpangenome. Thus, gene birth-and-death processes at an ancient gene cluster created rare standing variation and provided the adaptive allele for evolutionary rescue.",

We studied binding and pore formation of NLPs in model membranes with GIPCs derived from dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plants. Using the cytotoxic NLP 2 from fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa (MpNEP2), we show that membrane binding and damage extend beyond previously studied oomycetal NLPs. Furthermore, NLP Pya from the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum exhibits promiscuous binding with a marked preference for branched GIPC series B lipids. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the structural plasticity of NLP Pya provides a rational basis for its interaction with a variety of GIPC headgroups.

Here, we report an axial-coordination activation strategy to unlock this reactivity space in Co-MHAT catalysis. Through stoichiometric organometallic studies using well-defined alkyl–Co III complexes, we demonstrate that an alkoxide ligand can render alkyl–Co III sufficiently nucleophilic to displace a suitable leaving group, via a stereospecific backside-backside approach.

Ubiquitin-specific protease 21 (USP21), one of four major H2AK119-specific deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes. However, the mechanisms by which USP21 specifically deubiquitinates H2AK119ub and is regulated are unknown. We determined the cryo-EM structure of the USP21 catalytic domain bound to an H2AK119ub nucleosome, which revealed a recognition mode that differs from that of other H2AK119-specific DUBs. We unexpectedly found that the N-terminal IDR of USP21 inhibits the enzyme’s activity. Using AlphaFold-Multimer to perform a virtual screen of USP21 interactors, we identified kinases that phosphorylate the USP21 IDR and thereby relieve autoinhibition. AlphaFold3 modeling of USP21 suggests a structural model for autoinhibition. AlphaFold analysis suggests that phosphorylation-regulated autoinhibition may be a feature of various USP enzymes. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of H2AK119 deubiquitination and reveal a previously unexplored mode of phosphorylation-dependent DUB autoregulation.",

Its frontline treatment uses the BH3 mimetic venetoclax to trigger mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. However, drug resistance nearly always develops, calling for therapies to circumvent it. Advanced microscopy and genome-wide CRISPRi screen analyses pinpointed mitochondrial adaptations primarily mediated by the master regulator of cristae shape optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) as critical for BH3 mimetics resistance. Resistant AML cells up-regulate OPA1 to modify their mitochondrial structure and evade apoptosis. MYLS22 and Opitor-0, two specific and nontoxic OPA1 inhibitors, promote apoptotic cristae remodeling and cytochrome c release, synergizing with venetoclax in AML cells and xenografts derived from AML patients ex vivo and in vivo. Mechanistically, OPA1 loss renders AML cells dependent on glutamine and sensitizes them to ferroptosis by activating ATF4-regulated integrated stress responses. Overall, our data clarify how OPA1 up-regulation allows AML cells' metabolic flexibility and survival and nominates specific OPA1 inhibitors as efficacious tools to overcome venetoclax resistance in leukemia.",

We demonstrate a strategy to introduce and tune Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) to unprecedented magnitudes in inversion-symmetric solids by incorporating ultrasmall silver nanoparticles in bulk gold. The near-identical lattice constants of Ag and Au allow dense packing of the Ag/Au hetero-interfaces without compromising the global BIS. By varying the density of embedded nanoparticles, we generate Rashba SOI in a bulk metal with coupling strength ~15 meV∙Å, higher than any known system preserving BIS globally, and show up to ~20 times increase in the spin-orbit scattering rate.

In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, CITED exhibited robust therapeutic efficacy, resulting in reduced disease progression, improved motor function, and diminished myelin damage. Mechanistic studies reveal that CITED exerts its therapeutic effects by targeted reprogramming of both innate and adaptive immune responses in CNS.

We provide an observational verification of the physical link between global precipitation and net atmospheric radiative cooling.

Trends of longwave cooling and shortwave heating are 0.76 ± 0.48 and 0.64 ± 0.27 Wm −2 dec -1 , respectively. The longwave trend is a result of partial cancelation among contributions from increasing surface skin temperature, air temperature, and water vapor. Increasing shortwave absorption is caused by increasing water vapor. The trend of global mean diabatic heating by precipitation is 0.03 ± 0.61 Wm −2 dec −1 .

          "abstract": "Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), the most common severe cyanotic congenital heart disease, has unclear genetic causes. Through next-generation sequencing in 131 patients with nonsyndromic TOF, we identified an increased burden of rare deleterious variants in ciliary genes and cilium pathway and observed a multigenic inheritance pattern, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.672 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.120 to 2.547; P  = 0.0104] for more than two deleterious variants and a cumulative OR of 3.158 (95% CI, 1.381 to 6.371; P  = 0.0038) for six variants. Functional validation in single- and double-heterozygous mouse models carrying these variants recapitulated TOF-like phenotypes and impaired normal cilia structure and function, particularly disrupting Hedgehog signaling in cardiomyocytes, and down-regulating key transcription factors Gata4 and Nkx2-5 . Together, our study provides compelling evidence linking ciliary gene variants to a heightened risk of TOF in Han Chinese, offering valuable genetic insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of nonsyndromic TOF and supporting a multigenic inheritance model for the disease.",

          "abstract": "From single cells to humans, ciliary arrays exhibit diverse coordination patterns that are essential to normal physiology. A major open question is how cilia self-organize into metachronal waves, where neighboring cilia beat with the same beat pattern but slightly differing phase. In marine invertebrate larvae, cilia are arranged ornately in arrays or bands, which propagate mesmerizing metachronal waves for swimming motility. Here, we investigate ciliary metachronism in larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerelii , using whole-body high-speed imaging and physical and biological manipulations. The results reveal an unexpected wave structure featuring strong coupling within multiciliated cells that breaks down across cell boundaries. Using laser ablation to selectively remove parts of the ciliary band, we establish the necessity and sufficiency of ciliary band continuity for wave transmission and the importance of nonreciprocal steric interactions. Taking advantage of neuronally controlled whole-body ciliary arrests, we also reveal the dynamics of wave cessation and reestablishment.",

Inspired by foxtail grass, we developed a magnetically actuated liquid-infused slippery microcatheter (LISMC) with artificial cilia. Its soft magnetic cilia and hydrogel coating allow smooth traversal of luminal surfaces, reducing friction by two-thirds compared to conventional designs. Magnetic cilium oscillation enhances adaptability to complex pathways and minimizes friction during navigation. As a proof of concept, the LISMC precisely deployed helical microswimmers to the bile duct and actuated them downstream for x-ray–guided treatment of acute pancreatitis with rabbit models.

Although poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) benefit a subset of patients with mCRPC and BRCA1/2 deficiencies, therapeutic options remain limited for those without such mutations. Here, we uncover a critical role for the ATM-TRMT10A-BRCA1 signaling axis in regulating homologous recombination (HR) repair and PARPi sensitivity. We demonstrate that ATM phosphorylates TRMT10A at serine-28 after DNA damage, promoting BRCA1 recruitment and efficient HR repair. TRMT10A deletion disrupts HR repair, sensitizing cells to PARPis. Moreover, TRMT10A is up-regulated in mCRPC through stabilization by USP10. Targeting USP10 with spautin-1 induces TRMT10A degradation and enhances tumor sensitivity to PARPis in cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenograft models. These findings identify TRMT10A as a therapeutic vulnerability in mCRPC and demonstrate that combined inhibition of PARP and USP10 offers a promising synthetic lethal strategy for a broader group of patients lacking classical BRCA mutations.",

We define accommodation quantitatively as mean thickness of potential deposition per unit of time, calculated per unit area based on a maximum deposition rate and slope-controlled probabilities of erosion and deposition. Testing this definition in a simple numerical stratigraphic forward model reproduces key stratal geometries and behaviors, suggesting basic predictive power. However, the model output is missing much stratigraphic detail, and it is difficult to see how this can be added through extension of the accommodation definition. This suggests that accommodation has less predictive power than typically assumed; many important elements of stratal prediction must come instead from independent calculation of sediment erosion, routing, and depositional processes.",

However, their functional potential is often limited by the intrinsic constraints of conventional host materials, which typically lack sufficient flexibility in defect engineering, magnetic modulation, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) enhancement. To address this challenge, we introduce high-entropy metal oxides (HEMOs) into carbon-based chiral frameworks, constructing HEMO and carbon nanocoil (HEMO@CNC) composites. By combining advanced microscopy, electromagnetic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is revealed that increasing entropy and helical strain jointly induce nonlinear changes in SOC strength and defect-related localized states. Benefiting from these effects, the HEMO@CNC system achieves an ultrawide bandwidth, outperforming linear structures and low-entropy systems. This work provides a potential paradigm for integrating topological defect engineering and high-entropy quantum modulation, offering deeper insights into advancing electromagnetic functional materials from macroscopic design toward geometry-defect-spin synergistic regulation.",

K. rhaeticus produces the bacterial cellulose (BC) matrix that integrates Bacillus spores within, whereas the confined spores keep dormant and are resistant to harsh conditions in the environment. Bacillus spores can germinate and confer desired functions to the materials. Modulating the binding affinity of spores to the BC matrix with genetic engineering can improve cell loading and therefore enhance the material functionality.

Combined with our parameter-efficient miniset self-attention block, this enables QuAN to access high-order moments of bit-string distributions and preferentially attend to less noisy snapshots. We test QuAN across three quantum simulation settings: driven hard-core Bose-Hubbard model, random quantum circuits, and toric code under coherent and incoherent noise. QuAN directly learns entanglement and state complexity growth from experimental computational basis measurements, including complexity growth in random circuits from noisy data.

Small RNA–mediated targeting remains functional across varying small RNA lengths and is compatible with heterozygous sites. These small RNAs are cleaved by Dicer-like ribonuclease from long noncoding RNAs, which are bidirectionally transcribed of somatic chromosomes, initiated at subtelomeric chromosome breakage sequences (5′-TTGAA-3′).

OsSPDT forms a domain-swapped homodimer with each protomer containing an N-terminal domain (NTD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) divided into core and gate subdomains, and a C-terminal sulfate transporter and antisigma factor (STAS) domain. The structure adopts a cytoplasm-facing conformation with Pi coordinated at the core-gate interface. Key residues, including SPDT-unique Ser 170 , mediate Pi specificity within the binding pocket, distinguishing it evolutionarily from sulfate transporters within the SULTR family.

Here, we present a hybrid platform that enables comprehensive dc and ac analog signal processing within a 2D-ACT device. By synergistically integrating 2D-FET and SAW components, our system achieves real-time subwavelength carrier monitoring and ac signal manipulation. ac measurements further elucidate mechanisms of dc acoustoelectric current generation. Notably, by controlling the phase and intensity of counter-propagating SAWs, we demonstrate analog signal addition and subtraction capabilities not previously realized in 2D-ACT devices. This platform establishes a benchmark for compact, low-loss ACT devices in ac signal processing, representing a notable advance for acoustoelectric technologies and 2D material systems.",

          "abstract": "The rate of DNA synthesis is crucial for full DNA duplication. We report a key role of p21 in controlling this rate. During normal replication, p21 promotes nascent DNA synthesis alongside the DNA polymerase iota (Pol ι)/p53 complex. When p21 is down-regulated but detectable, nascent DNA tracks are longer and discontinuous and rely on primase and DNA polymerase (PrimPol). With the complete elimination of p21, nascent DNA tracks become shorter and continuous and depend on Pol kappa (κ). Endogenous p21 levels are critical for genomic stability, as both PrimPol- and Pol κ–mediated syntheses can induce chromosomal instability. The residual expression of p21 in p53-null cells influences the involvement of PrimPol or Pol κ in nascent DNA synthesis and subsequent chromosomal instability. Our results demonstrate that endogenous levels of p21 in cycling cells, insufficient for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition, prevent genomic instability through proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding (PCNA), limiting PrimPol and Pol κ’s role in nascent DNA synthesis.",

Here, we develop theranostic bacteria by depositing a protective visual therapeutic nanocoating via in situ sequential mineralization. Using two-step metal ion adsorption and nucleation, bacterial surface is successively mineralized with an inner manganese dioxide/ferric oxide nanoparticle layer and an outer calcium carbonate layer. Upon ingestion, the outer layer neutralizes gastric acid through double-decomposition reaction, protecting bacterial viability and the inner layer. During intestinal passage, the inner layer enables T1/T2 dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging for real-time tracking, whereas the lesion-triggered release of manganese ions allows T1 single-mode pathological detection. The inner layer also exhibits superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, synergizing therapeutic effects with bacteria. Further supported by satisfactory performances in two murine models of Salmonella -induced colitis and apolipoprotein E–deficient atherosclerosis, this work provides a platform to generate innovative theranostic agents for advanced bacteriotherapy.",

These effects are linked to protective pathways, including those for oxidative stress and autophagy, and depend on the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor.

Mechanistically, photocatalytically generated hydrogen induces robust immunogenic cell death by triggering severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Concurrently, photosynthetic oxygen production and photocatalytic lactic acid depletion collaboratively alleviate immunosuppression within the TME, thereby enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and promoting the repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to the M1 phenotype. In vivo studies demonstrate that PCC@AuNP not only eradicates primary tumors but also elicits potent systemic antitumor immunity against distant lesions, without observable toxicity to healthy tissues.

Here, we use deep learning and two decades’ worth of orbital images to track the global, diurnal, and seasonal migration patterns of dust devils across Mars, providing a distributed characterization of the dynamics of near-surface winds. Across Mars, derived wind stresses systematically exceed those predicted by global circulation models and frequently surpass the threshold required to initiate particle saltation and the lifting of dust. We identify instances of fast-moving dust devils, indicating strong near-surface winds, that are colocated with large-scale dust lifting events and storms. Our observations show that strong near-surface winds are abundant on Mars and play an important role in atmospheric dust sourcing, directly informing more accurate models of Mars’ atmosphere, weather, and climate.",

Specifically, we identify the indispensable role of glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to the prelimbic cortex (PrL) for the development of vicarious pain hypersensitivity. MS dampens activation of the PVT → PrL pathway during social interactions between observer and painful demonstrator. Augmenting the excitability or activity of the PVT → PrL circuit through chemogenetic interventions or tactile stimulation resembling social touch significantly ameliorates the MS-evoked contagious pain deficits.

Genetic perturbation of AMPAR function and optogenetic control bidirectionally shifted the anemo-discrimination learning pace, with contrasting phenotypes observed for odor learning, engagement of inhibitory circuits, and setting the optimal inhibition level for stimulus refinement.

We develop a three-component (ThrCo) LNP by replacing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids in Pfizer-BioNTech LNPs with zwitterionic pyridine carboxybetaine (PyCB) ionizable lipids (ILs), achieving ~70% lower liver accumulation and a 4.5-fold increase in spleen-specific mRNA translation. PyCB ILs enhance LNP hydrophilicity, stabilizing the outer membrane to compensate for cholesterol removal. PyCB groups also exhibit strong protonation at endosomal pH, facilitating mRNA translation. The zwitterionic surface of ThrCo LNP reduces protein adsorption, thereby preventing the accelerated blood clearance effect caused by PEGylated lipids following repeated administrations.

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer and liver metastases are a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Overexpression of the immunostimulatory cytokine TNFSF14/LIGHT associates with improved survival and correlates with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients and a clinically relevant model of colorectal liver metastases. We demonstrate that LIGHT monotherapy activates T cells, but also induces T cell exhaustion and the recruitment of immunosuppressive elements. As colorectal liver metastases exhibit high levels of CTLA-4 expression, we combined LIGHT overexpression with anti-CTLA-4, leading to complete tumor control. The combination functions by homing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, inducing tumor antigen-specific T cells, and reversing T cell exhaustion. Whereas both LIGHT overexpression and anti-CTLA-4 increase tumor-promoting macrophages, the combination eliminates this population. The ability of LIGHT overexpression combined with CTLA-4 inhibition to reverse T cell exhaustion and myeloid cell suppression is supported by analysis of complementary patient cohorts and has strong clinical relevance, especially given that liver metastases contribute to immunotherapy resistance across various cancer types.",

It achieves dual-modal imaging at a 10-hertz frame rate and completes a whole-breast scan in 12 seconds, providing penetration up to 5 centimeters in vivo. In a clinical study involving 170 patients with 186 breast tumors, we developed a diagnostic model leveraging combined photoacoustic and ultrasound features. In a triple-blinded comparison using pathological diagnosis as the ground truth, HDMI significantly improved diagnostic specificity from 22.5 to 75.0% compared to clinical ultrasonography.

However, once prototyped, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)–based silicone elastomer is limited in mechanical strength and programmable spatial construction due to the flexible polymer matrix and mismatched interface with other materials. We propose a mechanically strengthened PDMS-based origami structure (MSOS) via polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/acetone solution swelling. The planar elastomer precursor can be swollen-folded into programmable spatial construction based on mechanically strengthened creases during solvent diffusion and de-gelatinization. This strengthened crease is induced by a hierarchical shrink-fitting based on solute molecular chain insertion and a seamless coupling interface between elastomer microstructures and solidified PMMA. We present a programmable MSOS to support a load more than 58,100 times of its own weight and a pillbug-inspired ringbot to resist heavy impact. Our work provides a strategy toward customized mechanically strengthened soft material for developing functional structural architectures and soft origami robots.",

Herein, we show that microdroplet interfaces with strong electric fields (10 9 volts per meter) substantially extend the lifespan of e aq − generated from industrial sulfite pollutants (SO 3 2− ), lowering energy barriers in the CO 2 reduction reaction and enabling targeted product formation. The machine learning strategy identified microdroplet size as the key parameter controlling electric field strength, product yield, and selectivity. In our lab-based scaled-up system, microdroplets &lt;10 micrometers improved performance by four to seven orders of magnitude over bulk-phase systems, achieving ~99% methanol selectivity. Strong interfacial electric fields stabilize intermediates and modulate carbon-oxygen bond lengths, directing pathways to high-value products.

We targeted the fibrinogen-related protein 3.1 ( FREP3.1 ) gene, confirmed stable germline transmission of the mutated gene, and established two different homozygous FREP3.1 -edited lines. Disruption of the FREP 3.1 gene did not alter snail susceptibility to Schistosoma mansoni infection, possibly due to a limited role of FREP3.1 in resistance or to functional redundancy and/or compensatory expression within the highly diverse FREP gene family.

We developed an automated radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking system to continuously collect behavioral data from entire colonies, monitoring 102 individuals from five colonies for 30 days. Based on behavioral parameters, we statistically identified distinct behavioral phenotypes, comprising one cluster for breeders and six clusters for nonbreeders. Breeders formed strong social bonds, consistently remaining close in activity rhythm synchrony, spatial proximity, and directional following. In contrast, nonbreeders exhibited behavioral heterogeneity according to their cluster: One cluster avoided other active nonbreeders, whereas another cluster attracted frequent following. Our study highlights social complexity in this eusocial mammal and establishes a robust platform for further investigations into naked mole-rat social dynamics.",

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising adsorbents, yet atomic-level insights into Xe and Kr adsorption remain limited. Here, we report the first application of high-field solid-state 83 Kr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), alongside extensive 129 Xe NMR, to investigate gas adsorption in eight MOFs representing three design strategies: ultramicroporous one-dimensional–channel MOFs with pore sizes matching noble gas diameters, functionalized MOFs, and MOFs with open metal sites. Single-gas and coadsorption studies reveal distinct adsorption sites, guest-host interactions, and gas dynamics in each MOF. Most MOFs retain crystallinity after exposure to 60-kilogray γ radiation. Several radiation-sensitive MOFs exhibit enhanced stability in the presence of Xe, suggesting that Xe adsorption enhances framework stability and may broaden the range of MOFs usable under γ radiation in nuclear off-gas separation.

Gene duplication resulting from polyploidization offers insights into plant adaptation to environmental stress. Here, we reveal that extensive duplication of GhRALF30L , which encodes an intrinsically disordered small peptide, contributes to thermotolerance in cotton male reproductive organs. Polyploidization has driven the formation of 23 GhRALF30L genes in allotetraploid cotton, whereas only four or five homologs are identified in its two diploid ancestors. Expression and functional analyses confirm that GhRALF30L regulates thermotolerance in a dosage-dependent manner, with reduced dosage decreasing heat resistance. Under heat stress, GhRALF30L interacts with GhFERA1/GhCAPA1 and enhances their condensation at the plasma membrane, which activates heat stress responses by up-regulating the expression of heat shock factors ( HSFs ), heat shock proteins ( HSPs ), and reactive oxygen species scavenging genes. Our findings demonstrate that the GhRALF30L gene cluster, resulting from polyploidization, confers thermotolerance through facilitating the condensation of GhFERA1/GhCAPA1.",

Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 integrates innate immune signals following diet-induced obesity to promote glucose homeostasis through the induction of mitophagy. Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for pancreatic β cell function at baseline, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and mitophagy following metabolic stress in mouse and human islets. TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) mitophagy machinery. Glucose intolerance induced by TRAF6 deficiency following metabolic stress was reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency by relieving obstructions in receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy. Our results establish that TRAF6 is vital for traffic through Parkin-mediated mitophagy and implicates TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated mitophagy. Together, we illustrate that β cells engage innate immune signaling to adaptively respond to a diabetogenic environment.",

Inspired by spine features, the magnetorheological spine beams, exhibiting substantial stiffness variation by bistable transition, meticulously conceived the stiffness reprogrammable magnetorheological metamaterial (SRMM). The SRMM exhibits a large stiffness conversion capability (40-fold) and high-density information encoding performance (10-bit). Coupling with the mechanoluminescent materials, the mechanical information achieves visualization conveniently, which is attributed to the conversion of the stiffness data into optical signals through optical energy level transitions. Such stiffness-based magnetorheological metamaterial offers expansive information encoding spaces, stable operation capabilities, and convenient readout approaches, advancing mechanical information processing system design for extreme environments.",

Using an improved centriole isolation method, we determined the structure of the A-C linker bound to microtubule triplets, which revealed how the A-C linker cross-links microtubules and integrates with the B-C junction. We found marked changes in the structure and composition of the A-C linker that correlate with the presence of other centriolar modules, including the pinhead, cartwheel, and inner scaffold.

Valosin-containing protein (VCP), an enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, is essential for SG disassembly, but whether and how this process is coordinated with SG assembly remains unclear. Here, we identify the VCP cofactor, Alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL) as a key regulator linking SG assembly and disassembly. ASPL promotes SG assembly by facilitating biomolecular condensation of Ras guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein-binding protein (G3BP) and stabilizing its interactions with other SG proteins. ASPL also facilitates phosphorylation and activation of VCP by UNC-51-like kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1/2), enabling G3BP extraction and efficient SG disassembly. Pathogenic VCP mutations that disrupt ASPL binding impair SG disassembly, a defect rescued by phosphomimetic mutations or ASPL depletion. Our findings suggest that disruptions in the ASPL-VCP interaction uncouple SG assembly and disassembly, representing a potential mechanism underlying VCP-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",

They are typically derived from secondary formation, which is generated through atmospheric chemical reactions involving precursor compounds, such as phenolic compounds. However, information on NAC formation mechanisms remains limited. Here, we found that particulate-phase NAC concentrations were notably affected by relative humidity (RH) in field observations. Smog chamber experiments indicated that RH could influence NAC formation via changes in gaseous water concentration, rather than solely through aerosol liquid water content. Theoretical calculations further clarified that water clusters (WCs), formed from gaseous water, can notably lower reaction energy barriers along the NAC formation pathway, rendering this pathway competitive under atmospheric conditions. Hence, we propose a potential mechanism in which WCs catalyze NAC formation, offering a previously unidentified perspective on atmospheric secondary aerosol formation.",
