Challenges include sufficient cardiomyocyte retention for a sustainable therapeutic impact without intolerable side effects, such as arrhythmia and tumour growth. We investigated the hypothesis that epicardial engineered heart muscle (EHM) allografts from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells structurally and functionally remuscularize the chronically failing heart without limiting side effects in rhesus macaques. After confirmation of in vitro and in vivo (nude rat model) equivalence of the newly developed rhesus macaque EHM model with a previously established Good Manufacturing Practice-compatible human EHM formulation 8 , long-term retention (up to 6 months) and dose-dependent enhancement of the target heart wall by EHM grafts constructed from 40 to 200 million cardiomyocytes/stromal cells were demonstrated in macaques with and without myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. In the heart failure model, evidence for EHM allograft-enhanced target heart wall contractility and ejection fraction, which are measures for local and global heart support, was obtained. Histopathological and gadolinium-based perfusion magnetic resonance imaging analyses confirmed cell retention and functional vascularization. Arrhythmia and tumour growth were not observed. The obtained feasibility, safety and efficacy data provided the pivotal underpinnings for the approval of a first-in-human clinical trial on tissue-engineered heart repair. Our clinical data confirmed remuscularization by EHM implantation in a patient with advanced heart failure.",

          "abstract": "The fate of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) 1 is the largest cause of uncertainty in long-term sea-level projections. In the last interglacial (LIG) around 125,000 years ago, data suggest that sea level was several metres higher than today 2–4 , and required a significant contribution from Antarctic ice loss, with WAIS usually implicated. Antarctica and the Southern Ocean were warmer than today 5–8 , by amounts comparable to those expected by 2100 under moderate to high future warming scenarios. However, direct evidence about the size of WAIS in the LIG is sparse. Here we use sea salt data from an ice core from Skytrain Ice Rise, adjacent to WAIS, to show that, during most of the LIG, the Ronne Ice Shelf was still in place, and close to its current extent. Water isotope data are consistent with a retreat of WAIS 9 , but seem inconsistent with more dramatic model realizations 10 in which both WAIS and the large Antarctic ice shelves were lost. This new constraint calls for a reappraisal of other elements of the LIG sea-level budget. It also weakens the observational basis that motivated model simulations projecting the highest end of projections for future rates of sea-level rise to 2300 and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Crosslinked thermosets are highly durable materials, but overcoming their petrochemical origins and inability to be recycled poses a grand challenge1,2,3. Many strategies to access crosslinked polymers that are bioderived or degradable-by-design have been proposed, but they require several resource-intensive synthesis and purification steps and are not yet feasible alternatives to conventional consumer materials4,5,6,7,8. Here we present a modular, one-pot synthesis of degradable thermosets from the commercially available, biosourced monomer 2,3-dihydrofuran (DHF)9. In the presence of a ruthenium catalyst and photoacid generator, DHF undergoes slow ring-opening metathesis polymerization to give a soft polymer; then, exposure to light triggers strong acid generation and promotes the cationic polymerization of the same DHF monomer to spatially crosslink and strengthen the material10,11,12. By manipulating catalyst loading and light exposure, we can access materials with physical properties spanning orders of magnitude and achieve spatially resolved material domains. Importantly, the DHF-based thermosets undergo stimuli-selective degradation and can be recycled to the monomer under mild heating. The use of two distinct polymerization mechanisms on a single functional group allows the synthesis of degradable and recyclable thermoset materials with precisely controlled properties.",

Turnover rates differ markedly among communities4, but the drivers of this variation across taxa and realms remain unknown. Here we analyse 42,225 time series of species composition from marine, terrestrial and freshwater assemblages, and show that temporal rates of turnover were consistently faster in locations that experienced faster temperature change, including both warming and cooling. In addition, assemblages with limited access to microclimate refugia or that faced stronger human impacts on land were especially responsive to temperature change, with up to 48% of species replaced per decade. These results reveal a widespread signal of vulnerability to continuing climate change and highlight which ecological communities are most sensitive, raising concerns about ecosystem integrity as climate change and other human impacts accelerate.",

However, low- and middle-income countries, in which approximately 84% of the world’s population lives1, are not equitably represented in large-scale gut microbiome research2,3,4. Here we present the AWI-Gen 2 Microbiome Project, a cross-sectional gut microbiome study sampling 1,801 women from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. By engaging with communities that range from rural and horticultural to post-industrial and urban informal settlements, we capture a far greater breadth of the world’s population diversity. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we identify taxa with geographic and lifestyle associations, including Treponema and Cryptobacteroides species loss and Bifidobacterium species gain in urban populations. We uncover 1,005 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes, and we identify antibiotic susceptibility as a factor that might drive Treponema succinifaciens absence in urban populations. Finally, we find an HIV infection signature defined by several taxa not previously associated with HIV, including Dysosmobacter welbionis and Enterocloster sp. This study represents the largest population-representative survey of gut metagenomes of African individuals so far, and paired with extensive clinical biomarkers and demographic data, provides extensive opportunity for microbiome-related discovery.",

          "abstract": "The Casarabe culture (500–1400 ce ), spreading over roughly 4,500 km 2 of the monumental mounds region of the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia, is one of the clearest examples of urbanism in pre-Columbian (pre-1492 ce ) Amazonia. It exhibits a four-tier hierarchical settlement pattern, with hundreds of monumental mounds interconnected by canals and causeways 1,2 . Despite archaeological evidence indicating that maize was cultivated by this society 3 , it is unknown whether it was the staple crop and which type of agricultural farming system was used to support this urban-scale society. Here, we address this issue by integration of remote sensing, field survey and microbotanical analyses, which shows that the Casarabe culture invested heavily in landscape engineering, constructing a complex system of drainage canals (to drain excess water during the rainy season) and newly documented savannah farm ponds (to retain water in the dry season). Phytolith analyses of 178 samples from 18 soil profiles in drained fields, farm ponds and forested settings record the singular and ubiquitous presence of maize ( Zea mays ) in pre-Columbian fields and farm ponds, and an absence of evidence for agricultural practices in the forest. Collectively, our findings show how the Casarabe culture managed the savannah landscape for intensive year-round maize monoculture that probably sustained its relatively large population. Our results have implications for how we conceive agricultural systems in Amazonia, and show an example of a Neolithic-like, grain-based agrarian economy in the Amazon.",

          "abstract": "Soil alkalinization and global warming are predicted to pose major challenges to agriculture in the future, as they continue to accelerate, markedly reducing global arable land and crop yields1,2. Therefore, strategies for future agriculture are needed to further improve globally cultivated, relatively high-yielding Green Revolution varieties (GRVs) derived from the SEMIDWARF 1 (SD1) gene3,4. Here we propose that precise regulation of the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) to optimal levels is the key to not only confer alkali–thermal tolerance to GRVs, but also to further enhance their yield. Endogenous modulation of ALKALI-THERMAL TOLERANCE 1/2 (ATT1/2), quantitative trait loci encoding GA20-oxidases or exogenous application of GA minimized rice yield loss affected by sodic soils. Mechanistically, high GA concentrations induce reactive oxygen species over-accumulation, whereas low GA concentrations repress the expression of stress-tolerance genes by means of DELLA–NGR5-mediated H3K27me3 methylation. We further showed that ATT1 induces large fluctuations in GA levels, whereas ATT2 is the ideal candidate for fine-tuning GA concentrations to appropriate levels to balance reactive oxygen species and H3K27me3 methylation to improve alkali–thermal tolerance and yield. Thus, ATT2 is expected to be a potential new post-Green Revolution gene that could be harnessed to develop and use marginal lands for sustainable agriculture in the future.",

The extent to which this negative effect varies among grassland types and over time in response to multi-year extreme drought remains unclear. Here, using a coordinated distributed experiment that simulated four years of growing-season drought (around 66% rainfall reduction), we compared drought sensitivity within and among six representative grasslands spanning broad precipitation gradients in each of Eurasia and North America—two of the Northern Hemisphere’s largest grass-dominated regions. Aboveground plant production declined substantially with drought in the Eurasian grasslands and the effects accumulated over time, while the declines were less severe and more muted over time in the North American grasslands. Drought effects on species richness shifted from positive to negative in Eurasia, but from negative to positive in North America over time. The differing responses of plant production in these grasslands were accompanied by less common (subordinate) plant species declining in Eurasian grasslands but increasing in North American grasslands. Our findings demonstrate the high production sensitivity of Eurasian compared with North American grasslands to extreme drought (43.6% versus 25.2% reduction), and the key role of subordinate species in determining impacts of extreme drought on grassland productivity.",

Infections in bats are largely asymptomatic2,3, indicating limited tissue-damaging inflammation and immunopathology. To investigate the genomic basis of disease resistance, the Bat1K project generated reference-quality genomes of ten bat species, including potential viral reservoirs. Here we describe a systematic analysis covering 115 mammalian genomes that revealed that signatures of selection in immune genes are more prevalent in bats than in other mammalian orders. We found an excess of immune gene adaptations in the ancestral chiropteran branch and in many descending bat lineages, highlighting viral entry and detection factors, and regulators of antiviral and inflammatory responses. ISG15, which is an antiviral gene contributing to hyperinflammation during COVID-19 (refs. 4,5), exhibits key residue changes in rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats. Cellular infection experiments show species-specific antiviral differences and an essential role of protein conjugation in antiviral function of bat ISG15, separate from its role in secretion and inflammation in humans. Furthermore, in contrast to humans, ISG15 in most rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats has strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our work reveals molecular mechanisms that contribute to viral tolerance and disease resistance in bats.",

This protein catalyses the oxidation of VK hydroquinone to convert specific glutamate residues to γ-carboxyglutamate residues in VK-dependent proteins (VDPs), which are involved in various essential biological processes and diseases1,2,3. However, the working mechanism of GGCX remains unclear. Here we report three cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human GGCX: in the apo state, bound to osteocalcin (a VDP) and bound to VK. The propeptide of the VDP binds to the lumenal domain of GGCX, which stabilizes transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of GGCX to create the VK-binding pocket. After binding of VK, residue Lys218 in GGCX mediates the oxidation of VK hydroxyquinone, which leads to the deprotonation of glutamate residues and the construction of γ-carboxyglutamate residues. Our structural observations and results from binding and cell biological assays and molecular dynamics simulations show that a cholesterol molecule interacts with the transmembrane helices of GGCX to regulate its protein levels in cells. Together, these results establish a link between cholesterol metabolism and VK-dependent pathways.",

          "abstract": "Since the onset of the pandemic, many SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, exhibiting substantial evolution in the virus’ spike protein 1 , the main target of neutralizing antibodies 2 . A plausible hypothesis proposes that the virus evolves to evade antibody-mediated neutralization (vaccine- or infection-induced) to maximize its ability to infect an immunologically experienced population 1,3 . Because viral infection induces neutralizing antibodies, viral evolution may thus navigate on a dynamic immune landscape that is shaped by local infection history. Here we developed a comprehensive mechanistic model, incorporating deep mutational scanning data 4,5 , antibody pharmacokinetics and regional genomic surveillance data, to predict the variant-specific relative number of susceptible individuals over time. We show that this quantity precisely matched historical variant dynamics, predicted future variant dynamics and explained global differences in variant dynamics. Our work strongly suggests that the ongoing pandemic continues to shape variant-specific population immunity, which determines a variant’s ability to transmit, thus defining variant fitness. The model can be applied to any region by utilizing local genomic surveillance data, allows contextualizing risk assessment of variants and provides information for vaccine design.",

Following pathogen recognition by nucleotide binding-domain, leucine-rich, repeat-containing (NLR) proteins, CARDs recruit and activate caspases, which, in turn, activate gasdermin pore-forming proteins to induce pyroptotic cell death2. Here we show that CARD domains are present in defence systems that protect bacteria against phage. The bacterial CARD domain is essential for protease-mediated activation of certain bacterial gasdermins, which promote cell death once phage infection is recognized. We further show that multiple anti-phage defence systems use CARD domains to activate a variety of cell death effectors, and that CARD domains mediate protein–protein interactions in these systems. We find that these systems are triggered by a conserved immune-evasion protein used by phages to overcome the bacterial defence system RexAB3, demonstrating that phage proteins inhibiting one defence system can activate another. Our results suggest that CARD domains represent an ancient component of innate immune systems conserved from bacteria to humans, and that CARD-dependent activation of gasdermins is shared in organisms across the tree of life.",

          "abstract": "The γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues enables Ca2+-mediated membrane assembly of protein complexes that support broad physiological functions including hemostasis, calcium homeostasis, immune response, and endocrine regulation1-4. Modulating γ-carboxylation level provides prevalent treatments for hemorrhagic and thromboembolic diseases5. This unique posttranslational modification requires vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) to drive highly demanding reactions6 catalyzed by the membrane-integrated γ-carboxylase (VKGC). To decipher underlying mechanisms, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VKGC in unbound form, with KH2 and four hemostatic and non-hemostatic proteins possessing propeptides and glutamate-rich domains in different carboxylation states. VKGC recognizes substrate proteins via knob-and-hole interactions with propeptides, thereby bringing tethered glutamate-containing segments for processive carboxylation within a large chamber that provides steric control. Propeptide binding also triggers a global conformational change to signal VKGC activation. Through sequential deprotonation and KH2 epoxidation, VKGC generates free hydroxide ion as an exceptionally strong base required to deprotonate the γ-carbon of glutamate for CO2 addition. The diffusion of this superbase, protected and guided by a sealed hydrophobic tunnel, elegantly resolves the challenge of coupling KH2 epoxidation to γ-carboxylation across the membrane interface. These structural insights and extensive functional experiments advance membrane enzymology and propel the development of novel treatments for γ-carboxylation disorders.",

          "abstract": "Dielectric-based energy storage capacitors characterized with fast charging and discharging speed and reliability1,2,3,4 play a vital role in cutting-edge electrical and electronic equipment. In pursuit of capacitor miniaturization and integration, dielectrics must offer high energy density and efficiency5. Antiferroelectrics with antiparallel dipole configurations have been of significant interest for high-performance energy storage due to their negligible remanent polarization and high maximum polarization in the field-induced ferroelectric state6,7,8. However, the low antiferroelectric–ferroelectric phase-transition field and accompanying large hysteresis loss deteriorate energy density and reliability. Here, guided by phase-field simulations, we propose a new strategy to frustrate antipolar ordering in antiferroelectrics by incorporating non-polar or polar components. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively tunes the antiferroelectric–ferroelectric phase-transition fields and simultaneously reduces hysteresis loss. In PbZrO3-based films, we hence realized a record high energy density among all antiferroelectrics of 189 J cm−3 along with a high efficiency of 81% at an electric field of 5.51 MV cm−1, which rivals the most state-of-the-art energy storage dielectrics9,10,11,12. Atomic-scale characterization by scanning transmission electron microscopy directly revealed that the dispersed non-polar regions frustrate the long-range antipolar ordering, which contributes to the improved performance. This strategy presents new opportunities to manipulate polarization profiles and enhance energy storage performances in antiferroelectrics.",

However, the length and cost of personalized manufacturing limits access and leaves patients vulnerable to disease progression. Allogeneic cell therapies have the potential to increase patient access and improve treatment outcomes but are limited by immune rejection2,3. To devise a strategy to protect allogeneic CAR T cells from host immune cells, we turned to lymphotropic viruses that have evolved integrated mechanisms for immune escape of virus-infected lymphocytes4. We find that viral evasins that partially reduce HLA class I expression can shelter CAR T cells from mismatched CD8+ T cells without triggering ‘missing-self’ rejection by NK cells. However, this protection alone is insufficient to sustain effective allogeneic CAR T cell therapy. HIV-1 Nef uniquely also acts through the serine-threonine kinase Pak2 to abate activation-induced cell death and promote survival of CAR T cells in vivo. Thus, virus-like immune escape can harness multiple mechanisms that act in concert to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic CAR T cells.",

          "abstract": "During normal cellular homeostasis, unfolded and mislocalized proteins are recognized and removed, preventing the build-up of toxic byproducts 1 . When protein homeostasis is perturbed during ageing, neurodegeneration or cellular stress, proteins can accumulate several forms of chemical damage through reactive metabolites 2,3 . Such modifications have been proposed to trigger the selective removal of chemically marked proteins 3–6 ; however, identifying modifications that are sufficient to induce protein degradation has remained challenging. Here, using a semi-synthetic chemical biology approach coupled to cellular assays, we found that C-terminal amide-bearing proteins (CTAPs) are rapidly cleared from human cells. A CRISPR screen identified FBXO31 as a reader of C-terminal amides. FBXO31 is a substrate receptor for the SKP1–CUL1–F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase SCF–FBXO31, which ubiquitylates CTAPs for subsequent proteasomal degradation. A conserved binding pocket enables FBXO31 to bind to almost any C-terminal peptide bearing an amide while retaining exquisite selectivity over non-modified clients. This mechanism facilitates binding and turnover of endogenous CTAPs that are formed after oxidative stress. A dominant human mutation found in neurodevelopmental disorders reverses CTAP recognition, such that non-amidated neosubstrates are now degraded and FBXO31 becomes markedly toxic. We propose that CTAPs may represent the vanguard of a largely unexplored class of modified amino acid degrons that could provide a general strategy for selective yet broad surveillance of chemically damaged proteins.",

However, the origin of these chemicals remains unclear5,6 as there are no known energy metabolisms that generate methylated compounds de novo as a major product. Here we identified an energy metabolism in the subsurface-derived thermophilic anaerobe Zhaonella formicivorans7 that catalyses the conversion of formate to methanol, thereby producing methanol without requiring methylated compounds as an input. Cultivation experiments showed that formate-driven methanologenesis is inhibited by the accumulation of methanol. However, this limitation can be overcome through methanol consumption by a methylotrophic partner methanogen, Methermicoccus shengliensis. This symbiosis represents a fourth mode of mutualistic cross-feeding driven by thermodynamic necessity (syntrophy), previously thought to rely on transfer of hydrogen, formate or electrons8,9,10. The unusual metabolism and syntrophy provide insights into the enigmatic presence of methylated compounds in subsurface methanogenic ecosystems and demonstrate how organisms survive at the thermodynamic limit through metabolic symbiosis.",

The key challenge is achieving selectivity for one particular C(sp3)−H bond1,2,3. In recent years, metalloenzymes have been found to perform C(sp3)−H bond functionalization4,5. Despite substantial progresses in the past two decades6,7, enzymatic halogenation and pseudohalogenation of unactivated C(sp3)−H—providing a functional handle for further modification—have been achieved with only non-haem iron/α-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases, and are therefore limited by the chemistry possible with these enzymes8. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a previously unknown halogenase ApnU, part of a protein family containing domain of unknown function 3328 (DUF3328). ApnU uses copper in its active site to catalyse iterative chlorinations on multiple unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds. By taking advantage of the softer copper centre, we demonstrate that ApnU can catalyse unprecedented enzymatic C(sp3)−H bond functionalization such as iodination and thiocyanation. Using biochemical characterization and proteomics analysis, we identified the functional oligomeric state of ApnU as a covalently linked homodimer, which contains three essential pairs—one interchain and two intrachain—of disulfide bonds. The metal-coordination active site in ApnU consists of binuclear type II copper centres, as revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This discovery expands the enzymatic capability of C(sp3)−H halogenases and provides a foundational understanding of this family of binuclear copper-dependent oxidative enzymes.",

To meet recent international commitments to maintain genetic diversity within species 5,6 , we need to understand relationships between threats, conservation management and genetic diversity change. Here we conduct a global analysis of genetic diversity change via meta-analysis of all available temporal measures of genetic diversity from more than three decades of research. We show that within-population genetic diversity is being lost over timescales likely to have been impacted by human activities, and that some conservation actions may mitigate this loss. Our dataset includes 628 species (animals, plants, fungi and chromists) across all terrestrial and most marine realms on Earth. Threats impacted two-thirds of the populations that we analysed, and less than half of the populations analysed received conservation management. Genetic diversity loss occurs globally and is a realistic prediction for many species, especially birds and mammals, in the face of threats such as land use change, disease, abiotic natural phenomena and harvesting or harassment. Conservation strategies designed to improve environmental conditions, increase population growth rates and introduce new individuals (for example, restoring connectivity or performing translocations) may maintain or even increase genetic diversity. Our findings underscore the urgent need for active, genetically informed conservation interventions to halt genetic diversity loss.",

A representative example is charge pumping that is associated with the quantum Hall effect2 and the quantum anomalous Hall effect3. Spin pumping, the spin equivalent of charge pumping, refers to the emission of a spin current by magnetization dynamics4,5,6,7. Previous studies have focused solely on transversal spin pumping arising from classical dynamics, which corresponds to precessing atomic moments with constant magnitude. However, longitudinal spin pumping arising from quantum fluctuations, which correspond to a temporal change in the atomic moment’s magnitude, remains unexplored. Here we experimentally investigate longitudinal spin pumping using iron–rhodium (FeRh), which undergoes a first-order antiferromagnet-to-ferromagnet phase transition during which the atomic moment’s magnitude varies over time. By injecting a charge current into a FeRh/platinum bilayer, we induce a rapid phase transition of FeRh in nanoseconds, leading to the emission of a spin current to the platinum layer. The observed inverse spin Hall signal is about one order of magnitude larger than expected for transversal spin pumping, suggesting the presence of longitudinal spin pumping driven by quantum fluctuations and indicating its superiority over classical transversal spin pumping. Our result highlights the significance of quantum fluctuations in spin pumping and holds broad applicability in diverse angular momentum dynamics, such as laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization8, orbital pumping9,10 and quantum spin transfer11,12,13.",

          "abstract": "“Drill, baby, drill!” This campaign slogan came up minutes into Donald Trump’s inauguration address, as the new US President announced his plans to boost domestic fossil-fuel production and exports and curb climate action. This push for US oil and gas production will probably be endorsed by the Department of Energy, the Department of Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency — now led by vocal supporters of fossil-fuel development.\n\nSome level of oil and gas extraction was always going to continue in the coming years. Some cleaner fuels, such as hydrogen, are derived mostly from natural gas — boosting hydrogen was a hallmark policy of the Biden administration, which saw record levels of US fossil-fuel extraction. Now, Trump has made clear that he aims to expand drilling, declaring an ‘energy emergency’ on day one of his presidency. But this needn’t mean the end of US decarbonization efforts, nor further environmental degradation. What’s important is that it is done right.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nThe US government has direct control over oil and gas development only on federal lands and waters, which host just 11% of US oil production and 9% of its gas. And opening up more federal lands, such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to oil and gas drilling, as Trump has threatened to do, will be neither quick nor easy. Several laws protect these lands, including the Clean Air (1963), Safe Drinking Water (1974) and Endangered Species (1973) acts. It would take acts of Congress to overturn them — and major rollbacks are unlikely to be widely supported by the mostly moderate legislators across the US House of Representatives and Senate, in line with their constituents’ preferences.\n\nTrump has issued an executive order to encourage energy exploration on federal areas. But any drilling initiative can, and probably will, be immediately challenged by environmental groups. The initiatives would then have to wind their way through the court system to get approved. Drilling on federal territories might not even be economically competitive, because these regions are often more remote and harder to access than other resource deposits.\n\nAs an energy geographer, I study state energy policies and their impacts on communities and ecosystems. The public often worries that energy policy is dictated by the oil and gas industry through ‘model bills’ written by pro-business lobbying groups. But my colleagues and I have found that, in fracking regulation for example, states often relied more on each other’s regulations to strike the right balance between permitting fracking to boost employment and lower energy prices and safeguarding the environment (J. Baka et al. Energy Res. Soc. Sci. 70, 101734; 2020).\n\nTrump will weaken climate action — the rest of the US must not follow suit\n\nStates should retain their own regulatory frameworks to ensure environmental protection. Independent groups such as the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission can help with these efforts. The organization was founded in 1935 to facilitate communication on fossil fuels between oil and gas regulators, providing a space for state officials to promote balanced regulatory approaches.",

Field and laboratory studies suggest that bats rarely become ill from these viruses and don’t mount the harmful immune overreactions seen, for instance, in people with severe COVID-19.\n\n“There’s something unique about bats,” says Aaron Irving, a comparative immunologist at the Zhejiang University–University of Edinburgh Institute in Haining, China, who co-led the study, published1 on 29 January in Nature. “When they are infected, generally, they’re quite healthy. They somehow evolved the right way to control their immune responses without going overboard.”\n\nImmunity secrets\n\nTo uncover secrets to bat immunity, a team led by Irving and Michael Hiller, an evolutionary genomicist at the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt, Germany, sequenced the genomes of ten bats, including four horseshoe bat and three species part of a family called hipposiderids, all of which are coronavirus reservoirs. The researchers then analysed these along with ten previously sequenced bat species from other parts of the family tree.\n\nCompared with 95 other mammal species, bats had especially high numbers of immune genes, with changes indicative of natural selection. Some of these alterations were limited to individual branches of the bat family tree, hinting that they evolved after the group began diversifying. But many immune adaptations were shared by all bats, suggesting that they emerged in a common ancestor of all bats — and at around the same point that fossil evidence has suggested that powered flight evolved in the animals.",

Scientists who examined her old heart found that the implanted muscle patches had remained in place and formed blood vessels.\n\nThe results of the trial, which took place in 2021, were published in Nature on 29 January1, alongside findings from earlier studies that tested muscle patches containing between 40 million and 200 million cells each in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta).\n\nFirst pig-to-human heart transplant: what can scientists learn?\n\n“We now have, for the first time, a laboratory-grown biological transplant available which has the potential to stabilize and strengthen the heart muscle,” said study co-author Ingo Kutschka, a heart surgeon at University Medical Center Göttingen in Germany, during a press briefing.\n\n“It’s quite a breakthrough,” says Jianyi Zhang, who specializes in bioengineering and using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) — cells reprogrammed from an adult state to allow them to differentiate into any cell type in the body — for cardiac repair at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nThe treatment is not intended to replace the need for a full transplant, but it can help people with advanced heart failure who are waiting for a heart to become available.\n\n“Less than 1% of the patients in need are heart transplanted,” said study co-author Wolfram-Hubertus Zimmermann, a pharmacologist at University Medical Center Göttingen, during the press briefing. This approach “is offering another treatment to patients that are presently under palliative care”.\n\nThe researchers have implanted similar muscle patches into 15 people so far, and hope to recruit more participants.\n\nPatched-up hearts\n\nAn estimated 60 million people worldwide are living with heart failure, and more than half of people who enter severe heart failure die within a year. A lack of donors means that there are not enough hearts available for most people who need them, and artificial pumping devices are expensive and require invasive surgery.\n\nFor many years, scientists have experimented with implanting or directly injecting stem cells or muscles grown from them into the heart. But these procedures often result in irregular heartbeat, growth of tumours or rejection by the body’s immune system.\n\nZimmermann and his team engineered iPSCs to grow into heart muscle and connective tissue. They mixed these cells with collagen gel to create patches, and developed a minimally invasive procedure to place them on the surface of the heart. “The graft is basically outside of the heart,” says Zhang.\n\nCRISPR ‘cousin’ put to the test in landmark heart-disease trial",

          "abstract": "The H5N1 avian influenza virus (blue) revealed in a coloured image from a transmission electron microscope.Credit: CDC/Science Photo Library\n\nTen months on from the shocking discovery that a virus usually carried by wild birds can readily infect cows, at least 68 people in North America have become ill from the pathogen and one person has died.\n\nWhy a teenager’s bird-flu infection is ringing alarm bells for scientists\n\nAlthough many of the infections have been mild, emerging data indicate that variants of the avian influenza virus H5N1 that are spreading in North America can cause severe disease and death, especially when passed directly to humans from birds. The virus is also adapting to new hosts — cows and other mammals — raising the risk that it could spark a human pandemic.\n\n“The risk has increased as we’ve gone on — especially in the last couple of months, with the report of [some] severe infections,” says Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nLast week, US President Donald Trump took office and announced that he will pull the United States — where H5N1 is circulating in dairy cows — out of the World Health Organization, the agency that coordinates the global response to health emergencies. This has sounded alarm bells among researchers worried about bird flu.\n\nHere, Nature talks to infectious-disease specialists about what they’re learning about how humans get sick from the virus, and the chances of a bird-flu pandemic.\n\nDoes how ill a person gets depend on whether they are infected by a cow or a bird?\n\nThere are two main variants of H5N1 that researchers are monitoring: one, called B3.13, is spreading mainly in cows; the other, called D1.1, is found mostly in wild and domesticated birds, including chickens raised for poultry.\n\nHuge amounts of bird-flu virus found in raw milk of infected cows\n\nB3.13 has spread rapidly in cattle across the United States, infecting more than 900 herds across 16 states, and has also infected other animals, such as cats, skunks and poultry. Infected cows and their milk contain high levels of the virus, making it easy for the pathogen to be transmitted between animals and workers on dairy farms, where milking equipment can spray liquid into the air and milk can coat surfaces.\n\nAt least 40 people have been infected by sick cows in North America, but in these cases, the virus has caused only mild respiratory illness and an inflammatory eye condition known as conjunctivitis. At least 24 people have become ill after exposure to sick birds, and 2 of these infections, caused by D1.1, were severe — one person was in hospital for months and the other died.\n\nThese numbers are too small to enable researchers to determine whether one variant of the virus is more dangerous than the other, Lakdawala says. Factors such as underlying health conditions in the people infected and the route of exposure to the virus can affect outcomes, she says.\n\nSo can an infection’s severity depend on whether a person ingests or breathes in the virus?\n\nDairy workers are vulnerable to infection because, during the milking process, they can inhale airborne milk particles and milk droplets can splash into their eyes. Some data suggest that if the virus enters the lungs directly, it could cause a severe infection. In a study published in Nature on 15 January1, a research group including Heinz Feldmann, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ virology laboratory in Hamilton, Montana, infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with B3.13 virus.\n\nIs bird flu spreading among people?

          "abstract": "Credit: Getty\nNature’s 2024 hiring in science survey\n\nThis article is the fifth in a short series discussing the results of Nature’s global survey of hiring managers in science. The survey, created in partnership with Thinks Insights & Strategy, a research consultancy in London, launched in June 2024 and was advertised on nature.com, in Springer Nature digital products and through e-mail campaigns. It received 1,134 self-selecting respondents from 77 countries, based in academia, industry and other sectors, including industry responses provided in partnership with Walr, a market-research panel. The full survey data sets are available at go.nature.com/3bgpazn.\n\nUnsolicited applications — commonly known as cold e-mails — can be a surprisingly powerful tool for landing a job in science. According to Nature’s hiring-in-science survey, 43% of laboratory leaders and principal investigators (PIs) think that cold e-mails are an effective way for candidates to get noticed, with 57% saying they “tend to” or “always” respond.\n\nWant a new job in science? Six charts to help you land it\n\nHowever, with 39% of respondents receiving such e-mails at least monthly — and some daily — crafting one that will stand out is essential. To avoid being dismissed as just another generic or intrusive message, your e-mail must strike the right balance between assertive and respectful.\n\nHere are four key strategies for success, based on survey insights, a panel discussion hosted by Nature’s Careers team last November and interviews with researchers who receive or have successfully written such missives.\n\nShow you understand the workplace\n\nTailoring your e-mail to the recipient is essential. According to the survey, 58% of hiring managers are most likely to respond to e-mails that demonstrate an understanding of their workplace and research. In academia, the proportion rose to 68%, compared with 48% among hirers in industry(see ‘Top five ways to boost your cold e-mail’s chances’).\n\nTop five ways to boost your cold e-mail’s chances of success\n\nHirers in academia and industry say these are the top factors that prompt them to respond to unsolicited requests.\n\n1. Demonstrates knowledge of my workplace or research\n\n2. Phrasing is professional\n\n3. Message is personalized to me\n\n4. There is a job vacancy at my workplace\n\n5. The individual is known to a colleague or peer\n\nAndreas Laustsen-Kiel, a biotechnology entrepreneur at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby, who receives several unsolicited job applications every day, agrees.\n\n“If people write a very generic e-mail, they disqualify themselves,” he said during the Nature panel discussion. “If they’re not going to research my group, they’re probably not going to research other things very well either.”\n\nExplain your motivation\n\nSharing why you are reaching out now, or to this particular group, can be more important in a cold e-mail than when applying for an advertised post. In the survey, 46% of hirers were more likely to respond to personalized messages, although this was higher in academia (59%) than in industry (29%).\n\nA step-by-step guide to landing your next job in science\n\nEileen Parkes, an oncology researcher at the University of Oxford, UK, is often left wondering why applicants are reaching out. “What people don’t tell me is what makes them tick,” Parkes said during the Nature panel discussion. “What gets them excited? What makes them want to stay in academia despite better salaries in industry? Those are the e-mails I will pick up and respond to.”\n\nFernanda Adame, a wetlands ecologist at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, who gets cold applications daily, wants to understand applicants’ values — for example, whether they have been involved in any volunteer work or activism. “It’s about having the right incentive,” she says.\n\nMake a professional impression\n\nAccording to the survey, 53% of hirers are most likely to respond to e-mails that are professional — concise, well structured and respectful of the recipient’s time.\n\nParkes receives up to ten unsolicited applications per week, some of which are from people looking for PhD positions. She advises applicants to focus on the first and last paragraphs: these are sometimes the only ones that she has time to read before deciding whether to move on. “Make sure those sections are compelling,” she says.",

They explored various warming scenarios and considered the effects of strategies to to keep people safe amid rising heat, such as increasing the amount of green space and shade in cities or installing air conditioning in homes.\n\nThe results, published in Nature Medicine1, suggest that heat-related deaths will surpass those caused by cold conditions in even the most optimistic scenarios, and that temperature-related deaths overall could increase by nearly 50%. Mediterranean regions, particularly eastern Spain, southern France, Italy and Malta, are on track to be the worst affected (see ‘Deadly heat’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1Source: Ref. 1\n\n“We would need a massive adaptation in order to compensate for the increase in temperature,” says study co-author Pierre Masselot, a statistician and environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. At the moment, he says, “it’s difficult to see how that level of adaptation could be reached”.\n\nRapid warming\n\nIn recent years, several countries have experienced record-breaking heatwaves that have been linked to tens of thousands of deaths2. Still, in Europe, deaths due to cold temperatures currently outnumber those caused by heat by ten to one. This is on track to change as global temperatures increase: cold-related deaths are projected to fall, while those caused by extreme heat will become more prevalent.\n\nFor their analysis, Masselot and his colleagues explored four future scenarios in which global temperatures increase by 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C. They also considered three scenarios for how countries might improve their adaptation strategies, potentially reducing the risk of heat-related deaths by 10%, 50% or 90%.\n\nHow climate change is hitting Europe: three graphics reveal health impacts",

Press (2024).\n\n‘Big Steve,’ his students called him. Steven Weinberg was not physically imposing, but was an intellectually dominant and much-revered figure in the scientific community and on the public stage. One of the most distinguished theoretical physicists of the past 75 years, Weinberg dedicated his professional life to leading what he described as the ‘grand enterprise’ of seeking the bedrock laws of nature that underpin the workings of the Universe. He looked the part, too — at physics conferences, he was often the only participant wearing a suit and tie.\n\nWhen he died in 2021, he was only a few months away from completing his memoir, a roughly chronological account of his life up to the 1990s, with his perspective on the development of fundamental physics over the past century. Cambridge University Press has now published the book, which is written for a wide audience, featuring neither unexplained jargon nor even a single equation.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nHis account of his formative years as a boy from the Bronx, a borough of New York City, is a fascinating glimpse into the influences that shaped him. Born in 1933, during the Great Depression, he was the only child of Frederick and Eva Weinberg, both immigrants from Europe. Although his parents were of modest means, he never felt deprived — they gave him a stable, loving home and cultivated his appetite for learning. He writes: “Whatever native intelligence and intellectual curiosity I may have, I owe to my parents, in particular, my father.”\n\nAlthough not a prodigy, Weinberg was bright and inquisitive, a voracious reader and immersed in the popular culture of the era, especially on radio and television. He flourished at the highly regarded Bronx High School for Science, counting himself lucky to have been educated in a place where “it was cool to be smart”. Many of his fellow students were bright and strongly motivated, including his best friends Sheldon Glashow and Gerald Feinberg, both destined to be leading physicists. Weinberg and Glashow went on to study together as undergraduates at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where Weinberg met the love of his life and soulmate Louise Goldwasser, whom he married in 1954.\n\nTheoretical advances\n\nWeinberg later became best known among physicists as a grandmaster of quantum field theory. This was based on the classical concept of a field, modified to incorporate both quantum mechanics and the special theory of relativity. As a PhD student at Princeton University in New Jersey in the 1950s, he cut his teeth as a field theorist, learning the then recently developed theory of quantum electrodynamics, which described electrons and their interactions with electromagnetic fields.\n\nThe contentious genius who made black holes real\n\nWeinberg was soon regarded as one of the most able young theorists, and he was well aware of his talent. He admits that he was “brash and self-confident” — qualities that irritated some of his colleagues, not least theorists Murray Gell-Mann and Richard Feynman, themselves pre-eminent theorists of the era. Neither of them were friendly to Weinberg, partly, he thought, because he was “too often thinking outside the box, and it was their box”.\n\nHe made his most famous breakthrough soon after he moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, in 1967. He hit on the idea that electromagnetic interactions and the apparently quite different weak interactions responsible for radioactivity could be described inside the framework of a single, ‘electroweak’ model.\n\nWeinberg (and, independently, theorist Abdus Salam) surmised that, at extremely high energies, these two superficially different types of interaction should be intertwined according to a theory introduced by Chen-Ning Yang and Robert Mills in 1953, whose equations featured what was known as gauge symmetry. Weinberg and Salam suggested that this symmetry was hidden by a mechanism — proposed by UK theorist Peter Higgs and independently by François Englert with Robert Brout — endowing mass to most fundamental particles, although not to the photon. The mechanism implied the existence of a spinless particle that experimenters had not observed.\n\nWeinberg and his schoolmate Sheldon Glashow won shares in the 1979 physics Nobel.Credit: Bettmann/Getty\n\nAt first, this idea attracted little attention, mainly because no one could demonstrate that the theory made sensible, finite predictions of measurable quantities — it might not be renormalizable. After the Dutch theorist Gerard ‘t Hooft proved that the Weinberg–Salam model was indeed renormalizable, interest in the theory took off and Weinberg’s paper became one of the most cited in the history of physics.\n\nAfter experimental support for the Weinberg–Salam model rolled in, it was no surprise that they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing it with Weinberg’s secondary-school friend Glashow, who had pioneered the use of gauge theories in particle physics.\n\nBy that time, theorists had successfully devised a gauge theory (quantum chromodynamics) to describe the strong interactions between quarks, constituents of particles such as the proton and neutron. The result was the standard model of particle physics, a unified account of the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions that together describe the behaviour of all atoms. After the experimental discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, there was no doubt that the model was one of the supreme communal achievements in the history of science, with Weinberg being one of its key architects.\n\nNon-specialists might sometimes be overwhelmed by the details of Weinberg’s account of the development of the standard model. But he takes care to leaven his narrative with engaging accounts of his meetings with other famous physicists, including Robert Oppenheimer and quantum pioneers Niels Bohr and Wolfgang Pauli. Most fascinating are his experiences as a member of the JASON group of top-drawer scientists that gives independent, secret advice to the US government.",

It was originally settled in 1801, when a life-saving station was built to aid sailors whose ships had been wrecked. The island consists of grasses and shrubs that sustain a population of around 450 feral horses, descended from an unknown population introduced in the mid-1700s. A meteorological station was established in the 1890s, and biological research began in the 1970s.\n\nTwo of us (V.C. and J.A.) were there to collect data for our PhD projects.

J.A. collects and processes atmospheric microplastic samples in the mornings and then monitors her equipment throughout the rest of the day.\n\nThe island is almost 25 times longer than it is wide. Its expansive coastline hosts the largest breeding population of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the world and has a rich biodiversity of seabirds. The weather often changes without warning, from blaring heat to dense fog. There is an average summer population of 15 people, including federal employees, researchers and visiting academics.\n\nOur island ‘town’ is Parks Canada’s main station. This cluster of buildings, mostly from the 1940s, includes our shared accommodations. The Visitors’ Quarters building has all the comforts of home. Electricity, running water, Wi-Fi and laundry facilities all make the isolation and long working days easier.\n\nWe’ve reflected on our shared experiences to compile advice for early-career researchers (ECRs) journeying into the pressure-cooker environment of remote fieldwork, which poses many challenges. These include managing logistics for the first time, fixing damaged field gear and navigating group dynamics at close quarters. We encourage all ECRs going into the field to take initiative. Given that the barrier between work and life tends to dissolve in the field, initiative can take different forms from those that you might be used to. For example, you might offer to cook, or to verify weather conditions for the next working day or even just to sweep up if you notice that it needs to be done.\n\nDon’t overcomplicate things\n\nGetting to your remote field site is hard, typically involving making relevant partnerships, applying for permits and funding, and ensuring that you are prepared to conduct your science in the field. Don’t be hard on yourself. Fieldwork is unpredictable; for reasons from illness to adverse weather conditions, it isn’t always possible to do everything you initially planned. Put your health and safety first, to prevent burnout.\n\nWe were lucky to spend two periods at our field site, enabling us to better understand sampling protocols and the environment. This helped to reduce the risk of our project not meeting our expectations. For example, V.C.’s work is part of a long-term monitoring project on the feral horses, collecting data through photography and non-invasive faecal sampling without disturbing or handling the animals. Her first field season was spent gaining experience with her study system, which inspired the direction of her PhD project, by asking new questions that use data collected over the past 17 years.\n\nJustine Ammendolia processes atmospheric microplastic samples on Sable Island, as part of her PhD project.Credit: Victoria Crozier\n\nWith any field project, we suggest working with what’s available. In designing her field programme, J.A. could have collected data anywhere on the island, but instead chose to use existing infrastructure, because it didn’t require any extra construction. J.A. has adapted a localized sampling approach that minimizes island travel and uses the Air Chemistry building in the island’s main town to take samples. And although choosing not to sample at multiple points on the island has reduced the number of variables to measure, by keeping things simple, J.A. has framed her project to have reliable data while minimizing its impact on the environment. Our two projects have taken approaches that support the philosophy of ‘leave no trace’, which should inform our work as field scientists.\n\nCapture science in action\n\nWe have supported each other in documenting our fieldwork experiences. This has involved waking up at the crack of dawn to photograph microplastic collections or hiking across the island to document data being collected on feral-horse biology.\n\nWe’ve invested time in developing stories about our research and filming each other in the field, with the intention of sharing the results with audiences back home through seminars, articles and educational-outreach initiatives. J.A. photographed O.A. and V.C. during their fieldwork; the photos were used in an article celebrating O.A.’s experience as an Indigenous scholar. V.C. and O.A. helped J.A. to document her science for her virtual tour, part of her National Geographic Society grant.\n\nVictoria Crozier on Sable Island, collecting data for her PhD project.Credit: Justine Ammendolia\n\nJ.A. shared her knowledge about science communication and photography, and as a group we gained a better understanding of how to develop an impactful story arc and capture complementary footage. As a group, we’ve become better science communicators, working together to capture research in action, so that we can share our science beyond our time in the field. Sharing your research can not only inspire others, but also help to elevate your professional profile and reputation in your field.",

          "abstract": "Cows graze in a drought-afflicted field near Les Brenets, Switzerland, during a 2022 heatwave.Credit: Fabrice Coffeini/AFP via Getty\n\nFarmers suing their government for failing to act on climate change might sound surprising — we’re more used to seeing convoys of tractors in the streets with farmers protesting the imposition of climate and sustainability policies. But that’s just what’s happening in Switzerland — a country where average temperature increases have already hit 2.8 °C compared with preindustrial times.\n\nIn March last year, a group of farmers turned to the Swiss courts to force the government to do more to act on climate change before their farms become unviable.\n\nEarth breaches 1.5 °C climate limit for the first time: what does it mean?\n\nNine farmers and five farmers’ associations, involved in producing crops, fruits and vegetables, viticulture, forestry and animal husbandry, submitted evidence that anthropogenic, climate-related drought and heat, increasing storms, hail and changes in the seasons have led to losses of 10–40% in annual turnover over the past three years (see go.nature.com/4h4bzk6). Adapting to climate change is adding to those losses.\n\nThis case is yet to be settled — having been initially rejected, the farmers are still awaiting the outcome of an appeal. But it marks a big shift in the position of farmers on environmental issues. In the past few years, many lawsuits have been filed — and won — in the United States and beyond to hold ‘methane majors’, which include dairy farms, pork producers and other agricultural corporations, responsible for their contribution to global warming1.\n\nBy contrast, the Swiss case positions farmers as crucial advocates for protecting the climate. It also contributes to a wider trend in which individuals are increasingly taking governments to court for negligence over climate change.\n\nWill lawsuits from farmers make a difference? They might. Here, we explain how.\n\nClimate drivers\n\nFarming is at the heart of climate change. The agri-food sector accounts for about one-third of global greenhouse-gas emissions2,3. And limiting global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, as set out by the 2015 Paris climate agreement, will be impossible without addressing this sector4,5.\n\nAt the same time, agriculture is greatly affected by rising temperatures and extreme weather, including droughts, heatwaves, frosts and heavy rainfall, as well as changes in pests6. These effects differ widely from region to region, from crop to crop and from farm to farm, depending on local climate, terrain and soil types, access to water and the type of farming7.\n\nA water bladder helps farmers to cope with more frequent droughts in Alpine areas.Credit: George Steinmetz/New York Times/Redux/eyevine\n\nCosts arise from lost yields, increased risks and the need to implement adaptation measures and climate-resilient farm practices, such as switching crops, improving soils and using more irrigation. In the long run, farmers worry that climate change could threaten the viability of some farms8.\n\nAlthough Swiss farmers are drawing attention these issues, they are not alone — agriculturalists all over the world are being severely affected by rapidly changing climates.\n\nPrivileged position\n\nSo far, agriculture has also been exempted from the strictest regulations on climate and environmental protection, owing to its economic and cultural importance9,10. For example, the Global Methane Pledge, launched in 2021 at the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference, focuses mainly on cutting emissions of this potent greenhouse gas from the oil, gas and waste sectors rather than from food systems. In 2023 at COP28, parties to the Paris climate agreement signed a non-binding pledge on sustainable agriculture, but only in relation to adapting current practices, not mitigating climate change.\n\nScience could solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Why aren’t governments using it?\n\nIn the past few years, some nations have begun to take a closer look at agriculture’s role in climate policy. The European Green Deal and Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are pushing towards sustainable food production and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions while strengthening the resilience of food systems11. Similarly, Switzerland’s Climate Strategy for Agriculture and Food emphasizes self-sufficiency while cutting the nation’s food-related ecological footprint, through recommendations, food labels, dietary advice and research.\n\nStill, farmers remain sceptical. Putting farmers in the spotlight of climate policy has reinforced the message that they are ‘polluters who have to pay’. And across Europe in 2024, many farmers engaged in organized protests in response12. As well as dealing with rising production costs, competitive pressure from free trade agreements, high margins paid to retailers and poor working conditions, they are now shouldering the costs and regulatory burdens of climate policy, they say.\n\nYet, as farmers face increasing climate impacts themselves, some are beginning to question this ‘farmer versus environment’ narrative and are calling for more action to protect their livelihoods — while securing food production.\n\nGrowing pressure\n\nThe Swiss farmers who brought the lawsuit accuse their national government of failing to take effective measures to protect them from the most sweeping effects of climate change. Farmers argue that, because the government has disregarded its own climate-change laws for more than 20 years and is acting contrary to its own long-term climate strategy, it is unlikely that Switzerland will meet its future commitments. Many farms will be less profitable and face higher risks owing to climate change, threatening the continuation of business.\n\nSwiss farmers use their tractors to form an SOS signal near Goumoens-la-Ville, Switzerland.Credit: Valentin Flauraud/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nIn legal terms, the farmers claim that, as well as violating their rights to life, private and family life and personal liberty, government inaction is threatening their economic freedom and property rights. After the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications disagreed initially, the farmers lodged an appeal with the Swiss Federal Administrative Court; if that fails, too, the judgment will probably be appealed to the Federal Supreme Court.",

          "abstract": "The DeepSeek model is accessible through a chatbot app.Credit: Mladen Antonov/AFP via Getty\n\nScientists are flocking to DeepSeek-R1, a cheap and powerful artificial intelligence (AI) ‘reasoning’ model that sent the US stock market spiralling after it was released by a Chinese firm last week.\n\nRepeated tests suggest that DeepSeek-R1’s ability to solve mathematics and science problems matches that of the o1 model, released in September by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, whose reasoning models are considered industry leaders.\n\nHow China created AI model DeepSeek and shocked the world\n\nAlthough R1 still fails on many tasks that researchers might want it to perform, it is giving scientists worldwide the opportunity to train custom reasoning models designed to solve problems in their disciplines.\n\n“Based on its great performance and low cost, we believe Deepseek-R1 will encourage more scientists to try LLMs in their daily research, without worrying about the cost,” says Huan Sun, an AI researcher at Ohio State University in Columbus. “Almost every colleague and collaborator working in AI is talking about it.”\n\nOpen season\n\nFor researchers, R1’s cheapness and openness could be game-changers: using its application programming interface (API), they can query the model at a fraction of the cost of proprietary rivals, or for free by using its online chatbot, DeepThink. They can also download the model to their own servers and run and build on it for free — which isn’t possible with competing closed models such as o1.\n\nSince R1’s launch on 20 January, “tons of researchers” have been investigating training their own reasoning models, based on and inspired by R1, says Cong Lu, an AI researcher at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. That’s backed up by data from Hugging Face, an open-science repository for AI that hosts the DeepSeek-R1 code. In the week since its launch, the site had logged more than three million downloads of different versions of R1, including those already built on by independent users.\n\nHow does ChatGPT ‘think’? Psychology and neuroscience crack open AI large language models\n\nScientific tasks\n\nIn preliminary tests of R1’s abilities on data-driven scientific tasks — taken from real papers in topics including bioinformatics, computational chemistry and cognitive neuroscience — the model matched o1’s performance, says Sun. Her team challenged both AI models to complete 20 tasks from a suite of problems they have created, called the ScienceAgentBench. These include tasks such as analysing and visualizing data. Both models solved only around one-third of the challenges correctly. Running R1 using the API cost 13 times less than did o1, but it had a slower “thinking” time than o1, notes Sun.\n\nR1 is also showing promise in mathematics. Frieder Simon , a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Oxford, UK, challenged both models to create a proof in the abstract field of functional analysis and found R1’s argument more promising than o1’s. But given that such models make mistakes, to benefit from them researchers need to be already armed with skills such as telling a good and bad proof apart, he says.\n\nMuch of the excitement over R1 is because it has been released as ‘open-weight’, meaning that the learnt connections between different parts of its algorithm are available to build on. Scientists who download R1, or one of the much smaller ‘distilled’ versions also released by DeepSeek, can improve its performance in their field through extra training, known as fine tuning. Given a suitable data set, researchers could train the model to improve at coding tasks specific to the scientific process, says Sun.\n\nChina’s cheap, open AI model DeepSeek thrills scientists",

          "authors": "Meghie Rodrigues",
          "abstract": "At age 75, Vadevino Alano keeps up a brisk pace as he strides through the forest on the way to the Armadillo’s Den — a spectacular cave in southern Brazil. When he reaches the cave’s opening, Alano is dwarfed by the size of the hole, which is big enough to accommodate a van.\n\nAlano steps into the cave and enters a different world. The air is noticeably warmer and the cavern echoes loudly as Alano, who is a local guide, discusses the cave’s history with Juliano Campos, an archaeologist at the University of the Extreme South of Santa Catarina (UNESC) in Criciúma, Brazil. According to local legend, the Armadillo’s Den — known as Toca do Tatu in Portuguese — was a hiding place where Jesuit missionaries stored gold centuries ago. But the real treasure is more ancient and strange.\n\nCampos points to the ceiling of the cave, which is covered with deep grooves. He and other researchers suspect that the scars were carved by giant ground sloths that roamed the region until they went extinct more than 10,000 years ago. “This is an archaeological and palaeontological marvel,” says Campos.\n\nLocal guide Vadevino Alano (left) and archaeologist Juliano Campos examine gouges that researchers have identified as being scratch marks left by ice age ground sloths.Credit: Rafael Lange for Nature\n\nFor generations, these structures have puzzled travellers and scientists, who have debated how they formed. Explorers in the early twentieth century attributed the spaces to ancient Indigenous groups. But research in the past decade has coalesced around the theory that the caves were carved by extinct megafauna.\n\nPalaeontologists have been amassing evidence to tease out which creatures were responsible and how they carved such huge burrows — the biggest known caves of their type in the world — from solid rock. But many questions remain about these enigmatic formations, says Campos.\n\nThe vast desert\n\nResearchers call these caves giant palaeoburrows and most are concentrated in Brazil, with a few in Argentina, says Heinrich Frank, a retired geologist formerly at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil. He founded the Palaeoburrows Project research group in the early 2000s to study these structures.\n\nAccording to Francisco Buchmann, a palaeo-oceanographer at São Paulo State University in São Vicente, Brazil, the majority of the caves are found in a particular layer of sandstone called the Botucatu Formation. It dates to more than 100 million years ago, a time when the region was a large desert. “The Sahara is small compared to this one,” says Buchmann, who leads the Palaeoburrows Project with Frank.\n\nBecause of how those desert sands solidified, the Botucatu sandstone is soft enough to carve but not so soft that it falls apart too easily, says Maria Carolina Villaça Gomes, a physical geographer at the State University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.\n\nThe rounded edges of the scratches indicate they are much older than modern graffiti.Credit: Rafael Lange for Nature\n\nInside the Armadillo’s Den, the rock is covered with modern graffiti, which researchers can spot because its edges are much crisper than those of the inscriptions made by ancient human residents. Alano points to a zig-zag carving on the wall. “This line puzzled many explorers who came here in the past,” he says. “But what it most certainly shows is an ancient map of the Rocinha River that flows nearby,” because it depicts specific bends seen in the nearby canyons. “Past Indigenous groups could have used it to orient themselves in the region,” says Alano, a descendant of one of the Indigenous groups that could have left the inscription.\n\nJust a few metres beyond the zig-zag line, the cave presents evidence of even older residents. The large scratches on the walls and ceiling have stunned palaeontologists and other scientists from across South America.\n\nFrank and Buchmann were part of the first group to describe the Armadillo’s Den, and suggested in 2012 that it was carved by ancient megafauna1. It is an example of what palaeontologists refer to as an ichnofossil: tracks, tunnels and other marks left by ancient organisms.\n\nGone with a trace\n\nThe South American palaeoburrows might be the largest ichnofossils known so far, says Luis Buatois, an ichnologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada.\n\nIn the field of ichnology, researchers assign genus and species names to specific ichnofossils. In a study of these caves, Buchmann, Frank and their colleagues divided the South American palaeoburrows into two types: Megaichnus minor and Megaichnus major2. The M. minor type includes tunnels with openings measuring 0.6–1.5 metres wide by 0.5–0.9 metres high, and a maximum length of 30 metres. The M. major type is massive: more than 2 m high by 4 m wide, with a length that can exceed 50 m.\n\nThe battle to rebuild centuries of science after an epic inferno\n\nThe longest described so far is in Pará state in the Amazon region, with combined internal galleries some 1,500 metres long, says Buchmann.\n\nAccording to Frank, there are between 1,500 and 2,000 of these structures in South America, but none on other continents, which baffles scientists. Caves of the M. major type have so far been found only in Brazil. Just a few of each type of cave have been described in detail, and they are hard to find because most — about 70% of the M. major ones — are filled with rubble. “We often find them when a company is doing some earth-moving work for construction,” Frank says.\n\nKnowledge of these caves goes back more than a century, and researchers have long thought the giant palaeoburrows were archaeological structures left by people. But in 2001, Sergio Vizcaíno, head of the vertebrate palaeontology department at the La Plata Museum in Argentina and his colleagues proposed that the large palaeoburrows that have claw-like markings on the walls and roof could have been excavated by ground sloths belonging to the extinct genera Scelidotherium and Glossotherium3. The scratches are a match for these animals’ claws, he and his colleagues argued.\n\nOne species, Glossotherium robustum, a South American sloth that lived between 4 million and 12,500 years ago, reached more than 3 metres in length and weighed up to 1,500 kilograms. A smaller species of sloth, Scelidotherium leptocephalum, inhabited South America between about 800,000 and 11,000 years ago. It is thought to have been about one metre long, weighing up to one tonne.\n\nA reconstruction of several extinct ground sloths and armadillos compares them with the dimensions of some caves found in South America.Credit: Renato Pereira Lopes\n\nAccording to Richard Fariña, a palaeontologist at the University of the Republic Uruguay in Montevideo, the anatomy of these large ancient sloths suggests that they were efficient diggers.\n\nDespite their size and strength, individual animals might not have carved each burrow, says Vizcaíno. He suggests that the caves might instead have been the work of several animals over time. “Palaeoburrows must be transgenerational, as the energy cost decreases when the work is done by many individuals,” he says.\n\nHumanity’s oldest art is flaking away. Can scientists save it?\n\nWhy these animals would dig such large, long burrows is not clear, however. Néstor Toledo, a comparative anatomist at the La Plata Museum argues that giant prehistoric armadillos might have carved the smaller burrows to hide from predators, and giant sloths “could have started digging to protect themselves from a colder and drier climate” during ice ages. Ground sloths might also have used the caves to hide offspring from predators.",

          "abstract": "Artist’s illustration of antibodies (Y-shaped structures) flocking towards a SARS-CoV-2 particle (spiked sphere).Credit: KTSDesign/Science Photo Library\n\nAs COVID-19 began to surge five years ago, no one knew what to expect.\n\nNeither did the immune system.\n\nConfronted with a new virus, humanity was immunologically naive. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 provided a rare opportunity to study the immune system in action, and researchers raced to gather all the data they could. “The world was exposed to a brand-new pathogen,” says Nadia Roan, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco. “We were trying to leverage that to learn more about immunity.”\n\nYears later, scientists are still sifting through the data to garner a better understanding of how the immune system works. Here are four lessons they’ve learnt so far.\n\nAntibodies aren’t everything\n\nEarly in the pandemic, many researchers focused on the antibodies produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like antibodies, the immune components called T cells also combat infection — but these drew less attention at first. Many clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines, for example, analysed antibody levels and not T cells.\n\nThat’s in part because T cells are more difficult to study than antibodies, and so our understanding of them has lagged, says Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, California.\n\nAs the pandemic went on, however, it became clear that T cells were a crucial arm of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and to COVID-19 vaccines, says Alessandro Sette, also an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 waned in the months after vaccination, but vaccinated people continued to make T cells that recognized the virus1. That T-cell protection remained strong, Sette and others found2, even against viral variants that dodged the antibody defences raised by the first generation of COVID vaccines.\n\n“People used to focus more on antibodies, and tended to forget about the T-cell responses,” says Rosemary Boyton, an immunologist at Imperial College London. “Now we understand much, much better that the T-cell responses matter as well.”\n\nEarly-warning immune alarm reaches the whole body\n\nThe pandemic also gave researchers new insights into the innate immune system, another line of defence against viruses.\n\nInnate immune responses are not as specific as antibodies and T cells. Cells can unleash these responses when they detect foreign molecules, such as the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. When a cell discovers a telltale molecule, it raises the alarm, by releasing proteins called interferons. These proteins activate hundreds of genes, including many involved in viral defence. The interferon response also notifies other cells in the same organ to be on high alert, says Benjamin tenOever, a virologist at New York University in New York City. “It can be very damning to a virus.”\n\nKids and COVID: why young immune systems are still on top\n\nBefore the pandemic, researchers thought that this warning cry did not travel far beyond the site of infection. But when tenOever and his colleagues analysed samples from hamsters and from autopsies of people who had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2, they found signs of interferon responses throughout the body, even in organs far away from infected cells3. Later, the team learnt that this is not limited to SARS-CoV-2: the influenza virus also elicits a widespread interferon response in hamsters.\n\ntenOever hypothesizes that these global antiviral defences bolster protection in case the infection travels rapidly through the body. They might also be part of the reason that the SARS-CoV-2 variants that spread later in the pandemic were less likely than their predecessors to cause severe disease: the later variants bound better than earlier forms of the virus to cells in the nose, keeping the virus in the upper airways for longer. That allowed time for the innate warning signal to reach the lungs and bolster defences there before the virus arrived.\n\nThe nose knows\n\nBefore the pandemic, researchers weren’t terribly interested in the nose, says Jose Ordovas-Montanes, an immunologist at Boston Children’s Hospital in Massachusetts. “It was seen as just a passive tube to get air to the lungs,” he says. “And the lungs were where the business happened.”\n\nThe pandemic underscored the importance of understanding immune responses in specific tissues, and especially in the place where infection often starts: the nose.\n\nThe moist lining of the nose is a unique immune environment that contains a different blend of antibodies and immune cells from that found in the blood. As a result, injected vaccines, which generate antibodies in the bloodstream, might not be ideal for blocking infection in the nose. “One of the lessons from the pandemic is location, location, location,” says Crotty.",

          "abstract": "Fragments of the asteroid Bennu, carefully collected and ferried to Earth by a robotic spacecraft, contain the building blocks for life, NASA announced today.\n\nNASA ‘fist bumps’ an asteroid to reveal Solar System’s secrets\n\nNot only does Bennu contain all 5 of the nucleobases that form DNA and RNA on Earth and 14 of the 20 amino acids found in known proteins, the asteroid’s amino acids hold a surprise. On Earth, amino acids in living organisms predominantly have a ‘left-handed’ chemical structure. Bennu, however, contains nearly equal amounts of these structures and their ‘right-handed’, mirror-image forms, calling into question scientists’ hypothesis that asteroids similar to this one might have seeded life on Earth.\n\nThe work appears in Nature Astronomy1.\n\n“What makes these results so significant is that we’re finding them in a pristine sample,” says co-author Daniel Glavin, an astrobiologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. When meteorites fall to Earth, they are heated in the atmosphere and contaminated by the planet’s molecules. The Bennu samples were ferried to Earth in a sealed canister, protected from the heat, and analysed in a super-clean laboratory space under inert gas.\n\nThe specimens contain the richest bounty of life-friendly extraterrestrial compounds ever brought to Earth.\n\nA salty finding\n\nBut that’s not all they contain. In an accompanying paper published in Nature today2, other researchers report that the material from Bennu is also rich in salts created billions of years ago, probably when watery ponds on Bennu’s parent asteroid evaporated and left behind a crust of minerals. Although no signs of life were spotted on Bennu, those salty ponds would have been a good environment to foster the chemistry that could lead to it. This might involve small, carbon-rich molecules such as methanal (formaldehyde) — a simple compound that was found in the Bennu samples.\n\n“Having these brines there, along with simple organic stuff, may have kick-started [the process of] making much more complicated and interesting organics like the nucleobases,” says Sara Russell, a mineralogist at the Natural History Museum in London and an author of the Nature paper.\n\nA scanning electron microscope image of the sodium carbonate crystalline needles found in samples of the asteroid Bennu.Credit: Rob Wardell, Tim Gooding and Tim McCoy/Smithsonian\n\nThe Bennu discovery helps to illuminate how, early in the Solar System’s history, asteroids and other planetary building blocks were not just “lumps of stone and ice, but active ‘living’ objects”, says Yasuhito Sekine, a planetary scientist at the Earth-Life Science Institute in Tokyo who wrote a News & Views article accompanying the Nature paper.\n\nBoth sets of results come from NASA’s US$1.2-billion mission OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security — Regolith Explorer. The spacecraft launched from Florida in 2016, flew to Bennu, collected rocks and dust from the asteroid’s surface in 2020 and landed back on Earth in Utah in 2023.\n\nBefore the mission visited Bennu, scientists knew that the asteroid was probably carbonaceous — rich in carbon, and containing water molecules locked up in clay minerals. But until the samples came back to Earth and went into NASA’s curation facility in Houston, Texas, researchers didn’t know how much of a bounty they had.\n\nLargest-ever sample",

          "abstract": "The administration of President Trump set off an uproar 27 January by suspending federal spending on grants and loans.Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty\n\nUpdate: In a memo sent to federal agencies on 29 January, the administration of US president Donald Trump rescinded its 27 January order that would have frozen federal loans and grants beginning on 28 January. But Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on the social-media platform X that the latest move is not a cancellation of the funding freeze but a withdrawal of the 27 January order. It remains unclear which federal grants and loans are frozen.\n\nResearchers in the United States are reeling after the administration of new president Donald Trump issued an order on 27 January that froze all federal grants and loans. A federal judge in Washington DC temporarily blocked the order late today, but it had already spurred many US universities to advise faculty members against spending federal grant dollars on travel, new research projects, equipment and more.\n\nThe Republican-led administration issued a subsequent memo today attempting to clarify what is and is not covered by the freeze, but it included no information specific to scientific funding, leaving many scientists just as confused as when the order was issued.\n\n“If somehow they are allowed to get away with this, the disruption is almost incalculable,” says John Holdren, the former US science adviser to Democratic president Barack Obama.\n\nThe order is only the latest in a stream of White House directives on federal spending, diversity and other programmes that have sown chaos and confusion in the US scientific community. In the past week, the Trump administration ordered staff members at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), charged with protecting US health, to cease communication with the World Health Organization and scrubbed most federal websites of any material about diversity. Additionally, agencies such as the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF), major funders of basic US science, have suspended research-grant review meetings.\n\nMajor biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0\n\nResearchers aren’t sitting still: hundreds of scientists sprang into action on the social-media platform Bluesky to organize a rally at the White House today and to set up sessions for people to call their elected officials to stop the freeze.\n\nScientists are worried about the long-term effects of the administration’s actions. “It will be much easier to destroy the world’s greatest scientific ecosystem than it will be to try to rebuild it,” says Carole LaBonne, a developmental biologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nThe White House, the NIH and the NSF did not respond to queries about the breadth of the order, when it will be lifted or scientists' concerns.\n\nFrozen in place\n\nThe spending freeze was outlined in a 27 January memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which ordered federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance”. It singled out spending on “foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion], woke gender ideology, and the green new deal”, the name that Trump has given to climate legislation passed during the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nAs reported by the journalist Marisa Kabas, the memo was challenged in court by a coalition of states and legal experts who argue it illegally suspends funds appropriated by the US Congress. Matthew Lawrence, an expert in administrative law at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, says that the US Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to appropriate funds. An order that imposes “a halt across the board, and without a special message would violate the Impoundment Control Act”, he says, referring to a 1974 law that limited the president’s power to impound, or withhold, funding.\n\nWhat Trump 2.0 means for science: the likely winners and losers\n\nThe memo’s broad language left researchers confused about which portion of the country’s roughly US$200 billion annual spending on research and development is affected. Worried about the risk of non-compliance and without more clarity, many university officials have already begun to freeze funding at their institutions. For example, the University of Chicago in Illinois informed its faculty members on Tuesday that they should suspend certain spending on federally issued grants.\n\n“We must for now proceed under the assumption that grant expenditures incurred after today while this memorandum is in effect may not be covered by federal funding,” university provost Katherine Baicker wrote in an e-mail to faculty members. “This is not a request that I make lightly.”\n\nElusive clarity\n\nThe OMB issued a memo today clarifying that the funding pause does not apply to benefits programmes such as Medicare, which provides health care to older people in the United States, and it emphasized that the 27 January order sets up a process for agencies to determine which spending is affected. After review, the spending pause could be “as short as [a] day”, the clarification said, without offering a specific example of a programme whose funding had been restored.",

          "title": "‘Dark proteins’ hiding in our cells could hold clues to cancer and other diseases",
          "authors": "Ewen Callaway",
          "abstract": "Illustration: Fabio Buonocore\n\nIn 2009, Jonathan Weissman was hunting for a new way to spy on what happens inside a cell. In particular, the molecular cell biologist wanted to know what proteins are produced at any given moment. So his laboratory came up with a way to directly measure the output of ribosomes — the cell’s protein factories.\n\nThe method, developed with then-postdoc Nicholas Ingolia, who is now at the University of California, Berkeley, involves collecting all of a cells’ ribosomes and sequencing the individual strands of messenger RNA that are bound to them. The researchers hoped this tool, called ribosome profiling, would provide an accurate tally of all the proteins a cell makes and their relative quantities.\n\nBut, when Weissman and others began trying the method out, they turned up a giant surprise. Not only were ribosomes busily churning out proteins encoded by known genes in a cell’s genome, but they also seemed to be making thousands upon thousands of ‘dark proteins’ that map to portions of the genome that weren’t thought to produce proteins1. “That was the ‘Aha!’ moment for us,” says Weissman, who is based at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Soon, his lab and others were uncovering unexpected translation events in nearly every organism they examined.\n\nAI scans RNA ‘dark matter’ and uncovers 70,000 new viruses\n\nFifteen years later, scientists are still scratching their heads over what to make of these proteins.\n\nDark proteins tend to be short — often just a few dozen amino acids or fewer. And many are unfamiliar — they don’t have close relatives in the genomes of other organisms. Studies suggest that some could have essential roles in the cell and might influence human health. They seem to be abundant in some cancers, and several companies hope to develop treatments that target dark proteins. But for many of these mysterious entities, the evidence that they’re doing anything important — or even whether they survive for very long in the cell — is equivocal.\n\nThe problem, says Marie Brunet, who studies proteomics at University of Sherbrooke in Canada, is that scientists don’t really know what they might be missing. “If you have a protein lacking from the repository, you’re not even looking for it,” she says.\n\nGene-counting conundrum\n\nBrunet is part of a global effort to document all of the dark proteins encoded by the human genome (see ‘Exploring the dark proteome’). The goal is to draw researchers’ attention to this dark matter, so they can begin working out what the proteins are doing, molecule by molecule.\n\nSource: J. R. Prensner et al. Mol. Cell Prot. 22, 100631 (2023).\n\nThe prospects are exciting, says Sebastiaan van Heesch, a systems biologist at the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology in Utrecht, the Netherlands, who is also part of the effort: “There’s definitely new biology there.”\n\nLeading up to the first publications of the human genome in the early 2000s, researchers were furiously examining the emerging sequence data trying to estimate the number of protein-coding genes. Typically, they looked for what are known as open reading frames (ORFs), stretches of code with specific three-letter sequences, or codons, that can contain instructions for making a protein. Genomicists looked for further clues, such as evidence that a sequence is conserved among other organisms and of reasonable length, all of which are indications that the resulting protein might have a function in cells.\n\nMany ORFs that didn’t meet these criteria were ignored or simply missed as biologists refined their estimates. Consortia that maintain lists of predicted genes, such as the GENCODE project, currently list just shy of 20,000 protein-coding genes. About 90% of these have been confirmed through other efforts, to produce corresponding proteins (individual genes can encode multiple different proteins, by including or omitting stretches of code called exons). GENCODE and other projects make periodic adjustments to their lists as data emerge.\n\nAI has dreamt up a blizzard of new proteins. Do any of them actually work?\n\nBut, according to John Prensner, a cancer biologist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, the accounting is incomplete. The idea that researchers could draw up a complete list of protein-coding genes as early as 2001 was a popular misconception. “The leaders of the Human Genome Project always knew they were just starting a conversation,” Prensner says.\n\nThe ability to directly measure ribosomes’ output led to an explosion of interest in overlooked ORFs and their potential to encode working proteins. In a 2022 correspondence to Nature Biotechnology, a team co-led by Prensner, van Heesch and others assembled a list of more than 7,000 of these ‘non-canonical’ ORFs, which generally don’t meet the requirements to be considered protein-coding genes and have therefore been omitted from databases2. (That is a lower bound, says van Heesch; other studies have identified tens of thousands of potential dark proteins encoded by the human genome.)\n\nMost of the unconventional ORFs that the scientists listed are found either near to or overlapping with canonical, protein-coding genes (see ‘Where are all the dark proteins?’). About one-third of them were in sequences called long non-coding RNAs, which — as the name suggests — weren’t expected to encode proteins but were thought to have regulatory roles.\n\nSource: J. R. Prensner et al. Mol. Cell Prot. 22, 100631 (2023)\n\nBut just because an ORF is translated into a protein doesn’t mean that the proteins are stable or have important jobs in a cell. The translation of some non-canonical ORFs, which is carried out by ribosomes, could be a way for cells to control the activity of a nearby gene, for instance, by gumming up the ribosomal machinery with products that will be quickly degraded, say Prensner and others. This sort of control occurs in certain upstream ORFs that appear ahead of a protein-coding sequence.\n\nIn a preprint study that follows up on their 2022 publication, Prensner, van Heesch and an expanded consortium of genomics and proteomics specialists trawled through hundreds of proteomics data sets — comprising billions of data points — and findings from studies that used mass spectrometry and other approaches to identify the protein content of cells3. The researchers found protein fragments corresponding to more than 1,700 of the non-canonical ORFs they had identified in 2022. For 15 of them, the researchers argued, the evidence was strong enough to make a case for adding the proteins and their corresponding genes to official tallies of protein-coding genes.\n\nBut, for most non-canonical ORFs, clear-cut evidence that they can produce a protein is lacking. Part of the challenge is the small size of the potential proteins — researchers call them microproteins because they tend to be much shorter than 100 amino acids (on average human proteins contain several hundred amino acids, and many are much longer). Their short length makes it hard to find matching fragments — which are created in experiments that break proteins apart and identify the resulting shards by their mass. Cell samples will over-represent the fragments of longer proteins, says van Heesch, particularly if the microproteins are less abundant.\n\nWhen scientists have used the artificial-intelligence tool called AlphaFold to predict the structure of dark proteins, the molecules often bear little resemble to well-folded, bona fide proteins. But, Presner says, “there are clear examples that very much look like canonical proteins and were just missed”. GENCODE and other organizations that manage repositories have begun to add these overlooked proteins to their lists.\n\nJonathan Mudge, who works on the GENCODE project at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, and is a co-author of the preprint, says that around 50 sequences identified through ribosome profiling have been included in its list of human protein-coding genes.\n\nBut they are moving carefully, he adds. It isn’t just lab biologists who rely on efforts such as GENCODE to make sense of experiments. Clinicians, too, rely on such databases, and adding a slew of suspect protein-coding genes could complicate efforts to identify harmful variants found in patient genomes, says Mudge. “We’re not sceptical. We’re just cautious,” he says.\n\nEdits for clarity\n\nAround the time that researchers started shining a spotlight on the genomes’ potential to encode dark proteins, another breakthrough made it possible to systematically study their effects in cells: CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing. “Suddenly we could surgically take out the coding sequence of these non-canonical proteins and ask, are they important for the function of the cell?” Weissman says.\n\nIn a 2020 Science paper, Weissman’s team showed just that. The researchers used CRISPR gene editing to interrupt thousands of non-canonical ORFs, preventing them from being translated into proteins in human induced pluripotent cells, as well as by a cancer cell line4. In hundreds of instances, the CRISPR editing caused a growth defect in the cells. “Many microproteins were really important for cells,” says Weissman.\n\nWith further experiments, they were able to ascertain why. In some instances, the proteins encoded by a non-canonical ORF interacted with a protein encoded on the same mRNA strand. This is reminiscent of the way that co-regulated bacterial genes tend to reside next to one another in units called operons, Weissman says. The functional dark proteins his team identified took on diverse roles in cells: one seemed to be involved in the cell cycle, another in mitochondrial physiology.\n\n‘Dark matter’ DNA influences brain development\n\nCancer cells might be especially rich in dark proteins. Prensner, who is also a paediatric neuro-oncologist, is studying the possibility that non-canonical ORFs present in all human genomes can become misregulated in some cancers, potentially contributing to different treatment outcomes that he and other cancer physicians see in their patients. “We’re asking the central question of why cancers are making these things,” he says.\n\nIn similar experiments to Weissman’s, a team led by Prensner found that about 10% of more than 500 non-canonical ORFs they inactivated with CRISPR caused growth defects in various kinds of human cancer cell5. Prensner and his colleagues identified a dark protein that was expressed at elevated levels in breast-cancer cell lines and also seemed to be driving their growth.\n\nIn a study published last year, Prensner, van Heesch and their colleagues identified several dark proteins that contribute to medulloblastomas, sometimes fatal paediatric brain cancers6. In one example, the researchers showed that a dark protein — independent of a canonical protein encoded by an adjacent ORF — was driving the growth of especially aggressive forms of medulloblastoma that carry an overactive version of a cancer gene called MYC.",

That’s the finding of a study1 that tracked citations linked to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), a US law designed to protect and support the recovery of species at risk of extinction.\n\nGiven that the ESA has the power to halt logging, construction, problematic fishing practices and other human activities that threaten vulnerable wildlife, getting a species added to it can be an important way for a conservation biologist to help protect populations.\n\nBut publishing in the kinds of journal that are more likely to influence the ESA could set conservation researchers back in their careers, says study co-author Brian Silliman, a marine conservation biologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. For decisions about who gets hired, promoted or funded, he says, a researcher’s impact is too often equated with the number of citations they receive and the impact factor of the journals they’ve published in (the standard way of calculating a journal’s impact factor is by dividing the number of times all the papers it has published in the past two years were cited in the last year by the total number of papers published in those two years.)\n\n“When you have graduate students who are trying to get jobs, you generally advise them not to publish in taxon-specific journals, because they’re going to be low impact factor,” says Silliman. “Even if it’s great science and it has applications to other systems, it’s a very limited audience and it’s going to be harder for them to get a job.”\n\nThis disconnect between what’s valued in academia and what has real-life impact prompted Silliman to ask a graduate class to think of alternative ways to evaluate research. PhD student and co-author Jonathan Choi suggested that they investigate which journals are publishing the studies that are cited in the ESA when new species are added to it.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nChoi and his colleagues examined documentation for the 260 species that were added to the ESA by the administration of Barack Obama between 2012 and 2016. They counted 4,836 citations for academic papers published in 785 journals. Categorizing the journals according to their impact factor, they showed that only 7% of ESA citations came from journals with an impact factor of more than 9, whereas 87% came from journals with an impact factor of less than 4 or no impact factor at all. Mid-ranking journals accounted for 6%. Journals that have not been given an impact factor by Clarivate — often because they are not considered influential enough — represented 13% of ESA citations.\n\nThe team also created an “ESA listing impact factor”, which was based on the fraction of papers that a journal publishes that go on to be cited by the ESA. The highest ranked journal was Pacific Science, a regional journal with a conventional impact factor of just 0.74.\n\nCollectively, regional journals, such as The Southwestern Naturalist and The American Midland Naturalist, and taxa-specific journals, such as the Journal of the Lepidopterists Society, American Fern Journal and American Malacological Bulletin, were the most important sources of ESA citations, says Choi. Habitat-specific journals such as Coral Reefs and Rangeland Ecology & Management were also important, he adds.\n\nThe study, published in Conservation Biology, highlights how conservation law relies on the type of rigorous practical work that is typically published in niche journals but is not rewarded by academic promotion and funding systems.\n\nGreater support needed for fieldwork\n\nChoi is careful to point out that the study’s findings do not devalue the kind of theory-driven science that appeals to high-impact-factor journals. Rather, they emphasize the need to support researchers who want to do other kinds of work, such as long-term population-monitoring studies, without sacrificing their career prospects. “That is really important science when it comes to conservation that we stand to lose if we don’t incentivize this kind of very baseline data collection,” says Choi.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Jim Young/Reuters\n\nJames Fraser Stoddart created a field of chemistry based on threaded and mechanically connected molecules, held together like links of a chain rather than through conventional chemical bonds. He recognized that the motions of the linked components could be exploited to make artificial molecular machinery, a breakthrough for which he shared the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Jean-Pierre Sauvage and Bernard L. Feringa. He has died aged 82.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh, UK, Stoddart was brought up on a remote farm that lacked electricity. He said that farm living instilled in him “the work ethic of a honeybee”. The young Stoddart played with construction toys such as Meccano, which he later suggested was an inspiration for his building of machines from molecules. After completing a PhD in chemistry at the University of Edinburgh, he took a postdoctoral position at Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. The parting advice of the University of Edinburgh’s chair of organic chemistry, Edmund Hirst, rang in his ears: “Whatever you do in research, Stoddart, make sure you work on a big problem!”\n\nNanoscale scythe cuts molecular tethers using mechanical forces\n\nIn 1970, Stoddart returned to the United Kingdom to do a lectureship at the University of Sheffield, and began to search for a problem. The emerging field of supramolecular chemistry — chemistry beyond the molecule — caught his attention. He became intrigued by cyclic molecules called crown ethers, which could bind metal ions and charged organic molecules within their rings.\n\nFrom 1978, Stoddart spent three years on secondment to the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) Corporate Laboratories in Runcorn, UK, while — back in Sheffield — his students prepared a series of transition-metal complexes with crown ethers. Structural similarities between those complexes and the herbicides he had seen at ICI led Stoddart to explore crown ethers that could bind to the weedkiller Paraquat. A visiting Spanish PhD student threaded a paraquat derivative through a crown ether ring, then connected the derivative’s two ends. The result: two cyclic molecules mechanically linked together, called a [2]catenane.\n\nStoddart’s team then created a [2]rotaxane — a ring-shaped molecule threaded onto a dumbbell-shaped molecule, with the ring darting back and forth between two ‘stations’ on the dumbbell’s shaft. In a 1991 paper, Stoddart termed it a ‘molecular shuttle’, noting: “Insofar as it becomes possible to control the movement of one molecular component with respect to the other in a [2]rotaxane, the technology for building ‘molecular machines’ will emerge.” (P. L. Anelli et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 5131–5133; 1991).\n\nAn artificial molecular motor powered by electricity\n\nHe had found his problem. Over the next two decades, the Stoddart group pioneered the field of artificial molecular machinery, producing eye-catching molecular objects that resembled in some aspects their counterparts from the macroscopic world, including a ‘molecular elevator’ and ‘Olympiadane’, a molecular version of the Olympic rings.",

          "authors": "Holly Else",
          "abstract": "Prominent ecologist Thomas Crowther, whose research on trees has influenced figures including US President Donald Trump, will depart the prestigious Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) after the institution said that it would not renew his contract. ETH Zurich says it has received “reports of alleged misconduct on a variety of levels” and has lost trust in the assistant professor.\n\nCrowther and ETH Zurich declined to comment on the allegations. Crowther says that he is in talks to relocate his laboratory, which employs 40–60 people.\n\n“The team is doing its best to be resilient, but most of us are in shock, and there is grief over what has been lost,” says Emily Clark, the group’s manager, who describes the atmosphere in the lab as quiet and sad. Members of Crowther’s team were told in mid-December that they would lose their jobs by September because the lab is being dissolved, according to a member who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nCrowther rose to prominence while doing postdoctoral research at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. In 2015, he was lead author on a paper published in Nature1 that suggested there were nearly eight times more trees growing on Earth than expected. His research garnered attention from influential people and inspired the launch a high-profile tree-conservation initiative by the World Economic Forum (WEF), which received support from the first Trump administration. He was dubbed the ‘Steve Jobs of ecology’ and profiled by journals including Nature and Science.\n\nMillions in funding\n\nIn 2017, Crowther moved to ETH Zurich on a tenure-track professorship. He secured 7.6 million Swiss francs (US$8.4 million) in funding from a Dutch non-profit foundation called DOB Ecology in Veessen over ten years, from 2017 to 2027, for a project to understand how ecological processes drive the carbon cycle and climate. (DOB Ecology told Nature that the funding planned for 2025–27 has been suspended pending the result of ETH Zurich’s investigation into the allegations.)\n\nIn late 2024, Swiss media reported that eight people had made allegations against Crowther to the university. Details of the allegations have not been reported, and ETH Zurich and Crowther declined to comment to Nature on the content of the press reports.\n\nIn a statement to Nature, ETH Zurich said that last July its leadership decided to “have the allegations informally clarified by an external law firm”. It added: “ETH Zurich President, Joël Mesot has decided to no longer employ the scientist following expiration of the scientist’s tenure process. Following a careful evaluation, the ETH Zurich President reached the conclusion that there is no longer a basis of trust for a permanent employment contract.”\n\nCrowther is on administrative leave and his contract, which expires at the end of September, will not be renewed, according to the statement. “The initiated clarifications are still ongoing. Please understand, that we cannot comment further on this matter,” ETH Zurich said.\n\nCrowther told Nature that he is contemplating offers from two institutions, one in Europe and one in Asia, to relocate his lab. “I am still considering where might be the best place for the next phase of the group,” he says.",

          "abstract": "The production of fake research is now a thriving industry, thanks to paper mills. These networks sell paper authorships and poor-quality or fabricated scientific manuscripts to researchers, or violate the peer-review process by providing fake reviews. And they have become so prolific that current self-correction mechanisms no longer work.\n\nThe first evidence1 of authorships for sale was reported in 2013. The paper-mill industry has since mushroomed (see ‘Paper mills explode’). One estimate suggests that the problem might have started even earlier — at least 400,000 papers published between 2000 and 2022 show the hallmarks of having been produced by paper mills (see Nature 623, 466–467; 2023). Yet only 55,000 were retracted or corrected in the same period, according to the database of the website Retraction Watch. Fraudulent research pollutes the literature, slows down scientific progress, delays the discovery of therapies and reduces public trust in science.\n\nSource: Adam Day, unpublished estimates\n\nWe are integrity sleuths. Scientists by training, we now spend time sniffing out publications from paper mills. After initially working mostly alone, each specializing in a certain discipline or symptom of paper-mill activity, in the past three years, we’ve begun to join forces. Together, we are skilled at spotting the signs of a paper mill, from manipulated images to plagiarism, fake peer reviews and fake reviewers to unusual patterns of co-authors and paid-for citations.\n\nCollectively, we’ve discovered thousands of problematic papers. We shouldn’t need to do this work, which is mostly unpaid. But each of us was drawn to sleuthing by frustration and concern about dishonest scholars and the harm that industrialized fabrication of research can do.\n\nDespite our expertise, we have little power to tackle publications from paper mills. We depend on institutes to investigate suspicious actions by scientists, and on journal editors and publishers to correct or retract the articles that we flag. In our view, scientists, journals and publishers are woefully underprepared to do this work.\n\nSome initiatives have begun to take on the problem. United2Act, for instance, is a collaboration of stakeholders in academic publishing — such as researchers, sleuths, publishers and institutes — that’s attempting to raise awareness of paper mills, improve post-publication correction and facilitate research on paper mills. To stem the tide of fraudulent research, the scientific community must build on this momentum by making concerted efforts to seek out and stamp out paper mills.\n\nA welcoming environment\n\nPaper mills flourish because of research systems that evaluate scientists using publication metrics, thereby inadvertently providing an incentive for misconduct. People with paper-mill publications might be promoted over those who have more modest — but honest — publication records. One study, for instance, reported that 95% of biomedical faculties use the number of peer-reviewed papers that a researcher has had published as a performance metric2. And 40% of research-intensive institutions in the United States and Canada consider the impact factor of the journals in which an individual has had work published when making decisions about their promotion and tenure3. Institutions seldom seem to punish researchers for using paper mills, perhaps owing to a lack of awareness, or concern about reputational or legal risks.\n\nIf a paper-mill client becomes an influential researcher, they might then facilitate the production of more paper-mill publications, through academic editing roles. One of us (N.W.) was involved in an investigation that found that mills seemed to be offering money to editors in exchange for accepting publications in their journals4. Guest issues, organized by academics with little oversight from a journal’s editors, can be particularly problematic. Academics working for paper mills can propose themselves as guest editors, manipulate the peer-review process and accept articles from the mill.\n\nHow to improve assessments of publication integrity\n\nPublishers are often slow to act on reports of paper-mill content. One of us (E.B.) reported5 800 papers with apparent image duplication in 2014 and 2015 — of which only half had been corrected or retracted by March 2024. There are various reasons for this. For one, retractions can damage a journal’s brand. Publishers are often concerned about the level of evidence required to justify retraction, and could be at risk of legal action by disgruntled authors. In addition, they might lack the staff to quickly tackle the problem, or staff might lack the expertise to detect specific ‘red flags’ or problematic issues with individual paper mills.\n\nEach of us, along with other sleuths, identifies paper-mill products regularly — enough papers to overwhelm publishers with cases, making swift retractions or corrections nearly impossible. Scientists urgently need to make running and using paper mills less attractive. The following five steps would help.\n\nResearch to understand mills\n\nWith research into paper mills scant and fragmented, little is known about their business models and publication techniques6. It’s hard even to identify them, because they depend on staying one step ahead of publishers and sleuths, and are constantly developing fresh ways to hide their activity. Mills operating in different regions or specializing in different subjects use differing approaches to solicit business and avoid detection.\n\nEven for papers from the same mill, this can be true. Last year one of us (A.A.) received a message on social media from the owner of a paper mill that the sleuth had investigated. Her analytics undoubtedly deserved respect, the message read, but had many shortcomings, because the 1,000 papers she’d identified as coming from the mill were just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAnswers to some key questions would help to focus preventive efforts6. These include: where are paper mills located? What fields are they targeting? And how are they using artificial intelligence (AI)?\n\nMultimillion-dollar trade in paper authorships alarms publishers\n\nPaper mills have been found in a wide range of countries, including: China, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, India, Iran, Iraq, Latvia and Peru7. But there are large parts of the world in which paper mills are expected to operate but where few have been identified, notably in much of Latin America, where many journals are targeted. To make a start, local researchers and sleuths might scour social-media posts and the wider Internet to look for paper-mill offers.\n\nCertain research fields seem to be particularly susceptible, namely those in which the number of possible experiments far exceeds the available scientific resource. Fields we know of include non-coding RNAs in human cancer and crystallography — vast numbers of different RNA combinations and crystal structures can potentially be investigated. In chemistry, 44% of papers that are retracted owing to fraud are published in crystallography8. There are sure to be other fields.\n\nPaper mills are already exploiting large language models (LLMs) to avoid plagiarism detectors and AI image generators to mass-produce papers. One preprint9 suggests that at least 10% of all PubMed abstracts published in 2024 were written with LLMs — although it is challenging to differentiate between papers from mills and those by legitimate authors who want to improve their writing. We predict further exploitation of AI-generated images to produce figures in future paper-mill products. These are likely to be difficult to detect. Journals can help by promoting open science and demanding the raw data for studies — the more information is available about papers, the easier it is to spot new tricks by paper mills.\n\nEducate stakeholders\n\nWe’re often asked to speak at universities and conferences, and consistently come across academics and PhD students who have never heard of paper mills. By preparing people to recognize and call out fake research, the scientific community can build up immunity against paper mills.\n\nPay researchers to spot errors in published papers\n\nEveryone involved in disseminating and digesting research — editors, publishers, students, authors, funding organizations, institutions, bibliographic databases and governments — needs to understand what paper mills are and know how to spot the telltale signs of fake papers. Anyone can learn to look out for image falsification or duplication in papers in their field, as well as for nonsensical text or equations, problematic references and reagents, irrelevant citations and implausible co-authorships. Free tools such as the Problematic Paper Screener10 developed by one of us (G.C.) can help researchers to spot papers that might be fraudulent.\n\nThe first step is to check whether a published paper has been flagged in a database that lists retractions and corrections, such as the Retraction Watch database, or on PubPeer — an online platform for post-publication peer review, on which errors and questionable content might be flagged. There might be innocuous reasons for retractions or PubPeer comments, but by checking these databases, researchers can identify suspicious activity. There are browser extensions and reference managers (for example, Zotero) that have integrated these databases to indicate problematic references.\n\nUniversities should invest in education on paper mills as a standard part of PhD courses and training for staff, and should put in place clear policies that detail how to report a suspected paper-mill article. They should support researchers who report suspicious papers. Journal editors and research-integrity experts should receive regularly updated training organized by publishers or sleuths, and publishers should share experiences of new types of fraud with one another.\n\nEnsure best practice in publishing\n\nThe best time to detect fraudulent research is before it is published. Publishers should work together to identify papers submitted simultaneously to multiple journals — a common tactic from paper mills to increase the probability of publication. The STM Integrity Hub, set up in 2023, offers a platform to check articles for research-integrity issues, and is currently used by more than 25 publishers and societies. Currently, its duplicate-submission-checker tool screens around 60,000 papers per month, identifying around 1.5% of submissions as duplicates.\n\nEditors should look out for violations of the peer-review process. These might include authors suggesting peer reviewers with fake identities or affiliations. Anomalies in e-mails, such as a domain that doesn’t correspond with the university or affiliation country of a scholar, can be a telltale sign of a fake peer reviewer or author — either someone impersonating a real scholar or a completely fake identity. Publishers can verify peer reviewers by checking for indicators of honesty known as trust markers, which include an institutional e-mail address and a publication record in which no papers are flagged on PubPeer or elsewhere. Groups of collaborators from disciplines that rarely interact, publishing far outside their own fields, might also indicate that a paper warrants thorough scrutiny.\n\nChain retraction: how to stop bad science propagating through the literature\n\nA rigorous industry-wide system for author disambiguation would also help to detect authors or editors who are repeatedly associated with paper-mill activity. Often it’s hard to be sure whether a single dubious paper is from a paper mill, but when many such articles can be linked to a single author or editor, then the probability of paper-mill involvement is greater. Verified scholar identification such as that provided through ORCID is not enough11 — it must be built into a system that also includes trust markers.",

          "abstract": "Social-media platform Bluesky has more than 27 million users.Credit: Peter Kováč/Alamy\n\nSeventy per cent of Nature readers who responded to an online poll are using the social-media platform Bluesky, which works a lot like X (formerly Twitter) and whose popularity has soared in recent months, in particular since the November US election.\n\nAlthough the survey is not statistically representative of Nature readers or the scientific community at large, it echoes recent enthusiasm for Bluesky among researchers and disillusionment with X. Of roughly 5,300 readers who responded to a question about X, 53% said they used to be on X but have now left (see ‘Mass exodus’).\n\nSource: Nature poll\n\n“Bluesky is much better for science. There is much less toxicity, misinformation, and distractions,” wrote one respondent. “My feed is almost entirely scientists and I actually get updates on research that is relevant and timely,” wrote another.\n\nBluesky now has more than 27 million users and is broadly similar in functionality and user experience to X, which for a long time was a go-to platform for scientists to discuss and disseminate their work. X fell out of favour with some after entrepreneur Elon Musk purchased the tool in October 2022.\n\nIn Nature’s survey, 55% of respondents to the question ‘What do you use Bluesky for?’ said it was a mix of three research-related activities: to connect with other scientists, keep up to date with other research or researchers, and promote their own research (see ‘Online connections’).\n\nSource: Nature poll\n\nIn total, almost 6,000 readers responded to Nature’s poll, which ran from 14 to 17 January 2025. We solicited responses on the Nature website, on social media and in the Nature Briefing, an e-mail newsletter. Of the almost 5,000 respondents who answered a question about their work, 85% — or 3,970 — said that they were working scientists. A similar number responded to a question about their field of study: 38% said they worked in biological sciences, 11% in computing or information sciences, 9% in physical sciences and 9% in environmental sciences. Answers came from scientists in 84 countries or regions, with the most coming from the United States (33%), followed by the United Kingdom (15%) and Germany (12%).\n\nPositive vibes\n\nThousands of survey respondents wrote expressively about how they think Bluesky stacks up against X. “Bluesky compares beautifully so far. More civil and informed conversations,” wrote one. Other positive terms that respondents used to contrast the platform with X included more pleasant, more supportive, friendlier, kinder, nicer, more collegial, uplifting, more peaceful and safer.\n\nA sense of safety is particularly valuable to researchers who teach or lead teams. “I feel that I can recommend it to students and trainees. I can’t do that for X, it is not a safe learning space,” wrote one respondent.\n\nSome wrote that Bluesky is a better forum than X for discussing science, because debate there is more measured and more focused, with less hostility. “I find it much less antagonistic to science,” said one respondent.\n\nBut with less heated debate and fewer users than X, some find Bluesky boring. That could change if it continues to attract new users at pace (see ‘Bluesky growth’). “Was pretty sleepy until November 2024. Now there seems to be enough critical mass of researchers in my field to find new research and connect again,” wrote one respondent.\n\nSource: L. Balduf et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.11605 (2025)\nFewer fascists?\n\nOther marks in Bluesky’s favour noted by survey respondents include the perception that there are fewer “Nazis” on the platform than on X, and less racism; that it is not owned or deemed to be influenced by Musk; and that it does not host advertisements.\n\nX could not be reached for comment on these criticisms before this article was published.\n\nNot all Nature readers love Bluesky. One criticism that emerged in the survey responses contends that it is a leftwing echo chamber. “Bluesky is full of woke crazy people who will threaten you with violence if you disagree with the liberal narrative,” said one respondent.",

Researchers used genetic tools to reveal that certain neurons in the brain control food choice and can sense both taste and texture1 .\n\nThe conventional view of taste sensing holds that specific neurons carry single signals to the brain, says study co-author Simon Sprecher, a neurobiologist at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. For instance, sweet taste neurons carry sweet signals and bitter taste neurons carry bitter signals.\n\nBut those assumptions have been challenged over the past two decades by studies in fruit flies and mice that suggest neurons might have the capacity to respond to both chemical signals, such as bitter or sweet, as well as mechanical signals, such as texture.\n\nJust right\n\nIn the current study, published in PLoS Biology on 30 January, Sprecher and his colleagues set out to see whether individual neurons in taste organs have this ‘multimodal’ capacity. They fed fruit-fly larvae — maggots — different preparations of agarose, a sugary gel. The maggots showed a propensity for a ‘Goldilocks’ preparation, one that was neither too hard nor too soft. The preferred hardness for larvae is “similar to [that] of decaying fruit”, says Sprecher.",

          "abstract": "Itchy-scratchy: experiments show that there are benefits to scratching ― although it can also aggravate skin disease. Credit: Getty\n\nScratching a mosquito bite can offer a moment of bliss, and now scientists have learnt why: scratching activates an immune response that helps to protect the skin against harmful infections, at least in mice.\n\nThe findings could also explain why humans find a good scratch satisfying. The study1 was published today in Science.\n\n“The exciting thing about this study is that there's now a molecular basis” for how scratching causes inflammation, says immunologist Aaron Ver Heul at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, in Missouri, who was not involved in the study. The work, he added, is “rigorous” and “really well done”.\n\nWhy we scratch\n\nAlmost all animals scratch, even though scratching too much can damage the skin. The classic explanation for scratching is that it removes parasites and irritants. “But we’ve always thought there might be other reasons,” says Ver Heul. After all, some parasites, such as mosquitoes, are long gone by the time itching starts.\n\nTo get to the root of scratching, skin immunologist Dan Kaplan at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and his colleagues painted a synthetic allergen on the ears of mice. This induced a form of skin inflammation called allergic contact dermatitis, which is caused by contact with an allergen such as the oil in poison ivy. When control mice scratched, their ears swelled up and became full of neutrophils, a type of immune cell.\n\nBut mice that wore tiny Elizabethan collars — the rodent version of the ‘cone of shame’ that dogs wear — couldn’t scratch their irritated ears. These animals’ ears sported less swelling and fewer neutrophils than the ears of control mice. Bioengineered mice that were lacking an itch-sensing neuron showed a similarly muted reaction. This experiment showed that scratching itself worsens inflammation.\n\nFrom itch to scratch\n\nTo learn more about what happens after scratching, the scientists studied ordinary mice that were allowed to scratch their itchy ears. They noticed that at scratched sites, pain-sensing neurons released a potent nervous-system messenger called substance P.\n\nThe substance P turned on the activity of key white blood cells called mast cells, which are central to triggering allergy symptoms. The mast cells recruited neutrophils to the scratched site, driving inflammation.\n\nIt was previously known that mast cells can be turned on directly by allergens. The authors’ work revealed that mast cells can also be turned on indirectly, by scratching and the sequence of steps it causes.\n\nResearch round-up: Allergies\n\nInflammation by neutrophils was greatly increased if the mice scratched and activated both pathways. Scratching was a key component in the development of inflammation. “That was a bit of a surprise,” says Kaplan.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Chinese firm DeepSeek debuted a version of its large language model last year.Credit: Koshiro K/Alamy\n\nA Chinese-built large language model called DeepSeek-R1 is thrilling scientists as an affordable and open rival to ‘reasoning’ models such as OpenAI’s o1.\n\nThese models generate responses step-by-step, in a process analogous to human reasoning. This makes them more adept than earlier language models at solving scientific problems, and means they could be useful in research. Initial tests of R1, released on 20 January, show that its performance on certain tasks in chemistry, mathematics and coding is on a par with that of o1 — which wowed researchers when it was released by OpenAI in September.\n\n“This is wild and totally unexpected,” Elvis Saravia, an artificial intelligence (AI) researcher and co-founder of the UK-based AI consulting firm DAIR.AI, wrote on X.\n\nR1 stands out for another reason. DeepSeek, the start-up in Hangzhou that built the model, has released it as ‘open-weight’, meaning that researchers can study and build on the algorithm. Published under an MIT licence, the model can be freely reused but is not considered fully open source, because its training data have not been made available.\n\n“The openness of DeepSeek is quite remarkable,” says Mario Krenn, leader of the Artificial Scientist Lab at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen, Germany. By comparison, o1 and other models built by OpenAI in San Francisco, California,including its latest effort, o3, are “essentially black boxes”, he says.\nAI hallucinations can’t be stopped — but these techniques can limit their damage\n\nDeepSeek hasn’t released the full cost of training R1, but it is charging people using its interface around one-thirtieth of what o1 costs to run. The firm has also created mini ‘distilled’ versions of R1 to allow researchers with limited computing power to play with the model. An “experiment that cost more than £300 [US$370] with o1, cost less than $10 with R1,” says Krenn. “This is a dramatic difference which will certainly play a role in its future adoption.”\n\nChallenge models\n\nR1 is part of a boom in Chinese large language models (LLMs). Spun off a hedge fund, DeepSeek emerged from relative obscurity last month when it released a chatbot called V3, which outperformed major rivals, despite being built on a shoestring budget. Experts estimate that it cost around $6 million to rent the hardware needed to train the model, compared with upwards of $60 million for Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B, which used 11 times the computing resources.\n\nPart of the buzz around DeepSeek is that it has succeeded in making R1 despite US export controls that limit Chinese firms’ access to the best computer chips designed for AI processing. “The fact that it comes out of China shows that being efficient with your resources matters more than compute scale alone,” says François Chollet, an AI researcher in Seattle, Washington.\n\nDeepSeek’s progress suggests that “the perceived lead [that the] US once had has narrowed significantly”, Alvin Wang Graylin, a technology specialist in Bellevue, Washington, who works at the Taiwan-based immersive technology firm HTC, wrote on X. “The two countries need to pursue a collaborative approach to building advanced AI vs continuing on the current no-win arms-race approach.”\n\nChain of thought\n\nLLMs train on billions of samples of text, snipping them into word-parts, called tokens, and learning patterns in the data. These associations allow the model to predict subsequent tokens in a sentence. But LLMs are prone to inventing facts, a phenomenon called hallucination, and often struggle to reason through problems.",

We help characterize the nature of the construct by adopting a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analytic approach to summarize the temporal stability of 358 risk preference measures (33 panels, 57 samples, 579,114 respondents). Our findings reveal noteworthy heterogeneity across and within measure categories (propensity, frequency and behaviour), domains (for example, investment, occupational and alcohol consumption) and sample characteristics (for example, age). Specifically, while self-reported propensity and frequency measures of risk preference show a higher degree of stability than behavioural measures, these patterns are moderated by domain and age. Crucially, an analysis of convergent validity reveals a low agreement across measures, questioning the idea that they capture the same underlying phenomena. Our results raise concerns about the coherence and measurement of the risk preference construct.",

Our polygenic index captures 1–5% of income variance, with only one fourth due to direct genetic effects. A phenome-wide association study using this index showed reduced risks for diseases including hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, depression, asthma and back pain. The Income Factor had a substantial genetic correlation (0.92, s.e. = 0.006) with educational attainment. Accounting for the genetic overlap of educational attainment with income revealed that the remaining genetic signal was linked to better mental health but reduced physical health and increased risky behaviours such as drinking and smoking.

          "abstract": "The urgent calls for action on climate change underscore the importance of increasing sustainable behavior among individuals who have traditionally veered away from it, such as those on the political right. Utilizing data from four geopolitical regions across 24 countries, we explore whether vulnerability to natural disasters, brought on by either experiencing or anticipating a natural disaster, is a crucial factor. We find that as vulnerability to natural disasters increases, sustainable consumption intentions significantly increase among rightists in Western Europe, Israel, and the United States. Environmental motives, rather than economic or trend motives, are found to drive this effect. This suggests that, for rightists, the expectation of being directly impacted by climate change can override their established attitudes and foster more sustainable behavior with the goal of helping the environment. In contrast, the same increase in sustainable consumption intentions is weaker among leftists, who already embrace sustainable behavior. Interestingly, in Central and Eastern Europe, this interplay between political ideology and vulnerability to natural disasters is absent, highlighting the unique postcommunist context of this region. These findings underscore the necessity of tailored strategies for promoting sustainable behavior across regional contexts and provide vital insight into how sustainable consumption may increase among groups that have traditionally resisted it. In a quasiexperiment, we test the potential of an intervention using messages that highlight recent natural disasters in one’s locality and demonstrate its effectiveness in pushing rightists toward sustainable consumption.",

We examined the association of a partner’s age with romantic desire ( N = 9,084 dyadic reports) among N = 6,262 blind daters who used a matchmaking service in hopes of finding a long-term partner. Preregistered tests revealed that people were (slightly) attracted to younger partners on average—and this association did not differ by gender. Conclusions were identical if we examined a) age difference from one’s own age, and b) a dataset limited to women 40-and-under and mixed-gender dates. Furthermore, participant’s self-reported “upper-age limits” played no meaningful role: Participants had a modest preference for youth overall, but it did not matter whether the partner’s age fell below or above this personal maximum.

Associated harms are primarily framed as women’s issues due to more severe consequences women face. Yet, gendered arrangements also shape men ’s relationships, career paths, and health. Current work on gender equity overlooks men’s perspectives. Despite benefits they gain from out-ranking women, men’s position paradoxically entraps them in restrictive roles, compelling them to prioritize dominance. An inclusive framework challenges prevailing narratives by considering personal costs borne by men. Identifying with a man’s traditional role is a mixed privilege, as five gendered arrangements show for men who subscribe to them: 1. Masculine norms can restrict men’s choices and are associated with adverse health trajectories; 2. Some men’s disengagement from communal roles denies them positive outcomes associated with caring for others; 3. Hostile sexism fosters antipathy, fueling tension in some men’s interactions with women; 4. Benevolent sexism forces some men into scripted interactions, preventing genuine connections and burdening them with unrealistic breadwinner and protector roles; 5. Societal shifts in gender hierarchies can elicit threat responses in men, depending on intersections with social class and racial identities. Understanding costs to men calls for more empirical research. Gender equity for men, whose circumstances differ from those of women, would enable men to make informed choices and achieve better outcomes for themselves—paralleling the progress women have made in many areas of life. Striving for equity for all genders can ultimately enhance overall human well-being.",

We discuss possible alternative models for dealing with these issues. These alternatives include incremental changes such as placing more weight on the proposals or on the investigators and representative composition of panel members, along with deeper reforms such as distributed or concentrated funding and partial lotteries in response to low inter-reviewer reliability. We also consider radical alternatives to current funding schemes: the removal of political governance and the introduction of international competitive applications to a World Research Council alongside national funding sources.

          "abstract": "The ε4 variant of human apolipoprotein E ( APOE4 ) is a key genetic risk factor for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and elevated all-cause mortality in humans. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that can mitigate the harmful effects of APOE4 has significant implications. In this study, we find that inactivating the VHL-1 (Von Hippel–Lindau) protein can suppress mortality, neural and behavioral pathologies caused by transgenic human APOE4 in Caenorhabditis elegans . The protective effects of VHL-1 deletion are recapitulated by stabilized HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor), a transcription factor degraded by VHL-1. HIF-1 activates a genetic program that safeguards against mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, proteostasis imbalance, and endolysosomal rupture—critical cellular events linked to neural pathologies and mortality. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Vhl reduces cerebral vascular injury and synaptic lesions in APOE4 mice, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Thus, we identify the VHL–HIF axis as a potent modulator of APOE4 -induced neural pathologies and propose that targeting this pathway in nonproliferative tissues may curb cellular damage, protect against neurodegeneration, and reduce tissue injuries and mortality.",

          "abstract": "Life is invasive, occupying all physically accessible scales, stretching between almost nothing (protons, electrons, and photons) and almost everything (the whole biosphere). Motivated by seventeenth-century insights into this infinity, this paper proposes a language to discuss life as an infinite double cascade of machines making machines. Using this simplified language, we first discuss the micro-cascade proposed by Leibniz, which describes how the self-reproducing machine of the cell is built of smaller submachines down to the atomic scale. In the other direction, we propose that a macro-cascade builds from cells larger, organizational machines, up to the scale of the biosphere. The two cascades meet at the critical point of 10 3 s in time and 1 micron in length, the scales of a microbial cell. We speculate on how this double cascade evolved once a self-replicating machine emerged in the salty water of prebiotic earth.",

          "abstract": "Heterocytes, specialized cells for nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria, are surrounded by heterocyte glycolipids (HGs), which contribute to protection of the nitrogenase enzyme from oxygen. Diverse HGs preserve in the sediment and have been widely used as evidence of past nitrogen fixation, and structural variation has been suggested to preserve taxonomic information and reflect paleoenvironmental conditions. Here, by comprehensive HG identification and screening of HG biosynthetic gene clusters throughout cyanobacteria, we reconstruct the convergent evolutionary history of HG structure, in which different clades produce the same HGs. We find that rudimentary HG biosynthetic machinery was already present in cyanobacteria before the emergence of heterocytes for functions unrelated to nitrogen fixation and identify HG analogs produced by specific and distantly related nonheterocytous cyanobacteria. These structurally less complex molecules represent precursors of HGs, suggesting that HGs arose after a genomic reorganization and expansion of ancestral biosynthetic machinery, enabling the rise of cyanobacterial heterocytes in an increasingly oxygenated atmosphere. Our results open a chapter in the potential use of diagenetic products of HGs and HG analogs as fossils for reconstructing the evolution of multicellularity and division of labor in cyanobacteria.",

          "abstract": "Wildlife populations are not static. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect individuals, which lead to spatiotemporal variation in population density and range. Yet, dynamics in density and their drivers are rarely documented, due in part to the inherent difficulty of studying long-term population-level phenomena at ecologically meaningful scales. We studied the spatiotemporal density dynamics in a recolonizing large carnivore population, the wolverine Gulo gulo , across the Scandinavian Peninsula over nine years. We fitted open-population spatial capture-recapture models to noninvasive genetic sampling data collected across Norway and Sweden to estimate annual density surfaces and their drivers. This approach allowed us to model sex-specific changes in wolverine density and the effect of landscape-level environmental determinants over time. Our results revealed that, as wolverines successfully recolonized many parts of their historical range in Scandinavia, the relationship with spatial determinants of density has changed over time. We also found support for sex-specific responses of the Scandinavian wolverine to the environmental determinants of density and differences in the temporal dynamics of their relationships, indicating disproportionate recolonization ability and anthropogenic pressures. We observed significant changes in the relationship of female wolverine density with several determinants during the study period, suggesting still ongoing expansion of female wolverines whereas males might have already reached the range limits. These findings show that the Scandinavian wolverine population is still recovering from centuries of persecution and severe range contraction. Our study sheds light on the dynamics and challenges of recolonizing large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes across time and space.",

          "abstract": "The rise and spread of ancient Indian Ocean Rim (IOR) trade networks profoundly impacted southern Africa. Control over this trade played a critical role in the rise and maintenance of complex societies of the second millennium CE such as Mapungubwe and Great Zimbabwe. While the African origins of this trade lie in the first millennium CE, understanding its earliest phases and subsequent development in the far south has been hampered by a general paucity of research. The recovery of Persian Gulf ceramic sherds and Asian glass beads from the Letaba region of northeastern South Africa demonstrates that communities up to 400 km inland were already part of IOR trade by the 10th century. Although glass beads have been found at several late first millennium CE sites throughout the region, glazed wares are much rarer by comparison. In southern Africa, archaeological sites with Persian Gulf ceramics largely date to between the 9th and 10th centuries with a distribution limited to the Limpopo River’s main tributaries. This distribution poses new questions about early IOR trade routes into the southern African interior and suggests Xai-Xai in southern Mozambique as a possible entry point for early IOR trade.",

In this paper, we reexamine the parsimony principle in light of these scientific and technological advancements. We review recent developments, including the surprising benefits of modeling with more parameters than data, the increasing appreciation of the context-sensitivity of data and misspecification of scientific models, and the development of new modeling tools. By integrating these insights, we reassess the utility of parsimony as a proxy for desirable model traits, such as predictive accuracy, interpretability, effectiveness in guiding new research, and resource efficiency. We conclude that more complex models are sometimes essential for scientific progress, and discuss the ways in which parsimony and complexity can play complementary roles in scientific modeling practice.",

          "authors": "Shuting Yan, Tamar Schlick",
          "abstract": "Frameshifting is an essential mechanism employed by many viruses including coronaviruses to produce viral proteins from a compact RNA genome. It is facilitated by specific RNA folds in the frameshift element (FSE), which has emerged as an important therapeutic target. For SARS-CoV-2, a specific 3-stem pseudoknot has been identified to stimulate frameshifting. However, prior studies and our RNA-As-Graphs analysis coupled to chemical reactivity experiments revealed other folds, including a different pseudoknot. Although structural plasticity has been proposed to play a key role in frameshifting, paths between different FSE RNA folds have not been yet identified. Here, we capture atomic-level transition pathways between two key FSE pseudoknots by transition path sampling coupled to Markov State Modeling and our BOLAS free energy method. We reveal multiple transition paths within a heterogeneous, multihub conformational landscape. A shared folding mechanism involves RNA stem unpairing followed by a 5 ′ -chain end release. Significantly, this pseudoknot transition critically tunes the tension through the RNA spacer region and places the viral RNA in the narrow ribosomal channel. Our work further explains the role of the alternative pseudoknot in ribosomal pausing and clarifies why the experimentally captured pseudoknot is preferred for frameshifting. Our capturing of this large-scale transition of RNA secondary and tertiary structure highlights the complex pathways of biomolecules and the inherent multifarious aspects that viruses developed to ensure virulence and survival. This enhanced understanding of viral frameshifting also provides insights to target key transitions for therapeutic applications. Our methods are generally applicable to other large-scale biomolecular transitions.",

          "abstract": "The sense of hearing originates in the cochlea, which detects sounds across dynamic sensory environments. Like other peripheral organs, the cochlea is subjected to environmental insults, including loud, damage-inducing sounds. In response to internal and external stimuli, the central nervous system directly modulates cochlear function through olivocochlear neurons (OCNs), which are located in the brainstem and innervate the cochlear sensory epithelium. One population of OCNs, the lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons, target spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), the primary sensory neurons of the ear. LOCs alter their transmitter expression for days to weeks in response to noise exposure (NE), suggesting that they could tune SGN excitability over long time periods in response to auditory experience. To examine how LOCs affect auditory function after NE, we characterized OCN transcriptional profiles and found transient LOC-specific gene expression changes after NE, including upregulation of multiple neuropeptide-encoding genes. Next, by generating intersectional mouse lines that selectively target LOCs, we chemogenetically ablated LOCs and assayed auditory responses at baseline and after NE. Compared to controls, mice with reduced LOC innervation showed greater NE-induced functional deficits 1 d later and had worse auditory function after a 2-wk recovery period. The number of remaining presynaptic puncta at the SGN synapse with inner hair cells did not differ between control and LOC-ablated animals, suggesting that the primary role of LOCs after NE is likely not to protect but instead to compensate, ensuring that SGN function is enhanced during periods of need.",

These Aβ aggregates are increasingly successfully targeted with clinical therapies at later stages of the disease, but the fundamental molecular steps in early stage disease that trigger the initial nucleation event leading to the conversion of monomeric Aβ peptide into pathological aggregates remain unknown. Here, we show that the Aβ peptide can form biomolecular condensates on lipid bilayers both in molecular assays and in living cells. Our results reveal that these Aβ condensates can significantly accelerate the primary nucleation step in the amyloid conversion cascade that leads to the formation of amyloid aggregates. We show that Aβ condensates contain phospholipids, are intrinsically heterogeneous, and are prone to undergo a liquid-to-solid transition leading to the formation of amyloid fibrils. These findings uncover the liquid–liquid phase separation behavior of the Aβ peptide and reveal a molecular step very early in the amyloid-β aggregation process.",

          "abstract": "SOX9 is a crucial transcriptional regulator of cartilage development and homeostasis. Dysregulation of SOX9 is associated with a wide spectrum of skeletal disorders, including campomelic dysplasia, acampomelic campomelic dysplasia, and scoliosis. Yet how SOX9 variants contribute to the spectrum of axial skeletal disorders is not well understood. Here, we report four pathogenic variants of SOX9 identified in a cohort of patients with congenital vertebral malformations. We report a pathogenic missense variant in the transactivation middle (TAM) domain of SOX9 associated with mild skeletal dysplasia and scoliosis. We isolated a Sox9 mutant mouse with an in-frame microdeletion in the TAM domain ( Sox9 Asp272del ), which exhibits skeletal dysplasia including kinked tails, rib cage anomalies, and scoliosis in homozygous mutants. We find that both the human missense and the mouse microdeletion mutations resulted in reduced SOX9 protein stability in cell culture, while Sox9 Asp272del mutant mice show decreased SOX9 expression in the growth plate and annulus fibrosus tissues of the spine. This reduction in SOX9 expression was correlated with the reduction of extracellular matrix components, such as tenascin-X and the Adhesion G-protein coupled receptor ADGRG6. In summary, our work identified and modeled a pathologic variant of SOX9 within the TAM domain and demonstrated its importance for SOX9 protein stability. Our work demonstrates that SOX9 stability is important for the regulation of ADGRG6 expression, which is a known regulator of postnatal spine homeostasis, underscoring the essential role of SOX9 dosage in a spectrum of axial skeleton dysplasia in humans.",

          "abstract": "Bubbles present in saline water typically exhibit a prolonged lifetime, making them attractive for various engineering processes. Herein, we unveil a transition from delayed bubble coalescence to rapid bursting within about one millisecond in salty solutions. The key aspect in understanding this transition lies in the combined influences of surface deformation and ion surface excess instead of characterizing the ions alone. Only with a sufficiently deformed region trapped between the colliding bubble and fluid surfaces can the coalescence inhibition effect be maintained to cause the bouncing behavior. Thus, we quantify a consistent upper limit of ion transfer content required for instant coalescence under different salty conditions. Furthermore, we present numerical ranges associated with different bubble behaviors in terms of E o , R e , and W e and determine the critical values to predict bubble dynamics. Our findings shed light on the bubble coalescence principle in saline water and allow access to the regulation of coalescence time based on the requirement of technological applications.",

          "abstract": "The cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria is composed of a phospholipid bilayer made up of a diverse set of lipids. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is one of the principal constituents and its production is essential for growth in many bacteria. All the enzymes required for PG biogenesis in Escherichia coli have been identified and characterized decades ago. However, it has remained poorly understood how gram-positive bacteria perform the terminal step in the pathway that produces this essential lipid. In E. coli, this reaction is mediated by three functionally redundant phosphatases that convert phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) into PG. Here, we show that homologs of these enzymes in Bacillus subtilis are not required for PG synthesis. Instead, we identified a previously uncharacterized B. subtilis protein, YqeG (renamed PgpP), as an essential enzyme required for the conversion of PGP into PG. Expression of B. subtilis or Staphylococcus aureus PgpP in E. coli lacking all three Pgp enzymes supported the growth of the strain. Furthermore, depletion of PgpP in B. subtilis led to growth arrest, reduced membrane lipid staining, and accumulation of PGP. PgpP is broadly conserved among Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria. Homologs are also present in yeast mitochondria and plant chloroplasts, suggesting that this widely distributed enzyme has an ancient origin. Finally, evidence suggests that PgpP homologs are essential in many gram-positive pathogens and thus the enzyme represents an attractive target for antibiotic development.",

We address this challenge by atomistically modeling, for a total of ≈80 μs, a slice of the human cell cytoplasm that includes three successive enzymes along the glycolytic pathway: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). We tested the model for nonspecific protein stickiness, an artifact of current atomistic force fields in crowded environments. The simulations reveal that the human enzymes co-organize in-cell into transient submetabolon complexes, consistent with previous experimental results. Our data both reiterate known specificity between GAPDH and PGK and reveal extensive direct interactions between GAPDH and PGM. Our simulations further reveal, through force field benchmarking, the critical role of protein solvation in facilitating these enzyme–enzyme interactions. Transient interenzyme interactions with μs lifetime occur repeatedly in our simulations via specific sticky protein surface patches, with interactions often mediated by charged patch residues. Some of the residues that interact frequently with one another lie in or near the active site of the enzymes. We show that some of these patches correspond to a general mode to interact with several partners for promiscuous enzymes like GAPDH. We further show that the non-native yeast PGK is stickier than human PGK in our human cytoplasm model, supporting the idea of evolutionary pressure to reduce sticking. Our cytoplasm modeling paves the way toward capturing the atomistic dynamics of an entire enzymatic pathway in-cell.",

The caseinolytic mitochondrial matrix peptidase chaperone subunit X (ClpX) recognizes and translocates protein substrates into the degradation chamber of the caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) for proteolysis. ClpXP degrades damaged respiratory chain proteins and is necessary for cancer cell survival. Despite the critical role of ClpXP in mitochondrial protein quality control, the specific degrons, or modifications that tag substrate proteins for degradation by human ClpXP, are still unknown. We demonstrated that phosphorylated serine (pSer) targets substrates to ClpX and facilitates their degradation by ClpXP in biochemical assays. In contrast, ClpP hyperactivated by the small-molecule drug ONC201 lost the preference for phosphorylated substrates. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry combined with biochemical assays showed that pSer binds the RKL loop of ClpX. ClpX variants with substitutions in the RKL loop failed to recognize phosphorylated substrates. In intact cells, ClpXP also preferentially degraded substrates with pSer. Moreover, ClpX substrates with the pSer were selectively found in aggregated mitochondrial proteins.

We quantified the motility of individual cells and entire colonies and demonstrated that Chfl MS-1 formed bundles of filaments that moved in all directions with no directional bias to light. Syn OS-B′ was slightly less motile but exhibited positive phototaxis. This binary consortium displayed cooperative behavior by moving further than either species alone and formed ordered arrays where both species aligned with the light source. No cooperative motility was observed when a nonmotile pilB mutant of Syn OS-B′ was used instead of Syn OS-B′. The binary consortium also produced more adherent biofilm than individual species, consistent with the close interspecies association revealed by electron microscopy. We propose that cyanobacteria and Chloroflexota cooperate in forming natural microbial mats by colonizing new niches and building robust biofilms.",

          "abstract": "The design of new alloys is a multiscale problem that requires a holistic approach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced computational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the results, a process that is typically slow and reserved for human experts. Machine learning can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural and chemical features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative AI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models (LLMs) and the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various domains, including knowledge retrieval, multimodal data integration, physics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities. The concerted effort of the multiagent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key characteristics across alloys and highlight the crucial role of solid solution alloying to steer the development of advanced metallic alloys. Our framework enhances the efficiency of complex multiobjective design tasks and opens avenues in fields such as biomedical materials engineering, renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.",

However, most existing dimensionality reduction methods primarily rely on 2D visualization, which can distort true data relationships and fail to extract reliable biological information.

DTNE constructs a manifold distance matrix using a modified personalized PageRank algorithm, thereby preserving topological structure while enabling diverse single-cell analyses. This approach facilitates distribution-based cellular relationship analysis, pseudotime inference, and clustering within a unified framework. Extensive benchmarking against mainstream algorithms on diverse datasets demonstrates DTNE’s superior performance in maintaining geodesic distances and revealing significant biological patterns.

Investigating the complex, multiscale-graded structures found in animal tissue provides valuable insights that can help address this challenge. The human meniscus root–bone interface is an exemplary model, renowned for its exceptional fatigue resistance, toughness, and interfacial adhesion properties throughout its lifespan. Here, we investigated the multiscale graded mineralization structure and their strengthening mechanisms within the 30-micron soft–hard interface at the root–bone junction. This graded interface, featuring interdigitated structures and an exponential increase in modulus, undergoes a phase transition from amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) to gradually matured hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystals, regulated by location-specific distributed biomolecules. In coordination with collagen fibril deformation and reorientation, the in situ tensile mechanical experiments and molecular dynamic simulations revealed that immature ACP particles debond from the collagenous matrix and translocate to dissipate energy, while the progressively matured HAP crystals with high stiffness pins propagating cracks, thereby enhancing both the toughness and fatigue resistance of the interface. To further validate our findings, we built biomimetic soft–hard interfaces with phase-transforming mineralization which exhibited boosted strength, toughness, and interface adhesion. This interface model is generalizable to other material joints and provides a blueprint for developing robust soft–hard composites across various applications.",

          "abstract": "Measuring and interpreting errors in behavioral tasks is critical for understanding cognition. Conventional wisdom assumes that encoding/decoding errors for continuous variables in behavioral tasks should naturally have Gaussian distributions, so that deviations from normality in the empirical data indicate the presence of more complex sources of noise. This line of reasoning has been central for prior research on working memory. Here, we reassess this assumption and find that even in ideal observer models with Gaussian encoding noise, the error distribution is generally non-Gaussian, contrary to the commonly held belief. Critically, we find that the shape of the error distribution is determined by the geometrical structure of the encoding manifold via a simple rule. In the case of a high-dimensional geometry, the error distributions naturally exhibit flat tails. Using this insight, we apply our theory to visual short-term memory tasks, and find that it can account for a large array of experimental data with only two free parameters. Our results challenge the dominant view in the mechanisms and capacity constraints of working memory systems. They instead suggest that the Bayesian framework, which explains various aspects of perceptual behavior, also provides an excellent account of working memory. Overall, our results establish a direct connection between neural manifold geometry and behavior, and call attention to the geometry of the representation as a critically important, yet underappreciated factor in determining the character of errors in human behavior.",

This complexity has been proposed as the source of the rich spatial organization and apparent anomalous diffusion of intracellular components, although this has not been tested directly. Here, we use biplane microscopy to track the 3D motion of self-assembled bacterial genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (bGEMs) with tunable size (20 to 50 nm) and charge (−3,240 to +2,700 e) in live Escherichia coli cells. To probe intermolecular details at spatial and temporal resolutions beyond experimental limits, we also developed a colloidal whole-cell model that explicitly represents the size and charge of cytoplasmic macromolecules and the porous structure of the bacterial nucleoid. Combining these techniques, we show that bGEMs spatially segregate by size, with small 20-nm particles enriched inside the nucleoid, and larger and/or positively charged particles excluded from this region. Localization is driven by entropic and electrostatic forces arising from cytoplasmic polydispersity, nucleoid structure, geometrical confinement, and interactions with other biomolecules including ribosomes and DNA. We observe that at the timescales of traditional single molecule tracking experiments, motion appears subdiffusive for all particle sizes and charges. However, using computer simulations with higher temporal resolution, we find that the apparent anomalous exponents are governed by the region of the cell in which bGEMs are located. Molecular motion does not display anomalous diffusion on short time scales and the apparent subdiffusion arises from geometrical confinement within the nucleoid and by the cell boundary.",

The ubiquitous human pathogen, Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), encodes a protein (UL12.5) that induces the release of mitochondrial nucleic acid into the cytosol, which activates immune-sensing pathways and reduces productive replication in nonneuronal cells. HSV-1 establishes latency in neurons and can reactivate to cause disease. We found that UL12.5 is required for HSV-1 reactivation in neurons and acts to directly promote viral lytic gene expression during initial exit from latency. Further, the direct activation of innate immune-sensing pathways triggered HSV-1 reactivation and compensated for a lack of UL12.5. Finally, we found that the induction of HSV-1 lytic genes during reactivation required intact RNA- and DNA-sensing pathways, demonstrating that HSV-1 can respond to and active antiviral nucleic acid–sensing pathways to reactivate from a latent infection.",

Mx proteins arose within the Dynamin superfamily of proteins (DSP), which mediate critical cellular processes, such as endocytosis and mitochondrial, plastid, and peroxisomal dynamics. Despite their crucial role, the evolutionary origins of Mx proteins are poorly understood. Through comprehensive phylogenomic analyses with progressively expanded taxonomic sampling, we demonstrate that Mx proteins predate the interferon signaling system in vertebrates. Our analyses find an ancient monophyletic DSP lineage in eukaryotes that groups vertebrate and invertebrate Mx proteins with fungal MxF proteins, the largely uncharacterized plant and algal Dynamin 4A/4C proteins, and representatives from several other eukaryotic lineages, suggesting that Mx-like proteins date back close to the origin of Eukarya. Our phylogenetic analyses also find host-encoded and nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses-encoded DSPs interspersed in four distinct DSP lineages, indicating recurrent viral theft of host DSPs. Our analyses thus reveal an ancient history of viral and antiviral functions encoded by the Dynamin superfamily in eukaryotes.",

This study shows that electric fields facilitate transportation and detection of hummingbirds in a guild of tropical phoretic mites. Hummingbird flower mites feed on nectar and pollen and complete their life cycle inside flowers. Mites colonize new flowers by hitching rides on hummingbird beaks. Flower mites emerge from hummingbird nostrils and disembark when the beak touches a flower. We tested whether flower mites are attracted to unmodulated electrostatic, or to modulated electric fields with amplitudes and frequencies in the range of those previously reported for hummingbirds. In a laboratory setup, mites were only attracted to modulated electric fields. In a choice experiment between positive or negative polarities, mites almost instantaneously chose positive charges, but only when the field was modulated. Mites display questing behavior, moving their front legs toward an electrostatic source. In experiments where we removed one or both front leg tarsi, we show that modulated fields are detected by sensory structures present in the front legs. We also show that flower mites use electrostatic attraction to bridge the gap to the beaks of hummingbirds, for a few milliseconds becoming one of the fastest terrestrial organisms. Our results confirm that hummingbird flower mites evolved an additional sensory modality — electroreception — to quickly detect hummingbirds and use electrostatics to facilitate transportation onto their hosts.",

          "abstract": "Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are associated with familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). LRRK2 phosphorylates Rab guanosine triphosphatase (GTPases) within the Switch II domain while PINK1 directly phosphorylates Parkin and ubiquitin (Ub) and indirectly induces phosphorylation of a subset of Rab GTPases. Herein we have crossed LRRK2 [R1441C] mutant knock-in mice with PINK1 knock-out (KO) mice and report that loss of PINK1 does not impact endogenous LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation nor do we see significant effect of mutant LRRK2 on PINK1-mediated Rab and Ub phosphorylation. In addition, we observe that a pool of the Rab-specific, protein phosphatase family member 1H phosphatase, is transcriptionally up-regulated and recruited to damaged mitochondria, independent of PINK1 or LRRK2 activity. Parallel signaling of LRRK2 and PINK1 pathways is supported by assessment of motor behavioral studies that show no evidence of genetic interaction in crossed mouse lines. Previously we showed loss of cilia in LRRK2 R1441C mice and herein we show that PINK1 KO mice exhibit a ciliogenesis defect in striatal cholinergic interneurons and astrocytes that interferes with Hedgehog induction of glial derived-neurotrophic factor transcription. This is not exacerbated in double-mutant LRRK2 and PINK1 mice. Overall, our analysis indicates that LRRK2 activation and/or loss of PINK1 function along parallel pathways to impair ciliogenesis, suggesting a convergent mechanism toward PD. Our data suggest that reversal of defects downstream of ciliogenesis offers a common therapeutic strategy for LRRK2 or PINK1 PD patients, whereas LRRK2 inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials are unlikely to benefit PINK1 PD patients.",

          "abstract": "Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine (mC) in DNA, contributing to the regulation of gene transcription. Diverse mutations of TET2 are frequently found in various blood cancers, yet the full scope of their functional consequences has been unexplored. Here, we report that a subset of TET2 mutations identified in leukemia patients alter the substrate specificity of TET2 from acting on mC to thymine. This neomorphic activity results from substitutions at key residues involved in the interactions with the mC base, including Asn1387 and His1904. Recombinant human TET2 proteins harboring the mutation of these residues can catalyze the oxidation of thymine to 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) and 5-formyluracil (fU). Exogenous expression of the mutant TET2 Asn1387Thr (N1387T) in HEK293T cells leads to hmU accumulation, with levels further increased in cells lacking the glycosylase SMUG1. Endogenous knock-in of N1300T, the murine equivalent of N1387T, in mouse embryonic stem cells induces hmU production, causing DNA lesions and transcriptional activation of DNA damage response genes. N1300T cells accumulate more additional mutations with extended culture and exhibit heightened sensitivity to ATR inhibition compared to Tet2 knockout cells. Our study reveals that certain patient-derived TET2 mutations can acquire unexpected gain-of-function activities beyond impairing mC oxidation, offering a fresh perspective on the diverse molecular etiology of mutant TET2-related leukemogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Bacterial receptors feed into multiple signal transduction pathways that regulate a variety of cellular processes including gene expression, second messenger levels, and motility. Receptors are typically activated by signal binding to ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Cache domains are omnipresent LBDs found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, including humans. They form the predominant family of extracytosolic bacterial LBDs and were identified in all major receptor types. Cache domains are composed of either a single (sCache) or a double (dCache) structural module. The functional relevance of bimodular LBDs remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the PacF chemoreceptor in the phytopathogen Pectobacterium atrosepticum that recognizes formate at the membrane-distal module of its dCache domain, triggering chemoattraction. We further demonstrate that a family of formate-specific sCache domains has evolved from a dCache domain, exemplified by PacF, by losing the membrane-proximal module. By solving high-resolution structures of two family members in complex with formate, we show that the molecular basis for formate binding at sCache and dCache domains is highly similar, despite their low sequence identity. The apparent loss of the membrane-proximal module may be related to the observation that dCache domains bind ligands typically at the membrane-distal module, whereas studies have failed to find ligands bound in the membrane-proximal module. This work advances our understanding of signal sensing in bacterial receptors and suggests that evolution by reducing complexity may be a route for shaping diversity.",

Here, we investigate the elasticity of CaPv using ab initio machine-learning force fields (MLFF). At room temperature, the elasticity of tetragonal CaPv determined by MLFF molecular dynamics (MD) agrees well with experimental measurements after considering temperature induced variations in the hydrostatic structure, proving the effectiveness of the method. We use the MLFF MD in the NPT ensemble to establish the tetragonal–cubic phase boundary and confirm that in the lower mantle CaPv is in the cubic phase. The elasticity of cubic CaPv shows distinct temperature dependence at different ranges: it is linear at high temperatures, whereas it exhibits anomalous precursor softening near the tetragonal–cubic phase boundary. The temperature interval of precursor softening widens as the pressure increases and overlaps with the temperature profile of subducted cold slabs near the core–mantle boundary. While cubic CaPv is seismically invisible along the average mantle geotherm, it may induce low-velocity zones with negative temperature anomaly, leading to the view that the large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) may be caused by subducted oceanic crust rich in CaPv with temperature lower than ambient mantle. A cool, rigid LLSVP may help explain the preferential formation of mantle plumes at its margins, as well as its weaker seismic anisotropy.",

High-resolution structures of the peptide complexed with mutant RBDs revealed a mechanism of mutation-tolerant inhibition.

In this study, the coexpression network of the periplasmic proteome uncovers potential accessory enzymes for B-type dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DypBs) in Pseudomonas putida A514. The catalytic network of the DypBs-based multienzyme complex is characterized. DypBs couple with quinone reductases and nitroreductase to participate in quinone redox cycling. They work with superoxide dismutase to induce Fenton reaction for lignin oxidation. A synthetic enzyme cocktail (SEC), recruiting 15 enzymes, was consequently designed with four functions. It overcomes the limitation of lignin repolymerization, exhibiting a capacity comparable to that of the native periplasmic secretome. Importantly, we reveal the synergistic mechanism of a SEC-A514 cell system, which incorporates the advantages of in vitro enzyme catalysis and in vivo microbial catabolism. Chemical analysis shows that this system significantly reduces the molecular weight of lignin, substantially extends the degradation spectra for lignin functional groups, and efficiently metabolizes lignin derivatives. As a result, 25% of lignin is utilized, and its average molecular weight is reduced by 27%. Our study advances the knowledge of bacterial lignin-degrading multienzymes and provides a viable lignin degradation strategy.",

In the course of a Myxococcus xanthus predator evolution experiment, we identified a class of genotypes leading to enhanced predation against diverse species. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that this phenotype is linked to the constitutive activation of a predation-specific program. Functional analysis of the mutations accumulated across the evolutionary time in a two-component system and Acyl-CoA-manipulating enzymes revealed the critical roles of fatty acid metabolism and antioxidant gene induction. The former likely adapts the predator to metabolites derived from the prey while the latter protects predatory cells from reactive oxygen species generated by prey cells under stress and released upon lysis during predation. These findings reveal interesting parallels between bacterial predator–prey dynamics and pathogen–host cell interactions.",

          "abstract": "Cellular actin networks exhibit distinct assembly and disassembly dynamics, primarily driven by multicomponent reactions occurring at the two ends of actin filaments. While barbed ends are recognized as the hotspot for polymerization, depolymerization is predominantly associated with pointed ends. Consequently, mechanisms promoting barbed-end depolymerization have received relatively little attention. Here, using microfluidics-assisted three-color single-molecule imaging, we reveal that cyclase-associated protein (CAP), long known for its roles in nucleotide exchange and pointed-end depolymerization, also acts as a processive depolymerase at filament barbed ends. CAP molecules track barbed ends for several minutes, inducing depolymerization rates of up to 60 subunits per second. Importantly, CAP modulates barbed-end dynamics even under cytosol-mimicking assembly promoting conditions. We further show that CAP can colocalize with both formin and capping protein (CP) at barbed ends. CAP enhances formin processivity by 10-fold, allowing CAP–formin complexes to track fast-elongating barbed ends. In contrast, CAP destabilizes CP-bound barbed ends and accelerates dissociation of CP by fourfold. Our findings, combined with CAP’s previously reported activities, firmly establish CAP as a key regulator of cellular actin dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Airborne insects generate a leading edge vortex when they flap their wings. This coherent vortex is a low-pressure region that enhances the lift of flapping wings compared to fixed wings. Insect wings are thin membranes strengthened by a system of veins that does not allow large wing deformations. Bat wings are thin compliant skin membranes stretched between their limbs, hand, and body that show larger deformations during flapping wing flight. This study examines the role of the leading edge vortex on highly deformable membrane wings that passively change shape under fluid dynamic loading maintaining a positive camber throughout the hover cycle. Our experiments reveal that unsteady wing deformations suppress the formation of a coherent leading edge vortex as flexibility increases. At lift and energy optimal aeroelastic conditions, there is no more leading edge vortex. Instead, vorticity accumulates in a bound shear layer covering the wing’s upper surface from the leading to the trailing edge. Despite the absence of a leading edge vortex, the optimal deformable membrane wings demonstrate enhanced lift and energy efficiency compared to their rigid counterparts. It is possible that small bats rely on this mechanism for efficient hovering. We relate the force production on the wings with their deformation through scaling analyses. Additionally, we identify the geometric angles at the leading and trailing edges as observable indicators of the flow state and use them to map out the transitions of the flow topology and their aerodynamic performance for a wide range of aeroelastic conditions.",

          "abstract": "The chloroplast genome encodes key components of the photosynthetic light reaction machinery as well as the large subunit of the enzyme central for carbon fixation, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphat-carboxylase/-oxygenase (RuBisCo). Its expression is predominantly regulated posttranscriptionally, with nuclear-encoded RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) playing a key role. Mutants of chloroplast gene expression factors often exhibit impaired chloroplast biogenesis, especially in cold conditions. Low temperatures pose a challenge for plants as this leads to electron imbalances and oxidative damage. A well-known response of plants to this problem is to increase the production of RuBisCo and other Calvin Cycle enzymes in the cold, but how this is achieved is unclear. The chloroplast RBP CP29A has been shown to be essential for cold resistance in growing leaf tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana . Here, we examined CP29A–RNA interaction sites at nucleotide resolution. We found that CP29A preferentially binds to the 5′-untranslated region of rbcL , downstream of the binding site of the pentatricopeptide repeat protein MATURATION OF RBCL 1 (MRL1). MRL1 is an RBP known to be necessary for the accumulation of rbcL . In Arabidopsis mutants lacking CP29A, we were unable to observe significant effects on rbcL , possibly due to CP29A’s restricted role in a limited number of cells at the base of leaves. In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants of tobacco NtCP29A exhibit cold-dependent photosynthetic deficiencies throughout the entire leaf blade. This is associated with a parallel reduction in rbcL mRNA and RbcL protein accumulation. Our work indicates that a chloroplast RNA–binding protein contributes to cold acclimation of RbcL production.",

Applying X-ray absorption near edge structure, transmission electron microscopy, and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer analyses, we report a unique mineral assemblage where CFA crystals coat phillipsite in abyssal sediments of the East Mariana Basin and the Philippine Sea. This finding suggests that phillipsite provides an ideal microenvironment for CFA formation due to its ability to release calcium cations and its strong adsorption capacity for phosphate anions. The feasibility of such a mechanism was confirmed by long-term (10 mo) laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the CFA forming in the sediment of abyssal plains is found to be enriched in rare earth elements (REE). The previously unrecognized mechanism of CFA formation may therefore not only contribute to the cycling of phosphorus in oceanic low-productivity environments but may also represent a significant sink of REE.",

However, the role of chronic stress in esophageal carcinogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study uncovered that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism significantly promotes esophageal carcinogenesis under chronic stress conditions. Our findings indicate that the persistent elevation of glucocorticoids induced by chronic stress stimulates cholesterol uptake, contributing to esophageal carcinogenesis. The activated glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) enrichment at the promoter region of High Mobility Group Box 2 (HMGB2) facilitates its transcription. As a transcription coactivator, HMGB2 enhances Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Transcription Factor 1 (SREBF1) transcription and regulates cholesterol metabolism through LDL particle uptake into cells via Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR). These results emphasize the significant impact of chronic stress on esophageal carcinogenesis and establish cholesterol metabolism disorder as a crucial link between chronic stress and the development of ESCC. The implications suggest that effectively managing chronic stress may serve as a viable strategy for preventing and treating ESCC.",

          "abstract": "The L-type Ca 2+ channel (Ca V 1.2) is essential for cardiac excitation–contraction coupling. To contribute to the inward Ca 2+ flux that drives Ca 2+ -induced-Ca 2+ -release, Ca V 1.2 channels must be expressed on the sarcolemma; thus the regulatory mechanisms that tune Ca V 1.2 expression to meet contractile demand are an emerging area of research. A ubiquitously expressed protein called 14-3-3 has been proposed to affect Ca 2+ channel trafficking in nonmyocytes; however, whether 14-3-3 has similar effects on Ca V 1.2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown. 14-3-3 preferentially binds phospho-serine/threonine residues to affect many cellular processes and is known to regulate cardiac ion channels including Na V 1.5 and the human ether-à-go-go–related gene (hERG) potassium channel. Altered 14-3-3 expression and function have been implicated in cardiac pathologies including hypertrophy. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that 14-3-3 interacts with Ca V 1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and regulates cardiac Ca V 1.2 trafficking and recycling. Confocal imaging, proximity ligation assays, superresolution imaging, and coimmunoprecipitation revealed a population of 14-3-3 colocalized and closely associated with Ca V 1.2. The degree of 14-3-3/Ca V 1.2 colocalization increased upon stimulation of β -adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Notably, only the 14-3-3-associated Ca V 1.2 population displayed increased cluster size with isoproterenol, revealing a role for 14-3-3 as a nucleation factor that directs Ca V 1.2 superclustering. Isoproterenol-stimulated augmentation of sarcolemmal Ca V 1.2 expression, Ca 2+ currents, and Ca 2+ transients in ventricular myocytes were strengthened by 14-3-3 overexpression and attenuated by 14-3-3 inhibition. These data support a model where 14-3-3 interacts with Ca V 1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to promote enhanced trafficking/recycling, clustering, and activity during β -adrenergic stimulation.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is impacting forests in complex ways, with indirect effects arising from interactions between tree growth and reproduction often overlooked. Our 43-y study of European beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) showed that rising summer temperatures since 2005 have led to more frequent seed production events. This shift increases reproductive effort but depletes the trees’ stored resources due to insufficient recovery periods between seed crops. Consequently, annual tree ring increments have declined by 28%, dropping from a stable average of 1.60 mm y −1 between 1980 and 2005 to 1.16 mm y −1 thereafter. Importantly, this growth decline occurred without an accompanying trend in summer drought, indicating that altered reproductive patterns—not moisture stress—are driving the reduction. This creates a “perfect storm”: Increased reproductive effort drains resources, viable seed output falls due to the loss of mast-seeding benefits via pollination and lower seed predation, and the ongoing growth decline reduces current carbon uptake and future reproductive potential. These compounding factors threaten the sustainability of Europe’s most widespread forest tree. Our findings unveil a critical yet underrecognized indirect mechanism by which climate change endangers forest ecosystems, emphasizing the need to consider interactions between demographic processes when assessing species vulnerability to climate change.",

Bacterial and yeast Hsp70s and their cochaperones function synergistically with Hsp90s to reactivate inactive and aggregated proteins by a mechanism that requires a direct interaction between Hsp90 and Hsp70 both in vitro and in vivo. Escherichia coli and yeast Hsp70s also collaborate in bichaperone systems with ClpB and Hsp104, respectively, to disaggregate and reactivate aggregated proteins and amyloids such as prions. These collaborations are dependent on direct interactions between ClpB/Hsp104 and Hsp70. We explored the possibility that E. coli homologs of Hsp70, Hsp90, and ClpB, referred to as DnaK, Hsp90 Ec , and ClpB, respectively, in combination with two DnaK cochaperones, DnaJ and GrpE, could promote protein disaggregation and reactivation under conditions where bichaperone systems are ineffective. Our results show that Hsp90 Ec is able to overcome the inhibition of protein disaggregation and reactivation observed when the concentration of DnaK is approaching physiological concentrations. We found that ATP hydrolysis and substrate binding by all three chaperones are essential for the collaborative function. The work further shows that ClpB acts early in protein reactivation with DnaK and its cochaperones; E. coli Hsp90 acts at a later stage after ClpB.

          "abstract": "In mammals, the four subunit isoforms HCN1–4 assemble to form functional homotetrameric and heterotetrameric hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) ion channels. Despite the outstanding relevance of HCN channels for organisms, including generating electrical rhythmicity in cardiac pacemaker cells and diverse types of brain neurons, key channel properties are still elusive. In particular, the unitary conductance, γ, of HCN channels is highly controversial. We analyzed the unitary conductance at femtosiemens resolution of all four homotetrameric channels of the mouse, mHCN1–4. All conductance values are in the range of 1 pS which is exceptionally small compared to most other ion channels. Surprisingly, the conductance among the isoforms differs up to threefold (γ mHCN2 = 1.54 pS &gt; γ mHCN1 = 0.84 pS &gt; γ mHCN3 = 0.54 pS ≈ γ mHCN4 = 0.51 pS) though the residues in the two narrow parts of the pore, the selectivity filter and the inner gate, are conserved. Mutagenesis and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the differences in the conductance are generated by different amounts of negative charges in the outer channel vestibule, which control ion accumulation. In line with these results, heterotetrameric channels exhibit intermediate unitary conductance values with respect to the homotetrameric channels. Our approach demonstrates how HCN channels can be functionally differentiated at the single-channel level, paving the way to target specific channels with selective drugs.",

Genetic deletion of TgCLP1 resulted in a thickened cyst wall that decreased cyst turnover, blocked the export of virulence effectors into host cells, and resulted in failure to persist during chronic infection. Genetic complementation with a series of mutants revealed that the GH19 glycosidase domain was crucial for regulating glycosylation of several glycoproteins in the cyst wall. Overall, our findings reveal that TgCLP1 is a multifunctional survival factor that modifies glycoproteins within the cyst wall to modulate export of virulence effectors and regulate turnover of tissue cysts.",

          "abstract": "The question of what mechanisms maintain tropical biodiversity is a critical frontier in ecology, intensified by the heightened risk of biodiversity loss faced in tropical regions. Ecological theory has shed light on multiple mechanisms that could lead to the high levels of biodiversity in tropical forests. But variation in species abundances over time may be just as important as overall biodiversity, with a more immediate connection to the risk of extirpation and biodiversity loss. Despite the urgency, our understanding of the primary mechanisms driving fluctuations in species abundances has not been clearly established. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework based around life history; the schedule of birth, growth, and mortality over a lifespan, and its systematic variation across species. We develop a mean field model to predict expected fluctuations in abundance for a focal species in a larger community, and we quantify empirical life history variation among 90 tropical forest species in a 50 ha plot in Panama. Putting theory and data together, we show that life history provides a critical piece of this puzzle, allowing us to explain patterns of abundance fluctuations more accurately than previous models incorporating demographic stochasticity without life history variation, and without introducing unobserved couplings between species and their environment. This framework provides a starting point for more general models that incorporate multiple factors in addition to life history variation, and suggests the potential for a fine-grained assessment of extirpation risk based on the impacts of anthropogenic change on demographic rates across life stages.",

Existing physical models only describe this process in few special cases but not in many of the types of sample geometries encountered in the practical use of AFM-IR. In this work, an analytical expression for modeling the temperature and photothermal expansion process is introduced, verified with finite element simulations, and validated with AFM-IR experiments. This method describes AFM-IR signal amplitudes in vertically and laterally heterogeneous samples and allows studying the effect of position and size of an absorber, pump laser repetition rate and pulse width on AFM-IR signal amplitudes and spatial resolution.

However, DOX toxicity and AMH rescue mechanisms in the ovary have remained unclear. Herein, we characterize the consequences of these treatments in ovarian cell types using scRNAseq. DOX-induced DNA damage activates Tp53 class mediators across ovarian cell types. In the mesenchyme, cotreatment with AMH halts theca progenitor differentiation and reduces apoptotic gene expression. In preantral granulosa cells, DOX upregulates the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1a and dysregulates Wnt signaling, which are ameliorated by AMH cotreatment. Finally, AMH induces Id3 , a gene involved in DNA repair, which is necessary to prevent the accumulation of DNA lesions marked by γ-H2AX. Altogether these mechanisms of AMH protection contribute to sustained fertility in mice, offering promising broad avenues for fertility preservation in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Carrier-free nanomedicines exhibited significant potential in elevating drug efficacy and safety for tumor management, yet their self assembly typically relied on chemical modifications of drugs or the incorporation of surfactants, thereby compromising the drug’s inherent pharmacological activity. To address this challenge, we proposed a triethylamine (TEA)-mediated protonation–deprotonation strategy that enabled the adjustable-proportion self assembly of dual drugs without chemical modification, achieving nearly 100% drug loading capacity. Molecular dynamic simulations, supported by experiment evidence, elucidated the underlying self-assembly mechanism. Specifically, TEA facilitated the deprotonation of Doxorubicin (Dox) and α-Tocopherol succinate (α-tos), causing Dox to transition from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic state, while simultaneously increasing the hydrophilicity of α-tos. This allowed for a fine-tuned balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the two compounds, enabling their precise self assembly into a carrier-free nanomedicine (DT) with a tailored drug ratio. The engineered DT demonstrated the ability to accumulate at the tumor sites and release its therapeutic drugs in a controlled manner. The combination of Dox and α-tos synergistically generated reactive oxygen species and modulated the expression of tumor matrix metalloproteinase-9, leading to superior antitumor efficacy without significant metastasis, while maintaining excellent safety profiles. Our findings provided unique perspectives on the design of carrier-free nanomedicine for cancer therapy, thereby laying a solid foundation for its potential clinical translation.",

Although the disulfide bond formed between Cys57 and Cys146 in the active state has been well studied, the role of the reduced cysteine residues, Cys6 and Cys111, in SOD1 filament formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of reduced cysteine residues by determining and comparing cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of wild-type (WT) and C6A/C111A SOD1 filaments under thiol-based reducing and metal-depriving conditions, starting with protein samples possessing enzymatic activity. The C6A/C111A mutant SOD1 formed filaments more rapidly than the WT protein. The mutant structure had a unique paired-protofilament arrangement, with a smaller filament core than that of the single-protofilament structure observed in WT SOD1. Although the single-protofilament form developed more slowly, cross-seeding experiments demonstrated the predominance of single-protofilament morphology over paired protofilaments, regardless of the presence of the Cys6 and Cys111 mutations. These findings highlight the importance of the number of amino acid residues within the filament core in determining the energy requirements for assembly. Our study provides insights into ALS pathogenesis by elucidating the initiation and propagation of filament formation, which potentially leads to deleterious amyloid filaments.",

          "authors": "David Alvarez-Ponce, Subramanian Krishnamurthy",
          "abstract": "In the pregenomic era, scientists were puzzled by the observation that haploid genome size (the C-value) did not correlate well with organismal complexity. This phenomenon, called the “C-value paradox,” is mostly explained by the fact that protein-coding genes occupy only a small fraction of eukaryotic genomes. When the first genome sequences became available, scientists were even more surprised by the fact that the number of genes (G-value) was also a poor predictor of complexity, which gave rise to the “G-value paradox.” The proposed explanations usually invoke mechanisms that increase the information content of each individual gene (protein–protein interactions, intrinsic disorder, posttranslational modifications, alternative splicing, etc.). Less attention has been paid to mechanisms that increase the amount of genetic material but do not increase (or not to the same extent) the amount of information encoded in the genome, such as gene duplication and domain shuffling. Proteins belonging to the same family and/or sharing the same domains often carry out similar or even redundant functions. We thus hypothesized that an organism’s number of different protein families and domains should be suitable predictors of organismal complexity. In agreement with our hypothesis, we observed that the number of protein families, clans, domains, and motifs increases from simple to progressively more complex organisms. In addition, these metrics correlate with the number of cell types better than and independently of the number of protein-coding genes and several previously proposed predictors of organismal complexity. Our observations have the potential to represent a resolution to the G-value paradox.",

          "abstract": "Classical tissue recombination experiments demonstrate that cell-fate determination along the anterior–posterior axis of the Müllerian duct occurs prior to postnatal day 7 in mice. However, little is known about how these cell types are maintained in adults. In this study, we provide genetic evidence that a balance between antagonistic retinoic acid (RA) and estrogen signaling activity is required to maintain simple columnar cell fate in adult uterine epithelium. Transdifferentiation of simple columnar uterine epithelium into stratified cervicovaginal-like epithelium was observed in three related mouse genetic models, in which RA signaling was perturbed in the postnatal uterus. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified the transformed epithelial cell populations and revealed extensive immune cell infiltration resulting from loss of RA signaling. Surprisingly, disruption of RA signaling led to dysregulated expression of a substantial number of estrogen target genes, suggesting that these two pathways may functionally oppose each other in determining and maintaining uterine epithelial cell fate. Consistent with this model, neonatal exposure to the strong synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol, downregulated expression of a group of RA target genes and led to epithelial stratification and immune cell infiltration in wild-type uterus. Treating RA receptor triple conditional knockout pups with fulvestrant, an estrogen antagonist, reestablished the balance between the two signaling pathways, and effectively prevented the transformation of mutant simple columnar epithelia to metaplastic stratified epithelia. These findings implicate an essential role for RA signaling in maintaining uterine cytodifferentiation by antagonizing estrogen signaling in the postnatal uterus.",

          "abstract": "Large herbivores are in decline in much of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, and true apex carnivores like the lion ( Panthera leo ) decline in parallel with their prey. As a consequence, competitively subordinate carnivores like the African wild dog ( Lycaon pictus ) are simultaneously experiencing a costly reduction in resources and a beneficial reduction in dominant competitors. The net effect is not intuitively obvious, but wild dogs’ density, survival, and reproduction are all low in areas that are strongly affected by prey depletion. To assess whether these correlations are causal, we tested the hypothesized mechanism, using data from 13 wild dog packs in two ecosystems to relate the energetic costs and benefits of hunting to variation in prey density, while controlling for the effects of local lion density, pack size, the number of dependent pups, and the level of protection. All of these variables affected the energetic costs and benefits of hunting. In areas with low prey density, the magnitude of movements and vectorial dynamic body acceleration (a measure of energy expenditure) both increased, the mass of killed prey decreased, and the number of kills per day did not change detectably. Programs to reduce or reverse the decline of large herbivore populations should be an effective means of improving the status of endangered subordinate competitors like the wild dog, and should be a high priority. Our results demonstrate the utility of research that integrates data from biomonitoring with direct, long-term observation of endangered species, their competitors, and their resources.",

Tigers persistently occupied human-free, prey-rich protected areas (35,255 square kilometers) but also colonized proximal connected habitats that were shared with ~60 million people. Tiger absence and extinction were characterized by armed conflict, poverty, and extensive land-use changes. Sparing land for tigers enabled land sharing, provided that socioeconomic prosperity and political stability prevailed.

The η-to-θ phase transition of alumina is unidirectional in bulk and retains the crystal lattice orientation. We report a rare example of a statistical kinetics study showing that for nanoparticles on a bulk Al(OH) 3 surface, this phase transition occurs nondeterministically through an ergodic equilibrium through the molten state, and the memory of the lattice orientation is lost in this process. The rate of the interconversion was found to be insensitive to the electron dose rate, and this process had a small Gibbs free energy of activation. These nondeterministic kinetics should be a key feature of crystal nucleation occurring in high-surface-energy regions of bulk crystals.",

This accomplishment was a precursor to an unprecedented burgeoning of large language models (LLMs) in the life sciences. That was just the beginning. In recent months, we have moved into a hyperaccelerated phase of new foundation models , pretrained on massive datasets, with the ability to perform a wide range of tasks that are helping us understand the structure, biology, evolution, and design of proteins, RNA, DNA, and ligands, as well as their biomolecular interactions. Unlike multimodal LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude, which process text, audio, and images, these large language of life models (LLLMs) are multiomic. That is to say, they are not only multimodal but pertain to different layers of molecular biology. For example, Evo , a foundation model trained on 2.7 million diverse phage and prokaryotic genomes (equivalent to about 300 billion DNA nucleotides), predicts the impact of variants in DNA, RNA, or proteins on structure and function, as well as how essential genes are to cell function, and can generate new DNA sequences.",

This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease, which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation.

We used a continuous attractor model of neural activity to demonstrate that neuronal fatigue both generates replay sequences and produces self-avoidance over the observed timescales. In addition, replay of past experience became predominant later into the stopping period, in a manner requiring cortical input. These results indicate a mechanism for replay generation that unexpectedly constrains which sequences can be produced across time.",

Here, we investigated hippocampal CA1 neurons in a mixed-sex group of five to 10 freely behaving wild Egyptian fruit bats that lived continuously in a laboratory-based cave and formed a stable social network. In-flight, most hippocampal place cells were socially modulated and represented the identity and sex of conspecifics. Upon social interactions, neurons represented specific interaction types. During active observation, neurons encoded the bat’s own position and head direction, together with the position, direction, and identity of multiple conspecifics. Identity-coding neurons encoded the same bat across contexts. The strength of identity coding was modulated by sex, hierarchy, and social affiliation. Thus, hippocampal neurons form a multidimensional sociospatial representation of the natural world.",

However, the mechanisms through which scratching exacerbates inflammation and whether scratching provides benefit to the host are largely unknown. We found that scratching was required for skin inflammation in mouse models dependent on FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation. Scratching-induced inflammation required pain-sensing nociceptors, the neuropeptide substance P, and the mast cell receptor MrgprB2. Scratching also increased cutaneous inflammation and augmented host defense to superficial Staphylococcus aureus infection. Thus, through the activation of nociceptor-driven neuroinflammation, scratching both exacerbated allergic skin disease and provided protection from S. aureus , reconciling the seemingly paradoxical role of scratching as a pathological process and evolutionary adaptation.",

Mice self-stimulate the SVTg, which can also be activated directly by the neocortex, resulting in effective inhibition of the lateral habenula, a region associated with depression. This mechanism may also explain why SVTg suppression induces aversion and increases fear. The translational relevance of these findings is supported by evidence in the rat, monkey, and human brainstem, establishing SVTg as a key hub for reward processing, emotional valence, and motivation.",

We found that Uty regulates spermatogonial proliferation, revealed a role for Zfy2 in promoting meiotic sex chromosome pairing, and uncovered unexpected effects of Y genes on the somatic testis transcriptome. In the remaining single Y-gene deletants, spermatogenesis appeared unperturbed, but testis transcription was still altered. Multigene deletions, including a human-infertility AZFa model, exhibited phenotypes absent in single Y deletants. Thus, Y genes may regulate spermatogenesis even if they show no phenotypes when deleted individually.

The pronounced grain boundary–related strengthening and ductilization mechanism is realized through segregation of the short-range ordering near the grain boundary. Furthermore, the supranano ordering with a larger size has an enhanced pinning effect for dislocations and stacking faults, multiplied and accumulated in grain interiors during plastic deformation.

RAD51 recombinase, the central component of several crucial processes in repairing DNA and protecting genome integrity, forms filaments on DNA, which are tightly regulated. One of these RAD51 regulators is FIGNL1 (fidgetin-like 1), which prevents RAD51 genotoxic chromatin association in normal cells and persistent RAD51 foci upon DNA damage. The cryogenic electron microscopy–imaged structure of FIGNL1 in complex with RAD51 reveals that FIGNL1 forms a nonplanar hexamer and encloses RAD51 N terminus in the FIGNL1 hexamer pore. Mutations in pore loop or catalytic residues of FIGNL1 render it defective in filament disassembly and are lethal in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our study reveals a distinct mechanism for removing RAD51 from bound substrates and provides the molecular basis for FIGNL1 in maintaining genome stability.",

Derived HSD17B2 isozymes, which are absent in high-testosterone males but preferentially expressed in low-testosterone males, converted testosterone to androstenedione faster than the ancestral isozyme.

Resonant excitation of either one of two orthogonal, degenerate vibrational modes determines the sign of the induced chiral order parameter.

Across locations, reforestation tends to provide species more habitat through both land-cover change and climate mitigation, whereas habitat loss from afforestation and bioenergy cropping typically outweighs the climate mitigation benefits.

          "abstract": "Single-cell decisions made in complex environments underlie many bacterial phenomena. Image-based transcriptomics approaches offer an avenue to study such behaviors, yet these approaches have been hindered by the massive density of bacterial messenger RNA. To overcome this challenge, we combined 1000-fold volumetric expansion with multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to create bacterial-MERFISH. This method enables high-throughput, spatially resolved profiling of thousands of operons within individual bacteria. Using bacterial-MERFISH, we dissected the response of Escherichia coli to carbon starvation, systematically mapped subcellular RNA organization, and charted the adaptation of a gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to micrometer-scale niches in the mammalian colon. We envision that bacterial-MERFISH will be broadly applicable to the study of bacterial single-cell heterogeneity in diverse, spatially structured, and native environments.",

          "abstract": "Vascular inflammation regulates endothelial pathophenotypes, particularly in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Dysregulated lysosomal activity and cholesterol metabolism activate pathogenic inflammation, but their relevance to PAH is unclear. Nuclear receptor coactivator 7 ( NCOA7 ) deficiency in endothelium produced an oxysterol and bile acid signature through lysosomal dysregulation, promoting endothelial pathophenotypes. This oxysterol signature overlapped with a plasma metabolite signature associated with human PAH mortality. Mice deficient for endothelial Ncoa7 or exposed to an inflammatory bile acid developed worsened PAH. Genetic predisposition to NCOA7 deficiency was driven by single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11154337, which alters endothelial immunoactivation and is associated with human PAH mortality. An NCOA7-activating agent reversed endothelial immunoactivation and rodent PAH. Thus, we established a genetic and metabolic paradigm that links lysosomal biology and oxysterol processes to endothelial inflammation and PAH.",

          "abstract": "We know more about the costs of chronic stress than the benefits of the acute stress response—an adaptive response that buffers organisms from life-threatening challenges. As yet, no primate study has empirically identified how the stress response adaptively affects evolutionary fitness. Here, we take advantage of a natural experiment—an El Niño drought—that produced unprecedented mortality for wild white-faced capuchins. Using a reaction norm approach, we provide evidence from primates that a more robust stress response to a challenge, measured using fecal glucocorticoids, predicts a greater likelihood of survival. We show that individuals with greater stress responsiveness to previous droughts later had higher survival across a severe El Niño drought. Evolutionary models need empirical data on how stress responsivity varies in adaptive ways. While we cannot buffer subjects from catastrophic events, we can use them to understand which aspects of the stress response help animals to “weather the storm.”",

Feldspar thermal disequilibrium textures indicate that they were carried from their crustal staging area. Bulk and mafic minerals have very high FeO and low MgO to FeO total ratios, which are partially reproduced by thermodynamic models involving high-degree fractional crystallization of a gabbroic assemblage and possibly also assimilation of iron-rich basement.

Using 13 years of data from 300 sites in Germany, we tested whether and how trait-based community features mediate the effect of land-use intensity on acknowledged stability drivers (compensatory dynamics, portfolio effect, and dominant species variability), within and across plant and arthropod communities. Trait-based plant features, especially the prevalence of acquisitive strategies along the leaf-economics spectrum, were the main land-use intensity mediators within and across taxonomic and trophic levels, consistently influencing dominant species variability. Functional diversity also mediated land-use intensity effects but played a lesser role. Our analysis discloses trait-based community features as key mediators of land-use effects on stability drivers, emphasizing the need to consider multi-trophic functional interactions to better understand complex ecosystem dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluids has been an elusive goal for centuries. Even with modern computers, anything beyond the simplest turbulent flows is too chaotic and multiscaled to be directly simulatable. An alternative is to treat turbulence probabilistically, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Such PDFs are neither chaotic nor multiscale, yet remain challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here, we overcome the dimensionality problem by encoding turbulence PDFs as highly compressed “tensor networks” (TNs). This enables single CPU core simulations that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a 5 + 1 dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of O ( 10 6 ) and O ( 10 3 ) , respectively, compared to standard finite-difference algorithms. A future path is opened toward something heretofore thought infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that can usefully be described probabilistically.",

Here, we introduce Motion Hologram, a holographic technique that accurately portrays photorealistic and speckle-free 3D scenes. This technique leverages a single hologram and a learnable motion trajectory, which are jointly optimized within a deep reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrated that the proposed technique could achieve a 4- to 5-dB PSNR improvement of focal stacks in comparison with traditional holography and could successfully depict speckle-free, high-fidelity, and full-color 3D displays using only a commercial SLM. We believe that the proposed method promises a prospective form of holographic displays that will offer immersive viewing experiences for audiences.",

We herein report an unprecedented nanosonosensitizer of one-dimensional bamboo-like multisegmented manganese dioxide@manganese–bismuth vanadate (BMMBV) to boost multiple branches of immune responses targeting MHC-I–deficient tumors. BMMBV markedly augments sonodynamic activity contributed by manganese heteroatoms in the lattice of bismuth vanadate with narrowing bandgaps. Under sonoirradiation, BMMBV enhances tumor antigen spreading and emission of adjuvant signals, which potentiate dendritic cell maturation, thereby eliciting high aptitude of CTLs. This therapy substantially up-regulates MHC expression on tumor cells, which are reversely sensitive to CTLs. Alongside, extensive innate immune cells complement the cytolytic activity of CTLs for eliminating mouse urologic tumors.

To eliminate this problem, we exploit optical frequency information carried by the ring-down cavity electromagnetic field. Instead of measuring only the decaying light intensity, we perform heterodyne detection of ring-downs followed by Fourier analysis to provide exact frequencies of optical cavity modes and a high-fidelity dispersive spectrum of a gas sample from them. We demonstrate the sub–per-mil accuracy of our method, confirmed by the best ab initio results for CO line intensity and for HD line shape, and the long-term repeatability of our dispersion measurements at 10 −4 level.

However, currently, inducing room-temperature nonequilibrium polariton condensation in perovskite microcavities requires optical pulsed excitations with high excitation densities.

Here, we found that M. tuberculosis infection induced the expression of zinc-finger DHHC domain–type palmitoyl-transferases (ZDHHCs), particularly ZDHHC2, in mouse macrophages. Furthermore, ZDHHC2 deficiency in mouse macrophages impaired the immunity against M. tuberculosis and reduced the production of various proinflammatory cytokines. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of ZDHHC2 in mediating the palmitoylation of B-RAF and C-RAF, affecting their autophagic degradation and stabilizing protein levels. The increased abundance of B-RAF and C-RAF subsequently increases the activity of the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, affecting the survival of M. tuberculosis within macrophages.

In this study, we find that both preclinical murine and clinically available human PD-L1 antibodies limit DC migration. We show that cis interactions between PD-L1 and CD80 are critical for promoting migration and define specific regions within these proteins necessary for migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that αPD-L1 significantly impedes DC migration in a B16 melanoma tumor model. Last, we outline how blocking cis PD-L1:CD80 interactions or mutation of the intracellular domain of PD-L1, in an imiquimod-induced murine model of psoriasis, limits DC migration to the lymph node, decreases interleukin-17 production by CD4 + T cells in the lymph node, and reduces epidermal thickening.

We analyzed 117 canid skulls, representing 40 domestic dog breeds and 18 wild subspecies, using geometric morphometric techniques and k -means clustering. Results show near-full overlap in kennel-club groups and with natural species, except for companion dogs having extreme snout shape.

Recent reductions in PM 2.5 were substantially larger in wealthier areas, highlighting the urgency of air quality control policies addressing all socioeconomic communities.

Although the incorporation of dynamic interactions enhances self-healing capabilities, it simultaneously weakens the hydrogels’ strength. External stimuli such as heating, while accelerating the healing process, may also lead to dehydration. Developing a stable repair strategy that combines rapid healing and high mechanical strength is challenging. Here, we introduce “salt-welding” for high-strength hydrogels with rapid room temperature self-healing. This is achieved through dynamic borate ester bonds in a salt-responsive poly(methacrylamide) hydrogel. The process involves “salt-fusion” to convert fractures into a viscous liquid for swift healing, followed by “salt-concretion” to toughen the hydrogel. The hydrogels achieve a posthealing strength of 23 megapascals in 95 minutes at room temperature, with near 100% healing efficiency. Leveraging their tunable mechanical strength and rapid healing rate, the hydrogel can be tailored for applications as a reparable wear-resistant material and damping device.",

Most existing approaches addressing this trade-off require controlled “labels,” i.e., metamaterials or contrast agents, to be deposited close to the objects and to either remain static or be tracked precisely during imaging. We propose a “blind-label” approach for acoustic subwavelength imaging. The blind labels are randomly distributed acoustic scatterers with deep-subwavelength sizes whose exact locations and trajectories are not necessary information in image reconstruction. The proposed method achieves the resolution of 0.24 wavelengths in ultrasound imaging experiments and 0.2 wavelengths in simulations, providing over 10 times improvement compared to the diffraction limit. We also elucidate the influence of scatterer size and concentration on imaging performance. The proposed “blind-label” approach relaxes the restrictions of existing acoustic subwavelength imaging technologies relying on controlled labels, therefore substantially improving the practicality of acoustic subwavelength imaging in biomedical ultrasound imaging, sonar, and nondestructive testing.",

Unexpectedly, the junction develops enhanced, instead of weakened, superconducting behaviors, exhibiting fluctuations to a higher critical magnetic field compared to its adjacent Pd 7 MoTe 2 superconductor. In addition, the critical current further exhibits a notable V-shaped minimum at zero magnetic field. These features are unexpected in conventional Josephson junctions and absent in junctions of natural bilayer MoTe 2 created using the same approach.

          "abstract": "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects nearly 90% of adults globally and is linked to over 200,000 annual cancer cases. Immunocompromised individuals from conditions such as primary immune disorders, HIV, or posttransplant immunosuppressive therapies are particularly vulnerable because of EBV’s transformative capability. EBV remodels B cell metabolism to support energy, biosynthetic precursors, and redox equivalents necessary for transformation. Most EBV-driven metabolic pathways center on mitochondria. However, how EBV regulates B cell mitochondrial function and metabolic fluxes remains unclear. Here, we show that EBV boosts cardiolipin (CL) biosynthesis, essential for mitochondrial cristae biogenesis, via EBV nuclear antigen 2/MYC-induced CL enzyme transactivation. Pharmacological and CRISPR genetic analyses underscore the essentiality of CL biosynthesis in EBV-transformed B cells. Metabolomic and isotopic tracing highlight CL’s role in sustaining respiration, one-carbon metabolism, and aspartate synthesis. Disrupting CL biosynthesis destabilizes mitochondrial matrix enzymes pivotal to these pathways. We demonstrate EBV-induced CL metabolism as a therapeutic target, offering synthetic lethal strategies against EBV-associated B cell malignancies.",

While extensive research has explored cellular responses to hypoxia, understanding how cells respond to physiologically high O 2 levels remains uncertain. To address this problem, we investigated respiratory epithelia as their contact with air exposes them to some of the highest O 2 levels in the body. We asked how the O 2 level in air controls differentiation of airway basal stem cells into the ciliated epithelial cells essential for clearing airborne pathogens from the lung. Through a metabolomics screen and 13 C tracing on primary cultures of human airway basal cells, we found that the O 2 level in air directs ciliated cell differentiation by increasing mitochondrial citrate export. Unexpectedly, disrupting mitochondrial citrate export elicited hypoxia transcriptional responses independently of HIF1α stabilization and at O 2 levels that would be hyperoxic for most tissues. These findings identify mitochondrial citrate export as a cellular mechanism for responding to physiologically high O 2 levels.",

          "abstract": "The stability of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is tightly regulated during transcriptional elongation for proper control of gene expression. Our recent studies revealed that promoter-proximal Pol II is destabilized via the ubiquitin E3 ligase cullin 3 (CUL3) upon loss of transcription elongation factor SPT5. Here, we investigate how CUL3 recognizes chromatin-bound Pol II as a substrate. Using an unbiased proteomic screening approach, we identify armadillo repeat-containing 5 (ARMC5) as a CUL3 adaptor required for VCP/p97-dependent degradation of SPT5-depleted, chromatin-bound Pol II. Genome-wide analyses indicate that ARMC5 targets promoter-proximal Pol II in a BTB domain–dependent manner. Further biochemical analysis demonstrates that interaction between ARMC5 and Pol II requires the transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), supporting a phospho-dependent degradation model. We propose that defective, promoter-proximal Pol II that lacks SPT5 is rapidly eliminated from chromatin in a noncanonical early termination pathway that requires CDK9-dependent interaction with the CUL3-ARMC5 ubiquitin ligase complex.",

In plants, elicitor perception provokes systemically expanding Ca 2+ and H 2 O 2 signals conferring immunity.

A combined two-layer bi-kinase/substrate phospho-code allows for sensitized signaling initiation already by near-resting elevations of Ca 2+ concentration. Subsequently, it facilitates further signal wave proliferation with minimal Ca 2+ amplitude requirement, triggering protective defense responses throughout the plant.

These capsule flippases collectively transport more than 100 types of capsule precursors. To determine whether they can substitute for one another, we developed a high-throughput approach to systematically examine nearly 6000 combinations of flippases and substrates. CPS flippases fall into three groups: relaxed, type-specific, and strictly specific. Cargo size and CPS acetylation affect transport, and we isolated additional gain-of-function flippase variants that can substitute for the peptidoglycan flippase YtgP (MurJ). We also showed that combining flippase variants in a single cassette allows various CPS precursors to be flipped, which may aid glycoengineering.

In systems from sheared glassy materials to buckling beams to crumpled sheets, this behavior is dominated by return-point memory, in which revisiting a past extremum of driving restores the system to a previous state. Cyclic driving with both positive and negative strains forms multiple nested memories, as in a single-dial combination lock, while asymmetric driving (only positive strain) cannot. We study this case in a general model of hysteresis that considers discrete elements called hysterons. We show how two hysterons with a frustrated interaction can violate return-point memory, realizing multiple memories of asymmetric driving. This reveals a general principle for designing systems that store sequences of cyclic driving, whether symmetric or asymmetric. In disordered systems, asymmetric driving is a sensitive tool for the direct measurement of frustration.",

We show that the inner edge of the habitable zone can now be mapped among exoplanets using their lack of surface water, which, unlike the presence of water, can be unambiguously revealed by atmospheric sulfur species. Using coupled climate-chemistry modeling, we find that the observability of sulfur gases on exoplanets depends critically on the ultraviolet (UV) flux of their host star, a property with wide variation: Most M-dwarfs have a low UV flux and thereby allow the detection of sulfur gases as a tracer of dry planetary surfaces; however, the UV flux of Trappist-1 may be too high for sulfur to disambiguate uninhabitable from habitable surfaces on any of its planets. We generalize this result to show how a population-level search for sulfur chemistry on M-dwarf planets can be used to empirically define the habitable zone in the near future.",

Analyzing 4264 individual bird captures over 27 years, we found that harsher Amazonian dry seasons significantly reduced apparent survival for 24 of 29 species, with longer-lived species being more strongly affected. Our model predicted that a 1°C increase in average dry season temperature would reduce the mean apparent survival of the understory bird community by 63%.

However, the molecular architecture and mechanistic regulation of human NADK remain undescribed. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of human NADK, both in its apo-form and in complex with its substrate NAD + (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), revealing a tetrameric organization with distinct structural features. We discover that the amino (N)- and carboxyl (C)-terminal tails of NADK have opposing effects on its enzymatic activity and cellular NADP(H) levels. Specifically, the C-terminal region is critical for NADK activity, whereas the N-terminal region exhibits an inhibitory role.

Pairing chromatin scanning transmission electron tomography with multiomic analysis and single-molecule localization microscopy, we study the role of cohesin in regulating the conformationally defined chromatin nanoscopic packing domains. Our results indicate that packing domains are not physical manifestation of TADs. Using electron microscopy, we found that only 20% of packing domains are lost upon RAD21 depletion. The effect of RAD21 depletion is restricted to small, poorly packed (nascent) packing domains. In addition, we present evidence that cohesin-mediated loop extrusion generates nascent domains that undergo maturation through nucleosome posttranslational modifications. Our results demonstrate that a 3D genomic structure, composed of packing domains, is generated through cohesin activity and nucleosome modifications.",

We integrate the spatial and temporal distribution of shallow water, in situ reef metazoans, and trilobites, with high-resolution multi-proxy redox data through the highly biodiverse Siberian Platform. We document primarily dysoxic water column conditions, suggesting that early Cambrian metazoans, including motile skeletal benthos, had low oxygen demands.

Examination of retrieved grafts demonstrated that engrafted human islets were mainly vascularized by the cotransplanted R-VECs, which had anastomosed with the host microcirculation.

          "abstract": "Coastal vertical land motion (VLM), including uplift and subsidence, can greatly alter relative sea level projections and flood mitigations plans. Yet, current projection frameworks, such as the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, often underestimate VLM by relying on regional linear estimates. Using high-resolution (90-meter) satellite data from 2015 to 2023, we provide local VLM estimates for California and assess their contribution to sea level rise both now and in future. Our findings reveal that regional estimates substantially understate sea level rise in parts of San Francisco and Los Angeles, projecting more than double the expected rise by 2050. Additionally, temporally variable (nonlinear) VLM, driven by factors such as hydrocarbon and groundwater extraction, can increase uncertainties in 2050 projections by up to 0.4 meters in certain areas of Los Angeles and San Diego. This study highlights the critical need to include local VLM and its uncertainties in sea level rise assessments to improve coastal management and ensure effective adaptation efforts.",

          "abstract": "Multimodal sensing using soft body dynamics plays a crucial role in controlling soft robotic motions. An intriguing application of such soft robot control is to mimic whiskers and digitize soft body motion through whisker dynamics. The challenge herein is to simultaneously monitor the directions, speed, force, and slip information of the whisker motion. The existing whisker-like sensors cannot detect slip information effectively. To address this challenge, this study develops a multitasking electronic brush (e-brush) composed of bundle of whiskers powered by reservoir computing (RC). Four pressure sensors are integrated into the brush to monitor its motion, speed, force, slip, and target surface. These sensors can provide long-term, low-pressure detection as low as 50 pascals, allowing for the precise monitoring of brush movements. A RC algorithm is developed to extract multiple brush motion parameters, including the slip. As a proof of concept for multitasking e-brush, the motion trajectory of handwriting is successfully detected.",

          "abstract": "Plants sense and respond to hyperosmotic stress via quick activation of sucrose nonfermenting 1–related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2). Under unstressed conditions, the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) in clade A interact with and inhibit SnRK2s in subgroup III, which are released from the PP2C inhibition via pyrabactin resistance 1–like (PYL) abscisic acid receptors. However, how SnRK2s are released under osmotic stress is unclear. Here, we outline how subgroup I SnRK2s sense molecular crowding to interrupt PP2C-mediated inhibition in plants. Severe hyperosmotic stress triggers condensate formation to activate the subgroup I SnRK2s, which requires their intrinsically disordered region. PP2Cs interact with and inhibit subgroup I SnRK2s, and this interaction is disrupted by phase separation of SnRK2s. The subgroup I SnRK2s are critical for severe osmotic stress responses. Our findings elucidate a mechanism for how macromolecular crowding is sensed in plants and demonstrate that physical separation of signaling molecules can segregate negative regulators to initiate signaling.",

Despite thermal insulation provided by blubber and fur layers and low Arctic temperatures, their fur is typically observed to be free of ice. This study investigates the anti-icing properties of polar bear fur. Here, we show that polar bear fur exhibits low ice adhesion strengths comparable to fluorocarbon-coated fibers, with the low ice adhesion a consequence of the fur sebum (hair grease). Lipid analyses reveal the presence of cholesterol, diacylglycerols, anteisomethyl-branched fatty acids, and the unexpected absence of squalene. Quantum chemical calculations predict low ice adsorption energies for identified lipids and high adsorption for squalene, suggesting that sebum composition is responsible for the observed anti-icing properties. Our work enhances understanding of polar bears and their interactions with their environment and builds on Inuit knowledge of natural anti-icing materials.",

Here, we demonstrate 50 parallel comb-teeth pairs of continuous-wave weak coherent photons HOM interference using two independently frequency post-aligned soliton microcombs (SMCs), achieving an average fringe visibility over 46%. The frequencies of all comb-teeth pairs are long-term aligned by developing two sets of fully frequency-stabilized SMCs with independent reference and adjusting free spectral range beyond 100 kilohertz through perturbations in soliton state.

However, how phytoplasmas evade this immune response to promote their propagation in insect vectors remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that infection of leafhopper vectors with rice orange leaf phytoplasma (ROLP) activates the mild melanization response in hemolymph. ROLP-encoded effector protein SRP1 is highly expressed in leafhopper hemolymph, where it competitively binds to SP2, thereby inhibiting SP2-mediated cleavage of prophenoloxidase into active phenoloxidase. Consequently, microinjection of SRP1 effectively suppresses the melanization response and enhances ROLP propagation. The histidine residue at position 23 of SRP1 is essential for SRP1-SP2 interaction, and the mutation of this position abolishes its ability to inhibit such SP2-meidated cleavage, ultimately promoting melanization response and inhibiting ROLP propagation. Our findings provide insights into how phytoplasmas antagonize insect melanization response to facilitate their persistent transmission.",

To shed light on the evolutionary emergence of the vertebrate brain, we compared anterior neuroectoderm development across deuterostome species, using available single-cell datasets from sea urchin, amphioxus, and zebrafish embryos. We identified a conserved gene co-expression module, comparable to the anterior gene regulatory network (aGRN) controlling apical organ development in ambulacrarians, and spatially mapped it by multiplexed in situ hybridization to the developing retina and hypothalamus of chordates. Using functional approaches, we show Wnt signaling regulating this co-expression module in amphioxus, like the aGRN in echinoderms, and that its overactivation suppresses forebrain identity. This suggests a previously undescribed role for Wnt signaling in amphioxus in determining the position of the forebrain. We propose this Wnt-regulated gene co-expression module as a possible mechanism by which the brain set antero-dorsally early in chordate evolution.",

This constraint cannot be overcome without using a quantum resource. Here, we show that this constraint can be overcome using a two-mode squeezed state. Quantum-correlated ultrashort pulses, generated by parametric down-conversion, enhance the sensitivity of far-infrared detection beyond the classical limit, achieving a twofold reduction in measured noise. This advancement paves the way for further development of ultrafast quantum metrology, moving toward quantum-enhanced time-resolved electric field spectroscopy with sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit.",

The reaction uses an inexpensive and commercially available phosphonium ylide as the carbon source to furnish a wide range of substituted naphthalenes. The key to the success of this transformation is the formation of a triene intermediate through ring opening, which undergoes 6π-electrocyclization and elimination processes to afford the naphthalene product. Furthermore, this strategy enables the facile synthesis of 13 C-labeled naphthalenes using 13 CH 3 PPh 3 I as a commercial 13 C source and facilitates modifying the directing group for C─H functionalization.",

Unexpectedly, mouse liver and primary hepatocytes consumed ketone bodies to support fatty acid biosynthesis via both de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) elongation. While an acetoacetate intermediate was not absolutely required for ketone bodies to source DNL, PUFA elongation required activation of acetoacetate by cytosolic acetoacetyl–coenzyme A synthetase (AACS). Moreover, AACS deficiency diminished free and esterified PUFAs in hepatocytes, while ketogenic insufficiency depleted PUFAs and increased liver triacylglycerols.

However, the photon-pair generation rate and purity are relatively low, and the strong photoluminescence in 2D semiconductors also makes the operational wavelength range limited. Here, we use the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) of rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) as a polarization entangled photon-pair source. We have achieved a generation rate of more than 120 hertz (a record-high SPDC coincidence rate with 2D materials) and a high-purity photon-pair generation with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of above 200.

          "abstract": "Prosocial behaviors are advantageous to social species, but the neural mechanism(s) through which others receive benefit remain unknown. Here, we found that bystander mice display rescue-like behavior (tongue dragging) toward anesthetized cagemates and found that this tongue dragging promotes arousal from anesthesia through a direct tongue-brain circuit. We found that a direct circuit from the tongue → glutamatergic neurons in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (MTN Glu ) → noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC NE ) drives rapid arousal in the anesthetized mice that receive the rescue-like behavior from bystanders. Artificial inhibition of this circuit abolishes the rapid arousal effect induced by the rescue-like behavior. Further, we revealed that glutamatergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT Glu ) that project to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) mediate the rescue-like behavior. These findings reveal a tongue-brain connection underlying the rapid arousal effects induced by rescue-like behavior and the circuit basis governing this specific form of prosocial behavior.",

Although reinforcement learning (RL) provides ample theoretical evidence suggesting that the long-term accumulation of these error signals improves learning efficiency, it remains unclear whether the brain uses similar mechanisms. To explore this, we constructed RL-based theoretical models and used multiregional two-photon calcium imaging in the mouse dorsal cortex. We identified a population of neurons whose activity was modulated by varying degrees of RPE accumulation. Consequently, RPE-encoding neurons were sequentially activated within each trial, forming a distributed assembly. RPE representations in mice aligned with theoretical predictions of RL, emerging during learning and being subject to manipulations of the reward function. Interareal comparisons revealed a region-specific code, with higher-order cortical regions exhibiting long-term encoding of RPE accumulation. These results present an additional layer of complexity in cortical RPE computation, potentially augmenting learning efficiency in animals.",

However, the functional packing and precise role of VirB8 in T4SSs biology remain undefined. Our findings elucidate the nature of VirB8 proteins as cell wall components, where they multimerize and exhibit a conserved assembly pattern, distinct from VirB8 in Gram-negative bacteria. We also demonstrate that VirB8 proteins interact with other T4SS subunits and DNA, indicating their pivotal role in the building of the DNA translocation channel across the cell wall.

We find that there is a time lag in viral transmission among different host populations and that movements from wild birds to unvaccinated poultry were more frequent than those from wild birds to vaccinated poultry. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the HA (hemagglutinin) gene of the AIV lineage that circulated predominately in Chinese poultry experienced greater nonsynonymous divergence and adaptive fixation than other lineages. Our results indicate that the epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary consequences of widespread AIV vaccination in poultry may be linked in complex ways and that much work is needed to better understand how such interventions may affect AIV transmission to, within, and from wild birds.",

To address this, we implemented machine learning algorithms to establish quantitative structure-property relationship models, predicting key optoelectronic characteristics, such as full width at half maximum (FWHM) and main peak wavelength, for deep-blue MR candidates. Using these methodologies, we crafted ν-DABNA-O-xy and developed deep-blue organic light-emitting diodes featuring a Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage y of 0.07 and an FWHM of 19 nm.

This work uses high-depth imaging techniques to investigate the MPs within the brain in vivo. We show that circulating MPs are phagocytosed and lead these cells to obstruction in the capillaries of the brain cortex. These blockages as thrombus formation cause reduced blood flow and neurological abnormalities in mice.

Mice with Nf2 deletion develop schwannomas slowly with low penetrance, hence inconvenient for preclinical studies. Here, we show that NF2, by recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases β-TrCP1/2, promotes WWC1-3 ubiquitination and degradation. In NF2 mutated cells, WWC1-3 accumulation is a compensatory mechanism to prevent YAP/TAZ hyperactivation and rapid tumorigenesis. Accordingly, we generate a synthetic mouse model with complete penetrance and short latency by concurrently deleting Nf2 and Wwc1/2 in Schwann cells. This model closely resembles NF2-related schwannomatosis in patients, as confirmed by histological and single-cell transcriptome analysis. Moreover, a cell line from mouse schwannomas and a syngeneic tumor model in immune-competent mice are established. Furthermore, a screen using established models has identified candidate drugs that effectively suppress schwannoma progression. Hence, this work has developed rapid and transplantable models that will facilitate both basic and translational research on NF2-related schwannomatosis.",

We have found that Suppressor of site III Qo Electron Leak 1.2 (S3QEL 1.2), a specific inhibitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from mitochondrial complex III, and myxothiazol, a complex III inhibitor, decrease IL-10 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–activated macrophages.

This mutation alters the unique C terminal domain of an essential SC protein, SYP-4, a likely ortholog of the vertebrate SC protein SIX6OS1. We use three-dimensional stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (3D-STORM) to interrogate the molecular architecture of the SC from wild-type and mutant C. elegans animals. Using a probabilistic mapping approach to analyze super-resolution image data, we detect changes in the organization of the synaptonemal complex in wild-type animals that coincide with crossover designation.

Disruption of proteostasis results in accumulation of protein aggregates causing cardiac pathologies such as hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and heart failure. Here, we identify ubiquitin-specific peptidase 5 (USP5) as a critical determinant of protein quality control (PQC) in CM. CM-specific loss of mUsp5 leads to the accumulation of polyubiquitin chains and protein aggregates, cardiac remodeling, and eventually DCM. USP5 interacts with key components of the proteostasis machinery, including PSMD14, and the absence of USP5 increases activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagic flux in CMs. Cardiac-specific hUSP5 overexpression reduces pathological remodeling in pressure-overloaded mouse hearts and attenuates protein aggregate formation in titinopathy and desminopathy models. Since CMs from humans with end-stage DCM show lower USP5 levels and display accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, we hypothesize that therapeutically increased USP5 activity may reduce protein aggregates during DCM. Our findings demonstrate that USP5 is essential for ubiquitin turnover and proteostasis in mature CMs.",

Although the rate-limiting step of this reaction is catalyzed by 5α-reductase (5αR), the role of its two primary isoenzymes, 5αR1 and 5αR2, in stress reactivity remains unclear. Here, we found that acute stress led to increased levels of 5αR2, but not 5αR1, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male, but not female, rats. Down-regulation of 5αR2 in the mPFC significantly reduced stress response in males, and similar sexual dimorphic effects were observed in a novel line of 5αR2 knockout rats. Notably, 5αR1 regulated baseline AP synthesis, whereas 5αR2 enabled AP production under stress. Acute AP administration restored stress response in 5αR2 knockdown rats. Single-nucleus transcriptomics showed that 5αR2 enabled stress-induced protein translation in neurons and glia.

          "abstract": "To push upper boundaries of thermal conductivity in polymer composites, understanding of thermal transport mechanisms is crucial. Despite extensive simulations, systematic experimental investigation on thermal transport in polymer composites is limited. To better understand thermal transport processes, we design polymer composites with perfect fillers (graphite) and defective fillers (graphite oxide), using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a matrix model. Measured thermal conductivities of ~1.38 ± 0.22 W m −1 K −1 in PVA/defective filler composites is higher than those of ~0.86 ± 0.21 W m −1 K −1 in PVA/perfect filler composites, while measured thermal conductivities in defective fillers are lower than those of perfect fillers. We identify how thermal transport occurs across heterogeneous interfaces. Thermal transport measurements, neutron scattering, quantum mechanical modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that vibrational coupling between PVA and defective fillers at PVA/filler interfaces enhances thermal conductivity, suggesting that defects in polymer composites improve thermal transport by promoting this vibrational coupling.",

          "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) comprise ~50 monogenic disorders marked by the buildup of cellular material in lysosomes, yet systematic global molecular phenotyping of proteins and lipids is lacking. We present a nanoflow-based multiomic single-shot technology (nMOST) workflow that quantifies HeLa cell proteomes and lipidomes from over two dozen LSD mutants. Global cross-correlation analysis between lipids and proteins identified autophagy defects, notably the accumulation of ferritinophagy substrates and receptors, especially in NPC1 −/− and NPC2 −/− mutants, where lysosomes accumulate cholesterol. Autophagic and endocytic cargo delivery failures correlated with elevated lysophosphatidylcholine species and multilamellar structures visualized by cryo–electron tomography. Loss of mitochondrial cristae, MICOS complex components, and OXPHOS components rich in iron-sulfur cluster proteins in NPC2 −/− cells was largely alleviated when iron was provided through the transferrin system. This study reveals how lysosomal dysfunction affects mitochondrial homeostasis and underscores nMOST as a valuable discovery tool for identifying molecular phenotypes across LSDs.",

These electronics must endure extreme folding during packaging and tension to maintain a rigid structure in the deployment state. Here, we present foldable and robustly deployable electronics inspired by Plantago, characterized by their tolerance to folding and tension due to integration of tough veins within thin leaf. The primary design approach for these electronics involves a high resistance to folding and tension, achieved through a thin multilayered electronic composite, which manages the neutral axis and incorporates tough Kevlar. The fabricated electronics can be folded up to 750,000 times without malfunctions and endure pulling an object 6667 times heavier than itself without stretching. Such robust electronics can be used as a deployable robot with sensor arrays, demonstrating practical applicability, as it maintains their mechanical and electrical properties during inflation from the packaged state.",

          "abstract": "Until now, Hippo pathway–mediated nucleocytoplasmic translocation has been considered the primary mechanism by which yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) transcriptional coactivators regulate cell proliferation and differentiation via transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD)-mediated target gene expression. In this study, however, we found that TAZ, but not YAP, is associated with the Golgi apparatus in macrophages activated via Toll-like receptor ligands during the resolution phase of inflammation. Golgi-associated TAZ enhanced vesicle trafficking and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in M1 macrophage independent of the Hippo pathway. Depletion of TAZ in tumor-associated macrophages promoted tumor growth by suppressing the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Moreover, in a diet-induced metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis model, macrophage-specific deletion of TAZ ameliorated liver inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. Thus, targeted therapies being developed against YAP/TAZ-TEAD are ineffective in macrophages. Together, our results introduce Golgi-associated TAZ as a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention to treat tumor progression and chronic inflammatory diseases.",

          "abstract": "Although lipid-derived acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) is a major carbon source for histone acetylation, the contribution of fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) to this process remains poorly characterized. To investigate this, we generated mitochondrial acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1, distal FAO enzyme) knockout macrophages. 13 C-carbon tracing confirmed reduced FA-derived carbon incorporation into histone H3, and RNA sequencing identified diminished interferon-stimulated gene expression in the absence of ACAT1. Chromatin accessibility at the Stat1 locus was diminished in ACAT1 −/− cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated reduced acetyl-H3 binding to Stat1 promoter/enhancer regions, and increasing histone acetylation rescued Stat1 expression. Interferon-β release was blunted in ACAT1 −/− and recovered by ACAT1 reconstitution. Furthermore, ACAT1-dependent histone acetylation required an intact acetylcarnitine shuttle. Last, obese subjects’ monocytes exhibited increased ACAT1 and histone acetylation levels. Thus, our study identifies an intriguing link between FAO-mediated epigenetic control of type I interferon signaling and uncovers a potential mechanistic nexus between obesity and type I interferon signaling.",

          "abstract": "A major limiting factor in the success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for the treatment of solid tumors is targeting tumor antigens also found on normal tissues. CAR T cells against GD2 induced rapid, fatal neurotoxicity because of CAR recognition of GD2 + normal mouse brain tissue. To improve the selectivity of the CAR T cell, we engineered a synthetic Notch receptor that selectively expresses the CAR upon binding to P-selectin, a cell adhesion protein overexpressed in tumor neovasculature. These tumor microenvironment actuated T (MEAT) cells ameliorated T cell infiltration in the brain, preventing fatal neurotoxicity while maintaining antitumor efficacy. We found that conditional CAR expression improved the persistence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes because of enhanced metabolic fitness of MEAT cells and the infusion of a less differentiated product. This approach increases the repertoire of targetable solid tumor antigens by restricting CAR expression and subsequent killing to cancer cells only and provides a proof-of-concept model for other targets.",

Cell and animal experiments indicate tau functions as a prion, as different strains propagated in cells cause unique, transmissible neuropathology after inoculation. Strain amplification requires compatibility of the monomer and amyloid template. We used cryo–electron microscopy to study one cell-based yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–tagged strain, resolving its amyloid nature. We then used sequential alanine (Ala) substitution (scan) within tau repeat domain (RD) to measure incorporation to preexisting tau RD-YFP aggregates. This robustly discriminated strains, defining sequences critical for monomer incorporation. We then created 3R/4R or 4R wild-type RD (amino acids 246 to 408) biosensors. Ala scan of recombinant tau seeds with the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) fold matched that of AD homogenate. We scanned 22 brain lysates comprising four tauopathies. This clustered cases by neuropathological syndrome, revealed the role of amino acids in protofilament folds, and allowed strain discrimination based on amino acid requirements for prion replication.",

The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) has long been held to act as a passive relay for visual information, but recent findings suggest a largely underestimated functional plasticity in the dLGN. However, the cellular mechanisms supporting this plasticity have not yet been explored. We show here that monocular deprivation (MD), an experimental model of amblyopia, reduces the intrinsic excitability of dLGN cells. Furthermore, dLGN neurons exhibit long-term potentiation of their intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) when suprathreshold afferent retinal inputs are stimulated at 40 hertz or when spikes are induced with current injection. LTP-IE is observed after eye opening, requires calcium influx, is expressed through the down-regulation of Kv1 channels, and is altered following MD. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence for intrinsic plasticity in dLGN neurons induced by natural stimuli.",

Oxy-functionalization of polydiketoenamines at specific sites on either the amine or triketone monomer segments increased acidolysis rates by more than three orders of magnitude, opening the door to efficient deconstruction of linear chain architectures. These insights substantially broaden the scope of applications for polydiketoenamines in a circular manufacturing economy, including chemically recyclable adhesives for a diverse range of surfaces.",

Cultured bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from these mitochondria CIII–deficient mice released less IL-10 than controls following TLR3 or TLR4 stimulation. Unexpectedly, restoring mitochondrial respiration without generating superoxide using alternative oxidase (AOX) was not sufficient to reverse LPS-induced endotoxic shock susceptibility or restore IL-10 release. However, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) rescued IL-10 release in mitochondria CIII-deficient BMDMs following LPS stimulation. In addition, mitochondria CIII deficiency did not affect BMDM responses to interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation.
