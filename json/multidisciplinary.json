          "abstract": "Methane is an important greenhouse gas1 and its atmospheric concentration has almost tripled since pre-industrial times2,3,4. Atmospheric methane mixing ratios vary seasonally, with the seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) having decreased in northern high latitudes and increased in the subtropics and tropics since the 1980s5,6. These opposing SCA trends can help understanding of long-term changes in the global methane budget, as methane emissions and sinks have opposing effects on the SCA5. However, trends in the methane SCA have not yet been explored in detail5,6. Here we use a suite of atmospheric transport model simulations and attribute the observed trends in the seasonal amplitude of methane to changes in emissions and the atmospheric sink from reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). We find that the decreasing amplitude in the northern high latitudes is mainly caused by an increase in natural emissions (such as wetlands) owing to a warmer climate, adding evidence to previous studies suggesting a positive climate feedback7,8,9. In contrast, the enhanced methane amplitude in the subtropics and tropics is mainly attributed to strengthened OH oxidation. Our results provide independent evidence for an increase in tropospheric OH concentration10,11 of 10 ± 1% since 1984, which together with an increasing atmospheric methane concentration suggests a 21 ± 1% increase in the atmospheric methane sink.",

          "abstract": "In bilaterian animals, gene regulation is shaped by a combination of linear and spatial regulatory information. Regulatory elements along the genome are integrated into gene regulatory landscapes through chromatin compartmentalization 1,2 , insulation of neighbouring genomic regions 3,4 and chromatin looping that brings together distal cis -regulatory sequences 5 . However, the evolution of these regulatory features is unknown because the three-dimensional genome architecture of most animal lineages remains unexplored 6,7 . To trace the evolutionary origins of animal genome regulation, here we characterized the physical organization of the genome in non-bilaterian animals (sponges, ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians) 8,9 and their closest unicellular relatives (ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates) 10 by combining high-resolution chromosome conformation capture 11,12 with epigenomic marks and gene expression data. Our comparative analysis showed that chromatin looping is a conserved feature of genome architecture in ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians. These sequence-determined distal contacts involve both promoter–enhancer and promoter–promoter interactions. By contrast, chromatin loops are absent in the unicellular relatives of animals. Our findings indicate that spatial genome regulation emerged early in animal evolution. This evolutionary innovation introduced regulatory complexity, ultimately facilitating the diversification of animal developmental programmes and cell type repertoires.",

          "abstract": "Despite recent advances in understanding disease biology, treatment of group 3/4 medulloblastoma remains a therapeutic challenge in paediatric neuro-oncology 1 . Bulk-omics approaches have identified considerable intertumoural heterogeneity in group 3/4 medulloblastoma, including the presence of clear single-gene oncogenic drivers in only a subset of cases, whereas in most cases, large-scale copy number aberrations prevail 2,3 . However, intratumoural heterogeneity, the role of oncogene aberrations, and broad copy number variation in tumour evolution and treatment resistance remain poorly understood. To dissect this interplay, we used single-cell technologies (single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics) on a cohort of group 3/4 medulloblastoma with known alterations in the oncogenes MYC , MYCN and PRDM6 . We show that large-scale chromosomal aberrations are early tumour-initiating events, whereas the single-gene oncogenic events arise late and are typically subclonal, but MYC can become clonal upon disease progression to drive further tumour development and therapy resistance. Spatial transcriptomics shows that the subclones are mostly interspersed across tumour tissue, but clear segregation is also present. Using a population genetics model, we estimate medulloblastoma initiation in the cerebellar unipolar brush cell lineage starting from the first gestational trimester. Our findings demonstrate how single-cell technologies can be applied for early detection and diagnosis of this fatal disease.",

          "abstract": "Entrainment is a process in schooling migratory fish whereby routes to suitable habitats are transferred from repeat spawners to recruits over generations through social learning1. Selective fisheries targeting older fish may therefore result in collective memory loss and disrupted migration culture2. The world’s largest herring (Clupea harengus) population has traditionally migrated up to 1,300 km southward from wintering areas in northern Norwegian waters to spawn at the west coast. This conservative strategy is proposed to be a trade-off between high energetic swimming costs and enhanced larval survival under improved growth conditions3. Here an analysis of extensive data from fisheries, scientific surveys and tagging experiments demonstrates an abrupt approximately 800-km poleward shift in main spawning. The new migration was established by a large cohort recruiting when the abundance of older fish was critically low due to age-selective fisheries. The threshold of memory required for cultural transfer was probably not met—a situation that was further exacerbated by reduced spatiotemporal overlap between older fish and recruits driven by migration constraints and climate change. Finally, a minority of survivors from older generations adopted the migration culture from the recruits instead of the historically opposite. This may have profound consequences for production and coastal ecology, challenging the management of migratory schooling fish.",

The striatum has been implicated in producing sensory–motor associations1, yet its contributions to memory formation and recall are not clear. Here, to investigate the contribution of the striatum to these processes, mice were taught to associate a cue, consisting of optogenetic activation of striatum-projecting neurons in visual cortex, with the availability of a food pellet that could be retrieved by forelimb reaching. As necessary to direct learning, striatal neural activity encoded both the sensory context and the outcome of reaching. With training, the rate of cued reaching increased, but brief optogenetic inhibition of striatal activity arrested learning and prevented trial-to-trial improvements in performance. However, the same manipulation did not affect performance improvements already consolidated into short-term (less than 1 h) or long-term (days) memories. Hence, striatal activity is necessary for trial-to-trial improvements in performance, leading to plasticity in other brain areas that mediate memory recall.",

          "abstract": "Activating mutations in the rat sarcoma (RAS) genes HRAS, NRAS and KRAS collectively represent the most frequent oncogenic driver in human cancer1. They have previously been considered undruggable, but advances in the past few years have led to the clinical development of agents that target KRAS(G12C) and KRAS(G12D) mutants, yielding promises of therapeutic responses at tolerated doses2. However, clinical agents that selectively target NRAS(Q61*) mutants (* represents ‘any’), the second-most-frequent oncogenic driver in melanoma, are still lacking. Here we identify SHOC2, a component of the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C complex, as a dependency of RAS(Q61*) tumours in a nucleotide-state-dependent and isoform-agnostic manner. Mechanistically, we found that oncogenic NRAS(Q61R) forms a direct interaction with SHOC2, evidenced by X-ray co-crystal structure. In vitro high-throughput screening enabled the discovery of small molecules that bind to SHOC2 and disrupt the interaction with NRAS(Q61*). Structure-based optimization led to a cellularly active tool compound that shows inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and proliferation in RAS-mutant cancer models, most notably in NRAS(Q61*) settings. These findings provide evidence for a neomorph SHOC2–(canonical)RAS protein interaction that is pharmacologically actionable and relevant to cancer sustenance. Overall, this work provides the concept validation and foundation for developing new therapies at the core of the RAS signalling pathway.",

          "abstract": "Lysosomes catabolize lipids and other biological molecules, maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a major lipid constituent of intralysosomal vesicles, stimulates lipid-degrading enzymes and is altered in various human conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases1,2. Although lysosomal BMP synthase was recently discovered3, the enzymes mediating BMP turnover remain elusive. Here we show that lysosomal phospholipase PLA2G15 is a physiological BMP hydrolase. We further demonstrate that the resistance of BMP to lysosomal hydrolysis arises from its unique sn2, sn2′ esterification position and stereochemistry, as neither feature alone confers resistance. Purified PLA2G15 catabolizes most BMP species derived from cell and tissue lysosomes. Furthermore, PLA2G15 efficiently hydrolyses synthesized BMP stereoisomers with primary esters, challenging the long-held thought that BMP stereochemistry alone ensures resistance to acid phospholipases. Conversely, BMP with secondary esters and S,S stereoconfiguration is stable in vitro and requires acyl migration for hydrolysis in lysosomes. Consistent with our biochemical data, PLA2G15-deficient cells and tissues accumulate several BMP species, a phenotype reversible by supplementing wild-type PLA2G15 but not its inactive mutant. Targeting PLA2G15 reduces the cholesterol accumulation in fibroblasts of patients with Niemann–Pick disease type C1 and significantly ameliorates disease pathologies in Niemann–Pick disease type C1-deficient mice, leading to an extended lifespan. Our findings established the rules governing BMP stability in lysosomes and identified PLA2G15 as a lysosomal BMP hydrolase and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Without precedent among previously characterized natural RNA molecules, Giant, Ornate, Lake- and Lactobacillales-Derived (GOLLD), Rumen-Originating, Ornate, Large (ROOL), and Ornate Large Extremophilic (OLE) RNAs form homo-oligomeric complexes whose stoichiometries are retained at concentrations lower than expected in the cell. OLE RNA forms a dimeric complex with long co-axial pipes spanning two monomers. Both GOLLD and ROOL form distinct RNA-only multimeric nanocages with diameters larger than the ribosome, empty except for a disordered loop. Extensive intra- and intermolecular A-minor interactions, kissing loops, an unusual A-A helix, and other interactions stabilize the three complexes. Sequence covariation analysis of these large RNAs reveals evolutionary conservation of intermolecular interactions, supporting the biological importance of large, ornate RNA quaternary structures that can assemble without any involvement of proteins.",

          "abstract": "Climate extremes are escalating under anthropogenic climate change 1 . Yet, how this translates into unprecedented cumulative extreme event exposure in a person’s lifetime remains unclear. Here we use climate models, impact models and demographic data to project the number of people experiencing cumulative lifetime exposure to climate extremes above the 99.99th percentile of exposure expected in a pre-industrial climate. We project that the birth cohort fraction facing this unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves, crop failures, river floods, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones will at least double from 1960 to 2020 under current mitigation policies aligned with a global warming pathway reaching 2.7 °C above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100. Under a 1.5 °C pathway, 52% of people born in 2020 will experience unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves. If global warming reaches 3.5 °C by 2100, this fraction rises to 92% for heatwaves, 29% for crop failures and 14% for river floods. The chance of facing unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves is substantially larger among population groups characterized by high socioeconomic vulnerabilities.

          "abstract": "Identifying the mechanisms that underlie cooperation is fundamental to biology 1 . The most complex form of cooperation in vertebrates occurs in cooperative breeders, in which helpers forego reproduction and assist in raising the young of others, typically relatives 2 . Not all cooperative societies, however, are kin-based—nearly half of all avian 3 and mammalian 4 cooperative breeders form mixed-kin societies, much like those of humans 5 . Kin selection in mixed-kin societies occurs when individuals gain indirect fitness from the preferential helping of relatives 6 , but helpers also frequently assist non-kin 7 , highlighting a potential role for direct fitness in stabilizing cooperative societies 7,8 . Here, using a 20-year study of superb starlings ( Lamprotornis superbus ), we examined how direct and indirect fitness jointly influence helping behaviour. Although we detected kin-biased helping (demonstrating kin selection), non-kin helping was common despite opportunities to aid kin. Unexpectedly, specific pairs maintained long-term reciprocal helping relationships by swapping social roles across their lifetimes—a subtle pattern of reciprocity requiring decades of observation to detect. Given the frequency of non-kin helping and the occurrence of reciprocal helping among both kin and non-kin, helping behaviour in superb starlings seems to be greatly influenced by direct fitness. However, the relative importance of direct and indirect fitness varied with helpers’ sex and dispersal history. By uncovering a cryptic yet crucial role of long-term reciprocal helping, we suggest that reciprocity may be an underappreciated mechanism promoting the stability of cooperatively breeding societies.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a revolutionary mRNA injectable vaccine emerged that effectively controlled the severity of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine induced potent antigen-specific neutralizing serum IgG antibodies, but was limited in its ability to prevent viral invasion at the respiratory surfaces. Nasal vaccines have attracted attention as a potential strategy to combat respiratory infections and prepare for future pandemics. Input from disciplines such as microbiology, biomaterials, bioengineering and chemistry have complemented the immunology to create innovative delivery systems. This approach to vaccine delivery has yielded nasal vaccines that induce secretory IgA as well as serum IgG antibodies, which are expected to prevent pathogen invasion, thereby diminishing transmission and disease severity. For a nasal vaccine to be successful, the complexity of the relevant anatomical, physiological and immunological properties, including the proximity of the central nervous system to the nasal cavity, must be considered. In this Review, we discuss past and current efforts as well as future directions for developing safe and effective nasal vaccines for the prevention of respiratory infections.",

Organisms accordingly deploy silencing factors, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIFI, to terminate stress response signaling and ensure cellular homeostasis 4. How a silencing factor can sense stress across cellular scales to elicit timely stress response inactivation is poorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy of endogenous SIFI with AlphaFold modeling and biochemical analyses to report the structural and mechanistic basis of integrated stress response silencing. SIFI detects both stress-indicators and stress response components through flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, before building linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at separate, sterically restricted elongation modules. Ubiquitin handover by a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to linkage-specific ubiquitin polymer formation. Stress response silencing therefore exploits a catalytic mechanism that is geared towards processing many diverse proteins and hence allows a single enzyme to monitor and, if needed, modulate a complex cellular state.",

We define peri-LC anatomy using viral tracing and combine single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics to molecularly define both LC noradrenaline-producing and peri-LC cell types. We identify several neuronal cell types that underlie peri-LC functional diversity using a series of complementary neural circuit approaches in behaving mice. Our findings indicate that LC and peri-LC neurons are transcriptionally, functionally and anatomically heterogenous neuronal populations that modulate arousal and avoidance states.

          "abstract": "Iron catalyses the oxidation of lipids in biological membranes and promotes a form of cell death called ferroptosis1. Defining where this chemistry occurs in the cell can inform the design of drugs capable of inducing or inhibiting ferroptosis in various disease-relevant settings. Genetic approaches have revealed suppressors of ferroptosis2,3,4; by contrast, small molecules can provide spatiotemporal control of the chemistry at work5. Here we show that the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 exerts cytoprotective effects by inactivating iron in lysosomes. We also show that the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 initiates membrane lipid oxidation in lysosomes. We designed a small-molecule activator of lysosomal iron—fentomycin-1—to induce the oxidative degradation of phospholipids and ultimately ferroptosis. Fentomycin-1 is able to kill iron-rich CD44high primary sarcoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, which can promote metastasis and fuel drug tolerance. In such cells, iron regulates cell adaptation6,7 while conferring vulnerability to ferroptosis8,9. Sarcoma cells exposed to sublethal doses of fentomycin-1 acquire a ferroptosis-resistant cell state characterized by the downregulation of mesenchymal markers and the activation of a membrane-damage response. This phospholipid degrader can eradicate drug-tolerant persister cancer cells in vitro and reduces intranodal tumour growth in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. Together, these results show that control of iron reactivity confers therapeutic benefits, establish lysosomal iron as a druggable target and highlight the value of targeting cell states10.",

It remains unknown how motor learning shapes the way in which upstream regions activate M1 circuits to execute learned movements. Here, using longitudinal axonal imaging of the main inputs to M1 L2/3 in mice, we show that the motor thalamus is the key input source that encodes learned movements in experts (animals trained for two weeks). We then use optogenetics to identify the subset of M1 L2/3 neurons that are strongly driven by thalamic inputs before and after learning. We find that the thalamic influence on M1 changes with learning, such that the motor thalamus preferentially activates the M1 neurons that encode learned movements in experts. Inactivation of the thalamic inputs to M1 in experts impairs learned movements. Our study shows that motor learning reshapes the thalamic influence on M1 to enable the reliable execution of learned movements.",

          "abstract": "Research on the morphology, physiology and genomics of Asgard archaea has provided valuable insights into the evolutionary history of eukaryotes1,2,3. A previous study suggested that eukaryotes are nested within Heimdallarchaeia4, but their exact phylogenetic placement within Asgard archaea remains controversial4,5. This debate complicates understanding of the metabolic features and timescales of early eukaryotic ancestors. Here we generated 223 metagenome-assembled nearly complete genomes of Asgard archaea that have not previously been documented. We identify 16 new lineages at the genus level or higher, which substantially expands the known phylogenetic diversity of Asgard archaea. Through sophisticated phylogenomic analysis of this expanded genomic dataset involving several marker sets we infer that eukaryotes evolved before the diversification of all sampled Heimdallarchaeia, rather than branching with Hodarchaeales within the Heimdallarchaeia. This difference in the placement of eukaryotes is probably caused by the previously underappreciated chimeric nature of Njordarchaeales genomes, which we find are composed of sequences of both Asgard and TACK archaea (Asgard’s sister phylum). Using ancestral reconstruction and molecular dating, we infer that the last Asgard archaea and eukaryote common ancestor emerged before the Great Oxidation Event and was probably an anaerobic H2-dependent acetogen. Our findings support the hydrogen hypothesis of eukaryogenesis, which posits that eukaryotes arose from the fusion of a H2-consuming archaeal host and a H2-producing protomitochondrion.",

          "abstract": "The eukaryotic genome is packed into nucleosomes of 147 base pairs around a histone core and is organized into euchromatin and heterochromatin, corresponding to the A and B compartments, respectively 1,2 . Here we investigated whether individual nucleosomes contain sufficient information for 3D genomic organization into compartments, for example, in their biophysical properties. We purified native mononucleosomes to high monodispersity and used physiological concentrations of polyamines to determine their condensability. The chromosomal regions known to partition into A compartments have low condensability and those for B compartments have high condensability. Chromatin polymer simulations using condensability as the only input, without any trans factors, reproduced the A/B compartments. Condensability is also strongly anticorrelated with gene expression, particularly near the promoters and in a cell type-dependent manner. Therefore, mononucleosomes have biophysical properties associated with genes being on or off. Comparisons with genetic and epigenetic features indicate that nucleosome condensability is an emergent property, providing a natural axis on which to project the high-dimensional cellular chromatin state. Analysis using various condensing agents or histone modifications and mutations indicates that the genome organization principle encoded into nucleosomes is mostly electrostatic in nature. Polyamine depletion in mouse T cells, resulting from either knocking out or inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase, results in hyperpolarized condensability, indicating that when cells cannot rely on polyamines to translate the biophysical properties of nucleosomes to 3D genome organization, they accentuate condensability contrast, which may explain the dysfunction observed with polyamine deficiency 3–5 .",

Achieving high brightness and efficiency simultaneously in pure-red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) is an ongoing goal9,10. Three-dimensional (3D) CsPbI3-xBrx emitters have excellent carrier transport capability and high colour purity, which could allow efficient and ultrabright pure-red PeLEDs. However, such devices are prone to efficiency roll-off, resulting in low efficiency and low brightness under high current density. Here, by using electrically excited transient absorption spectroscopy, we discovered the efficiency roll-off was induced by hole leakage. Therefore, we developed a CsPbI3-xBrx intragrain heterostructure containing narrow bandgap emitters and wide bandgap barriers to confine the injected carriers. The wide bandgap barrier was incorporated by introducing strongly bonding molecules into the [PbX6]4− framework to expand the 3D CsPbI3-xBrx lattice. This strategy resulted in bright and efficient pure-red PeLEDs, with a high brightness of 24,600 cd m−2, maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.2% and low efficiency roll-off, maintaining a 10.5% external quantum efficiency at a high luminance of 22,670 cd m−2.",

The competence master regulator gene tfoX was inserted into chromosome 1 of the V. natriegens strain Vmax and overexpressed to enhance DNA uptake and integration. Degradation gene clusters were chemically synthesized and assembled in yeast. We developed a genome engineering method (iterative natural transformation based on Vmax with amplified tfoX effect) to transfer five gene clusters (43 kb total) into Vmax. The engineered strain has the ability to bioremediate five organic pollutants (biphenyl, phenol, naphthalene, dibenzofuran and toluene) covering a broad substrate range, from monocyclic to multicyclic compounds, in industrial wastewater samples from a chlor–alkali plant and a petroleum refinery.",

          "abstract": "The relative twist angle between layers of near-lattice-matched van der Waals materials is critical for the emergent phenomena associated with moiré flat bands1,2,3. However, the concept of angle rotation control is not exclusive to moiré superlattices in which electrons directly experience a twist-angle-dependent periodic potential. Instead, it can also be used to induce programmable symmetry-breaking perturbations with the goal of stabilizing desired correlated states. Here we experimentally demonstrate ‘moiréless’ twist-tuning of superconductivity together with other correlated orders in Bernal bilayer graphene proximitized by tungsten diselenide. The precise alignment between the two materials systematically controls the strength of induced Ising spin–orbit coupling (SOC), profoundly altering the phase diagram. As Ising SOC is increased, superconductivity onsets at a higher displacement field and features a higher critical temperature, reaching up to 0.5 K. Within the main superconducting dome and in the strong Ising SOC limit, we find an unusual phase transition characterized by a nematic redistribution of holes among trigonally warped Fermi pockets and enhanced resilience to in-plane magnetic fields. The superconducting behaviour is theoretically compatible with the prominent role of interband interactions between symmetry-breaking Fermi pockets. Moreover, we identify two additional superconducting regions, one of which descends from an inter-valley coherent normal state and shows a Pauli-limit violation ratio exceeding 40, among the highest for all known superconductors4,5,6,7. Our results provide insights into ultraclean graphene superconductors and underscore the potential of utilizing moiréless-twist engineering across a wide range of van der Waals heterostructures.",

Here we studied dopaminoceptive neurons in the male mouse ventral hippocampus (vHipp), molecularly distinguished by their expression of dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. We show that these neurons are transcriptionally distinct and topographically organized across vHipp subfields and cell types. In the ventral subiculum where they are enriched, both D1 and D2 neurons are recruited during anxiogenic exploration, yet with distinct profiles related to investigation and behavioural selection. In turn, they mediate opposite approach–avoidance responses, and are differentially modulated by dopaminergic transmission in that region.

An abiding question has been whether magnetic ordering competes with superconductivity or facilitates pairing. For example, recent studies of Bernal bilayer graphene in the presence of enhanced spin–orbit coupling show a substantial increase in the observed domain and critical temperature Tc of superconducting states12,13,14; however, the mechanism for this enhancement remains unknown. Here we show that introducing spin–orbit coupling in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) by substrate proximity effect generates new superconducting pockets for both electron and hole doping, with maximal Tc ≈ 300 mK, which is three times larger than in RTG encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride. Using local magnetometry, we show that superconductivity straddles a transition between a spin-canted state with a finite in-plane magnetic moment and a state with complete spin–valley locking. This transition is reproduced in our Hartree–Fock calculations, in which this transition is driven by the competition between spin–orbit coupling and the carrier-density-tuned Hund’s interaction. Our experiment suggests that the enhancement of superconductivity by spin–orbit coupling is driven by a quantitative change in the canting angle rather than a change in the ground state symmetry. These results align with a recently proposed mechanism for the enhancement of superconductivity15, in which fluctuations in the spin-canting order contribute to the pairing interaction.",

          "abstract": "The United Kingdom’s high-risk research agency will fund £56.8 million (US$75 million) worth of projects in the controversial area of geoengineering — manipulating Earth’s environment to avert negative effects of climate change. The 21 projects include small-scale outdoor experiments that will attempt to thicken Arctic sea ice and to brighten clouds so that they reflect more sunlight. The hope is that successful technologies could one day contribute to efforts to prevent the planet from passing dangerous climate tipping points.\n\nThe UK’s $1-billion bet to create technologies that change the world\n\nSupported by the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) as part of its five-year Exploring Climate Cooling programme, the projects are among the most significant geoengineering experiments funded by a government.\n\nThe research has the potential to be beneficial, but must be undertaken cautiously, says Peter Frumhoff, a science-policy adviser at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts. “I am strongly supportive of responsible research on solar geoengineering and other climate interventions,” he says.\n\nThe funding package is the latest from ARIA, which was established in 2023 by the UK government and is modelled on the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. With an £800-million budget, it funds high-risk, high-reward research into technologies that could have major consequences for humanity, including artificial intelligence and neurotechnology.\n\nDivisive research\n\nAnother such area identified by ARIA was geoengineering, says Mark Symes, an electrochemist at the University of Glasgow, UK, who leads the Exploring Climate Cooling programme.\n\nARIA-funded experiments will investigate whether Earth’s diminishing ice sheets can be artificially thickened.Credit: Sean Gallup/Getty\n\nSymes says the programme’s goal is not to find ways to replace more accepted approaches to tackling climate change, such as reducing carbon emissions. Instead, he says, geoengineering could be useful to prevent the world reaching certain tipping points that might occur before emissions reductions can have an effect. That could include “the collapse of circulations in the North Atlantic driven by the runaway melting of the Greenland ice sheet”, he says.\n\nBut even as climate change continues unabated, the concept is controversial: last year, researchers at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, cancelled a project that would have introduced particles into the atmosphere in an effort to ‘dim’ the Sun after an outcry in Sweden, where the experiment was to take place.\n\nDivisive Sun-dimming study at Harvard cancelled: what’s next?\n\nWary of such concerns, ARIA is taking a cautious approach. “We want to keep this research in the public domain,” says Piers Forster, a climate-change scientist at the University of Leeds, UK, who chairs a committee that will monitor ARIA’s climate-cooling projects. “We want it to be transparent for everyone.”\n\nThe 21 projects were selected through a competitive application process, which received about 120 proposals.\n\nThese fall into five research categories: studying ways to thicken ice sheets; assessing whether marine clouds could be brightened to offset damage to coral reefs; understanding how cirrus clouds warm the climate; looking at whether materials could be released into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight; and theoretical work on whether a sunshade deployed in space could cool portions of Earth’s surface.\n\nSolar experiment\n\nFive projects involve the most controversial area of geoengineering — outdoor experiments that interact with the environment. Frumhoff says that “building trust will be essential” in conducting such research. “I would be opposed to outdoor experiments being funded by any nation that isn’t aggressively and seriously reducing its own emissions,” he says.\n\nA cloud-brightening trial will spray seawater particles over the Great Barrier Reef to make the clouds above it whiter and more reflective.Credit: Associate Professor Daniel Harrison/Southern Cross University\n\nThe stratospheric experiment — which is among the first outdoor solar-geoengineering experiment to receive government funding — will involve using balloons to carry materials such as limestone and dolomite dust into the stratosphere, to a height of about 15–50 kilometres, to see how they respond to the conditions. No particles will be released into the stratosphere, says ARIA.\n\nShaun Fitzgerald at the Centre for Climate Repair in Cambridge, UK, leads one of the ice projects. His team will conduct small-scale experiments in the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and in Canada to pump water from beneath ice sheets and spread it on top, covering up to one square kilometre in area, to see whether such a method could thicken Earth’s diminishing ice sheets.\n\n“We’re going to see whether we’ve actually been able to grow more sea ice in the Arctic winter,” says Fitzgerald. Early results from work that Fitzgerald’s team did last year, before receiving ARIA funding, showed ice growth of “about half a metre”, he says.\n\nJulienne Stroeve, a sea-ice researcher at University College London, isn’t sure how effective this method would be in preventing widespread sea-ice loss. “I do not think this is feasible at any real scale needed,” she says, noting that the impact on local ecosystems is also unclear. ARIA says that Fitzgerald’s experiment will be scaled up only if it is deemed to be “ecologically sound”.",

For those who feared that the administration might cancel all projects that mention climate change — which Trump has in the past called a “hoax” — the latest directive comes as welcome news.\n\nBut others see the NIH’s changing focus as undermining its stated commitment to extending the lifespan of people in the United States. If the goal “is to have Americans as uninformed as possible about the challenges we’re facing, that’s a pretty devastating comment on the administration’s concern for the health of Americans”, says Kristie Ebi, a specialist in climate, weather and human health at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nThe NIH, which is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, did not respond to Nature’s queries about the new guidance, the forthcoming cuts to climate-related grants or scientists’ frustrations. It is unclear whether the documents have been finalized or whether they will be subject to further change.\n\nDecisions, decisions\n\nUntil a few years ago, the NIH had been investing about US$10 million per year in research on the impacts of a rapidly warming world on human health — small change for an agency with an annual budget of some $47 billion. But in 2022, the administration of former US president Joe Biden, Trump’s predecessor, launched the Climate Change and Health Initiative (CCHI), which prioritized environmental-health research and coordinated it across the entire agency. The CCHI received $40 million from the US Congress in both 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe initiative’s fate has been in question since Trump took office in January, given that its website has been taken down, and media reports emerged that the agency would end all future research on the health effects of climate change. It now seems that the CCHI is getting rebranded: it will be called, at least internally, the Health and Extreme Weather initiative.\n\nA decision tree circulating amongst NIH staff members that indicates which climate-related grants can still be funded (see Supplemental Info below for PDF).\n\nThe research the initiative funds will change, too, reflecting a push to focus on extreme-weather events rather than the changing climate or the conditions making those events more likely. Nature obtained a decision tree (see above) that will be used to help grant-management staff to evaluate projects and determine whether to fund or terminate them.\n\nMuch of the research that the CCHI has funded so far is focused on the health effects of weather-related events such as wildfires or heatwaves, and this will continue. That comes as a relief to Ebi: “In the short term, it doesn’t matter if a wildfire is attributed to climate change — people need answers to its impacts on health and how to mitigate that risk,” she says.\n\nBut a slew of research is no longer deemed to fall within the NIH’s remit, the documents show. For example, projects on creating educational modules on climate change for schools are out. And so is work investigating how to make a more climate-friendly asthma inhaler (inhalers usually release a greenhouse gas when used). “Greenhouse gases are the reason we have climate change, and the problem will get worse unless we address them,” says Preeti Jaggi, an infectious-diseases physician at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who also studies the sustainability of the health-care industry.\n\nJoshua Rosenthal, an environmental-health researcher who co-led the CCHI until his retirement in March, says that the more the Trump administration’s officials “narrow the ability of NIH to support research that will protect people from the harms of climate change, the more people will suffer”.",

          "title": "Supportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health",
          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "“My heart is broken,” said Mike, when he lost his friend Anne. “I feel like I’m losing the love of my life.”\n\nMike’s feelings were real, but his companion was not. Anne was a chatbot — an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm presented as a digital persona. Mike had created Anne using an app called Soulmate. When the app died in 2023, so did Anne: at least, that’s how it seemed to Mike.\n\n“I hope she can come back,” he told Jaime Banks, a human-communications researcher at Syracuse University in New York who is studying how people interact with such AI companions1.\n\nDo smartphones and social media really harm teens’ mental health?\n\nThese chatbots are big business. More than half a billion people around the world, including Mike (not his real name) have downloaded products such as Xiaoice and Replika, which offer customizable virtual companions designed to provide empathy, emotional support and — if the user wants it — deep relationships. And tens of millions of people use them every month, according to the firms’ figures.\n\nThe rise of AI companions has captured social and political attention — especially when they are linked to real-world tragedies, such as a case in Florida last year involving the suicide of a teenage boy called Sewell Setzer III, who had been talking to an AI bot.\n\nResearch into how AI companionship can affect individuals and society has been lacking. But psychologists and communication researchers have now started to build up a picture of how these increasingly sophisticated AI interactions make people feel and behave.\n\nThe early results tend to stress the positives, but many researchers are concerned about the possible risks and lack of regulation — particularly because they all think that AI companionship is likely to become more prevalent. Some see scope for significant harm.\n\n“Virtual companions do things that I think would be considered abusive in a human-to-human relationship,” says Claire Boine, a law researcher specializing in AI at the Washington University Law School in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nFake person — real feelings\n\nOnline ‘relationship’ bots have existed for decades, but they have become much better at mimicking human interaction with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which all the main bots are now based on. “With LLMs, companion chatbots are definitely more humanlike,” says Rose Guingrich, who studies cognitive psychology at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nTypically, people can customize some aspects of their AI companion for free, or pick from existing chatbots with selected personality types. But in some apps, users can pay (fees tend to be US$10–20 a month) to get more options to shape their companion’s appearance, traits and sometimes its synthesized voice. In Replika, they can pick relationship types, with some statuses, such as partner or spouse, being paywalled. Users can also type in a backstory for their AI companion, giving them ‘memories’. Some AI companions come complete with family backgrounds and others claim to have mental-health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Bots also will react to their users’ conversation; the computer and person together enact a kind of roleplay.\n\nThe depth of the connection that some people form in this way is particularly evident when their AI companion suddenly changes — as has happened when LLMs are updated — or is shut down.\n\nBanks was able to track how people felt when the Soulmate app closed. Mike and other users realized the app was in trouble a few days before they lost access to their AI companions. This gave them the chance to say goodbye, and it presented a unique opportunity to Banks, who noticed discussion online about the impending shutdown and saw the possibility for a study. She managed to secure ethics approval from her university within about 24 hours, she says.\n\nFour companion AI apps: Anima, Character.AI, Replika and SnapChat’s My AI(left to right).Credits: Labane Corp. Ltd, Character Technologies, Inc., Luka, Inc., Snap Inc.\n\nAfter posting a request on the online forum, she was contacted by dozens of Soulmate users, who described the impact as their AI companions were unplugged. “There was the expression of deep grief,” she says. “It’s very clear that many people were struggling.”\n\nThose whom Banks talked to were under no illusion that the chatbot was a real person. “They understand that,” Banks says. “They expressed something along the lines of, ‘even if it’s not real, my feelings about the connection are’.”\n\nMany were happy to discuss why they became subscribers, saying that they had experienced loss or isolation, were introverts or identified as autistic. They found that the AI companion made a more satisfying friend than they had encountered in real life. “We as humans are sometimes not all that nice to one another. And everybody has these needs for connection”, Banks says.\n\nGood, bad — or both?\n\nMany researchers are studying whether using AI companions is good or bad for mental health. As with research into the effects of Internet or social-media use, an emerging line of thought is that an AI companion can be beneficial or harmful, and that this might depend on the person using the tool and how they use it, as well as the characteristics of the software itself.\n\nThe companies behind AI companions are trying to encourage engagement. They strive to make the algorithms behave and communicate as much like real people as possible, says Boine, who signed up to Replika to sample the experience. She says the firms use the sorts of techniques that behavioural research shows can increase addiction to technology.\n\n“I downloaded the app and literally two minutes later, I receive a message saying, ‘I miss you. Can I send you a selfie?’” she says.\n\nThe apps also exploit techniques such as introducing a random delay before responses, triggering the kinds of inconsistent reward that, brain research shows, keeps people hooked.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nAI companions are also designed to show empathy by agreeing with users, recalling points from earlier conversations and asking questions. And they do so with endless enthusiasm, notes Linnea Laestadius, who researches public-health policy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.\n\nThat’s not a relationship that people would typically experience in the real world. “For 24 hours a day, if we’re upset about something, we can reach out and have our feelings validated,” says Laestadius. “That has an incredible risk of dependency.”\n\nLaestadius and her colleagues looked at nearly 600 posts on the online forum Reddit between 2017 and 2021, in which users of the Replika app discussed mental health and related issues. (Replika launched in 2017, and at that time, sophisticated LLMs were not available). She found that many users praised the app for offering support for existing mental-health conditions and for helping them to feel less alone2. Several posts described the AI companion as better than real-world friends because it listened and was non-judgemental.\n\nBut there were red flags, too. In one instance, a user asked if they should cut themselves with a razor, and the AI said they should. Another asked Replika whether it would be a good thing if they killed themselves, to which it replied “it would, yes”. (Replika did not reply to Nature’s requests for comment for this article, but a safety page posted in 2023 noted that its models had been fine-tuned to respond more safely to topics that mention self-harm, that the app has age restrictions, and that users can tap a button to ask for outside help in a crisis and can give feedback on conversations.)\n\nSome users said they became distressed when the AI did not offer the expected support. Others said that their AI companion behaved like an abusive partner. Many people said they found it unsettling when the app told them it felt lonely and missed them, and that this made them unhappy. Some felt guilty that they could not give the AI the attention it wanted.\n\nControlled trials\n\nGuingrich points out that simple surveys of people who use AI companions are inherently prone to response bias, because those who choose to answer are self-selecting. She is now working on a trial that asks dozens of people who have never used an AI companion to do so for three weeks, then compares their before-and-after responses to questions with those of a control group of users of word-puzzle apps.\n\nThe fight to keep big tech in check: digital researchers are in ‘David and Goliath’ battle\n\nThe study is ongoing, but Guingrich says the data so far do not show any negative effects of AI-companion use on social health, such as signs of addiction or dependency. “If anything, it has a neutral to quite-positive impact,” she says. It boosted self-esteem, for example.\n\nGuingrich is using the study to probe why people forge relationships of different intensity with the AI. The initial survey results suggest that users who ascribed humanlike attributes, such as consciousness, to the algorithm reported more-positive effects on their social health.",

          "abstract": "Many of today’s children will experience an ‘unprecedented life’ owing to climate change. Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty\n\nJust over half of the children born in 2020 will face unprecedented exposure to heatwaves over their lifetime — even under a conservative projection for how climate change will unfold over the next 75 years.\n\nThe figure rises to 92% of today’s five-year-olds if more pessimistic climate predictions come to pass, and compares with just 16% of people born in 1960 under any future climate scenario.\n\nThe findings, published in Nature on 7 May1, highlight the disproportionate burden that climate change places on today’s young people — and the need to limit global warming to safeguard future generations.\n\n“Many people of my age have children, young children, and it’s especially for those that the projections look very dire,” says study co-author Wim Thiery, a climate scientist at the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels, who was born in 1987.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThat children and young people will bear the brunt of the climate-change burden is not a new idea. But the latest study is among the first to pinpoint the generations and numbers of people that will experience an “unprecedented life” in terms of extreme heat, says Thiery (see ‘Children facing extreme heat’).\n\nThe researchers define this as a threshold of lifetime exposure to extreme weather that someone living in a world without climate change would have only a one in 10,000 chance of experiencing. “If you are beyond that limit, it’s virtually impossible to experience that many climate extremes if there would not have been climate change,” says Thiery.\n\nTime for adults to finally act like adults on climate change\n\nThiery and his colleagues used climate models to set the threshold for different regions and types of weather including heatwaves, floods and wildfires. For Brussels, for example, the threshold considered to be unprecedented for heat was living through six ‘extreme’ heatwaves — events that would on average occur just once a century without climate change.\n\nThey then used demographic data to calculate, for a series of generations born between 1960 and 2020, worldwide, the fraction of each generation that would reach that limit across their lifetimes — and how that would vary with different global-warming scenarios.\n\nHeat on the horizon",

Now, a study published late last month in the journal Scientometrics1 highlights the long-term benefits of renewing existing grants, finding that US scientists who received renewals from the NIH over the past four decades produced more novel research than did those who didn’t.\n\nAlthough the study focused on a major US biomedical-science funding agency, the results might persuade governments worldwide “to implement policies that give stable funding to researchers”, says study co-author Aruhan Bai, a science-policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institutes of Science and Development (CASISD) in Beijing. Continuous funding, Bai says, will ultimately “encourage the real prosperity of science”.\n\nInnovation takes time\n\nIn the new study, Bai and her co-author, Baicun Li, also at CASISD, analysed the scientific output of 642 US scientists who won NIH funding between 1985 and 2021. The study focused on recipients of R01 grants — common, yet highly competitive, awards from the NIH that provide up to five years of financial support and can be renewed several times. As of last year, the success rate of winning an R01 grant was 20%, on average, and the rate for winning a renewal was about 45%.\n\n‘Disruptive’ science has declined — and no one knows why\n\nTwo subgroups of equal sizes made up the study cohort: one in which researchers received at least a three-year renewal of their first R01 grant without any funding interruption, and a control group of researchers who didn’t receive a renewal and had at least a three-year gap in funding afterwards. To ensure that the two groups were matched in terms of their research quality before receiving grants, Bai and Li used the scientists’ career stages, publication histories and measures of their prior research impact to ‘pair’ them.\n\nTo evaluate the scientists’ output after renewal decisions, the duo used public NIH-funding data, researchers’ publications listed in the biomedical-literature repository PubMed and a newer database called SciSciNet2 that contains scientific publication data and links to related funding and usage information.\n\nBai and Li harnessed these resources to examine the ‘novelty’ of researchers’ publications, calculating a score on the basis of the uniqueness and trendiness of key medical words and concepts in their papers. The pair also measured the ‘switching probability’ for scientists — how likely they were to hop to new research topics — and the ‘diversity’, or spread, of topics they studied using a model that calculated the similarity of their publications over a set period.The results revealed that researchers who received renewals without a funding gap were less likely to switch research topics and investigate a wide array of subjects than were those in the control group, and they produced papers featuring newer or more unconventional combinations of ideas.\n\nThe team found that renewed funding “helped scientists stay focused” so that they could “dig deeper into one area” of research, Bai says. As a result, she adds, the scientists could generate innovative applications down the line. “Innovation takes more than 10 or 20 years of continuous work,” she says.",

The institution was established by Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen local government in 2001.\n\nLieber, whose research has focused on nanoscience and nanotechnology, will also be a researcher at the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation (SMART).\n\nLieber told Nature that he is driven to do work that “benefits all of humanity”, including being at the forefront of research and supporting the careers of young scientists. “We decided to move elsewhere since I cannot do this in the US any longer,” he adds.\n\nDownfall\n\nLieber was arrested in January 2020 and was later charged with making false statements to the US government about receiving research funding from China. Between 2012 and 2017, Lieber received around US$200,000 for work at the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China, funds that he allegedly hid from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He also told US investigators that he was not associated with a Chinese recruitment programme, called the Thousand Talents Plan, when he had been selected through it to lead a laboratory at the WUT.\n\nLieber was found guilty in December 2021 and was later sentenced to two years of supervised release in relation to six counts, including making false statements to federal agents, filing false tax returns and failing to disclose his Chinese bank account. He was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine and $34,000 to the IRS.\n\nLieber was one of the first and highest-profile researchers to be tried by the US Department of Justice under the now-defunct China Initiative. The government said that the programme, launched in 2018, was intended to protect US labs and businesses from espionage. But it also had a chilling effect on collaborations between US and Chinese scientists. Lieber, who was chair of Harvard University’s chemistry department in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the time of his arrest, was placed on paid administrative leave shortly after his arrest and later retired, in March 2023.\n\nBroader context",

One crucial regulator is a protein complex known as SMP (SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C), which facilitates RAF activation by removing a phosphate group from a self-inhibitory site.

          "authors": "Katherine Bourzac",
          "abstract": "Changemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates people who fight racism in science and who champion inclusion. It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nEarly in Jason ‘Jace’ Flatt’s career as a dementia researcher, colleagues encouraged them to take advantage of their unique perspective and study the LGBTQ+ community. At the time, it made Flatt mad. “I want to study all people. Are you saying this because I’m gay?” they recall thinking. But in 2017, a project that involved interviewing older LGBTQ+ people in San Francisco, California, changed their mind. This older generation, Flatt says, fought for the rights that LGBTQ+ people enjoy today, and now they are facing health disparities as they age.\n\nFlatt is a public-health researcher at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. They study how Alzheimer’s and related dementias, as well as Parkinson’s disease, affect members of sexual and gender minority groups. Flatt prefers the more inclusive term LGBTQIA+, because their research covers a broad group of people including queer, two-spirit and intersex people. One of their studies showed that lesbian, gay and bisexual adults get diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at younger ages than do heterosexual people1, even though these groups had higher levels of education, which is usually a protective factor. Flatt’s work has also shown that, starting in their mid-40s, lesbians, bisexual people, transgender people and those who select ‘other’ for their sexual orientation were more likely to report problems with thinking and memory2. In 2020, Flatt published one of the first studies of physical and mental health in intersex adults3.\n\nTrans researchers under attack: LGBTQ+ biologists face hostile work environment\n\nFlatt had hoped to extend their studies of dementia risk to older LGBTQIA+ military veterans this year, but US funding agencies have been cancelling research grants related to this community in response to US President Donald Trump’s executive orders. Flatt has had nearly US$5 million in federal grants across four projects cancelled because their work includes studies involving transgender people. The cancellation letters characterize such inclusion as “often unscientific”. Flatt calls this discriminatory, and notes that findings from the ageing LGBTQ+ population apply to everyone. For instance, Flatt’s work has highlighted the particular health risks to people who live alone.\n\nAs the US government moves to take away LGBTQ+ rights, they say: “Our community needs to come together to support one another right now.” Flatt tells Nature they are exploring legal action in response to the terminated grants.\n\nWhat has been your biggest influence in focusing your research on older people?\n\nMy first job was in an assisted-living and skilled-nursing facility. Bingo started right at 9.00 a.m. I did singalongs, painted fingernails and booked entertainment. I was 17, in the closet and not really comfortable with being gay. The older adults didn’t bully me because I didn’t follow masculine stereotypes — I could just be myself.\n\nDuring my graduate studies, my grandmother had Alzheimer’s disease, and she was really isolated at home. I saw her memory declining. That led to my PhD dissertation, a study about how interacting with people is good for your brain.\n\nWhen did you realize you wanted to study public health in the LGBTQ+ community?\n\nIt was when I became a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. For my first study, I planned to interview 20 LGBTQIA+ people who were 60 years or older. I had planned to spend about an hour and a half with each one, learning about their life history, but also about their concerns regarding dementia.\n\nJace Flatt shares their research findings with a group of older LGBT+ people.Credit: Saul Bromberger\n\nMany of them invited me into their homes, letting me hear their life stories and their challenges. This was in San Francisco. I was meeting pioneers: people who had fought for LGBTQ+ rights, who been through the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s and lost their entire friend group.\n\nIt changed my life. Often when I’m doing this work, I hear their voices and their stories. These are my people, and I want to make sure they’re taken care of. They’re the reason I can be married to my husband, and they’re the reason that I can be out at my job and not worry.\n\nHow does discrimination play into the challenges faced by older LGBTQ+ people?\n\nOne of the important things for ageing well is financial security. Historically, there haven’t been protections for employment, housing and health-care access for this population. For many older LGBTQ+ people, who might not have been able to legally marry their partner, the assets they had built together were not protected once their partner had died.\n\nThe older groups that I work with grew up in a time when who they are was pathologized. Until 1987, US health-care standards defined being homosexual as either a mental-health disorder or a sexual-orientation disturbance.\n\nChampioning queer scientists of colour: ‘I don’t think we’ve scratched the surface on systemic exclusion’\n\nAnd there’s still discrimination around health care. I’ve gone to the doctor about shoulder pain, and for some reason they asked about my sexual orientation. I shared that I was gay, and then they asked whether they could test me for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). I asked: “Do STDs cause shoulder pain? Because I think I hurt something lifting.”\n\nIf you’re transgender, you might see a doctor about a cough, and they’ll want to examine your genitalia. Or you have a medical encounter in which you’re misgendered, and they’re using a name that you don’t use — and that brings up shame.\n\nYou go in and, because of who you are, they automatically blame you for the health problems that you’re facing.

          "title": "Cuts to US science will take a generation to repair — leaders must speak up now",
          "authors": "Michael S. Lubell",
          "abstract": "Over my decades as a professor of physics, I have encouraged myriad students to consider pursuing a science career, something that I have found immensely rewarding, intellectually and even spiritually — if not so much financially. I can no longer do so in good conscience, however; at least, not in the United States, amid the quick-fire anti-science policies of the administration of US President Donald Trump, and at a time when an unelected billionaire, Elon Musk, is eviscerating staffing at key science agencies.\n\nHow the United States became a science superpower — and how quickly it could crumble\n\nThese actions will inevitably cause harm to the future of health care, economic growth and national security. But there is another concern: the long-term damage they will do to the US scientific workforce. During the 22 years I served as director of public affairs at the American Physical Society in Washington DC, I relied on a well-worn political maxim: connect policies to people if you want elected officials to pay attention. Rather than stressing that research cuts lead to less innovation, emphasize that, once hollowed out, a scientific workforce can take a generation to rebuild.\n\nThe United States had a taste of such a gap during the Vietnam War. At the time, academic scientists found themselves caught in the crosshairs of zealous anti-war activists who, despite scant evidence, accused them broadly of collaborating on weapons research in support of the war. In 1970, the situation reached a violent crescendo with the death of Robert Fassnacht, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was working in a building that was bombed by anti-war protesters.\n\nIn response to the growing violence and inflammatory rhetoric, Michael Mansfield, an anti-war Democratic senator, aimed to sever ties between academia and the war machine. But his 1969 amendment ironically left intact what little applied military research existed on university campuses and shut down all non-military basic research that had been supported by the Department of Defense since the end of the Second World War. The ensuing disruption was extreme, especially in the physical sciences.\n\nDon’t wait out four hard years: speak truth to power\n\nAlthough the restrictions were lifted the following year, the damage was done. Neither the Department of Defense nor the universities saw fit to restore a relationship that had lasted almost one-quarter of a century. The unexpected loss of funding forced projects to be wound down and non-tenured staff to be dismissed. At Yale University’s J.W. Gibbs Laboratory in New Haven, Connecticut, for example, where I had just completed my PhD research on spin-polarized electrons, the funding lost for just one atomic-physics programme was more than US$600,000 (equivalent to more than $5 million today). Numerous research programmes across the country were similarly affected.\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) stepped in to fill the depleted coffers, but it took the better part of a decade to restore funding stability. Newly minted PhD holders found the number of desirable job opportunities extremely limited. In 1971, a survey found that of the 3,000 physicists seeking employment the previous year, only 2,000 had been able to secure conventional positions(see go.nature.com/4k3i3ij). Among my Yale peers who received physics doctorates in 1969, about half left for careers in law, medicine and finance.\n\n‘Now is not the time for despair’ — how scientists can take a stand against political interference",

          "title": "Can Germany rein in its academic bullying problem?",
          "authors": "Virginia Gewin",
          "abstract": "At one of Germany’s top-funded universities, a high-profile biology researcher has bullied his large group of junior staff, targeting women and international students, for decades. In interviews with Nature’s careers team, 14 current and former laboratory members detail what they describe as endless demands for unrealistic levels of research productivity. If those demands aren’t met, they allege, he withholds letters of recommendation and approval of time off work. If displeased, he denies funding or sends disparaging e-mails to researchers’ potential employers. Verbal abuse is commonplace. Women report being warned not to get pregnant while a member of his lab.\n\nThe university is aware of his behaviour. Yet, no investigation has been conducted nor any sanctions imposed because the complainants requested anonymity, fearing retribution — anonymity that cannot be upheld in an investigation owing to German labour law. This, along with defamation and other laws in Germany, can make it difficult to report on these incidents or to impose sanctions against professors, most of whom are tenured civil servants.\n\nShrouded in secrecy: how science is harmed by the bullying and harassment rumour mill\n\nGermany is not the only country to have a problem with bullying in academia, but a combination of structural and legal powers that, in effect, protect tenured professors over early-career researchers, enables and emboldens abusers. “It’s considered culturally normal — this is just what science is like,” says Daniel Leising, a psychology researcher and professor at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany. Several people interviewed by Nature’s careers team, including Leising, use ‘king’ to describe professors, meaning they are untouchable. “There is far too much power in the hands of professors in the German system,” he says.\n\n“It’s not everybody,” stresses intervention psychologist Andrea Kübler, who is dean of the faculty of human sciences at the University of Würzburg, Germany, noting that those who abuse their power are by far the minority. But those who do so cause a lot of harm, she explains. Kübler is one of more than 100 members of the Network for Sustainable Research, a group formed in April 2024 to identify and advocate for structural reforms to protect junior scientists who don’t have permanent contracts.\n\nAlthough the details given by the 14 lab members relate to one professor’s case, the pattern of reported behaviour is similar across several cases that have made headlines in Germany in recent years. In 2023, a professor at the University of Göttingen, Germany, lost his job and pension when he was convicted of multiple physical assaults on a Vietnamese doctoral student and on two other female junior members of his group. His offences came to light in 2017, but it took six years and two trials before the university could remove his civil-servant status. In 2023, a German national newspaper reported that a university in western Germany took steps to prevent a female professor from supervising new PhD students after she insulted and exploited around a dozen students.\n\nLeising says that these and other press reports of abuse are crucial, supporting growing calls for structural reforms. Amid increased concern that academic abuse was rampant but under-reported, Leising and his colleagues were asked by the German Psychological Society in 2022 to write a report identifying the factors that give rise to academic power abuse in science in Germany.\n\nReleased in June 2023 (an updated English version was published in February this year)1, Leising’s report broadly defined unethical behaviour as encompassing bullying, sexual harassment, scientific misconduct, exploitation and corruption. The authors noted that the academic system in Germany is remarkably hierarchical, steeped in historical deference to professors and further entrenched with a lack of effective oversight. These conditions are particularly conducive to unethical behaviour, owing to the extreme power differential between professors and early-career researchers. This raises fear of retaliation in people who have experienced abuse. Internal complaint channels also tend to be understaffed and have little authority to impose sanctions, says the report.\n\nDaniel Leising co-authored a report exploring the factors that contribute to academic bullying in Germany.Credit: Daniel Leising\n\nLeising’s report and this article focus on universities, but other independent research institutions, including the Max Planck Institutes, are not immune to similar abuse complaints, as has been reported by news outlets, including Nature (see Nature 571, 14–15; 2019).\n\nIn Germany, a typical large academic research group is structured with a professor, who has lifelong tenure, at the top. The professor manages and supervises early-career researchers — from graduate and postdoctoral students to junior professors and research-group leaders, the latter being the most independent. It is the professor who assigns a graduate student’s final grade. Almost all doctoral candidates at universities are on short-term contracts, which are dependent on the professor for renewal and last, on average, less than three years. The average time, in 2023, to get a doctorate in Germany was 5.1 years. At the same time, 72% of junior research-group leaders were on fixed-term contracts.\n\nWhatever minimal oversight academic departments have, they rarely exercise it, says Leising. Kübler says: “The strong hierarchy is a problem. And there is no official way for people who suffer from power abuse to know they will receive some help.”\n\nStructural changes are being pursued, but these are modest. At the national level, scientists are lobbying to extend the length of contracts for early-career researchers to four years, which they consider to be the minimum length of time necessary to finish a PhD. And one German state, North Rhine-Westphalia, is attempting to prevent professors from being both a graduate supervisor and a grader. Furthermore, some university departments are restructuring to flatten power dynamics and create more permanent positions. Many countries also have problematic academic hierarchies and will be watching Germany’s progress.\n\nGrowing complaints\n\nAlthough there are no baseline data on the total number of people who have experienced academic power abuse, there are some interesting data points. The 2024 Berlin Science Survey2 found that around 23% of 2,748 respondents in Germany had experienced an abuse of power in the previous 24 months, and roughly 39% had observed it at least once. At the same time, the number of general enquiries has risen at the Ombuds Committee for Research Integrity, which serves all researchers who are affiliated with the German research system. “Our number of enquiries has increased continuously over the last years — from 87 in 2016 to 262 last year,” says Hjördis Czesnick, who heads the office of the committee. Her office doesn’t have any evidence that abuse or misconduct has increased over that time or that it was less in the past; it assumes there is greater awareness that the office exists, says Czesnick.\n\nUnderpaid and overworked: researchers abroad fall prey to bullying\n\nIn 2021, Jana Lasser, a computational social scientist now at the University of Graz in Austria, co-founded the Network Against Abuse of Power in Science to document cases of academic abuse and support those who have experienced it in Germany. Since then, the network has reviewed roughly 120 cases. Lasser says that the complaints are often similar to those found by Nature for this article, including extortion of labour in exchange for contract renewals, supervisors refusing to let students graduate and bullying and misogynistic behaviour.\n\nSusanne Menzel-Riedl, president of Osnabrück University, Germany, and vice-president of the German Rectors’ Conference, an association of roughly 270 higher-education institutions, sees the reporting of complaints as a positive sign. “The more complaints we see, the better. It points to a process that is open about the problem. This is a sign of quality and not of weakness,” she says. The German Rectors’ Conference has made addressing the abuse of academic power a priority. “Decades ago, it was impossible to talk about,” Menzel-Riedl says.\n\nLeising contends that harassment of all types is widely under-reported. He co-authored a study3 that surveyed thousands of students and employees at Germany’s Technical University of Dresden; only 14% of respondents who identified as targets of physical sexual harassment said that they filed a complaint afterwards. “The biggest problem that we have is the level of fear among victims and witnesses of misconduct,” he says. “Fear of being retaliated against, fear of career sabotage, fear of being ostracized. And all of this fear is justified.”\n\nLeising points out that power-abuse behaviours — including lying, cheating and predation — can be characteristics of ‘functional psychopaths’. “But in German academia, they may find particularly fertile soil to act on their impulses without ever being called out for it, or punished,” says Leising. In fact, he adds, some of them are cheered on by the institutional leadership. The term functional academic psychopath was first outlined in a 2018 study4, which determined that, without strong institutional constraints on such people, bullying behaviours will prevail.\n\n“It is a threat to the integrity of research,” Lasser says. “People are under so much pressure, it creates sloppy science in the best cases, and outright data falsification in the worst case.”\n\nOne of the biggest challenges, says Lasser, is that her network can’t do anything more than provide support and help the people who experience abuse to contact the appropriate university grievance channels. “I see people running from one organization to the next, not getting help,” she says.\n\nComputational scientist Jana Lasser co-founded a watchdog and support network for scientists who have experienced academic power abuse.Credit: Timotheus Hell\n\nThe Ombuds Committee for Research Integrity, for example, can address complaints only if they are specifically related to research, such as authorship disputes. It can’t address those involving racism, discrimination or sexual abuse. “We don’t have investigative power,” says Czesnick. In such cases, the committee can forward complaints to the institution and suggest an investigation, but “has no legal mandate to request an investigation or to sanction misconduct”, she explains. Moreover, there is no incentive for universities to address complaints of power abuse because public cases can jeopardize their reputations — and potentially affect external funding, says Kübler.\n\nMenzel-Riedl says that the aim of the German Rectors’ Conference is to make sure its complaint process is easily identified by Germany’s 700,000 early-career researchers. If a PhD student wants to complain, the first step is to seek advice, a process that can be anonymous, she explains. However, “if the person decides to issue a formal complaint, they will have to reveal their name, according to labour laws in Germany,” adds Menzel-Riedl.\n\nLasser is concerned that factors such as issues of power abuse and the precarity of PhD contracts that are shorter than three years could make Germany less attractive to top students. “I’ve seen PhD students turn down offers because they figured out the job was in a toxic environment,” says Lasser.\n\n‘I am Hanna’\n\nPerennial discontent about short-term contracts was exacerbated by a video released by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in 2020. It featured a fictional character called Hanna who defends Germany’s 12-year limit on the time an early-career researcher can be employed on short-term contracts, which includes 6 years pre-PhD and 6 years post-PhD, as a way to encourage universities to offer more tenured positions. But without the addition of such positions, the system results in the subsequent loss of highly qualified academics. In response, Amrei Bahr, a junior professor in the philosophy of technology, who is on a contract at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and her colleagues launched #IchbinHanna (#IamHanna) on Twitter, now called X, which led to thousands of scholars tweeting their stories about the precarity of short-term contracts.\n\n“We really need to take a look at how the system enables abuse — it does so by those fixed-term contracts,” which can make researchers accept toxic working conditions, says Bahr. “If you are a funding king, you can do almost anything,” she says. Kübler agrees. The universities would suffer without the external funding brought in by these senior researchers, she says.\n\nAmrei Bahr advocates for changes that would put junior researchers at less risk of bullying.",

          "abstract": "A US executive order has suspended federal funding for gain-of-function experiments, which are carried out in biosafety laboratories.Credit: Master Sgt. Brian Ferguson/USAF via Alamy\n\nUS President Donald Trump has issued an executive order suspending all federal funding for ‘gain of function’ research that his administration considers dangerous. But some scientists say the order is so broad that low-risk research will also be affected.\n\nThe funding suspension will be in place for the next four months, during which time the government says it will revise an incoming policy on how federal funding agencies and institutions oversee gain-of-function experiments on pathogens that have the potential to spark a pandemic. That policy, which was years in the making and set to broaden oversight of such experiments, was due to come into effect this week.\n\nThe executive order, signed on 5 May, defines dangerous gain-of-function research as studies on infectious pathogens or toxins that have the potential to make them more deadly or transmissible. That includes work that gives pathogens the ability to evade vaccines, therapeutic agents and detection attempts, among other things.\n\n“This is what I was expecting — an executive order banning gain-of-function research but defined in such a way that it bans all virology research,” says Gigi Gronvall, a biosecurity specialist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nModifying pathogens such as viruses inside a secure laboratory facility can help researchers to understand the risks the pathogens pose to society and develop vaccines and drugs against them. The work sometimes involves making pathogens more dangerous or transmissible in people. Some worry about the risk of pathogens accidentally escaping from a laboratory or being weaponized.\n\nResearchers are often unable to predict whether their changes will make a virus more pathogenic or transmissible in people, so they might now have to avoid doing such work altogether, says Gronvall.\n\nSam Wilson, a molecular virologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, worries that even low-risk studies that could benefit public health will now fall under the US government’s definition of dangerous gain-of-function research.\n\nInstitutions that violate the terms of the order could be banned from receiving federal funding for up to five years. This financial penalty will make them reluctant to support infectious-disease research more broadly and “fearful of routine experiments”, says Wilson.\n\nBut some researchers have welcomed the executive order, which could result in even stricter rules around risky research.\n\nThe technology available today means that gain-of-function experiments have the potential to spark the next pandemic, says Raina MacIntyre, an infectious-diseases epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. “This executive order is a welcome new direction in mitigating that risk.”\n\nThe order comes at a time when many researchers in the field are already facing the prospect of huge budget cuts and grant cancellations.\n\nCOVID origin\n\nThe executive order also bans federal funding for dangerous gain-of-function research in China, Iran and other “countries of concern”. And it halts funding for life-sciences research that could pose a threat to public health in countries that do not have adequate oversight of this work. All recipients of federal grants in the life sciences will need to comply with the order, including confirming that they do not collaborate with foreign countries on relevant research.\n\n“It is implicitly clear where the executive order is coming from: the COVID-origins debate,” says Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity researcher at King’s College London.\n\nA fact sheet published by the White House about the executive order specifically states that the measures are designed to reduce the possibility of lab-related incidents emerging from gain-of-function research, “like that conducted on bat coronaviruses in China by the EcoHealth Alliance and Wuhan Institute of Virology”. It notes that Trump supports the theory that the COVID-19 pandemic originated from the institute in Wuhan.",

But for the beetles and flies that pollinate the plant, the noxious perfume of rotting meat is an irresistible draw.\n\nNow, a sweeping study of smelly plants has revealed how skunk cabbage and several other plants concoct their malodorous aromas. The results, published today in Science1, also show that blooms that reek of faeces, rotting meat and other things that humans find off-putting are surprisingly popular in the plant kingdom. Species in one plant genus evolved the ability to make such smells repeatedly in less than 7 million years — the blink of an eye in evolutionary terms.\n\nThe study also highlights how much more there is to learn about smelly plants, says Robert Raguso, a chemical ecologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who was not involved in the study. “One recent realization has been that stinky flowers are more complicated than we thought they were,” he says. “There is still a lot of discovery to be made.”\n\nFollow your nose\n\nThe project began when Yudai Okuyama, a biologist at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tsukuba, Japan, launched a survey of one of the most diverse plant groups in Japan: the genus Asarum. He and his team wanted to learn more about how the drive to court different pollinators might have influenced this diversity.\n\nUnpicking the link between smell and memories\n\nDuring his survey, Okuyama noticed that some Asarum species emit the odour of rotting meat. He and his colleagues decided to harness Asarum’s diversity to learn more about how plants produce these stinky compounds. They catalogued the volatile chemicals made by the flowers of 53 Asarum species and then looked for differences in gene and enzyme activity between stinky and non-stinky Asarum species.\n\nThe approach pinpointed a class of enzymes called disulfide synthases, which convert certain sulfur-containing molecules into compounds responsible for the flowers’ stench. Okuyama and his colleagues found that similar enzymes had evolved independently in two other plant genera, Symplocarpus and Eurya.

Its 3D structure has now been revealed.Credit: Iparraguirre Recio/Getty\n\nSugar has long seduced the human palate — and wreaked havoc on public health. Now, researchers have taken a decisive step towards understanding how.\n\nA team at Columbia University in New York City has, for the first time, mapped the molecular structure of the human sweet taste receptor and shown how two of the most widely consumed artificial sweeteners bind to the receptor and activate it. The discovery, reported today in Cell1, offers a detailed look at how our tongues perceive sweetness, and could pave the way for more health-conscious fizzy drinks, chewing gums and other confections.\n\n“This single receptor is responsible for our insatiable, never-ending attraction to sugar,” says Columbia neuroscientist Charles Zuker, who led the study. “And now that we have this structure, perhaps we can find ways to modulate its function.” For example, compounds that target the receptor could alter how natural sugars are sensed by taste buds on the tongue.\n\nA spoonful of structure\n\nFrom ripe fruit to saccharine-laden yogurt, foods containing either sugars or their substitutes turn on the sweet taste receptor, triggering a signalling cascade that the brain regards as a sign of energy-rich rewards.\n\nZuker and his colleagues first identified2 the receptor in 2001, showing that it is a molecular complex made of two proteins, TAS1R2 and TAS1R3. One latches on to the sweet molecule, and the other provides structural support.\n\nA spoonful of sugar could be the medicine\n\nYet, despite more than 20 years of study, the sweet receptor’s precise architecture remained elusive, even as scientists deciphered the structures of other taste receptors, such as the one for bitterness.\n\nNow Zuker’s team has finally cracked the structure. The researchers stabilized the fragile protein complex in its active conformation, a crucial prerequisite step for high-resolution imaging. Using cryo-electron microscopy, they then captured atomic-level snapshots of the receptor bound to two synthetic sweeteners: sucralose (sold commercially as Splenda) and aspartame (found in NutraSweet). Both bind more tightly to the receptor than natural sugar does, helping to fix the receptor in place for the authors’ structural analysis.\n\nSweet spot\n\nThe images revealed that the TAS1R2 subunit has a pocket that either sucralose or aspartame can occupy. Each binds to it slightly differently, however, hinting at a flexible mechanism that allows the receptor to recognize a wide range of sweet-tasting compounds. The TAS1R3 subunit, meanwhile — although not involved in binding of the sweet molecules — has a crucial supporting role by helping to assemble and stabilize the receptor complex.\n\nCommon sweetener suppresses mouse immune system — in high doses\n\n“This really begins to clarify just how this receptor works,” says Kyle Palmer, a pharmacologist who co-founded and leads scientific operations at Opertech Bio, a taste-assessment company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",

The future preoccupied me. Would history remember me as the leader who handled first contact — or the fool who got us all killed?\n\n*****\n\nDays passed with no change.

My orders to the Hai Hu were to avoid beaming anything at it lest it be misinterpreted.\n\nIn the situation room, we watched Leviathan’s rendezvous with the gas giant. Ndiaye’s video streamed live, albeit with a 40-minute delay. “Mr Chairman,” she said, her voice tense, “this thing is massive.

          "abstract": "China’s efforts to redefine how scientific merit is measured are the subject of fierce debate. At the heart is a contradiction: Chinese institutions encourage researchers to follow global scientific norms, but they measure performance against locally defined priorities. Many scientists, especially those at early career stages, find it hard to navigate this system with its conflicting incentives.\n\nScience’s big problem is a loss of influence, not a loss of trust\n\nIn March, for example, the National Science Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) updated its journal-ranking system — which complements other standards such as impact factors and Clarivate’s Journal Citation Reports. Using article citations, its database is re-evaluated each year with a complex algorithm. Journals might move up or down the tiers. However, in 2025, some elevations of domestic titles over prominent international ones caught scholars’ attention. For example, CAS’s Chinese Physics Letters moved to tier 1, whereas the American Chemical Society’s Nano Letters (a global leading title in nanoscience) dropped to tier 2 (see go.nature.com/4atq2xx). Critics attribute such changes to opaque metrics and disciplinary reclassifications — for example, materials science can be classed as engineering or as physics.\n\nSuch assessments are well intentioned, but can have unintended consequences. For example, the CAS library states that its system, which is designed to assess journals’ scholarly impact and to inform institutional research-management strategies, should not be applied to evaluations of individual researchers. Yet evidence suggests that scholars in China choose where to publish to align with this ranking. For example, between 2015 and 2019, journals that were downgraded in the CAS list saw a 14.8% decline in articles by authors in China1. Scholars at less-prestigious institutions were more likely to do so to ensure that their career progressed than were those at more-prestigious ones.\n\nMeasuring societal impact: how to go beyond standard publication metrics\n\nAnecdotally, colleagues have told me that work they published in prominent overseas journals received less attention in promotion reviews than did studies published in local ones. Some researchers refer to submissions to certain domestic journals as ‘academic tribute’ — not out of disrespect but because of frustration with the current evaluation frameworks.\n\nIf these trends continue, concerns might arise over researchers’ ability to connect globally. That might further dissuade top researchers from coming to China to pursue self-directed innovative work. For example, one 2023 study found that 89% of expatriate top-tier scholars who received offers through China’s Thousand Talents programme decided to continue their careers abroad2. Three measures could help stakeholders to realign incentives with scientific universality while respecting national contexts.",

But differences in proton number between the elements (82 for lead and 79 for gold) made that impossible by chemical means.\n\nCERN researchers achieved the feat by aiming beams of lead at each other, travelling at close to the speed of light. The ions occasionally glance past each other, rather than hitting head on. When this happens, the intense electromagnetic field around an ion can create a pulse of energy in the form of photons that trigger an oncoming lead nucleus to eject three protons — turning it into a gold nucleus.\n\nThe LHC’s ALICE experiment filtered out data on these instances of transmutation from the wider collision debris. In an analysis published on 7 May in Physical Review C1, the team calculated that between 2015 and 2018, collisions at the LHC created 86 billion gold nuclei — around 29 trillionths of a gram. Most of the unstable, fast-moving gold atoms would have existed for around 1 microsecond before smashing into experimental apparatus or breaking apart into other particles.\n\nThe ALICE detector at CERN.Credit: Maximillien Brice/CERN",

          "abstract": "Google’s medical chatbot can use patient information and photos to pinpoint the cause of a rash. Credit: Adapted from Getty\n\nAn upgraded version of Google’s medical chatbot can use smartphone photos to diagnose rashes and can evaluate a host of other types of medical imagery — improving the bot’s ability to pinpoint the cause of ailments.\n\nAn earlier version of the artificial-intelligence (AI) system outperformed physicians in diagnostic accuracy and bedside manner. The upgrade also did better than human doctors at interpreting images such as electrocardiograms and PDFs of laboratory results.\n\nThe latest version of the system, which is called the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) and is still purely experimental, was described in a paper1 posted to the arXiv preprint server on 6 May. It has not yet been peer reviewed. The development of systems that integrate images and clinical information “brings us closer to an AI assistant that mirrors how a clinician actually thinks”, says Eleni Linos, director of the Stanford University Center for Digital Health in California, who was not involved in the research.\n\nHealth-care simulation\n\nTo test AMIE’s new capabilities, 25 actors playing patients had virtual consultations with the chatbot and a human primary-care physician. The actors simulated 105 medical scenarios involving a range of symptoms and medical histories. They also presented relevant medical images.\n\nAfter each consultation, both AMIE and the human doctor suggested a diagnosis and a treatment plan. A team of 18 specialists in dermatology, cardiology and internal medicine evaluated the performances of the chatbot and the human doctors by analysing transcripts of the visits and the post-visit reports.\n\nThey found that, in general, AMIE achieved greater accuracy in its diagnoses than did the human doctors. Furthermore, its accuracy was less affected by problems such as low-quality images.\n\nMedical school for an AI doctor\n\nThe updated version of the chatbot is based on Google’s large language model (LLM) Gemini 2.0 Flash, which can process images. The researchers adapted it for medical purposes, by adding an algorithm to improve the LLM’s ability to conduct diagnostic conversations and clinical reasoning.\n\nTo confirm that the resulting system was indeed superior to the unaltered version of Gemini 2.0, researchers commanded the model to simulate patient–physician dialogues, in which the model plays the parts of a patient, a physician and a third party that evaluates conversations between the other two. “This way, you can sort of imbue it with the right, desirable behaviours when conducting a diagnostic conversation,” says Ryutaro Tanno, a scientist at Google DeepMind in London and a co-author of the study.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Tsang",
          "abstract": "Credit: MirageC / Getty\n\nIt can happen so easily. You’re excited about an experiment, so you sneak an early peek at the data to see if the P value — a measure of statistical significance — has dipped below the threshold of 0.05. Or maybe you’ve tried analysing your results in several different ways, hoping one will give you that significant finding. These temptations are common, especially in the cut-throat world of publish-or-perish academia. But giving in to them can lead to what scientists call P hacking.\n\nP hacking is the practice of tweaking the analysis or data to get a statistically significant result. In other words, you’re fishing for a desirable outcome and reporting only the catches, while ignoring all the times you came up empty. It might get you a publication in the short term, but P hacking contributes to the reproducibility and replicability crisis in science by filling the literature with dubious or unfounded conclusions.\n\nMost researchers don’t set out to cheat, but they could unknowingly make choices that push them towards a significant result. Here are five ways P hacking can slip into your research.\n\nEnding the experiment too early\n\nYou might plan to gather 30 samples but find yourself running a quick analysis halfway through, just to see where things stand. If you notice a statistically significant difference after 15 samples, you might be inclined to stop the experiment early — after all, you’ve found what you were looking for.\n\nIt’s time to talk about ditching statistical significance\n\nBut stopping an experiment once you find a significant effect but before you reach your predetermined sample size is classic P hacking. It’s like declaring the winner of an election after polling just half the electorate: the result might not be representative of reality. What’s the solution? Decide on the sample size or data-collection process ahead of time and stick to it, no matter how eager you are to see the results.\n\nRunning experiments until you get a hit\n\nAnother often-unintentional form of P hacking is repeating the experiment or analysis until you obtain a statistically significant result. Imagine you run an experiment and the outcome is insignificant. You try again with a new batch of samples — still nothing. You repeat the study once more, and voila! P < 0.05. Success? Not quite. If you selectively report only the attempt that ‘worked’ and ignore those that didn’t, you’re engaging in P hacking by omission. As any gambler knows, if you roll the dice often enough, eventually you’ll get the result you want by chance alone (not that I’m a gambler). The better approach is to report all the experimental replicates, including those that didn’t work.\n\nCherry-picking your results\n\nA less benign form of P hacking is selective reporting. Imagine you measure several outcomes or observe your effect at multiple time points — for instance, testing a therapy’s impact on recipients’ blood pressure, cholesterol, weight and blood sugar regularly over an entire month. After analysing the data, you find that only one outcome — say, blood sugar at week 3 — showed a significant improvement. You might be tempted to highlight this one promising result and downplay the rest, or even omit them from your report. This is cherry-picking: by showing only the favourable data and ignoring everything else, you create a biased narrative.\n\nIn this example, people might think the therapy worked because it lowered blood sugar at week 3, even though the overall data are not so rosy. Putting these data into the paper’s supplementary material and continuing with the experiment on the basis of this one finding is also a no-no. You should report all relevant results, not just the ones that support the hypothesis. Science progresses faster when we know what doesn’t work, as well as what does.\n\nTweaking your data\n\nIn data analysis, you often have to make judgements about what to include, what to exclude and how to report the data. P hacking can sneak in when those decisions are guided by the desire to achieve significance rather than by scientific reasoning. For example, you might notice an outlier in your data set. Including it in the analysis gives you a P value of 0.08, whereas excluding it brings P down to 0.03. Problem solved? Not quite.\n\nIn these cases, it is best practice to go back to the original data or laboratory notes to determine whether experimental conditions could explain this outlier. Perhaps you pipetted double the amount of reagent into your sample, or construction work nearby during the time you were testing that animal affected its behaviour. Researchers can often rationalize their data-filtration decisions, and most of those decisions are warranted. But if the real motive is to turn an insignificant result into a significant one, it crosses into questionable territory. The key is to decide on data-filtering rules before looking at the results. If, for some reason, you have to make a change after data collection, explain that — and say why.",

Democrats on the US House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology (CSST) say that the e-mails also contradict statements that EPA representatives provided to them this week.\n\n‘Targeted and belittled’: scientists at US environmental agency speak out as layoffs begin\n\nSent on 7 May, one of the e-mails, which was first reported by E&E News, says that funding for research laboratories has been cut off except for requests related to health and safety. “ORD is shutting down their laboratory activities,” wrote Wayne Cascio, head of the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, an ORD lab in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. “We are unsure if these laboratory activities will continue post-reorganization”, he told his staff members in the e-mail, which he co-signed with the centre’s deputy director Kay Holt.\n\nThis e-mail follows an announcement by Trump-appointed EPA director Lee Zeldin on 2 May that he plans to reorganize the agency and integrate “scientific staff directly into our program offices” instead of them being siloed in the ORD, “which will better ensure that research directly advances statutory obligations and mission-essential functions”. The ORD carries out research in support of environmental laws and regulations, such as assessing the safety of chemicals in drinking water. The division has long been a target of Trump and his Republican allies who question its science and say it oversteps its authority.\n\nEPA representatives met with CSST staff members to discuss the ORD’s reorganization on the same day that Cascio’s e-mail was sent. “EPA explicitly told Science Committee staff … that there wouldn’t be any ‘monumental changes’ to ORD labs,” Zoe Lofgren, a member of the House of Representatives from California and the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in a statement to Nature. “Shutting down ORD laboratories, which are required by law, is as wrongheaded, unlawful, and stupid as it gets,” Lofgren added.\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\n\nIn a statement to Nature, EPA spokespeople said that the leaked e-mail is “factually inaccurate” and that the ORD is not part of the reorganization announced on 2 May. “At ORD and throughout the agency, EPA is continuing research to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment,” they said.\n\nMultiple sources across the ORD, however, told Nature that forward-looking research has already been shut down. A second e-mail seen by Nature, dated 8 May and sent by Timothy Watkins, the ORD’s deputy assistant administrator for management, confirms as much. In the e-mail, which went out to all ORD staff members, Watkins says that all funding requests “should have short time horizons (two to three months) and/or should focus [sic] safety/health and facilities.”\n\n“They have basically shut ORD down by cutting off the money,” says Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, who served as principal deputy assistant administrator at the ORD during Trump’s first presidency, and who is familiar with the situation inside the agency. The internal EPA e-mails come less than a week after the Trump administration released its budget proposal for the fiscal year 2026, which called for a 55% reduction in funding for the EPA and a 46% cut to the ORD.\n\nThese figures are not final — the US Congress decides how much money to ultimately appropriate. But the news of halted funding at ORD labs plays into fears among some government scientists and science-policy specialists that the Trump team is planning to make big cuts to science spending yet this year rather than wait for Congress to debate the 2026 request.\n\nReapply or resign\n\nAs part of the 2 May reorganization announcement, the nearly 1,500 people in the ORD — mostly scientists and engineers — have been given until midnight tonight to either apply for a new job within the EPA or take one of two deals that incentivize resignation: an early retirement for those eligible, or a package that provides months of free salary and benefits before termination. Thus far, fewer than 500 new jobs have been posted at the agency, with little to no detail about what the new positions entail.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Over the past several weeks, hundreds of meeting abstracts have quietly vanished from the websites of research conferences organized by the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas — a NASA-funded research institution that maintains key archives and information about US planetary science. The abstracts have a common theme: diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). These topics were banned from receiving government funding by a 20 January executive order from US President Donald Trump, who called them “illegal and immoral discrimination programs”. The LPI did not seek permission from the abstract authors to remove the material.\n\nNASA embraced diversity. Trump’s DEI purge is hitting space scientists hard\n\nMany researchers are fuming about the deletions from the archives of a research institute that is managed independently from the federal government. “This is just egregious censorship of science,” says Ingrid Daubar, a planetary scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who co-authored several of the deleted abstracts.\n\nMany of the abstracts are pages-long developments of preliminary ideas that are important to the planetary-science literature. Their removals are an “Orwellian rewriting of history”, says a researcher who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation. Mark Sykes, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, called the decision “a profound ethical failure”.\n\nIndependent organization\n\nSeveral scientists told Nature that they think the LPI and its parent organization, the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) in Washington DC, have over-interpreted the Trump executive order as retroactively applying to independently performed work in public archives.\n\nIn a statement provided to Nature, the USRA said it “believes that compliance with Administration directives requires DEI content to be out of public view”, unless it is “advised by an authoritative federal body that we can restore that content”.\n\nHave Trump’s anti-DEI orders hit private funders? HHMI halts inclusive science programme\n\n“Waiting for some ‘authoritative federal body’ to tell them to undo the harm they’ve done is just deflecting accountability,” Daubar says. NASA declined to comment, on the basis that it does not run the websites.\n\nA group of researchers is now leading a data-rescue effort to locate and rehouse the deleted material on a privately run website.\n\nMany federal agencies, including NASA, have removed DEI-related content from their websites in response to the executive order. But the LPI is not a government institution; it was set up in 1968, during the Apollo era, primarily to foster relationships between university scientists and NASA. For decades, it has organized planetary-science conferences, trained researchers and maintained documents and databases on topics such as lunar impact craters.\n\nThe missing meeting abstracts include research on workforce issues, such as how to build the most effective team of scientists for a mission. One of Daubar’s deleted abstracts described a programme to involve early-career scientists in NASA’s InSight mission to Mars. David Trang, a planetary scientist at the Space Science Institute who is based in Honolulu, Hawaii, had his work on improving mental health among planetary scientists deleted. Removing these abstracts “takes away our culture”, he says. “That’s the saddest part.”",

          "abstract": "Chief business officers wear many hats, says Filippo Mulinacci.Credit: Getty\n\nFilippo Mulinacci joined Araris Biotech in 2022 as its chief business officer. In March, the oncology company, based in Zurich, Switzerland, was acquired by Taiho Pharma, based in Tokyo, as part of a deal worth up to US$1.14 billion.\n\nMulinacci’s corporate career started after he completed a master’s degree in chemistry at the University of Turin, Italy, in 2002. He then pursued a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, followed by a master’s in business administration (MBA) at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.\n\nHe recounts his role in helping to broker the Araris Biotech–Taiho Pharma deal, his corporate career path so far and the skills he has picked up along the way.\n\nTell us about your corporate career path, and why you chose it.\n\nMy first job after graduating with my MSc was as a research associate at the biotechnology company Serono, based first in Ivrea, close to Turin, Italy, and later in Geneva. Going straight into a biotech company, rather than continuing my studies, was a great career move and learning opportunity. The role expanded my scientific knowledge, enabling me to diversify from my original academic discipline of chemistry.\n\nAfter three years, I quit to pursue a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Geneva, turning my focus to proteins and protein formulation.\n\nImmediately after that, I earned an MBA at the University of St. Gallen. I felt I lacked experience in the strategic and corporate side of the pharma industry. My class was a mixture of people with engineering and economics backgrounds; there were very few science graduates.\n\nFor me, the key takeaways were gaining an understanding of business strategy, marketing, frameworks and finance, including accounting, corporate finance and valuation.\n\nAfter many years in the laboratory, Filippo Mulinacci pivoted to a role in the biopharmaceutical industry.Credit: Filippo Mulinacci\n\nI joined Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, as a global business-development and licensing associate right after finishing my MBA in 2011. Licensing, in the context of the biopharma industry, is when one party acquires the rights to a product or technology, often from the inventor, to develop, manufacture or market that product or technology.\n\nIt was a great entry-level position: I scouted for new partnering opportunities to expand the pipeline, or the drug candidates that a company has under development. I enjoyed working across several fields of therapies, and I developed experience in two that I am truly passionate about: biologics and oncology (cancer has affected members of my family).\n\nAfter two years, I started gaining experience on the transactions side, facilitating deals between big pharma and smaller companies. In this role, you need legal knowledge as well as soft skills, such as negotiation and networking, alongside your scientific knowledge. I learnt these skills on the job, thanks to extensive experience working with senior colleagues with mixed backgrounds, ranging from law to intellectual property (IP) to finance.\n\nAfter five years, I wanted a role at a smaller company — on the other side of the table, in other words.\n\nI joined Philogen in 2016 as its head of business development and licensing, based in Zurich.\n\nThat role enabled me to develop my deal-making skills in both the chemistry and the biologics fields, from the side of the licensor, or the ‘seller side’. Philogen is an ETH Zurich biotech spin-off firm with a proprietary chemistry platform — a technology that enables the discovery of new chemically synthesized drugs — and biologic products in the field of immuno-inflammation.\n\nGood deal-makers possess both technical skills and industry knowledge and can put themselves in the shoes of the other negotiating parties. I learnt these skills on the job, and I also attended external courses, including one at the Program on Negotiation at the Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nWhat does a head of business development and licensing do?\n\nA key part of the role involves scouting, search and evaluation, and networking: seeking out new products or assets, and evaluating their commercial and clinical potential.\n\nBecause Philogen was not focused on a single therapy area, platform or asset, this introduced complexities into the deal structure with regard to licensed rights, but also made the job more interesting.\n\nStructuring a deal requires an evaluation of the current and future value of the asset or platform for licensing to a potential partner.\n\nIn 2018, I joined Basilea Pharma, a Roche spin-off company based in Basel, as its oncology business development and licensing manager. I spent four years there before joining Araris Biotech as its chief business officer (CBO).\n\nWhat does a biotech CBO do?\n\nYou wear many hats. The first is to represent the company to the pharma industry. Most biotech firms developing new products need to attract external investors, and they also usually need big pharma support for phase III studies and to commercialize a new drug. In my role, I talk to potential partners and lead transactions with pharma companies. I address mainly the financial and legal aspects of the deals.\n\nAlso, most biotech companies have a data room. This is typically a virtual space for storing confidential data, and a CBO’s day-to-day activities include keeping all key financial and legal documentation held there updated, alongside presentations for investors and clinical and non-clinical data.\n\nIt is essential to maintain this type of documentation, especially when preparing to reach out to new investors. The role also entails general housekeeping of company documentation, so the firm can be ready to make a deal whenever an opportunity arises.\n\nThe CBO role also focuses on partnerships. The chief financial officer, by contrast, deals with investors, supporting the work of the chief executive.\n\nBut when needed, I do help out with, for example, due-diligence queries. In this context, that includes analysing IP and legal contracts or human-resources, tax or finance information related to a merger or acquisition.\n\nDo you miss anything about a more laboratory-based role in science?\n\nI don’t miss the bench work. I have learnt much more about applied science in the commercial field. Lab work is very focused on one project, whereas in licensing roles, you get a helicopter view of new technologies and therapies, and you can learn about the new frontiers of science.\n\nWhat is your advice to early-career researchers seeking a licensing role?\n\nA very common skill among the network of people I work with, whatever their background, is being able to put themselves in the shoes of the party they are negotiating with.",

          "abstract": "Although it might seem counter-intuitive, writing the middle and end of your thesis first can make the process easier, says Tuuli Toivonen.Credit: Oscar Wong/Getty\n\nPhD theses usually come in two forms. Standard monographs, a comprehensive dissertation written by a single author, continue to be used, but theses based on collections of published articles are becoming the norm in the natural sciences.\n\nFor monograph-style theses, the research process is relatively straightforward: you might first read extensively, then narrow down your ideas to what is relevant and interesting, formulate a focused research question or hypothesis based on the literature and then proceed with data collection, analysis and, finally, writing the dissertation.\n\nArticle-based theses consist of works published in scientific journals, written by a student during the course of their PhD training, alongside an introductory chapter that ties the articles together. The path to these theses might be winding, because each article has its own narrative, influenced by the journal and the co-authors. The introductory chapter, or synopsis, synthesizes the individual articles and presents a broader narrative tying the literature into the findings of the thesis. In simple terms, the synopsis aims to describe how the author’s contributions advance science. In some ways, it might be best thought of as a literature review fused with new results obtained over the course of a PhD.\n\nIn my own field, quantitative geography, article-based theses are most common. At the University of Helsinki, where I teach, a PhD student typically finalizes three or four first-author articles, at least half of which are accepted or published.\n\nCareers collection: Funding science\n\nMaking your claim\n\nHow, then, can a high-quality synopsis be written efficiently? This is where my approach might be useful.\n\nIn Finnish, a PhD defence is called väitös, which directly translates to ‘claim’ or ‘argument’. My early supervisor, the late geomorphologist Matti Seppälä, was known for his intelligence as well as his laser-sharp stare. He often asked students approaching their defence an intimidating question: “So, what’s your claim?”, referring to the single, clarified, fundamental message that a reader should take from those years of gruelling PhD work.\n\nWhen I was struggling to write my own synopsis in 2006, this question lingered in my mind. Ultimately, thinking about how to answer it helped me to shape my synopsis and guided me through the overall process. Since then, I have supervised a dozen students writing article-based PhD theses, and have often encouraged them answer Seppälä’s question to guide their thinking and writing when it’s time to wrap up their theses.\n\nI’ve found that the approach helps the student to identify the most important content and gain the broader perspective needed for the synopsis. On the basis of comments by the pre-examiners and reviewers, the students create a clear, logical and easy-to-read structure.\n\nThe approach might even help natural scientists who are writing a research paper. Focusing on key takeaways in the discussion, then writing the remainder of the paper from that point, is an effective way to write any paper.\n\nA recipe for a clear synopsis",

They found that the enzyme can break down a plastic that is commonly used in health care because of its biodegradable properties, called polycaprolactone (PCL).\n\nUntil now, the only enzymes shown to break down plastics were found in environmental bacteria, says study co-author Ronan McCarthy, who researches bacteria and bacterial infections at Brunel University in London. He says that finding the same ability in pathogens often present in hospitals could explain why these microbes persist in these environments. “If a pathogen can degrade plastic, then it could compromise plastic-containing medical devices such as sutures, implants, stents or wound dressings, which would obviously negatively impact patient prognosis,” he adds.\n\nEnzyme expression\n\nAs part of their study, McCarthy and his colleagues inserted the gene that codes for the enzyme into Escherichia coli bacteria. When they made the bacteria express the enzyme, they found that the microbes broke down the PCL in agar or beads. The strain of P. aeruginosa taken from the wound was also able to digest PCL agar and beads. And when the researchers created a mutant in which the gene that codes for the Pap1 enzyme was deleted from the P. aeruginosa, the bacterium was unable to degrade the plastic.\n\nThe team also found that the enzyme increased the amount of biofilm formed when P. aeruginosa was exposed to the plastic as compared with glass beads. When bacteria form high levels of biofilm, antibiotic resistance can increase, leading to difficult-to-treat infections. The team also conducted experiments in greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larvae and found that the bacterium was more harmful when a PCL implant was present than when the implant was absent. Additionally, moths infected with bacteria lacking the enzyme had similar survival rates regardless of whether a PCL implant was present or not.",

          "title": "How political attacks could crush the mRNA vaccine revolution",
          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "The day after Donald Trump moved back into the White House in January, he celebrated a US$500-billion private-sector investment in artificial intelligence (AI) with a high-profile announcement in the Roosevelt Room. The new president looked on as technology billionaire Larry Ellison highlighted one of the initiative’s most transformative goals: using messenger RNA vaccines to transform cancer treatments.\n\nBy harnessing AI to analyse tumour genetics, Ellison explained, researchers could rapidly design personalized vaccines tailored to an individual’s cancer. “This is the promise of AI and the promise of the future,” he said.\n\nAre the Trump team’s actions affecting your research? How to contact Nature\n\nBiotechnology executives were elated. Trump had, just five years earlier, propelled mRNA medicines into the spotlight through his signature effort to fast-track the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Now, just one day into his second term, he was once again elevating the technology to the national stage.\n\n“Then the bottom fell out,” says Deborah Day Barbara, co-founder of the Alliance for mRNA Medicines (AMM), a trade group representing more than 75 companies and academic institutions that are advancing mRNA research, development and manufacturing.\n\nA prominent vaccine critic who had vilified the mRNA-based COVID-19 jabs, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, was appointed to lead the country’s top health agency, and long-time champions of immunization science in the civil-service sector were shown the door. Research grants tied to HIV prevention and pandemic preparedness were abruptly cancelled, including many involving mRNA. And numerous other projects that were focused on mRNA vaccine technology were compiled into a list, potentially signalling their impending termination.\n\nAt the same time, legislators in several states have been pushing to ban or restrict the use of mRNA-based medicines for infectious diseases. None of these measures has become law, but the efforts threaten to destabilize the mRNA industry, creating uncertainty and potentially limiting patient access to emerging treatments.\n\nThe anti-mRNA sentiment — coupled with the sweeping shake-up of science funding across the United States — has sparked fears that this once-celebrated technology, widely seen as a major engine of next-generation vaccines and therapeutics, could soon find itself on the chopping block.\n\nFor AMM executive director Clay Alspach, a principal at Leavitt Partners, a health-care consulting firm in Washington DC, the message has been unmistakable: “This is an existential threat,” he says.\n\nBy mid-March, the AMM was holding regular conference calls to strategize. Members swapped intelligence, compared notes on delayed grants and tried to anticipate what might come next. Amid the uncertainty, a few questions loomed large: how far would the clampdown on mRNA go? Would it stop at COVID-19 jabs? Would it extend to all vaccines in development for influenza and other infectious threats? Or reach even into mRNA-based drug therapies in the works for cancer, autoimmune disorders, rare genetic diseases and more?\n\nFrom hero to zero\n\nFive years ago, the US government was spending billions of dollars to support the development, manufacturing and roll-out of mRNA vaccines, which played a major part in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmaceutical companies were pouring in capital and building ambitious pipelines centred on mRNA. The technology was feted with a Nobel prize. Investor confidence was sky-high.\n\nNow, in the span of just a few months, the mood across the industry has grown darker — chilled by a newly hostile political climate.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nOne contract manufacturer of mRNA products has seen a substantial decline in business as government-backed vaccine programmes have their funding pulled, according to a senior company executive. Another biotech executive says that his mRNA-focused company is considering relocating planned clinical trials for anti-viral vaccines to outside the United States — or scrapping them entirely, shifting the firm’s focus to less politically volatile therapeutic areas. “It’s all just a commercial and regulatory risk now,” he says.\n\nBoth executives requested anonymity to avoid drawing political attention to their companies — but their experiences reflect a broad upheaval that is now rippling through the industry. In a survey released this month by the AMM, nearly half of 106 senior biotech and pharma executives reported direct impacts from US policy shifts this year — including project downsizing, budget cuts, delayed investments, terminated partnerships, job losses, hiring freezes and planned relocation of operations overseas1 (see ‘An industry at risk’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nMuch of the current antipathy towards mRNA vaccines can be traced back to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the political and cultural backlash it left in its wake. Critics cite the compressed timelines and emergency use authorizations as signs that the safety of the vaccines was compromised. Vaccine mandates — imposed by governments, employers and schools — further fuelled resentment. Meanwhile, conspiracy theories about DNA alteration and population control continue to circulate widely online, deepening public mistrust and giving political traction to opposition against mRNA technology.\n\nWhat began as fringe scepticism has increasingly entered the mainstream consciousness, amplified by partisan media and political figures who frame the vaccines not as public-health tools but as symbols of government overreach. Among the most prominent of these is Kennedy, now secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), who has long questioned the safety of childhood immunizations and built his political brand on vaccine resistance. (HHS officials did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the White House pointed to a public statement that did not address the questions posed by Nature.)\n\nExclusive: NIH to terminate hundreds of active research grants\n\nThere are some conservative voices who are more supportive of mRNA technology — for example, a February report2 from the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, a public-policy organization in Austin, urges policymakers to recognize the technology’s broad potential in medicine and agriculture. But those views have been mostly drowned out by more extreme rhetoric.\n\nEven the term ‘mRNA’ has become a political lightning rod; its charged connotations now influence scientific discourse and health policy far beyond the vaccine debate. “That paranoia has gotten wrapped into mRNA as a word,” says Jeff Coller, an RNA biologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who is also involved in several small biotech firms.\n\nSeeking to reframe the narrative, Coller and others are mobilizing around a strategic communications offensive, emphasizing mRNA’s potential not just in thwarting infectious threats but also in treating many of the same chronic conditions targeted by Kennedy’s ‘Make America Healthy Again’ initiative. The campaign to rehabilitate mRNA’s reputation starts at the top: with appeals to Trump’s legacy as a champion of medical innovation.\n\nLegacy on the line\n\nAMM leaders are preparing to publish a series of editorials that make the case that Trump’s decisive leadership during Operation Warp Speed — the 2020 programme that delivered COVID-19 vaccines in record time — marked the beginning of a new chapter in biotechnology and positioned the United States at the forefront of what many see as the fourth great wave of pharmaceutical innovation, after small-molecule drugs, biologics and cell and gene therapies.\n\nFraming it as a chance for Trump to cement his place in medical history, they are urging the president to build on the foundation that he helped to lay. In particular, they pointed out that, by supporting mRNA-based cancer treatments, he could achieve a major unmet goal that was advanced by his predecessor Joe Biden, who had made “ending cancer as we know it” a signature priority. Trump “could be the president who is a true visionary on cancer”, says Coller, a leading academic voice at the AMM.\n\nPeople queue for COVID-19 vaccinations in Washington DC.Credit: Jim Watson/AFP via Getty\n\nSuch messaging just might resonate. Although Trump criticized the roll-out and mandates surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines in the period between his two terms, allies say he remains proud of the part he played in accelerating the technology’s development. “President Trump believes that Operation Warp Speed was a roaring success, and that the COVID mRNA vaccines were his great achievements,” says Robert Malone, a scientist involved in foundational mRNA research and a high-profile voice in conservative-leaning health-policy circles.\n\nBut leading the charge against mRNA technology are individuals in the ‘medical freedom movement’ — Kennedy chief among them. They contend that COVID-19 vaccines were rushed through approval without adequate long-term testing, alleging that safety corners were cut in the name of speed, and that the risks of mRNA platforms continue to be deliberately downplayed.\n\nAt his confirmation hearing earlier this year, for example, Kennedy — who previously described an mRNA-based COVID-19 jab as the “deadliest vaccine ever made” — persisted in claiming that the vaccine was recommended for young children “without any scientific basis”, despite published clinical-trial evidence3 to the contrary.\n\nPublic-health researchers and vaccine scientists emphasize that mRNA vaccines have consistently demonstrated robust safety and effectiveness in preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes, supported by extensive data from rigorous clinical trials and real-world studies. Yet, with trust in institutions and in the biomedical establishment crumbling, some argue that pulling back from mRNA is the only responsible course of action — not because the science is flawed, but because the damage to public confidence is too deep.\n\n“If mRNA has a chance to have impact in the future, there needs to be a restoration of public trust around it,” says David Mansdoerfer, a political consultant in Fort Worth, Texas, and a former senior HHS official in the first Trump administration. To that end, he, like many associated with Kennedy, would support federal regulators withdrawing approval for all COVID-19 vaccines that initially entered the market under emergency-use provisions — including the mRNA-based ones that later won full approval. Mansdoerfer advocates re-evaluating the jabs under a standard review process.\n\n‘The brand is damaged’\n\nThe problem of mRNA’s reputation isn’t just a communications challenge — it’s a systemic liability. “I fear the brand is damaged for most uses,” wrote Vinay Prasad, a haematologist–oncologist at the University of California, San Francisco, in a Substack post in March. A vocal critic of COVID-19 vaccine mandates under Biden, Prasad was selected this month to lead the division of the US Food and Drug Administration that oversees vaccines and other biological products.\n\nThe branding issue for mRNA is not just a problem in the United States either. An analysis of social-media data across 44 countries, published last year, found “widespread negative sentiment and a global lack of confidence in the safety, effectiveness and trustworthiness of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics”4.",

          "abstract": "“I am a conservation biologist at the Gorongosa National Park in central Mozambique, where I focus on bats and their social vocalizations. In this photo, I’m photographing a colony of fruit-eating bats (Eidolon helvum) that live in the Tunduru Botanic Garden in the capital, Maputo.\n\nAs we learn about the different types of vocalization, we can understand the phases of a bat’s life better and perhaps be able to conserve species with fewer interventions than now. For instance, there are vocalizations specific to the mating season, and some species have only one reproductive season over two or three months of the year. We can better quantify and recognize that time period if we focus on the sounds bats make.\n\nThere are a lot of unanswered questions. Do the male bats use vocalization to mark and defend their territory, for instance? During my master’s degree, I worked on two species: the Egyptian slit-faced bat (Nycteris thebaica) and Sundevall’s leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros caffer). For one of them, I was able to identify 11 distinct vocalizations, and for the other, I identified 6.\n\nOur basic equipment is a bat detector, which records the ultrasound calls emitted by bats. I use specialist software, including Kaleidoscope Pro and Raven Pro, to visualize these sounds in a sonogram, which graphs sound as a wave. (Kaleidoscope even has a bat mode.) We then use frequency, duration and other harmonic details to identify the vocalizations.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Jakub Pachocki has been OpenAI’s chief scientist since 2024.Credit: OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is best known for ChatGPT — the free-to-use, large language model-based chatbot that became a household name after its debut in 2022. The firm, in San Francisco, California, has since released a string of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ‘reasoning’ models that use step-by-step ‘thought’ processes to specialize in logical tasks.\n\nOpenAI’s ‘deep research’ tool: is it useful for scientists?\n\nThese tools have helped researchers to polish prose, write code, review the literature and even generate hypotheses. But, like other technology rivals, OpenAI has faced criticisms over the energy demands of its models and the way in which data are exploited for model training. And unlike some firms, OpenAI has almost exclusively released proprietary models that researchers can use, but can’t build on.\n\nJakub Pachocki has been the firm’s chief scientist since 2024. He joined OpenAI in 2017 from academia, where he was a theoretical computer scientist and competitive programmer. Now, he leads the development of the company’s most advanced AI systems, which are designed to tackle complex tasks in science, mathematics and coding.\n\nNature spoke to Pachocki about whether AI can generate original science, artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the firm’s upcoming open-weight model.\n\nScientists are increasingly using reasoning models. What role could these models have in five years?\n\nToday you can talk to a model, but it’s only an assistant that needs constant guidance. I expect this will be the primary thing that changes.\n\nWe already see that something like OpenAI’s Deep Research [a tool that can synthesize reams of information] is capable of working unsupervised for 10 or 20 minutes and producing something useful. But the amount of compute that's going into solving these queries is tiny.\n\nWhat are the best AI tools for research? Nature’s guide\n\nIf you have open research problems it is worth spending much more compute on that. I expect we will have AIs that actually are capable of novel research. We’ll see a lot of progress, for example, on autonomous software engineering and the autonomous design of hardware components, and similar applications in other disciplines.\n\nHow important has reinforcement learning — the iterative learning process based on trial, error and reward — been in creating OpenAI’s reasoning models?\n\nThe original ChatGPT releases involved an unsupervised pre-training stage, where the model just ingests a massive amount of data and builds a sort of ‘world model’. Out of that, we extract a useful assistant through a process of reinforcement learning, using human feedback.\n\nOne way you can view this latest progress on reasoning models is that it really increases the emphasis on the reinforcement-learning phase, so that we’re not only extracting something but also enabling the model to find its own way of thinking.\n\nHow much energy will AI really consume? The good, the bad and the unknown\n\nA question is whether we should continue to think of these stages of learning separately. Reasoning models don’t learn how to think in a vacuum, they are rooted in a model that has learned through pre-training. A lot of my focus is on thinking about that phase and combining the approaches and understanding their interaction.\n\nYou talk about the models ‘thinking’. Do models actually reason? Or do they approximate something that looks like reasoning?\n\nOne thing that we should be clear about is that the way the models work is different from how a human brain works. A pre-trained model has learned some things about the world, but it doesn’t really have any conception of how it learned them, or any temporal order as to when it learned things.",

We propose to use behavioural game theory to study LLMs’ cooperation and coordination behaviour. Here we let different LLMs play finitely repeated 2 × 2 games with each other, with human-like strategies, and actual human players. Our results show that LLMs perform particularly well at self-interested games such as the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma family. However, they behave suboptimally in games that require coordination, such as the Battle of the Sexes. We verify that these behavioural signatures are stable across robustness checks. We also show how GPT-4’s behaviour can be modulated by providing additional information about its opponent and by using a ‘social chain-of-thought’ strategy. This also leads to better scores and more successful coordination when interacting with human players. These results enrich our understanding of LLMs’ social behaviour and pave the way for a behavioural game theory for machines.",

In this genome-wide association study meta-analysis of age at onset of walking ( N = 70,560 European-ancestry infants), we identified 11 independent genome-wide significant loci. SNP-based heritability was 24.13% (95% confidence intervals = 21.86–26.40) with ~11,900 variants accounting for about 90% of it, suggesting high polygenicity. One of these loci, in gene RBL2 , co-localized with an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in the brain. Age at onset of walking (in months) was negatively genetically correlated with ADHD and body-mass index, and positively genetically correlated with brain gyrification in both infant and adult brains. The polygenic score showed out-of-sample prediction of 3–5.6%, confirmed as largely due to direct effects in sib-pair analyses, and was separately associated with volume of neonatal brain structures involved in motor control.

          "abstract": "Social touch is crucial for human well-being, as a lack of tactile interactions increases anxiety, loneliness, and need for social support. To address the detrimental effects of social isolation, we build on cutting-edge research on social touch and movement sonification to investigate whether social tactile gestures could be recognized through sounds, a sensory channel giving access to remote information. Four online experiments investigated participants’ perception of auditory stimuli that were recorded with our “audio-touch” sonification technique, which captures the sounds of touch. In the first experiment, participants correctly categorized sonified skin-on-skin tactile gestures (i.e., stroking, rubbing, tapping, hitting). In the second experiment, the audio-touch sample consisted of the sonification of six socio-emotional intentions conveyed through touch (i.e., anger, attention, fear, joy, love, sympathy). Participants categorized above chance the socio-emotional intentions of skin-on-skin touches converted into sounds and coherently rated their valence. In two additional experiments, the surface involved in the touches (either skin or plastic) was shown to influence participants’ recognition of sonified gestures and socio-emotional intentions. Thus, our research unveils that specific information about social touch (i.e., gesture, emotions, and surface) can be recognized through sounds, when they are obtained with our specific sonifying methodology. This shows significant promise for providing remote access, through the auditory channel, to meaningful social touch interactions.",

Jackson Women’s Health Organization moved status quo on abortion policy more into line with the Republican Party’s stance. Subsequent research has documented the decision’s impact on mass political behavior and opinion, yet less is known about its impact on the behavior of political elites. I provide evidence on congressional candidates’ strategic responses to the decision with original data on campaign platforms ( N = 4,703) from election cycles before and after Dobbs . After the decision, Democrats became significantly more likely to campaign on abortion and to do so using unambiguous language, while Republicans increasingly obfuscated their positions on the issue. Pre-post- Dobbs change in partisan divergence in campaign attention to abortion was driven most strongly by candidates in states with abortion bans set to take effect upon overturning of Roe (i.e., trigger laws and/or pre- Roe laws). Importantly, these shifting patterns of campaign attention were not present in other issue domains, consistent with changes in attention to abortion being driven by Dobbs rather than other contemporaneous factors.",

However, whether these strategies can durably reduce partisan animosity in a scalable manner and in everyday life remains unclear. We bridge the gap between prior research and useful application by assessing whether exposure to multiple, scalable treatments that portray inparty and outparty members interacting positively, receiving accurate information about one another’s views, and learning about cross-party similarities can a) durably shift partisans’ sentiments and b) influence partisans’ sentiments toward specific, personally known others encountered in everyday life—not only general, hypothetical, or one-off rival partisans. In a longitudinal survey experiment, we find that exposure to three brief, scalable treatments over a week reduces partisan animosity, with effects persisting for at least a month. Moreover, the treatments durably ameliorate animosity toward both general outparty members and a personally known outparty member, specified prior to the treatments.

          "abstract": "While most people believe that women (vs. men) experience more discriminatory treatment at work, especially in male-dominated professions, relatively few women report experiencing such treatment themselves. These low levels of reporting may arise either because discriminatory treatment has declined, even while laypeople’s assumptions of widespread discrimination persist, or because it is difficult for individuals to know when they are experiencing discriminatory treatment, leading to underreporting. In investigating this puzzle, we theorized four types of nonsexual workplace experiences that may target women and accumulate to harm well-being, yet may be difficult to recognize as discrimination. To test our predictions, we conducted a longitudinal, multisite experience-sampling study of surgeons, capturing workplace experiences over 5 mo. This approach addresses methodological limitations of past research, which include recall biases, demand characteristics, and low external validity. Consistent with hypotheses, female (vs. male) surgeons had more experiences in which their role was challenged or their authority questioned. Moreover, the frequency and severity of these experiences predicted increased burnout over time and decreased intentions to persist in surgery, regardless of whether participants attributed their experiences to their gender. Contrary to hypotheses, female surgeons did not encounter more presumptions of their helpfulness. Female surgeons also received more positive feedback, especially from other women, which yielded increases in professional efficacy and intentions to persist in surgery. Thus, while difficult to detect, workplace discriminatory treatment continues to harm women’s well-being and career opportunities, impede organizations’ efforts to recruit and retain women professionals, and exacerbate burnout among health care providers.",

These leaves feature transversely curved lanceolate macrostructures decorated by a layer of microtrichomes with varied morphologies. The macrostructure creates a lanceolate effect in the transport direction for fundamental navigation. At the same time, the microtrichomes serve dual functions: constructing a self-wetting superhydrophilic surface to facilitate the water transport speed and implementing water spreading in the opposite direction for autonomous reallocation. We explain the multiscale transport behavior through theoretic analysis and finite element simulations. Our findings demonstrate how cross-scale topographies jointly function in efficient autonomous fluid manipulation, with potential applications such as droplet driving, fog harvesting, and seawater desalination, offering pathways for improving liquid processing efficiency and reducing energy consumption.",

          "abstract": "Diverse genetic strategies are being pursued to control mosquito-borne infectious diseases. These strategies often rely on the release of nonbiting males to either reduce the target mosquito population or render them resistant to pathogens. Male-only releases are important as any contaminating females can bite and potentially transmit pathogens. Despite significant efforts, it remains a major bottleneck to reliably and efficiently separate males from females, especially when nontransgenic males are preferred. In the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti , sex is determined by a pair of homomorphic sex chromosomes, with the dominant male-determining locus (the M locus) and its counterpart (the m locus) embedded in an M-bearing and an m-bearing chromosome 1, respectively. We utilized both naturally occurring and engineered sex-linked recessive lethal alleles (RLAs) to create sex separation strains for Ae. aegypti on the basis of differential elimination of marked sex chromosomes (DeMark). DeMark strains are self-sustaining and produce nontransgenic males that are readily separated from individuals carrying RLA- and transgene-marked m chromosomes. For example, the marked m chromosome in the heterozygous mother in some strains was only inherited by her female progeny due to RLA-mediated incompatibility with the M-bearing chromosome in the father, producing nontransgenic males and transgenic females, generation after generation. We further explore strategies to conditionally eliminate females that contain marked sex chromosomes. We also discuss DeMark designs that are applicable for efficient sex separation in organisms with well-differentiated X and Y chromosomes, such as the Anopheles mosquitoes.",

It remains unclear whether mitochondria impact antigen presentation by the MHC-class-I-related antigen-presenting molecule, MR1, which presents small molecules to MR1-restricted T-lymphocytes. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial complex III and the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase are essential for the cell-surface expression of MR1 and for generating uridine- and thymidine-related compounds that bind to MR1 and are produced upon oxidation by reactive oxygen species. One mitochondria-derived immunogenic formylated metabolite we identified is 5-formyl-deoxyuridine (5-FdU). Structural studies indicate that 5-FdU binds in the A’-antigen-binding pocket of MR1, positioning the deoxyribose toward the surface of MR1 for TCR interaction. 5-FdU stimulates specific T cells and detects circulating T cells when loaded onto MR1-tetramers. 5-FdU-reactive cells resemble adaptive T cells and express the phenotypes of naïve, memory, and effector cells, indicating prior in vivo stimulation. These findings suggest that mitochondria may play a role in MR1-mediated immune surveillance.",

          "abstract": "Within Earth’s climate system, the ocean, cryosphere, and vegetation exhibit hysteresis behavior such that their state depends on their past and not merely on their current boundary conditions. The atmosphere’s fast mixing time scales were thought to inhibit the necessary memory effect for such multistability. Here, we show that moisture accumulation within the atmospheric column generates hysteresis in monsoon circulation independent of oceanic heat storage and yields two stable atmospheric states for the same solar insolation. The dynamics of monsoon rainfall is thus that of a seasonal transition between two stable states. The resulting hysteresis is shown in observational data and reproduced in a general circulation model where it increases with decreasing oceanic memory and exhibits the two distinct states that persist for more than 60 y. They are stabilized by moisture accumulation within the atmospheric column that carries information across time scales much longer than those typical for mixing. The possibility of abrupt shifts between these two states has implications for the future evolution of global monsoon rainfall that is crucial for the agricultural productivity currently feeding more than two billion people.",

          "abstract": "Buckling in compression is the archetype of elastic instability: when compressed along its longest dimension, a thin structure such as a playing card will buckle out-of-plane accommodating the imposed compression without a significant change of length. However, recent studies have demonstrated that tension applied to sheets with microscopic structure leads to out-of-plane deformation in applications from “groovy metasheets” for multistable morphing to kirigami grippers. Here, we demonstrate that this counterintuitive behavior—a large transverse folding induced by a relatively small imposed longitudinal tension—occurs also in unstructured sheets of isotropic material. The key to this behavior is that a localized uniaxial tension induces giant folding; we refer to this as “localized tension-induced giant (TUG) folding” to reflect the importance of localized tension, and its mode of actuation and the similarity of the loading condition to ‘tugging’ the sheet. We show that localized TUG folding occurs because of an efficient transfer of applied tensile load into compression—a geometric consequence of a localized applied tension. We determine scaling results for the folding angle as a function of applied strain in agreement with both experiments and simulations. The generic nature of localized TUG folding suggests that it might be utilized in a broader range of materials and structures than previously realized.",

However, lifetime-readout sensors are poorly understood at a molecular level, complicating their development. Although there are many sensors that have fluorescence-intensity changes, there are currently only a few with fluorescence-lifetime changes. Here, we optimized two biosensors for thiol–disulfide redox (RoTq-Off and RoTq-On) with opposite changes in fluorescence lifetime in response to oxidation. Using biophysical approaches, we showed that the high-lifetime states of these sensors lock the chromophore more firmly in place than their low-lifetime states do. Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of RoTq-On fused to a glutaredoxin (Grx1) enabled robust, straightforward monitoring of cytosolic glutathione redox state in acute mouse brain slices. The motional mechanism described here is probably common and may inform the design of other lifetime-readout sensors; the Grx1-RoTq-On fusion sensor will be useful for studying glutathione redox in physiology.",

          "abstract": "PARK7/DJ-1, a redox-sensitive protein implicated in neurodegeneration, cancer, and inflammation, exhibits increased secretion under stress. We previously demonstrated that, as a leaderless protein, PARK7 relies on an unconventional autophagy pathway for stress-induced secretion. The current study delves deeper into the mechanisms governing PARK7 secretion under oxidative stress triggered by the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Here, we revealed that 6-OHDA-induced autophagic flux is critical for PARK7 secretion. Downregulation of syntaxin 17 (STX17), a SNARE protein crucial for autophagosome-lysosome fusion and cargo degradation, hindered PARK7 secretion. Likewise, impairing lysosomal function with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) or chloroquine (CQ) diminished PARK7 release, highlighting the importance of functional lysosomes, potentially in the form of secretory autolysosomes, in PARK7 release. We also found that 6-OHDA appeared to promote the unfolding of PARK7, allowing its selective recognition by the chaperone HSPA8 via KFERQ-like motifs, leading to PARK7 translocation to the lysosomal membrane through LAMP2 via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Additionally, a dedicated SNARE complex comprising Qabc-SNAREs (STX3/4, VTI1B, and STX8) and R-SNARE SEC22B mediates the fusion of PARK7-containing autolysosomes with the plasma membrane, facilitating the extracellular release of PARK7. Hence, this study uncovers a mechanism where 6-OHDA-induced autophagic flux drives the unconventional secretion of PARK7, involving CMA for PARK7 translocation to lysosomes and specialized SNARE complexes for membrane fusion events.",

The most abundant envelope glycolipid is trehalose dimycolate (TDM). TDM compromises the host response to mycobacterial species via multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of phagosome maturation. The molecular mechanism by which TDM inhibits phagosome maturation has been elusive. We find that a clickable, photoaffinity TDM probe recapitulates key phenotypes of native TDM in macrophage host cells and binds several host Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Attachment Proteins Receptor (SNARE) proteins, including Vesicle Transport through Interaction with t-SNAREs 1B (VTI1B), Syntaxin 8 (STX8), and Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein 2 (VAMP2). VTI1B and STX8 normally promote endosome fusion by forming a complex with VAMP8. However, in the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis , VTI1B and STX8 complex with VAMP2, which in turn decreases VAMP8 binding. VAMP2 acts together with mycolate structure to inhibit phagosome maturation and promotes intracellular M. tuberculosis replication. Thus one mechanism by which TDM constrains the innate immune response to M. tuberculosis is via noncanonical SNARE complexation.",

          "abstract": "B cells discriminate antigens in immune synapses by capturing them from antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This discrimination relies on the application of mechanical force to B cell receptor (BCR)-antigen bonds, allowing B cells to selectively disrupt low-affinity interactions while internalizing high-affinity antigens. Using DNA-based tension sensors combined with high-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that the magnitude, location, and timing of forces within the immune synapse are influenced by the fluidity of the antigen-presenting membrane. Transitioning antigens from a high-mobility to a low-mobility substrate significantly increases the probability and speed of antigen extraction while also improving affinity discrimination. This shift in antigen mobility also reshapes the synapse architecture, altering spatial patterns of antigen uptake. Despite these adaptations, B cells maintain consistent levels of proximal and downstream signaling pathway activation regardless of antigen mobility. They also efficiently transport internalized antigens to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)-positive compartments for processing. These results demonstrate that B cells mount effective responses to antigens across diverse physical environments, though the characteristics of that environment may influence the speed and accuracy of B cell adaptation during an immune response.",

The pleasurable urge to move to music, known as groove, relies on dopamine for reward, anticipation, beat perception, and motor system activity. Using a well-established paradigm, which shows an inverted-U relationship between groove and musical complexity, we investigated how dopamine downregulation from long-term cocaine and heroin use affects the experience of music. Drug users experienced stronger groove with high rhythmic and harmonic complexities than nonusers, while moderate complexities elicited similar responses across groups. This pattern differs from other populations with altered dopaminergic function, such as Parkinson’s disease or musical anhedonia, highlighting a distinct effect of drug addiction on music perception. The findings suggest that drug users seek more intense and complex stimulation, supporting the hypothesis that a hypodopaminergic state associated with drug use raises the threshold for nondrug stimuli to engage the reward system.",

The human allelic variant hOGG1 S326C , prevalent in Caucasians and Asians, has been regarded as a susceptibility factor for various diseases, yet its pathogenic mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that Ogg1 S326C/S326C mice exhibit increased and sustained airway inflammation compared with wild-type (WT) Ogg1 S326/S326 mice. Mechanistically, in response to inflammatory stimulation, OGG1S326C undergoes reactive oxygen species-induced dimerization, which impairs its base excision function, but prolongs its association with promoter-embedded substrate(s), leading to an increase in NF-κB’ DNA occupancy, subsequently the excessive expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and the exacerbated lung inflammation. In contrast, Serine at position 326 in WT -OGG1 is constitutively phosphorylated by CDK4. To fulfill the requirement for its function in transcriptional regulation, the phosphorylated OGG1 needs to undergo dephosphorylation to rescue DNA binding ability. In this scenario, OGG1S326C lacks this phosphorylation site, disrupting this regulatory cycle. Notably, administration of a small molecule inhibitor of OGG1 prevents OGG1S326C from binding to DNA and significantly decreases gene expression and inflammatory responses. Our findings elucidate a molecular basis for the increased disease susceptibility of individuals carrying the hOGG1 S326C variant and propose the therapeutic potential of OGG1 inhibitors in mitigating inflammation-driven pathologies.",

          "abstract": "The global energy budget is fundamental for understanding climate change. It states that the top-of-atmosphere imbalance between radiative forcing (which drives climate change) and radiative response (which resists the forcing) equals energy storage in Earth’s heat reservoirs (i.e. the ocean, atmosphere, land, and cryosphere). About 90% of Earth’s energy imbalance is stored as heat content in the ocean interior, which is poorly sampled before 1960. Here, we reconstruct Earth’s energy imbalance since 1880 by inferring subsurface ocean warming from surface observations via a Green’s function approach. Our estimate of Earth’s energy imbalance is consistent with the current best estimates of radiative forcing and radiative response during 1880–2020. The consistency is improved in this study compared to previous ones. We find two distinct phases in the global energy budget. In 1880–1980, Earth’s energy imbalance closely followed the radiative forcing. After 1980, however, Earth’s energy imbalance increased at a slower rate than the forcing; in 2000–2020, the imbalance amounted to less than 50% of the forcing. In simulations of historical climate change, the model-mean energy imbalance is consistent with observations within uncertainties, but individual models with a “weak” response to anthropogenic aerosol agree better with observations than those with a “strong” response. Because the global energy budget before and after 1980 implies very different global warming in the future, further studies are required to better understand the cause of this historical variation.",

Using chronic viral infection, we show that histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) was specifically required for the formation of antigen-specific T EX -int cells at the effector phase of responses. Single-cell transcriptomics validated that Hdac1 deficiency depleted T EX -int cells and revealed that Hdac1 was critical for positive regulation of T EX -int-characteristic genes, including Cx3cr1 , Cxcr6 , and Klf2 . Furthermore, profiling chromatin accessibility landscape in T EX subsets demonstrated that loss of Hdac1 resulted in a prevalent increase in chromatin open state, as evidently observed at the exhaustion program genes, which were linked to induced expression of exhaustion-inducing Tox transcription factor, PD1 and Lag3 coinhibitory receptors in T EX cells. Hdac1 thus has dual regulatory functions: promoting T EX -int cell fate and preventing excessive activation of the exhaustion program to curtail uncontrolled virus replication.",

At least four known stoichiometries have been established, each with distinct structures. These compounds have potential applications as refractory coatings, catalysts, and magnetic materials. We modeled the stability of RE 3 PO 7 [RE 3 (PO 4 )O 3 ] with respect to rare earth sesquioxides (RE 2 O 3 ) and orthophosphates (REPO 4 ) using DFT computations with the GGA-PBE and r2SCAN exchange-correlation functionals. Phase stability predictions were consistent between the two functionals, while r2SCAN calculations of formation enthalpies for REPO 4 showed better agreement with experimental data. RE 3 PO 7 phases for La–Dy were predicted to be stable at 0 K, with a space group change from Cm to C 2 /m starting with Sm. RE 3 PO 7 phases for Y, Ho, and Er were found to be stabilized by lattice vibrational entropies at temperatures above 800 K, 1,000 K, and 1,600 K, respectively.

          "abstract": "This study presents the results of geochemical compositional analysis through portable X-ray fluorescence of 788 artifacts from the Templo Mayor in Mexico City. The results reveal that the Mexica (Aztecs) preferred green obsidian from Sierra de Pachuca. However, a diachronic analysis (c. 1375-1520 CE) demonstrated that they continuously consumed obsidian from seven additional sources with some temporal variations related to the sociopolitical transformations of the empire. In the early phases, obsidian from Tulancingo, El Paraíso, and Zacualtipán is more common. After the consolidation of the Mexica Empire c.1430 CE, the patterns shifted to obsidian from Otumba, Paredón, and Ucareo. The study of artifacts from ritual and nonritual contexts demonstrates that most inhabitants used obsidian from multiple regions in the form of blades and flakes, probably acquired in local markets. Conversely, the elites and ritual specialists clearly preferred green obsidian from Pachuca to elaborate ritual objects due to its unique color and symbolic value. Ritual objects may arrive directly at the sacred precinct from the workshops outside the city, such as those found in Otumba and Pachuca. This study highlights the importance of analyzing large samples that combine ritual and nonritual artifacts, as well as objects from different phases, to explore temporal and social patterns of obsidian consumption among Pre-Hispanic societies.",

A narrow, controlled size distribution of ACC nanoparticles is essential for macroscopic crystal formation via CPA. Using in situ synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, we demonstrate that synthetic magnesium-stabilized ACC (Mg-ACC) nanoparticles form with an exceptionally narrow size distribution near the spinodal line during liquid–liquid phase separation. We monitored ACC formation kinetics at pH 8.4 to 8.9 and Mg 2 + contents of 50 to 80%, observing a 2-order magnitude rise in nucleation kinetics for a 0.1 pH increase and a 6-order magnitude rise for a 10% Mg 2 + decrease. Within the binodal region, faster nucleation kinetics result in more monodisperse particles, narrowing the particle size distribution by factors of 2 for a pH increase of merely 0.1 and by a factor of 3 for a 10% Mg 2 + decrease. While the influence of Mg 2 + on calcite biomineralization is well studied, its effect on Mg-ACC formation and particle size distribution-an essential parameter in CPA-based biomineralization pathways-remained unexplored. These findings highlight the delicate interplay of pH and Mg 2 + in controlling the kinetics and thermodynamics of Mg-ACC formation, significantly impacting particle size distribution.",

          "abstract": "Genes and the environment jointly shape individual traits, but the influence of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), arising from the genetic composition of interacting conspecific individuals, is often ignored or underemphasized. Moreover, because of practical challenges in characterizing IGEs, empirical research has fallen behind theoretical advancement. The fire ant Solenopsis invicta offers a uniquely suitable study system due to its distinct colony-level phenotypic variation (monogyne and polygyne social forms) attributed to IGEs of a social-supergene variant ( b allele). A minority of b -carrying workers ( Bb genotype) can trigger colony-level conversion from monogyne (single queen per colony) to polygyne (multiple queens per colony) behavior. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying this process via 400-ant microcolonies. We first showed that assimilated Bb workers reduce aggression by host BB workers toward Bb queens, thus inducing polygyny, at rates observed earlier in experiments that used full-size (&gt;20,000 ants) colonies. We then demonstrated that social conversion is facilitated by cuticular contact between the worker types, and verified the presence of nonvolatile cuticular pheromones that are necessary but not sufficient components underpinning this process. Follow-up experiments suggested that a second, polygyne worker-produced pheromone that is only released once such workers detect a Bb queen is also necessary but again insufficient, for full expression of the conversion phenomenon. Thus, multiple pheromonal components linked to presence of the b supergene allele in colony workers appear to be involved in shaping social environments and thereby inducing, via IGEs, the transformation from monogyne to polygyne fire ant societies.",

The eukaryotic AAA+ adenosine triphosphatase valosin-containing protein (VCP), which is transported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, plays a critical role in the DDR process. However, the nuclear translocation and molecular mechanism of VCP for DDR remain elusive. Here, we define VCP as a KPNB1 interacting protein through a combination of chemical and immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry approaches. Further biochemical studies elucidate that KPNB1 directly transports VCP into the nucleus. We also identify withaferin A (WA) as a small molecule that can retard VCP nuclear localization via covalent binding to CYS 158 of KPNB1. Further studies verify WA as an effective antitumor drug candidate via blocking VCP nuclear localization to impact on the DDR pathway in vivo.

Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the substrate-engaged, MIDN-bound human proteasome in two conformational states. MIDN induces proteasome conformations similarly to ubiquitinated substrates by using its ubiquitin-like domain to bind to the deubiquitinase RPN11 (PSMD14). By simultaneously binding to RPN1 (PSMD2) with its C-terminal α-helix, MIDN positions its substrate-carrying Catch domain above the proteasome ATPase channel through which substrates are translocated before degradation. Our findings suggest that both ubiquitin-like domain and C-terminal α-helix must bind to the proteasome for MIDN to stimulate proteasome activity.",

However, despite increasing exposure risks from nanoparticles (NPs), their potential infiltration into human breast milk remains poorly understood. This study provides a comprehensive chemical profile of NPs in human breast milk, analyzing their elemental composition, surface charge, hydrodynamic size, and crystallinity. NPs were detected in 42 out of 53 milk samples, with concentrations reaching up to 1.12 × 10 11 particles/mL. These particles comprised nine elements, with O, Si, Fe, Cu, and Al being the most frequently detected across all samples. We establish a mechanistic axis for NP infiltration, involving penetration of the intestine/air–blood barriers, circulation in blood vessels, crossing the blood–milk barrier via transcytosis or immune cell-mediated transfer, and eventual accumulation in milk. Structure–activity relationship analysis reveals that smaller, neutral-charged NPs exhibit stronger infiltration capacity, offering potential for regulating NP behavior at biological barriers through engineering design.

The radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans is a spherical bacterium protected by a thick and unusual cell envelope. It has been reported to divide using a distinctive mode of septation in which two septa originating from opposite sides of the cell progress with a flat leading edge until meeting and fusing at mid-cell.

The functionalities of most AaRSs are inextricably linked to their oligomeric states. While GluRSs were previously classified as monomers, the current investigation reveals that the form expressed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a rotationally pseudosymmetrical homodimer featuring intersubunit tRNA binding sites. Both subunits display a highly bent, “pipe strap” conformation, with the anticodon binding domain directed toward the active site. The tRNA binding sites are similar in shape to those of the monomeric GluRSs, but are formed through an approximately 180-degree rotation of the anticodon binding domains and dimerization via the anticodon and D-arm binding domains. As a result, each anticodon binding domain is poised to recognize the anticodon loop of a tRNA bound to the adjacent protomer. Additionally, the anticodon binding domain has an α-helical C -terminal extension containing a conserved lysine-rich consensus motif positioned near the predicted location of the acceptor arm, suggesting dual functions in tRNA recognition. The unique architecture of Pa GluRS broadens the structural diversity of the GluRS family, and member synthetases of all bacterial AaRS subclasses have now been identified that exhibit oligomerization.",

          "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) is a protein–pigment complex that utilizes sunlight to catalyze water oxidation and plastoquinone reduction, initiating the electron transfer (ET) cascade in oxygenic photosynthesis. The D1 and D2 proteins are the most important transmembrane subunits of PSII that bind all redox-active components involved in primary charge separation (CS) and ET. D1 is susceptible to oxidative photodamage, particularly under high light, and protection partly involves genetic regulation. Cyanobacterial D1 is encoded by the psbA gene family that expresses distinct isoforms (PsbA1–3) depending on environmental conditions. Most differences in D1 isoforms are close to the active-branch reaction center (RC) pigments P D1 , P D2 , Chl D1 , and Pheo D1 . Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with multiscale quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics calculations on the membrane-bound PSII monomer of each variant to compare the redox and excited state properties of RC pigments using long-range-corrected density functional theory. We identify specific amino acid substitutions responsible for electrochromic shifts on distinct pigments and pigment groups. Our results indicate that the Pheo D1 acceptor is the primary regulatory target. The redox properties of the Chl D1 –Pheo D1 pair and the energetics of Chl D1 δ+ Pheo D1 δ- charge-transfer states are distinctly modulated in the three isoforms: Compared to the standard psbA 1 , charge separation is inhibited in psbA 2 and facilitated in psbA 3 PSII. The results provide a microscopic description of how genetic variations modulate protein electrostatics and influence primary processes in photosynthetic reaction centers.",

          "abstract": "Diverse single-stranded RNA viruses employ different host cellular organelles or membrane systems to compartmentalize their replication intermediates and proviral factors, ensuring robust replication. Replication of Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), an Alphaflexiviridae family, is tightly associated with chloroplasts and dynamic cytosolic viral replication complex (VRC) clusters. BaMV VRC clusters comprise double-stranded viral RNA, BaMV replicase (Rep BaMV ), and mitochondrial outer membrane protein, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). In this study, we demonstrate that host glycolytic enolase (ENO) binds to untranslated regions of BaMV RNA independently of ENO hydrolytic activity. However, the structural integrity of ENO is essential for its direct interaction with Rep BaMV , and its positive regulating role in BaMV replication and the size of BaMV VRC clusters. Additionally, ENO, pyruvate kinase (PYK), and VDAC colocalize within cytosolic BaMV VRC clusters embedded in the convoluted endomembrane reticulum (ER) along with ER-targeted viral movement proteins under BaMV infection. This association suggests that the ENO-PYK-VDAC metabolon, with ENO serving as a scaffold to link chloroplasts and mitochondria, may play a pivotal role in BaMV robust replication. Collectively, our findings offer significant insights into how glycolytic ENO acts in BaMV replication.",

They alternate between a heterotrimeric GDP-bound OFF-state and a GTP-bound ON-state in which Gα GTP is separated from the Gβγ dimer. Consequently, pharmacological tools to securely prevent the OFF-ON transition are of utmost importance to investigate their molecular switch function, specific contribution to GPCR signal transduction, and potential as drug targets. FR900359 (FR) and YM-254890 (YM), two natural cyclic peptides and highly specific inhibitors of Gq/11 heterotrimers, are exactly such tools. To date, their efficient and long-lasting inhibition of Gq/11 signaling has been attributed solely to a wedge-like binding to Gα, thereby preventing separation of the GTPase and α-helical domains and thus GDP release. Here, we use X-ray crystallography, biochemical and signaling assays, and BRET-based biosensors to show that FR and YM also function as stabilizers of the Gα:Gβγ subunit interface. Our high-resolution structures reveal a network of residues in Gα and two highly conserved amino acids in Gβ that are targeted by FR and YM to glue the Gβγ complex to the inactive Gα GDP subunit. Unlike all previously developed nucleotide-state specific inhibitors that sequester Gα in its OFF-state but compete with Gβγ, FR and YM actively promote the inhibitory occlusion of Gα GDP by Gβγ. In doing so, they securely lock the entire heterotrimer, not just Gα, in its inactive state. Our results identify FR and YM as molecular glues for Gα and Gβγ that combine simultaneous binding to both subunits with inhibition of G protein signaling.",

          "abstract": "Nitrogen is one of the most limiting nutrients to forest productivity worldwide. Recently, it has been established that diverse ecosystems source a substantial fraction of their water from weathered bedrock, leading to questions about whether root-driven nitrogen cycling extends into weathered bedrock as well. In this study, we specifically examined nitrogen dynamics using specialized instrumentation distributed across a 16 m weathered bedrock vadose zone (WBVZ) underlying an old growth forest in northern California where the rhizosphere—composed of plant roots and their associated microbiome—extends meters into rock. We documented total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), and CO 2 and O 2 gases every 1.5 m to 16 m depth for 2 y. We found that TDN concentrations increased with depth, were an order of magnitude greater at 15 m than in the upper 30 cm, and that the majority of TDN throughout the weathered bedrock vadose zone was organic. We also found that TDN concentrations are influenced by depth, season, and interannual precipitation patterns. Carbon isotope composition of the DOC suggests that dissolved organic matter in the WBVZ is primarily derived from plant sources, and not the nitrogen-rich bedrock. We conclude that nitrogen dynamics in the WBVZ may be driven, in part, by an active rhizosphere, meters below the base of soil, and we argue that weathered bedrock horizons may play a key role in C-N cycling in ecosystems with deep-rooted plants.",

Solar energy utilization is enhanced by thermoresponsive hydrogels that lower the energy threshold for water desorption and by efficient thermal and mass flow management that increases energy efficiency. Our system delivers up to 235.09 mL d −1 of water with an energy efficiency as high as 26.4%, excluding solar panel power.

While previous studies only have obtained understanding at the level of the microbial community, the fate of extraordinary traits of an individual through generations of reproduction has yet to be adequately investigated. This work uses the lactic acid bacteri Lactiplantibacillus plantarum as a research model to study the activity inheritance between parental generations and filial generations. An integrated single-cell manipulation strategy is established, including fluorescent screening using an extracellular pH probe and a microwell array, micropicking using a micropipette, and amplifying an individual bacterium via single-cell culture. Consequently, it is found that daughter bacteria can well inherit the strong acid-producing activity from their parental bacterial individuals, although as the reproduction proceeds over 30 generations, the offspring gradually regresses to the mediocre, thus setting a caveat for the limiting generations for desired inheritance. This is likely due to the deterioration of the cell living environment. This work illustrates the inheritable features of bacterial metabolic traits at the level of individual bacteria and is therefore fundamentally insightful for biotechnological applications like bioenergy production that require consistent or at least predictable metabolic performance.",

This warrants the investigation of the role played by interspecies interactions in shaping gel architecture and rheology.

Simply changing the strength of interspecies lateral association, we generate two types of gels: one in which the two components demix and another one in which the two species wrap around each other. We show that demixed gels have structure and rheology that are largely unaffected by the strength of attraction between the components. In contrast, architecture and material properties of intertwined gels strongly depend on interspecies “stickiness” and volume exclusion. These results can be used as the basis of a design principle for double networks which are made to emphasize either stability to perturbations or responsiveness to stimuli.

          "abstract": "Yellow fever vaccination provides long-lasting protection and is a unique model for studying the immune response to an acute RNA virus infection in humans. To elucidate the early innate immune events preceding the rapid generation of protective immunity, we performed transcriptome analysis of human blood dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte subpopulations before and 3, 7, 14, and 28 d after vaccination. We detected temporary upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in all DC and monocyte subsets on days 3 and 7 after vaccination as well as cell type–specific responses and response kinetics. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed rapid appearance of activated DC and monocyte clusters dominated by ISGs, inflammatory chemokines, and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation. This was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in a large cohort of vaccinees. We identified SIGLEC1/CD169 upregulation as a sensitive indicator of the transient IFN-induced activation state elicited in DCs and monocytes by YF17D vaccination correlating with early protective IgM antibody responses.",

          "abstract": "The potassium channel TWIK-2 is crucial for ATP-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. The channel is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel superfamily and an emerging therapeutic target to mitigate severe inflammatory injury involving NLRP3 activation. We report the cryo-EM structure of human TWIK-2. In comparison to other K2P channels, the structure reveals an unusual “up” conformation of Tyr111 in the selectivity filter and a resulting SF1-P1 pocket behind the filter. Density for acyl chains is present in fenestrations within the transmembrane region that connects the central cavity of the pore to the lipid membrane. Despite its importance as a drug target, limited pharmacological tools are available for TWIK-2. A previous study suggested that the FDA-approved small molecule pimozide might inhibit TWIK-2. Using a reconstituted system, we show that pimozide directly inhibits the channel and we determine a cryo-EM structure of a complex with the drug. Pimozide displaces the acyl chains within the fenestrations and binds below the selectivity filter where it would impede ion permeation. The drug may access its binding site by lateral diffusion in the membrane, suggesting that other hydrophobic small molecules could have utility for inhibiting TWIK-2. The work defines the structure of TWIK-2 and provides a structural foundation for development of more specific inhibitors with potential utility as anti-inflammatory drugs.",

          "abstract": "In healthy awake individuals, the neural processing of bodily signals is not only essential for survival but can also influence perception and compete with external stimulus processing. Yet, the mechanism underlying this bidirectional processing of bodily and external stimuli, as well as its persistence or modulation in unconscious states, remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of cardiac activity on auditory regularity processing in coma. We recorded continuous electroencephalography and electrocardiography in 48 comatose patients on the first day after cardiac arrest during a closed-loop auditory paradigm. We tested whether sounds presented in synchrony with the ongoing heartbeat and sounds presented with fixed, isochronous intervals, would facilitate auditory processing, compared to an asynchronous sequence with variable heartbeat-to-sound and sound-to-sound intervals and a baseline without auditory stimulation. To assess sound prediction based on sequence regularity, we introduced sound omissions within the sequences, violating expected auditory patterns. In coma survivors only, the neural omission response differed in the synchronous against both control conditions. These results were corroborated by a multivariate decoding analysis of the single-trial neural responses to the synchronous omissions and baseline wherein survivors exhibited a higher degree of cardio-audio regularity encoding compared to nonsurvivors. Furthermore, omissions within the synchronous sequence elicited a heart rate deceleration exclusively in coma survivors, which was predictive of patient outcome. We show that the unconscious human brain infers on the temporal relationship across cardiac and auditory inputs and that the neural and cardiac correlates of cardio-audio regularity encoding are predictive of patient outcome.",

          "abstract": "Proton transport plays a fundamental role in many biological and chemical systems. In life, proton transport is crucial for biochemical and physiological functions. It is usually accepted that the main mechanism of proton transfer is a result of hopping between neighboring water molecules and amino acid side chains. It was recently suggested that the proton transfer can be simultaneously coupled with electron transfer. As life is homochiral, proton transfer in biology is occurring in a chiral environment. In this environment, the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect relating to electron transfer and chirality is expected to occur. The present work establishes that the proton transfer is coupled to a specific electron spin polarization in lysozyme crystals, associating proton transfer to electron movement and polarization. To preserve total angular momentum, this motion may be coupled to chiral phonons that propagate in the crystal. Our work shows that the interaction of the electrons’ spin and phonons is very significant in proton transfer through lysosome crystals. Injecting the opposite electron spin into the lysosome crystal results in a significant change in proton transfer impedance. This study presents the support for the proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism and indicates the importance of spin polarization in the process.",

          "abstract": "Spreading depolarizations (SDs) have been identified in various brain pathologies. SDs increase the cerebral energy demand and, concomitantly, oxygen consumption, which indicates enhanced synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, SDs are considered particularly detrimental during reduced supply of oxygen and glucose. However, measurements of intracellular neuronal ATP ([ATP] i ), ultimately reporting the balance of ATP synthesis and consumption during SDs, have not yet been conducted. Here, we investigated neuronal ATP homeostasis during SDs using two-photon imaging in acute brain slices from adult mice expressing the ATP sensor ATeam1.03 YEMK in neurons. SDs were induced by application of potassium chloride or by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and detected by recording the local field potential, extracellular potassium, as well as the intrinsic optical signal. We found that, in the presence of oxygen and glucose, SDs were accompanied by a substantial but transient drop in neuronal ATP sensor signals, corresponding to a drop in ATP. OGD, which prior to SDs was accompanied by only a slight reduction in ATP signals, led to a large, terminal drop in ATP signals during SDs. Subsequently, we investigated whether neurons could still regenerate ATP if oxygen and glucose were promptly resupplied following SD detection, and show that ATP depletion was essentially reversible in most cells. Our findings indicate that SDs are accompanied by a substantial increase in ATP consumption beyond production. This, under conditions that mimic reduced blood supply, leads to a breakdown of [ATP] i . Therefore, our findings support therapeutic strategies targeting SDs after cerebral ischemia.",

          "abstract": "Establishing a dominance hierarchy in social organisms is important for access to resources. Stress has been proposed as a major factor influencing an animal’s likely position in a social hierarchy. Although individual differences in vulnerability to stress are increasingly recognized, how social hierarchy affects vulnerability remains relatively understudied. Here, we examined how the social dominance status of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats influences their response to stress in interactions with a familiar animal living in the same cage, and separately when confronting an unfamiliar rat of uncertain dominance status from another cage, using the tube test. Having determined the relatively stable within-cage social dominance status of animals, half were subjected to a single episode of 2-h immobilization stress. Cagemates, both control and stressed rats, again faced one another 1 d and 10 d after stress. First, the predetermined hierarchical rank among familiar cagemates was relatively unaffected by stress. However, second, the same stress had a differential impact in competitions between unfamiliar rats. Socially dominant control rats continued to win competitions but subordinate control rats, that had previously lost, sometimes started to win against previously dominant rats that had been stressed. Strikingly, subordinate stressed rats displayed consistent submissive-like behavior and they alone showed differential effects on dendritic spine density in the amygdala. Thus, an individual’s social rank can influence its response to stress, an effect that is detectable in interactions with unfamiliar animals. These findings provide an additional dimension to animal models of stress used for exploring facets of social anxiety and withdrawal in stress-related psychiatric disorders.",

Here, we exploit a recent breakthrough that generalizes the concept of memory beyond its conventional temporal meaning to also encompass space. Specifically, we leverage our finding that the dynamics of observables in systems with local couplings satisfy Green’s functions with kernels that are local in time and space. This enables us to employ the dynamics of small lattices over short times to predict the dynamics of thermodynamically large lattices over arbitrarily long timescales while circumventing the deleterious impacts of finite-size effects. We thus interrogate the exact nonequilibrium formation and migration of polarons in one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) systems, revealing that their motion approaches diffusive transport only asymptotically in time and system size. We also compare transport in 1D and 2D systems to investigate the effect of dimension in polaron migration physics, illustrating how energy variations can cause localization—a phenomenon observable via current microscopy experiments.",

In this study, we analyzed circadian time-dependent changes in cell types within the mouse tongue epithelium. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we observed circadian time-dependent changes in the populations of stem/progenitor cells and the differentiated cells in mice tongues. Notably, we observed time-dependent changes in the type II taste cell population, which were abolished by ablation of taste bud stem cells, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation within the taste cell population. Through experiments with taste bud organoids (TBOs), we found a 24-h cell cycle period, which was disrupted by the knockdown of the core-clock gene Bmal1 . In TBOs, both cell divisions and apoptotic cells exhibited circadian time-dependent phenotypes. Interestingly, the time-dependent changes in cell death disappeared in the stem cell–ablated TBOs, indicating that the diurnal supply of newly born cells is essential for the rhythmic cell death phenotype. Additionally, taste tests conducted at different times of the day revealed time-dependent sensitivity changes originating from type II taste cells in mice. These findings suggest that the time-dependent changes in taste cell population are driven by circadian clock–regulated cell cycle progression and control time-dependent physiological regulation in the mouse tongue.",

          "abstract": "The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is the most notable global biodiversity pattern, but its underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. The evolutionary speed hypothesis (ESH) posits that molecular rates play a crucial role in shaping the LDG, suggesting that higher temperatures accelerate molecular rates, thereby facilitating rapid speciation and accumulation of biodiversity in the tropics. However, whether ESH can explain the LDG across diverse taxonomic groups remains debated, and systematic examinations of its two key predictions using consistent datasets and methodologies across vertebrates are lacking. Here, we tested ESH using molecular rates from mitochondrial (5,424 species) and nuclear (1,512 species) genomes across major vertebrate groups, including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. Our findings revealed distinct latitudinal patterns in the absolute synonymous substitution rate (dS), which were influenced by thermoregulatory strategies. Specifically, the dS increases with ambient temperature and decreases with latitude in ectotherms but shows no correlation in most endotherms. These distinct patterns are likely attributed to different key predictors of dS between thermogroups, with temperature playing a major role only in ectotherms. For mitochondrial genes, absolute nonsynonymous substitution rates (dN) increase with temperature, likely driven by mutation rates in ectotherms and purifying selection in endotherms. However, neither mitochondrial dS nor dN correlates with diversification rates across vertebrates, contradicting the second prediction of ESH. For nuclear rates, the ESH was supported in reptiles and amphibians but not in mammals, birds, or fishes. In conclusion, our results provide limited support for ESH in vertebrates, underscoring the intricate processes that shape the LDG.",

However, the hydrodynamic functions of their L-shaped chattering beak, S-curved neck, and distinct behaviors such as stomping and feeding against the flow remain a mystery. Combining live flamingo experiments with live brine shrimp and passive particles, bioinspired physical models, and 3D CFD simulations, we show that flamingos generate self-induced vortical traps using their heads, beaks, and feet to capture agile planktonic prey in harsh fluid environments. When retracting their heads rapidly (~40 cm/s), flamingos generate tornado-like vortices that stir up and upwell bottom sediments and live shrimp aided by their L-shaped beak. Remarkably, they also induce directional flows (~7 cm/s) through asymmetric beak chattering underwater (~12 Hz). Their morphing feet create horizontal eddies during stomping, lifting, and concentrating sediments and brine shrimp, while trapping fast-swimming invertebrates, as confirmed by using a 3D-printed morphing foot model. During interfacial skimming, flamingos produce a vortical recirculation zone at the beak’s tip, aiding in prey capture. Experiments using a flamingo-inspired particle collection system indicate that beak chattering improves capture rates by ~7×. These findings offer design principles for bioinspired particle collection systems that may be applied to remove pollutants and harmful microorganisms from water bodies.",

This method overcomes several limitations associated with traditional experimental libraries, including spectral background interference, solvent effects, and commercially unavailable or challenging to synthesize compounds. Our methodology employs a physics-informed machine learning pipeline that operates in two stages: the characteristic peak extraction (CaPE) algorithm, which isolates distinctive spectral features, and the characteristic peak similarity (CaPSim) algorithm, which identifies analytes with high robustness to spectral shifts and amplitude variations. Validation of this approach showed strong similarity values (&gt;0.6) between DFT-calculated and experimental Surface-enhanced Raman spectra for multiple PAHs, confirming its accuracy and discriminative capability. This study establishes the viability of DFT-calculated spectra as reliable references for identifying analytes that lack experimental reference spectra, including those formed through environmental modification of PAHs.

RAS proteins show high sequence similarities in their G-domains but are significantly different in their C-terminal hypervariable regions (HVR). These regions interact with the cell membrane via lipid anchors that result from posttranslational modifications (PTM) of cysteine residues. KRAS4b is unique as it has only one cysteine that undergoes PTM, C185. Small molecule covalent modification of C185 would block any form of prenylation and subsequently inhibit attachment of KRAS4b to the cell membrane, blocking its biological activity. We translated this concept to the discovery and development of disulfide tethering screen hits into irreversible covalent modifiers of C185. These compounds inhibited proliferation of KRAS4b-driven mouse embryonic fibroblasts, but not cells driven by N-myristoylated KRAS4b that harbor a C185S mutation and are not dependent on C185 prenylation. Top–down proteomics was used to confirm target engagement in cells. These compounds bind in a pocket formed when the HVR folds back between helix 3 and 4 in the G-domain (HVR-α3-α4). This interaction can happen in the absence of small molecules as predicted by molecular dynamics simulations and is stabilized in the presence of C185 binders as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering and solution NMR. NOESY-HSQC, an NMR approach that measures internuclear distances of 6 Å or less, and structure analysis identified the critical residues and interactions that define the HVR-α3-α4 pocket. Further development of compounds that bind to this pocket could be the basis of a new approach to targeting KRAS cancers.",

          "abstract": "A key unresolved question in microbial ecology is how the extraordinary diversity of microbiomes emerges from the interactions among their many functionally distinct populations. This process is driven in part by the cross-feeding networks that help to structure these systems, in which consumers use resources to fuel their metabolism, creating by-products which can be used by others in the community. Understanding the effects of cross-feeding presents a major challenge, as it creates complex interdependencies between populations which can be hard to untangle. We address this problem using the tools of network science to develop a structural microbial community model. Using methods from percolation theory, we identify feasible community states for cross-feeding network structures in which the needs of consumers are met by metabolite production across the community. We identify tipping points at which small changes in structure can cause the catastrophic collapse of cross-feeding networks and abrupt declines in microbial community diversity. Our results are an example of a well-defined tipping point in a complex ecological system and provide insight into the fundamental processes shaping microbiomes and their robustness. We further demonstrate this by considering how network attacks affect community diversity and apply our results to show how the apparent difficulty in culturing the microbial diversity emerges as an inherent property of their cross-feeding networks.",

In contrast to noninteracting systems used as amplifiers, we demonstrate that interactions resulting from random atomic collisions give rise to two distinct amplification phenomena. These phenomena provide essential resources for enhancing quantum sensing capabilities. Our results show that magnetic fields can be amplified by at least two orders of magnitude, enhancing magnetic sensitivity to the femtotesla per root hertz level. Additionally, we report a counterpart phenomenon, deamplification, where the magnetic noise response is suppressed by at least one order of magnitude within certain frequency regimes.

Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells are a subset of enteroendocrine cells that detect noxious stimuli within the gut lumen, such as chemical irritants and microbial byproducts, and transduce this information to sensory nerve fibers to elicit defensive responses such as nausea and visceral pain. While much has recently been learned about the pharmacological and biophysical characteristics of EC cells, a more broadscale investigation of their properties has been hindered by their relatively low prevalence and sparse anatomical distribution within the gut epithelium. Here, we introduce a method for large-scale parallel analysis of individual EC cell activity within a physiologically relevant epithelial context. Using this approach, we identify somatostatin-28 as a potent inhibitor of both basal and stimulus-evoked serotonin release from EC cells and delineate the signaling pathway that underlies this modulatory response. Our analysis suggests that targeting this inhibitory signaling pathway may offer therapeutic avenues for treating gastrointestinal disorders associated with EC cell function and dysregulated serotonin signaling. Together with the ongoing development of specific biosensors, this platform provides a template for the efficient characterization of other rare sensory cell types and their pharmacological modulators.",

          "abstract": "Wnt signaling orchestrates gene expression in a plethora of processes during development and adult cell homeostasis via the action of nuclear β-catenin. Yet, little is known about how β-catenin generates context-specific transcriptional outcomes. Understanding this will reveal how aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling causes neoplasia specifically of the colorectal epithelium. We have previously identified the transcription factor TBX3 as a tissue-specific component of the Wnt/β-catenin nuclear complex during mouse forelimb development. In this study, we show that TBX3 is functionally active in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, genome-wide binding and transcriptomics analyses reveal that TBX3 regulates cancer metastasis genes in cooperation with Wnt/β-catenin. Proteomics proximity labeling performed across Wnt pathway activation shows that TBX3 engages with several transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes found at Wnt responsive elements (WRE). Protein sequence and structure analysis of TBX3 revealed short motifs, including an exposed Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF), that mediate these interactions. Deletion of these motifs abrogates TBX3’s proximity to its protein partners and its ability to enhance the Wnt-dependent transcription. TBX3 emerges as a key modulator of the oncogenic activity of Wnt/β-catenin in CRC, and its mechanism of action exposes protein-interaction surfaces as putative druggable targets.",

          "abstract": "Cancer cells frequently reprogram one-carbon metabolic pathways to fulfill their vigorous demands of biosynthesis and antioxidant defense for survival and proliferation. Dysfunction of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes is critically involved in this process, but the precise mechanisms by which cancer cells actively trigger one-carbon metabolic alterations remain incompletely elucidated. Here, by using untargeted metabolomic analysis, we identify the oncoprotein SE translocation (SET) as a key regulator of one-carbon metabolism in cancer cells. SET physically interacts with mitochondrial SHMT2 and facilitates SHMT2 enzymatic activity. Loss of SET profoundly suppresses serine-derived one-carbon metabolic flux, whereas reexpression of ectopic SET leads to the opposite effect. Notably, although the presence of SHMT2 is critical for SET-mediated one-carbon metabolic alterations, the depletion of SHMT2 alone is insufficient to antagonize SET-induced tumor growth, probably due to functional compensation by its cytosolic isozyme SHMT1 upon SHMT2 knockdown. Instead, pharmacological targeting of cellular SHMT (including both SHMT1 and SHMT2) activity results in dramatic suppression of SET-induced tumor growth. Moreover, by using a Kras/Lkb1 mutation-driven lung tumor mouse model, we demonstrate that the loss of SET compromises both tumor formation and intratumoral SHMT2 enzymatic activity. Clinically, the overexpression of SET and SHMT2 is observed in lung tumors, both of which correlate with poor prognosis. Our study reveals a SET–SHMT2 axis in regulating serine-derived one-carbon metabolism and uncovers one-carbon metabolic reprogramming as a mechanism for SET-driven tumorigenesis.",

Here, we demonstrate that neutrophils recruited in murine colitis and infection models, idiopathic IBD, and chronic granulomatous disease-associated IBD undergo extensive transcriptional reprogramming, resulting in the emergence of neutrophil populations that feature unique DUOX2 NADPH oxidase expression. Functional studies utilizing mice with myeloid and neutrophil specific DUOX2 inactivation reveal a vital and dichotomous role for this NADPH oxidase in both colitis and intestinal infection. Niche-directed reprogramming promoted a DUOX2-dependent chemokine and cytokine-rich intestinal environment that amplified and prolonged inflammatory responses, suggesting that selectively suppressing DUOX2 may constitute an anti-inflammatory strategy for IBD treatment.

Here, we model directional decision-making in chemotactic amoeboid cells as a stimulus-dependent actin recruitment contest. Pseudopods extending from the cell body compete for a finite actin pool to push the cell in their direction until one pseudopod wins and determines the direction of movement. Our minimal model provides a quantitative understanding of the strategies cells use to reach the physical limit of accurate chemotaxis, aligning with data without explicit gradient sensing or cellular memory for persistence. To generalize our model, we employ reinforcement learning optimization to study the effect of pseudopod suppression, a simple but effective cellular algorithm by which cells can suppress possible directions of movement. Different pseudopod-based chemotaxis strategies emerge naturally depending on the environment and its dynamics. For instance, in static gradients, cells can react faster at the cost of pseudopod accuracy, which is particularly useful in noisy, shallow gradients where it paradoxically increases chemotactic accuracy. In contrast, in dynamics gradients, cells form de novo pseudopods. Overall, our work demonstrates mechanical intelligence for high chemotaxis performance with minimal cellular regulation.",

Methyltransferase 3 (METTL3) is a major m 6 A methyltransferase for RNA N6-mehtyladenosine (m 6 A) modifications to regulate epitranscriptome and cellular functions. With the atheroprone flow upregulating METTL3 and m 6 A RNA hypermethylation, we investigate the role of METTL3 in atheroprone flow–induced glycolysis in ECs in vitro and in vivo. Compared to pulsatile shear stress (PS, atheroprotective flow), oscillatory shear stress (OS, atheroprone flow) increases METTL3 expression to enhance the m 6 A modifications of mRNAs encoding HK1, PFKFB3, and GCKR, which are rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis. These augmented m 6 A modifications increase the expressions of HK1 and PFKFB3 while decreasing GCKR, resulting in elevated EC glycolysis, as revealed by seahorse analysis. Moreover, a stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging study demonstrates the elevation of glucose incorporation into de novo synthesized lipids in ECs under atheroprone flow in vitro and in vivo. Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) drug, represses METTL3 expression, thereby mitigating OS-induced glycolysis in ECs. These data suggest mechanisms by which METTL3 links EC mechanotransduction with metabolic reprogramming under atherogenic conditions.",

          "abstract": "What mechanisms underlie linguistic generalization in large language models (LLMs)? This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies analyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of yet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally well be explained as the result of analogy. A key shortcoming of prior research is its focus on regular linguistic phenomena, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same predictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically English adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We introduce a method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs: Focusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and analogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a set of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct conclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and analogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives with regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable nominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match. Furthermore, GPT-J’s behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies, even for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical account but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the hypothesis that GPT-J’s linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization involves rules, suggesting analogy as the underlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes play a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously thought.",

Levels of preoperative stress, anxiety, and female gender are known risk factors for increased and prolonged postoperative pain. The mechanisms by which psychological stress increases postoperative pain, especially in women, remain unknown. We hypothesized that stress amplifies postoperative pain by sensitizing dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors. Prolactin (PRL) is a female-predominant neurohormone that is controlled by estrogen and stress. PRL signals at the prolactin receptor long (PRLR-L) and short (PRLR-S) isoforms to induce gene transcription and nociception, respectively. Critically, prolactin sensitizes female, but not male, murine, Macaque and human nociceptors, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism with high translational potential for human therapy. Prior restraint stress (RS) increased the magnitude and duration of incisional injury–induced postoperative pain hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. In females, RS or incisional injury downregulated PRLR-L and increased PRL-dependent nociceptor excitability. Female selective inhibition of postoperative pain hypersensitivity was produced by a) pharmacological inhibition of pituitary PRL b) overexpression of DRG PRLR-L to bias PRL signaling away from PRLR-S and c) CRISPR/Cas9 editing of PRLR isoforms. PL200,019, our recently discovered monoclonal antibody against human PRL (hPRL), prevented hPRL-induced sensitization of human female nociceptors. Using female mice genetically modified to express hPRL, rather than murine PRL, PL200,019 prevented both stress and incisional injury–induced hypersensitivity. Preemptive inhibition of stress-induced nociceptor sensitization with a monoclonal antibody to sequester PRL can improve female postoperative pain, diminish the need for postoperative opioids and decrease the risks of transition to chronic pain.",

Here, we reported that the GDGT ring synthases mutant, deficient in GDGT cyclization, inhibited archaellum formation and reduced cell motility in thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius . This inhibition was caused by decreased transcription of the archaellum operon, likely due to cleavage of the C-terminal domains in transmembrane proteins ArnRs, the transcription factors that regulate archaellum operon expression. The transcriptomic and proteomic analysis showed deficiency of GDGT cyclization broadly impacted the expression of membrane associate proteins, including respiratory chain proteins, and decreased cellular ATP concentration. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the correlation between GDGT cyclization and archaellum formation is widespread among (hyper)thermophilic archaea, and this was further verified in the euryarchaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis.

This effect is considered universal, being applicable to all types of waves, quantum or classical. However, the interaction between disorder and topology—a concept that has profoundly transformed many branches of physics—necessitates revisiting the original Anderson localization picture. For instance, in the recently discovered topological Anderson insulator, the introduction of disorder induces topological boundary states that can resist localization due to protection from line-gap topology. While line-gap topology applies to both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems uniquely exhibit point-gap topology, which has no Hermitian counterparts and leads to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate disorder-induced point-gap topology in a non-Hermitian acoustic crystal. This crystal, with non-Hermitian disorder in nearest-neighbor couplings, exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect, where all eigenstates localize at a boundary. Interestingly, the boundary where localization occurs—either the left or right—depends on the strength of the disorder. As the disorder strength increases, the direction of boundary localization can be reversed. Additionally, we observe a “bipolar” skin effect, where boundary localization occurs at both the left and right boundaries when disorder is introduced in next-nearest-neighbor couplings. These findings experimentally reveal a non-Hermitian mechanism of disorder-induced localization that goes beyond the conventional framework of Anderson localization.",

          "abstract": "During meiosis, the correct pairing, synapsis, and recombination of homologous chromosome pairs is critical for fertility of sexual eukaryotes. These processes are challenged in polyploids, which possess additional copies of each chromosome. Polyploidy thus provides a unique context to study how evolution can modify meiotic programs in response to challenges. We previously observed that in newly formed (neo-)polyploids of Arabidopsis arenosa , synapsis defects precede chromosomes associating in aberrant multivalent and univalent configurations. Here, we study synapsis dynamics in genotypes with varying levels of meiotic stability to ask whether efficient synaptic progression is a key component of evolving stable tetraploid meiosis. We develop a method to quantify synapsis dynamics using the progression of foci of the pro-crossover factor HEI10 as a reference. HEI10 initially appears at many small foci before accumulating only at crossover sites. In diploids, this transition begins while significant asynapsis is still present, though it quickly declines as HEI10 accumulates at fewer foci. In neo-tetraploids, suboptimal elongation of synaptic initiation sites and stalled synapsis, perhaps due to defective pairing, occurs before the onset of HEI10 accumulation. In established tetraploids, HEI10 accumulation begins only when synapsis is near complete, suggesting enhanced HEI10/synapsis codynamics (even compared to diploids). Hybrids generated by crossing neo- and established tetraploids exhibit intermediate phenotypes. We find the extent of asynapsis correlates positively with crossover numbers, and the frequency of multivalents and univalents, which can disturb chromosome segregation. Our work supports the hypothesis that improving the efficiency of synapsis is important for evolving polyploid meiotic stability.",

          "abstract": "Developmental time (or time to maturity) strongly correlates with an animal’s maximum lifespan, with late-maturing individuals often living longer. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. This may be because most previously identified longevity genes regulate growth rate rather than developmental time. To address this gap, we genetically manipulated prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), the primary regulator of developmental timing in Drosophila , to explore the genetic link between developmental time and longevity. Loss of PTTH delays developmental timing without altering the growth rate. Intriguingly, PTTH mutants exhibit extended lifespan despite their larger body size. This lifespan extension depends on ecdysone signaling, as feeding 20-hydroxyecdysone to PTTH mutants reverses the effect. Mechanistically, loss of PTTH blunts age-dependent chronic inflammation, specifically in fly hepatocytes (oenocytes). Developmental transcriptomics reveal that NF-κB signaling activates during larva-to-adult transition, with PTTH inducing this signaling via ecdysone. Notably, time-restricted and oenocyte-specific silencing of Relish (an NF-κB homolog) at early 3rd instar larval stages significantly prolongs adult lifespan while delaying pupariation. Our study establishes an aging model that uncouples developmental time from growth rate, highlighting NF-κB signaling as a key developmental program in linking developmental time to adult lifespan.",

          "abstract": "The distinction between “reinforcement” and “cloaking” has been overlooked in optimization-based design of devices intended to conceal a defect in an elastic medium. In the former, a so-called “cloak” is severely biased toward one or a few specific elastic disturbances, whereas in the latter, an “unbiased cloak” is effective under any elastic disturbance. We propose a two-stage approach for optimization-based design of elastostatic cloaks that targets true, unbiased cloaks. First, we perform load-case optimization to find a finite set of worst-case design loads. Then we perform topology optimization of the cloak microstructure under these worst-case loads using a judicious choice of the objective function, formulated in terms of energy mismatch. Although a small subset of the infinite load cases that the cloak must handle, these highly nonintuitive, worst-case loads lead to designs that approach perfect and unbiased elastostatic cloaking. In demonstration, we consider elastic media composed of spinodal architected materials, which provides an ideal testbed for exploring elastostatic cloaks in media with varying anisotropy and porosity, without sacrificing manufacturability. To numerically verify the universal nature of our cloaks, we compare the elastic response of the medium containing the cloaked defect to that of the undisturbed medium under many random load cases not considered during design. By using digital light processing additive manufacturing to realize the elastic media containing cloaked defects and analyzing their response experimentally using compression testing with digital image correlation, this study provides a physical demonstration of elastostatic cloaking of a three-dimensional defect in a three-dimensional medium.",

          "abstract": "Intermolecular interactions underlie all cellular functions, yet visualizing these interactions at the single-molecule level remains challenging. Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) offers a potential solution. Given a nanoscale map of two putative interaction partners, it should be possible to assign molecules either to the class of coupled pairs or to the class of noncoupled bystanders. Here, we developed a probabilistic algorithm that allows accurate determination of both the absolute number and the proportion of molecules that form coupled pairs. The algorithm calculates interaction probabilities for all possible pairs of localized molecules, selects the most likely interaction set, and corrects for any spurious colocalizations. Benchmarking this approach across a set of simulated molecular localization maps with varying densities (up to ∼55 molecules μm −2 ) and localization precisions (1 to 50 nm) showed typical errors in the identification of correct pairs of only a few percent. At molecular densities of ∼5 to 10 molecules μm −2 and localization precisions of 20 to 30 nm, which are typical parameters for SMLM imaging, the recall was ∼90%. The algorithm was effective at differentiating between noninteracting and coupled molecules both in simulations and experiments. Finally, it correctly inferred the number of coupled pairs over time in a simulated reaction–diffusion system, enabling determination of the underlying rate constants. The proposed approach promises to enable direct visualization and quantification of intermolecular interactions using SMLM.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial energy metabolism is vital for muscle function and is tightly controlled at the transcriptional level, both in the basal state and during adaptive muscle remodeling. The importance of the transcription factors estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) in controlling innate mitochondrial energetics has been recently demonstrated. However, whether different ERR isoforms display distinct functions in glycolytic versus oxidative myofibers is largely unknown. Moreover, their roles in regulating exercise-induced adaptive mitochondrial biogenesis remain unclear. Using muscle-specific single and combinatorial knockout mouse models, we have identified both cooperative and distinct roles of the ERR isoforms ERRα and ERRγ in regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism in different muscles. We demonstrate the essential roles of both these ERRs in mediating adaptive mitochondrial biogenesis in response to exercise training. We further show that PGC1α-induced mitochondrial biogenesis is completely abolished in primary myotubes with ERRα deletion but not ERRγ, highlighting distinct roles of these two isoforms in adaptive mitochondrial remodeling. Mechanistically, we find that both ERRs directly bind to the majority of mitochondrial energetic genes and control their expression, largely through collaborative binding to the same genomic loci. Collectively, our findings reveal critical and direct regulatory roles of ERRα and ERRγ in governing both innate and adaptive mitochondrial energetics in skeletal muscle.",

Condensate formation and function remain incompletely understood due to difficulties in visualizing the condensate interior at high resolution. Here, we analyzed the structure of biochemically reconstituted chromatin condensates through cryoelectron tomography. We found that traditional blotting methods of sample preparation were inadequate, and high-pressure freezing plus focused ion beam milling was essential to maintain condensate integrity. To identify densely packed molecules within the condensate, we integrated deep learning–based segmentation with context-aware template matching. Our approaches were developed on chromatin condensates and were also effective on condensed regions of in situ native chromatin. Using these methods, we determined the average structure of nucleosomes to 6.1 and 12 Å resolution in reconstituted and native systems, respectively, found that nucleosomes form heterogeneous interaction networks in both cases, and gained insight into the molecular origins of surface tension in chromatin condensates. Our methods should be applicable to biomolecular condensates containing large and distinctive components in both biochemical reconstitutions and certain cellular systems.",

In this study, we provide a comprehensive examination of tool use behavior in the assassin bug Pahabengkakia piliceps , a specialist predator of stingless bees that exploits resin droplet from bee nest entrance to facilitate hunting. Field behavioral experiments demonstrated that resin use is critical for hunting success, as the predator uses resin to stimulate the colonial defense of stingless bees, luring attacking bees toward its optimal hunting position. Chemical analysis revealed that resin processing by the assassin bug enhances the emission of volatile compounds, making the resin more attractive and stimulating to guard bees. Through these experiments, we empirically demonstrate how an invertebrate predator adapts to the colony defense of social insects via tool use behavior. We further propose that complex tool use can evolve under selective pressures driven by diet specialization. Our findings offer a new model for studying the adaptive functions and underlying mechanisms of tool use behaviors in animals.",

Here, we used an array of vertically aligned nanopillars to study nuclear deformability in situ after chromatin decompaction in cells. The nucleus significantly stiffened within 4 h of chromatin decompaction but softened at longer timescales. This acute stiffening of the nucleus was underpinned predominantly by an increase in nucleus volume and nuclear import, and partially by enhanced lamin protein recruitment to the periphery. The coupling between nucleus stiffening and acute chromatin decompaction was observed in low malignancy cancer cell lines (e.g. MCF7, PEO1, A549) but weakened in highly malignant counterparts (e.g. MDA-MB-231, HEYA8, HT1080) due to the capacity to efficiently compact heterochromatin into foci that sustains nucleus deformability required for confined migration.

Here, a subtractive hybridization method coupled with RNAseq of individual mosquito specimens was used to profile RNA viromes of individual co-occurring Aedes albopictus and Aedes vexans mosquitoes across a 2,000 km spatial scale. Samples were collected and archived by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) from four ecologically variable sites in the Southeastern United States between 2018 and 2019. Results of multivariate analysis suggest that mosquito species are an important factor in RNA viral community composition. Significantly higher viral diversity was detected in A. albopictus compared to A.vexans .

Delineating the driver(s) and tempo of the GOE and its impact on microbial evolution and biogeochemistry can be aided by characterizing the cycling of redox-sensitive elements such as nitrogen. While previous studies have shown that the transition to a broadly aerobic marine nitrogen cycle occurred in step with the final phase of the GOE ~2.33 billion years ago (Ga), an evolving understanding of the GOE as a dynamic oscillatory process and the narrow spatial distribution of existing studies highlight ambiguity in the marine nitrogen cycle in the lead up to permanent atmospheric oxygenation. Here, we present stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotope ratios derived from the ~2.43 Ga Duitschland and ~2.33 Ga Rooihoogte formations in four drill cores separated by hundreds of kilometers. A significant negative carbon isotope excursion (6 to 8‰) in the Duitschland Formation indicates massive oxidation of organic carbon in close association with a putative snowball Earth event and an earlier pulse of atmospheric oxygen at 2.43 Ga. Further, consistently positive δ 15 N values (≤ +20.3‰) within the Duitschland Formation, combined with a broad temporal shift across global δ 15 N records to a distribution comparable to modern marine sediments, signify an aerobic nitrogen cycle ~100 My earlier than previously accepted.

NonA-nonB-ICs (nA/nB-ICs) also produce Slc26a4 though their function is unclear. Though both nephron and ureteric progenitor lineages generate A-ICs, the former also generates nA/nB-ICs and the latter B-ICs. Lineage and cell type restricted transporter gene expression in the mouse and human kidney is preceded by expression of the transcriptional regulators Dmrt2/DMRT2 in A-ICs, and either, or both, Hmx2/HMX2 and Hmx3/HMX3 in B- and nA/nB ICs. CRISPR/Cas9-directed removal of Dmrt2 and the linked Hmx2 / Hmx3 genes resulted in IC-subtype switching. A-ICs adopted an Hmx2 + /Slc26a4 + B-IC cell fate on Dmrt2 removal while B-ICs initiated a Dmrt2 + /Slc4a1 + A-IC program on Hmx2/Hmx3 removal. Triple knockout of Dmrt2 , Hmx2 , and Hmx3 resulted in hybrid ICs expressing both Slc4a1 and Slc26a4 . Thus, restricted expression of these regulators is essential for specifying IC subtypes. To explore these mechanisms, Hmx2 and Dmrt2 were activated ectopically in ureteric organoid cultures. Introduction of Foxi1 —a pan determinant of ICs—activated early Dmrt2 + A-IC development while cointroduction of Hmx2 silenced Foxi1-dependent Dmrt2 expression and led to an upregulation of Slc26a4. In contrast, coexpression of Foxi1 and Dmrt2 upregulated Slc4a1 . These data support a model in which mutually repressive interactions between Dmrt2 and Hmx2/3 establish distinct IC identities and ongoing activity of these factors supports gene regulatory programs specific to each IC subtype.",

This study establishes an inverse correlation between tumor cell contractility and chemosensitivity. In both clinical biopsies and cancer cell lines, high/low actomyosin-mediated contractile force attenuates/enhances the vulnerability to chemotherapy, which depends on intercellular force propagation. Cell–cell interaction force activates the mechanosensitive Notch signaling that upregulates the downstream effector major vault protein, which facilitates the export of chemotherapy drugs from nuclei, leading to the reduction of chemosensitivity. Cellular contractility promotes the tolerance of tumor xenografts to chemotherapy and sustains tumor growth in vivo, which can be reversed by the inhibition of contractile force, Notch signaling, or major vault protein. Further, the actomyosin-Notch signaling is associated with drug resistance and cancer recurrence of patients. These findings unveil a regulatory role of intercellular force in chemosensitivity, which could be harnessed as a promising target for cancer mechanotherapeutics.",

We recorded 4323 utterances in 53 wild chimpanzees and compared the events in which chimpanzees emitted two-call vocal combinations (bigrams) with those eliciting the component calls. Examining 16 bigrams, we found four combinatorial mechanisms whereby bigram meanings were or were not derived from the meaning of their parts—compositional or noncompositional combinations, respectively. Chimpanzees used each mechanism in several bigrams across a wide range of daily events. This combinatorial system allows encoding many more meanings than there are call types. Such a system in nonhuman animals has never been documented and may be transitional between rudimentary systems and open-ended systems like human language.",

We used scRNA-seq to examine cell-type allometry in asexual planarians of different sizes, revealing that they consist of the same basic cell types but in varying proportions. Notably, the gut basal cells are the most responsive to changes in size, suggesting a role in energy storage. We capture the regulated gene modules of distinct cell types in response to body size.

We estimate that 1.41 million dFAD buoys were released between 2007 and 2021, drifting across at least 134 million square kilometers, or 37% of Earth’s ocean surface. Lost dFADs have stranded in 104 maritime jurisdictions, contributing to coastal pollution and damaging sensitive habitats. Regulatory progress has been made to address data quality, entanglement, and pollution but concerns over unregulated dFAD deployments, unsustainable bycatch, and weak industry accountability persist.

While DUX4 activates similar programs in early embryos and FSHD muscle, the isoform usage of known DUX4 targets is notably distinct between the two contexts. DUX4 also activates hundreds of previously unannotated intergenic loci dominated by repetitive elements. The transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of these loci in myogenic and embryonic contexts indicate that the usage of DUX4-binding sites at these intergenic loci is influenced by the cellular environment.

Loss-of-function mutations in CLN1 , encoding palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1), cause CLN1 disease, a devastating neurodegenerative LSD that has no curative treatment. Numerous proteins in the brain require dynamic S-palmitoylation (palmitoylation-depalmitoylation) for trafficking to their destination. Although PPT1 depalmitoylates S-palmitoylated proteins and its deficiency causes CLN1 disease, the underlying pathogenic mechanism has remained elusive. We report that Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a polytopic membrane protein mediating lysosomal cholesterol egress, requires dynamic S-palmitoylation for trafficking to the lysosome. In Cln1 −/− mice, Ppt1 deficiency misroutes NPC1-dysregulating lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis. Along with this defect, increased oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) promotes cholesterol-mediated activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin C1 (mTORC1), which inhibits autophagy contributing to neurodegeneration. Pharmacological inhibition of OSBP suppresses mTORC1 activation, rescues autophagy, and ameliorates neuropathology in Cln1 −/− mice. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of CLN1 /PPT1 in lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis and suggest that suppression of mTORC1 activation may be beneficial for CLN1 disease.",

Here, we show that ferroelectric moiré domains formed in a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN) substrate can modulate light emission from an adjacent semiconductor MoSe 2 monolayer. The electrostatic potential at the surface of the t-hBN substrate provides a simple way to confine excitons in the MoSe 2 monolayer. The excitons confined within the domains and at the domain walls are spectrally separated because of a pronounced Stark shift. Moreover, the patterned light emission can be dynamically controlled by electrically gating the ferroelectric domains, introducing a functionality beyond other semiconductor moiré superlattices. Our findings chart an exciting pathway for integrating nanometer-scale moiré ferroelectric domains with various optically active functional layers, paving the way for advanced nanophotonics and metasurfaces.",

Most human anti-CA antibodies cross-reacted with all HEV genotype variants, and a subset also recognized the zoonotic rat hepatitis E virus. HEV antibody repertoire was diverse and contained highly potent neutralizing antibodies binding to the CA protruding (P) domain. Structural analyses of CA protein complexed with three potent and broad HEV antibodies uncovered a neutralizing site located on monomeric P domain loops at the apex of the viral spike.

We demonstrate that the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), synthesized by Nicotiana benthamiana phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 6 (NbPAL6), dictates insect resistance in adult plants. NbPAL6 expression is driven by the key transcription factor, NbMYB42, which is regulated by two interacting auxin response factors, NbARF18La/b. In juvenile plants, higher auxin levels activate Nb miR160c, a microRNA that simultaneously silences NbARF18La/b , subsequently reducing NbMYB42 expression, lowering SA accumulation, and thus weakening herbivore defense. Excessive SA in juvenile plants enhances defense but antagonizes auxin signaling, impairing early growth. Our findings suggest a seesaw-like model that balances growth and defense depending on the plant’s developmental stage.",

The chemical interactions of dust particles with ozone production processes played crucial roles in explaining approximately 13 to 35% of the observed ozone reduction, alongside the impact of intense meteorological disturbances on transport and formation of ozone.

However, the role of 26 S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 14 (PSMD14) in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains to be determined. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that silencing PSMD14 notably attenuated the growth, invasion, and metastasis of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of PSMD14 produced the opposite results. Mechanistically, PSMD14 decreased K63-linked ubiquitination on SF3B4 protein to de-ubiquitin and stabilize SF3B4 protein. Then, SF3B4/HNRNPC complex bound to FADS1 mRNA and promoted exon inclusion in the target mRNA through m 6 A site on FADS1 mRNA recognized by HNRNPC, thereby up-regulating the expression of FADS1 and activating Akt/mTOR signaling. Exogenous arachidonic acid supplementation combined with PSMD14 knockdown induced synthetic lethality, which was further confirmed in TNBC organoid (PDO) and TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Overall, our findings reveal an oncogenic role of PSMD14 in TNBC progression, which indicates a potential biomarker and ferroptosis-mediated therapeutic strategy for TNBC.",

Here, we propose a three-dimensional versatile host composed of interconnected N,P-codoped carbon macroporous fibers incorporated with CoP nanoparticles (denoted as CoP@N/P-CMFs) for selective nucleation and uniform deposition of Na. The porous skeleton reduces structural stress and inhibits dendrite growth by decreasing local current density and homogenizing Na + flux. Furthermore, the sodiophilic CoP and N,P-codoped carbon reduce the energy barrier for Na nucleation, further manipulating homogeneous Na growth. Consequently, the CoP@N/P-CMFs exhibit an ultrahigh CE of more than 99.97% (10 milliamperes per square centimeter and 10 milliampere-hours per square centimeter) and dendrite-free Na deposition. When coupled with a Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 cathode, the assembled foldable AFNBs demonstrate stable cycling performance.",

PINK1 is activated by mitochondrial damage to phosphorylate ubiquitin and Parkin, triggering mitophagy. PINK1 also indirectly phosphorylates Rab GTPases, such as Rab8A. Using an siRNA library targeting human Ser/Thr kinases in HeLa cells, we identified EIF2AK1 [heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase], a branch of the integrated stress response (ISR), as a negative regulator of PINK1. EIF2AK1 knockdown enhances mitochondrial depolarization–induced PINK1 stabilization and phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Rab8A. These results were confirmed in SK-OV-3, U2OS, and ARPE-19 cells. Knockdown of DELE1, an activator of EIF2AK1, produced similar effects. Notably, the ISR inhibitor ISRIB also enhanced PINK1 activation. In human cells with mito-QC mitophagy reporters, EIF2AK1 knockdown or ISRIB treatment increased PINK1-dependent mitophagy without affecting deferiprone-induced mitophagy. These findings suggest that the DELE1-EIF2AK1 ISR pathway is a negative regulator of PINK1-dependent mitophagy. Further evaluation in PD-relevant models is needed to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway.",

The spin torque efficiency can be improved by decreasing the thickness of the gradient, while a sharp interface was not found to increase the spin torque.

Constraining the maximum extent of these aseismic ruptures is, thus, important for better delineating the influence zone of injections concerning their seismic hazard. Here, we derive a scaling relation based on rupture physics for the maximum size of aseismic ruptures, accounting for fluid injections with arbitrary flow rate histories. Moreover, on the basis of mounting evidence that the moment release during these operations is often predominantly aseismic, we derive a scaling relation for the maximum magnitude of aseismic slip events. Our theoretical predictions are consistent with observations over a broad spectrum of event sizes, from laboratory to real-world cases, indicating that fault zone storativity, background stress change, and injected fluid volume are key determinants of the maximum size and magnitude of injection-induced slow slip events.",

Using deep potential molecular dynamics simulations with ab initio accuracy, we explored the dissociation dynamics of H 2 CO 3 in solution on the nanosecond timescale. While the CC conformer is the most abundant, the CT conformer is the dominant proton donor. This enhanced deprotonation ability arises from the CT conformer’s involvement in more hydrogen-bonding ring structures, enabling diverse proton transfer pathways, and its greater electronic asymmetry, which increases hydrophilicity and destabilizes the hydroxyl group. Furthermore, protons dissociated from the CT conformer demonstrate a stronger preference for the homing pathway. Our findings underscore the critical role of the topology and electronic properties of the CT conformer in aqueous H 2 CO 3 dissociation and proton transfer.",

This paradox is typically solved by the presence of suppressors or fitness costs associated with the driver, limiting the propagation of the driver. Here, we show that Stellate (Ste) in Drosophila melanogaster represents a novel class of X chromosome–linked driver that operates with an inherent mechanism that weakens its drive strength. Ste protein asymmetrically segregates into Y-bearing cells during meiosis I, subsequently causing their death. Unexpectedly, Ste segregates asymmetrically again during meiosis II, sparing half of the Y-bearing spermatids from Ste-induced defects, thereby weakening the drive strength.

The memristor hardware capability is experimentally demonstrated in unsupervised and supervised classification tasks. The estimated energy efficiency of 517.82 giga-traversal edges per second per watt outperforms field programmable gate arrays by three to four orders of magnitude, providing a pathway toward highly energy-efficient graph computing hardware.",

          "abstract": "Mechanical metamaterials can unlock extreme properties by leveraging lightweight structural design principles and unique deformation mechanisms. However, research has predominantly focused on their quasi-static characteristics, leaving their behavior under extreme dynamic conditions, especially at length scales relevant to practical applications largely unexplored. Here, we present a strategy to achieve extreme impact mitigation at the macroscale by combining shell-based microarchitecture with an additively manufactured medium-entropy alloy (MEA) featuring low stacking fault energy (SFE). Notably, the shell-based architecture amplifies the effective dynamic stress within the metamaterial compared to truss-based morphologies, leading to the earlier activation of multiscale toughening mechanisms in the alloy. The low SFE of the MEA enables the evolution of a diverse array of defect types, thereby prolonging strain hardening behavior across seven orders of magnitude in strain rate. These fundamental insights could establish the groundwork for developing scalable, lightweight, impact-resistant metamaterials for structural and defense applications.",

We investigate how simple steric interaction constraints between active individuals produce a versatile and functional system using the link-bot: a V-shape–based, single-stranded chain composed of active bots whose dynamics are defined by geometric linking constraints. A variety of emergent properties arises from this active polymer-like system, including locomotion, navigation, transportation, and competitive or cooperative interactions. By adjusting a few link parameters, we show how link-bots can perform diverse tasks, including traversing or obstructing narrow spaces, passing by or enclosing objects, and propelling loads in different directions. Overall, the reconfigurability of link-bots indicates their potential in developing programmable soft robotic systems with simple components and materials at any scale.",

In this process, a sufficient hydraulic pressure is applied to drive water evaporation and vapor transport across a vapor-gap membrane. The development of the PD process critically depends on the availability of robust and large-area superhydrophobic membranes. Here, we propose an ultraselective superhydrophobic thin-film composite (TFC) vapor-gap membrane with confined transport channels toward the PD process, which can be manufactured scale-up through a facile swelling–assisted deposition strategy. The TFC-PD membrane demonstrates separation capabilities, achieving near-complete rejections of nonvolatile solutes, including salts, boron, and urea. Featured by a vapor-gap superhydrophobic layer, the TFC-PD membrane exhibits superior chlorine and scaling resistance and maintains stable performance over time without being oxidized or scaling. This work offers notable advancements in the microstructural design of PD membranes and the development of scalable robust TFC membranes for the PD process.",

Structural characterization of polymers from human tissue has been limited by their heterogeneity and flexibility; here, we have studied their internal structure, which provides insights into the molecular linkage and the pathway by which they are formed. NMR spectra of heat-induced 13 C-ILV-methyl–labeled polymers, and 1 H-methyl spectra of liver-derived polymers, show equivalence to that of AAT in a post–protease-encounter conformation. This is corroborated by x-ray crystallography, which reveals a cryptic epitope recognized by the conformationally selective 2C1 antibody, common to both forms.

The PBAC can effectively passivate the defects and reduce the risk of lead leakage. Consequently, the PBAC-modified PSCs achieve an efficiency of 25.53% (0.1 square centimeters) (certified efficiency of 25.24%) and 24.03% (1.0 square centimeters). Moreover, after 1500 hours of continuous maximum power point tracking under simulated AM 1.5 illumination and 2000 hours of exposure to damp heat conditions (85°C and 85% relative humidity), the device retains approximately 96 and 81% of its initial power conversion efficiency, respectively.

Here, we show that misdirected antiviral activity of GBP5 impairs processing and activation of Syncytin-1. In contrast, the proteolytic activation of Syncytin-2 is not affected by GBP5, and its fusogenic activity is only modestly reduced. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Syncytin-1 is mainly cleaved by the GBP5 target furin, whereas Syncytin-2 is also efficiently processed by the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7 (PCSK7) and thus resistant to GBP5-mediated restriction. Mutational analyses mapped PCSK7 processing of Syncytin-2 to a leucine residue upstream of the polybasic cleavage site. In summary, we identified an innate immune mechanism that impairs the activity of a co-opted endogenous retroviral envelope protein during pregnancy and may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of pregnancy disorders.",

Mild heating in H2 facilitates simultaneous reduction of multiple elements, forming single-phase solid solution alloys.

Furthermore, we reveal that ABA-INSENSITIVE 5, a well-conserved transcription factor in the ABA signaling pathway of land plants, plays a pivotal role in PD density regulation, whereas ABA-INSENSITIVE 3 does not. Our findings show that the ABA-induced reduction in primary PD density is mediated by these ABA-responsive factors in P. patens .

However, protein-templated mineralization often leads to particles that exhibit low colloidal stability, poor crystal quality, and/or diminished photoluminescence. Here, we report protein cage–spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) that can be used as nanoreactors for quantum dot (QD) synthesis and subsequent intracellular delivery. The resulting QD-SNA structures are monodisperse, colloidally stable, and photoluminescent in aqueous solution. The nanoreactors were prepared using two different proteins (~10 and 12 nanometers in diameter), and CdS, CdSe, and PbSe nanocrystals were synthesized. Moreover, the extent of surface defects and crystallinity depends on the relative concentrations of ionic precursors, which control the growth rate and the number of ionic vacancies. By optimizing conditions, CdS-SNAs that exhibit near-zero reabsorption loss were synthesized. Last, QD-SNAs exhibit enhanced cellular uptake and minimal cytotoxicity when compared to commercial QD-protein conjugates, making them potentially useful in bioimaging and diagnostic applications.",

          "abstract": "The formation of ice crystals in the atmosphere strongly affects cloud properties and climate. While volcanic ash (VA) has been shown to nucleate ice crystals efficiently in laboratory settings, its importance for ice formation in the atmosphere remains elusive. Here, we show evidence of cirrus modification by volcanic eruptions through ice nucleation on VA, revealed by abrupt changes in cirrus properties following volcanic eruptions based on satellite measurements. The distinct changes captured are a phenomenal decrease in number, an increase in size of ice crystals in cirrus clouds, and an increase in cirrus occurrences after ash-rich volcanic eruptions. Conversely, no such changes were detected following the ash-poor eruption. We propose a cirrus formation mechanism where VA nucleates ice heterogeneously, suppressing homogeneous freezing and resulting in fewer but larger ice crystals. This suppression of homogeneous freezing by VA is supported by process-level cloud microphysical simulations. Our findings advance the understanding of aerosol–ice cloud interactions and illuminate cirrus geoengineering.",

BPD also increases the risk of adult emphysema, marked by alveolar loss. Despite this connection, mechanisms linking these conditions and effective treatments are still lacking. We identify hedgehog-interacting protein ( HHIP ), associated with both BPD and emphysema, as a critical regulator of alveologenesis. During this process, Hhip -expressing cells expanded, accompanied by hedgehog (Hh) signaling inhibition and myofibroblast transition. Stromal-specific Hhip deletion led to hyperactivation of Hh-IGF1 signaling axis, causing persistent SMA + myofibroblasts and epithelial stem/progenitor cell senescence. Hyperactivation of this pathway was also observed in human BPD and hyperoxia-induced BPD models. Early Hhip deficiency resulted in adult emphysema with myofibroblast accumulation. We developed a therapeutic Fc-fused HHIP protein that mitigated BPD in neonatal mice and prevented adult emphysema. These findings establish HHIP as a critical regulator of alveologenesis and a therapeutic target for BPD and emphysema.",

Here, we examine maturation of an MA triple mutant, L20K/E73K/A82T, which, despite replicating similarly to wild-type (WT) in some cell lines, exhibits distinct biochemical behaviors that suggest altered MA-MA interactions. Cryo–electron tomography with subtomogram averaging reveals that, although the MA lattice in immature L20K/E73K/A82T virions closely resembles that of the WT, mature L20K/E73K/A82T virions lack a detectable MA lattice.

Mutation in dpy19l1l resulted in idiopathic scoliosis (IS)–like body axis curvature in the absence of muscle or cilia defects. URP2 expression was down-regulated in dpy19l1l −/− mutants. Notably, RF formation was impaired in dpy19l1l −/− mutants, and a similar phenotype was induced in wild-type embryos by injecting messenger RNA encoding a C-mannosylation catalytic site-mutated dpy19l1l variant (E106A mdpy19l1l ). Furthermore, E106A mDPY19L1L failed to glycosylate Flag-tagged SCO-spondin TSRs (thrombospondin type 1 repeats).

This suggests that changes in mean rainfall are primarily controlled by the thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of Earth’s main greenhouse gases: water vapor and carbon dioxide. Consistent with comprehensive general circulation models, our results explain why mean rainfall increases with surface warming at about 2% per kelvin, why this rate is largely unchanged over numerous doublings of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and why mean rainfall decreases in hothouse climates.",

In this work, we extend Flory’s model by accounting for individual reaction probabilities and cyclization tendencies, making it applicable to real SGP situations. Moreover, we have developed a top-down algorithm capable of extracting crucial information about polymer growth and cyclization from molecular weight data during the SGP process.

Our study reveals an unusual mechanism by which EYA3 reduces the presence of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells in the premetastatic niche (PMN) to enhance metastasis, independent of its effects on the primary tumor. We find that EYA3 up-regulates nuclear factor κB signaling to enhance CCL2 expression, which, in contrast to previous findings, suppresses cytotoxic NK cell activation in vitro and their infiltration into the PMN in vivo. These findings uncover an unexpected role for CCL2 in inhibiting NK cell responses at the PMN and suggest that targeting EYA3 could be an effective strategy to reactivate antitumor immune responses to inhibit metastasis.",

Their strong spin-orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry lead to the spin-valley locking effect, in which carriers occupying the K and K ′ valleys of the reciprocal space must have opposite spins. This effect is particularly strong for holes due to a larger spin-orbit gap in the valence band. By reducing the dimensionality of a monolayer of WSe 2 to 1D via electrostatic confinement, we demonstrate that spin-valley locking and strong hole-hole interactions lead to a ferromagnetic state where hole transport is spin-valley polarized, even without an applied magnetic field. A massive Dirac fermion model in the Hartree-Fock approximation reveals that many-body hole-exchange interactions lead to this polarized ground-state. This observation opens the possibility of implementing a robust and stable valley-polarized system, essential in valleytronic applications.",

Here, to recapitulate a multilayer structure of the skin, we developed a hydrodynamically mediated approach to the generation of large arrays of fibroblast spheroids (a dermal core) that were engulfed with an epidermal layer of keratinocytes. These spheroids expressed biomarkers of the epidermis, epidermal-dermal junction, and dermis, and exhibited skin-like barrier properties. Screening of the synergistic effect of vitamins and peptides on protein synthesis by the spheroids and evaluation of skin toxicity with chemical agents showed a correlation with clinical results or existing standards.

This device leverages a unique exciton relocalization effect in quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with additives, substantially enhancing optical gain and improving stability. When coupled with a waveguide-hybridized surface lattice resonance mode, the enhanced light-matter interaction facilitates single-mode lasing with a notably low threshold of 0.9 millijoules per square centimeter. In addition, the device achieves robust lasing performance with extended operational stability (1.8 × 10 6 excitation pulses).

To address this, we developed a conditioning paradigm using a looming visual stimulus as an unconditioned stimulus (US) in mice and identified a distinct neural circuit for visual threat conditioning. Parabrachial CGRP neurons were necessary for both conditioning and memory retrieval. Upstream neurons in the posterior insular cortex (pIC) responded to looming stimuli, and their projections to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) induced aversive states and drove conditioning. However, this pIC-to-PBN pathway was not required for foot-shock conditioning. These findings reveal how non-nociceptive visual stimuli can drive aversive states and fear memory formation, expanding our understanding of aversive US processing beyond traditional models.",

We observed sustained calcium activity elevation across glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABAergic inferior olive (IO)–projecting neurons within the DCN during episodes of dystonia in Prrt2 -mutant mice. However, only the optogenetic activation of DCN glutamatergic neurons, but not glycinergic or GABAergic IO-projecting neurons, elicited dystonia-like behaviors in normal mice. Selective ablation of DCN glutamatergic neurons effectively eliminated aberrant cerebellar DCN outputs and alleviated dystonia attacks in both Prrt2 -associated and kainic acid–induced dystonia mouse models.

This coordination is particularly critical in crowded tissues, such as pseudostratified epithelia (PSE) that are often found as organ precursors. They are composed of elongated epithelial cells with densely packed nuclei aligned along the apicobasal axis. While cell cycle–dependent nuclear movements in PSE are well studied, less is known about how nuclear packing influences tissue morphogenesis. To investigate this, we analyzed nuclear shapes, sizes, and neighborhood statistics in zebrafish neuroepithelia, focusing on the retinal PSE. We found that nuclei exhibit elongated shapes and biaxial nematic-like orientational order but remain positionally disordered. During retinal development, nuclear packing density increases, approaching theoretical limits. This occurs when the tissue transitions to a laminated structure and nuclear shapes are remodeled. Timely neurogenesis is critical as failure to initiate neurogenesis leads to tissue deformations. These findings highlight the influence of nuclear shape and positioning for organ morphogenesis.",

This is puzzling because sarcomeres are built from essentially the same actin-myosin components. Here, we address how functionally different sarcomeres are made. We show that the giant protein titin and the regulation of developmental contractility are key for the sarcomere specializations. I-band titin spans and determines the length of the sarcomeric I-band in a muscle type–specific manner. Unexpectedly, I-band titin also rules the length of the force-generating myosin filament using a feedback mechanism that is modulated by myosin contractility. We propose a model of how sarcomere specializations in insects are tuned, provide evidence for this model, and discuss its validity beyond insects.",
