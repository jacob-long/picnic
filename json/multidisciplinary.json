          "abstract": "The quantum-mechanical nuclear-shell structure determines the stability and limits of the existence of the heaviest nuclides with large proton numbers Z ≳ 100 (refs. 1–3 ). Shell effects also affect the sizes and shapes of atomic nuclei, as shown by laser spectroscopy studies in lighter nuclides 4 . However, experimental information on the charge radii and the nuclear moments of the heavy actinide elements, which link the heaviest naturally abundant nuclides with artificially produced superheavy elements, is sparse 5 . Here we present laser spectroscopy measurements along the fermium ( Z = 100) isotopic chain and an extension of data in the nobelium isotopic chain ( Z = 102) across a key region. Multiple production schemes and different advanced techniques were applied to determine the isotope shifts in atomic transitions, from which changes in the nuclear mean-square charge radii were extracted. A range of nuclear models based on energy density functionals reproduce well the observed smooth evolution of the nuclear size. Both the remarkable consistency of model prediction and the similarity of predictions for different isotopes suggest a transition to a regime in which shell effects have a diminished effect on the size compared with lighter nuclei.",

          "abstract": "Sleep is integral to cardiovascular health1,2. Yet, the circuits that connect cardiovascular pathology and sleep are incompletely understood. It remains unclear whether cardiac injury influences sleep and whether sleep-mediated neural outputs contribute to heart healing and inflammation. Here we report that in humans and mice, monocytes are actively recruited to the brain after myocardial infarction (MI) to augment sleep, which suppresses sympathetic outflow to the heart, limiting inflammation and promoting healing. After MI, microglia rapidly recruit circulating monocytes to the brain’s thalamic lateral posterior nucleus (LPN) via the choroid plexus, where they are reprogrammed to generate tumour necrosis factor (TNF). In the thalamic LPN, monocytic TNF engages Tnfrsf1a-expressing glutamatergic neurons to increase slow wave sleep pressure and abundance. Disrupting sleep after MI worsens cardiac function, decreases heart rate variability and causes spontaneous ventricular tachycardia. After MI, disrupting or curtailing sleep by manipulating glutamatergic TNF signalling in the thalamic LPN increases cardiac sympathetic input which signals through the β2-adrenergic receptor of macrophages to promote a chemotactic signature that increases monocyte influx. Poor sleep in the weeks following acute coronary syndrome increases susceptibility to secondary cardiovascular events and reduces the heart’s functional recovery. In parallel, insufficient sleep in humans reprogrammes β2-adrenergic receptor-expressing monocytes towards a chemotactic phenotype, enhancing their migratory capacity. Collectively, our data uncover cardiogenic regulation of sleep after heart injury, which restricts cardiac sympathetic input, limiting inflammation and damage.",

          "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in the tumour suppressor APC are an initial step in intestinal tumorigenesis 1,2 . APC -mutant intestinal stem cells outcompete their wild-type neighbours through the secretion of Wnt antagonists, which accelerates the fixation and subsequent rapid clonal expansion of mutants 3–5 . Reports of polyclonal intestinal tumours in human patients and mouse models appear at odds with this process 6,7 . Here we combine multicolour lineage tracing with chemical mutagenesis in mice to show that a large proportion of intestinal tumours have a multiancestral origin. Polyclonal tumours retain a structure comprising subclones with distinct Apc mutations and transcriptional states, driven predominantly by differences in KRAS and MYC signalling. These pathway-level changes are accompanied by profound differences in cancer stem cell phenotypes. Of note, these findings are confirmed by introducing an oncogenic Kras mutation that results in predominantly monoclonal tumour formation. Further, polyclonal tumours have accelerated growth dynamics, suggesting a link between polyclonality and tumour progression. Together, these findings demonstrate the role of interclonal interactions in promoting tumorigenesis through non-cell autonomous pathways that are dependent on the differential activation of oncogenic pathways between clones.",

          "abstract": "Additive manufacturing is an expanding multidisciplinary field encompassing applications including medical devices1, aerospace components2, microfabrication strategies3,4 and artificial organs5. Among additive manufacturing approaches, light-based printing technologies, including two-photon polymerization6, projection micro stereolithography7,8 and volumetric printing9,10,11,12,13,14, have garnered significant attention due to their speed, resolution or potential applications for biofabrication. Here we introduce dynamic interface printing, a new 3D printing approach that leverages an acoustically modulated, constrained air–liquid boundary to rapidly generate centimetre-scale 3D structures within tens of seconds. Unlike volumetric approaches, this process eliminates the need for intricate feedback systems, specialized chemistry or complex optics while maintaining rapid printing speeds. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique across a broad array of materials and intricate geometries, including those that would be impossible to print with conventional layer-by-layer methods. In doing so, we demonstrate the rapid fabrication of complex structures in situ, overprinting, structural parallelization and biofabrication utility. Moreover, we show that the formation of surface waves at the air–liquid boundary enables enhanced mass transport, improves material flexibility and permits 3D particle patterning. We, therefore, anticipate that this approach will be invaluable for applications where high-resolution, scalable throughput and biocompatible printing is required.",

Yet, despite this region having a large influence on the subsequent development of Europe and Asia, questions remain regarding its hunter-gatherer past and its formation of expansionist mobile steppe societies 3–5 . Here we present new genome-wide data for 131 individuals from 38 archaeological sites spanning 6,000 years. We find a strong genetic differentiation between populations north and south of the Caucasus mountains during the Mesolithic, with Eastern hunter-gatherer ancestry 4,6 in the north, and a distinct Caucasus hunter-gatherer ancestry 7 with increasing East Anatolian farmer admixture in the south. During the subsequent Eneolithic period, we observe the formation of the characteristic West Eurasian steppe ancestry and heightened interaction between the mountain and steppe regions, facilitated by technological developments of the Maykop cultural complex 8 . By contrast, the peak of pastoralist activities and territorial expansions during the Early and Middle Bronze Age is characterized by long-term genetic stability. The Late Bronze Age marks another period of gene flow from multiple distinct sources that coincides with a decline of steppe cultures, followed by a transformation and absorption of the steppe ancestry into highland populations.",

          "abstract": "Anurans are characterized by a biphasic life cycle, with an aquatic larval (tadpole) stage followed by an adult (frog) stage, both connected through the metamorphic period in which drastic morphological and physiological changes occur1. Extant tadpoles exhibit great morphological diversity and ecological relevance2, but their absence in the pre-Cretaceous fossil record (older than 145 million years) makes their origins and early evolution enigmatic. This contrasts with the postmetamorphic anuran fossil record that dates back to the Early Jurassic and with closely related species in the Late Triassic (around 217–213 million years ago (Ma))3. Here we report a late-stage tadpole of the stem-anuran Notobatrachus degiustoi from the Middle Jurassic of Patagonia (around 168–161 Ma). This finding has dual importance because it represents the oldest-known tadpole and, to our knowledge, the first stem-anuran larva. Its exquisite preservation, including soft tissues, shows features associated with the filter-feeding mechanism characteristic of extant tadpoles4,5. Notably, both N. degiustoi tadpole and adult reached a large size, demonstrating that tadpole gigantism occurred among stem-anurans. This new discovery reveals that a biphasic life cycle, with filter-feeding tadpoles inhabiting aquatic ephemeral environments, was already present in the early evolutionary history of stem-anurans and has remained stable for at least 161 million years.",

          "abstract": "Approximately 3.4 million patients worldwide are diagnosed each year with cancers that harbor pathogenic mutations in one of three RAS proto-oncogenes (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS)1,2. These mutations impair the GTPase activity of RAS, leading to activation of downstream signaling and proliferation3-6. Long-standing efforts to restore the hydrolase activity of RAS mutants have been unsuccessful, extinguishing any consideration towards a viable therapeutic strategy7. Here we show that tri-complex inhibitors, that is, molecular glues with the ability to recruit cyclophilin A (CYPA) to the active state of RAS have a dual mechanism of action: not only do they prevent activated RAS from binding to its effectors, but, unexpectedly, they also stimulate GTP hydrolysis. Drug-bound CYPA complexes modulate residues in the switch II motif of RAS to coordinate the nucleophilic attack on the ɣ phosphate of GTP, in a mutation-specific manner. RAS mutants most sensitive to stimulation of GTPase activity were more susceptible to treatment compared to mutants whose hydrolysis could not be enhanced, suggesting that pharmacologic stimulation of hydrolysis potentiates the therapeutic effects of tri-complex inhibitors for specific RAS mutants. This study lays the foundation for developing a new class of therapeutics that inhibit cancer growth by stimulating mutant GTPase activity.",

          "abstract": "Although coronaviruses use diverse receptors, the characterization of coronaviruses with unknown receptors has been impeded by a lack of infection models1,2. Here we introduce a strategy to engineer functional customized viral receptors (CVRs). The modular design relies on building artificial receptor scaffolds comprising various modules and generating specific virus-binding domains. We identify key factors for CVRs to functionally mimic native receptors by facilitating spike proteolytic cleavage, membrane fusion, pseudovirus entry and propagation for various coronaviruses. We delineate functional SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding sites for CVR design and reveal the mechanism of cell entry promoted by the N-terminal domain-targeting S2L20-CVR. We generated CVR-expressing cells for 12 representative coronaviruses from 6 subgenera, most of which lack known receptors, and show that a pan-sarbecovirus CVR supports propagation of a propagation-competent HKU3 pseudovirus and of authentic RsHuB2019A3. Using an HKU5-specific CVR, we successfully rescued wild-type and ZsGreen-HiBiT-incorporated HKU5-1 (LMH03f) and isolated a HKU5 strain from bat samples. Our study demonstrates the potential of the CVR strategy for establishing native receptor-independent infection models, providing a tool for studying viruses that lack known susceptible target cells.",

          "abstract": "Lytic cell death culminates in plasma membrane rupture (PMR), which releases large intracellular molecules to augment the inflammatory response. PMR is mediated by the effector membrane protein ninjurin-1 (NINJ1)1, which polymerises and ruptures the membrane via its hydrophilic face1–4. How NINJ1 is restrained under steady-state conditions to ensure cell survival remains a mystery. Here we describe the molecular underpinnings of NINJ1 inhibition. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we determined the structure of inactive-state mouse NINJ1 bound to a newly-developed nanobody, Nb538. Inactive NINJ1 forms a face-to-face homodimer by adopting a 3-helix conformation with unkinked transmembrane helix 1 (TM1), in contrast to the 4-helix TM1-kinked active conformation2–4. Accordingly, endogenous NINJ1 from primary macrophages is a dimer under steady-state conditions. Inactive dimers sequester the PMR-inducing hydrophilic face of NINJ1 and occlude the binding site for kinked TM1 from neighbouring activated NINJ1 molecules. Mutagenesis studies in cells show that destabilisation of inactive face-to-face dimers leads to NINJ1-mediated cell death, whereas stabilisation of face-to-face dimers inhibits NINJ1 activity. Moreover, destabilising mutations prompt spontaneous TM1 kink formation, a hallmark of NINJ1 activation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that dimeric NINJ1 is autoinhibited in trans to prevent unprovoked PMR and cell death.",

          "abstract": "The circadian rhythm of the immune system helps to protect against pathogens1,2,3; however, the role of circadian rhythms in immune homeostasis is less well understood. Innate T cells are tissue-resident lymphocytes with key roles in tissue homeostasis4,5,6,7. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing, a molecular-clock reporter and genetic manipulations to show that innate IL-17-producing T cells—including γδ T cells, invariant natural killer T cells and mucosal-associated invariant T cells—are enriched for molecular-clock genes compared with their IFNγ-producing counterparts. We reveal that IL-17-producing γδ (γδ17) T cells, in particular, rely on the molecular clock to maintain adipose tissue homeostasis, and exhibit a robust circadian rhythm for RORγt and IL-17A across adipose depots, which peaks at night. In mice, loss of the molecular clock in the CD45 compartment (Bmal1∆Vav1) affects the production of IL-17 by adipose γδ17 T cells, but not cytokine production by αβ or IFNγ-producing γδ (γδIFNγ) T cells. Circadian IL-17 is essential for de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue, and mice with an adipocyte-specific deficiency in IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) have defects in de novo lipogenesis. Whole-body metabolic analysis in vivo shows that Il17a−/−Il17f−/− mice (which lack expression of IL-17A and IL-17F) have defects in their circadian rhythm for de novo lipogenesis, which results in disruptions to their whole-body metabolic rhythm and core-body-temperature rhythm. This study identifies a crucial role for IL-17 in whole-body metabolic homeostasis and shows that de novo lipogenesis is a major target of IL-17.",

This was combined with 48 matched single-nucleus RNA sequencing samples and 22 matched co-detection by indexing (CODEX) samples. To describe tumour structures and habitats, we defined ‘tumour microregions’ as spatially distinct cancer cell clusters separated by stromal components. They varied in size and density among cancer types, with the largest microregions observed in metastatic samples. We further grouped microregions with shared genetic alterations into ‘spatial subclones’. Thirty five tumour sections exhibited subclonal structures. Spatial subclones with distinct copy number variations and mutations displayed differential oncogenic activities. We identified increased metabolic activity at the centre and increased antigen presentation along the leading edges of microregions. We also observed variable T cell infiltrations within microregions and macrophages predominantly residing at tumour boundaries. We reconstructed 3D tumour structures by co-registering 48 serial ST sections from 16 samples, which provided insights into the spatial organization and heterogeneity of tumours. Additionally, using an unsupervised deep-learning algorithm and integrating ST and CODEX data, we identified both immune hot and cold neighbourhoods and enhanced immune exhaustion markers surrounding the 3D subclones.

RAS mutations occur invariably late in the course of acute myeloid leukaemia, upon progression or relapsed/refractory disease1,2,3,4,5,6. Here, by using human leukaemogenesis models, we first show that RAS mutations are obligatory late events that need to succeed earlier cooperating mutations. We provide the mechanistic explanation for this in a requirement for mutant RAS to specifically transform committed progenitors of the myelomonocytic lineage (granulocyte–monocyte progenitors) harbouring previously acquired driver mutations, showing that advanced leukaemic clones can originate from a different cell type in the haematopoietic hierarchy than ancestral clones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RAS-mutant leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) give rise to monocytic disease, as observed frequently in patients with poor responses to treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. We show that this is because RAS-mutant LSCs, in contrast to RAS-wild-type LSCs, have altered BCL2 family gene expression and are resistant to venetoclax, driving clinical resistance and relapse with monocytic features. Our findings demonstrate that a specific genetic driver shapes the non-genetic cellular hierarchy of acute myeloid leukaemia by imposing a specific LSC target cell restriction and critically affects therapeutic outcomes in patients.",

Using this approach, we uncovered precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during mouse embryonic development, unconventional developmental relationships between cell types and new epithelial progenitor states by their unique genetic histories. Analysis of mouse adenomas, coupled to multiomic and single-cell profiling of human precancers, with clonal analysis of 418 human polyps, demonstrated the occurrence of polyclonal initiation in 15–30% of colonic precancers, showing their origins from multiple normal founders.

How aberrant dosage of X-linked genes impairs FGC development in humans remains poorly understood. FGCs of patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS), who have an extra X chromosome, provide natural models for addressing this issue3. Here we demonstrate that most human FGCs in KS are arrested at an early stage, characterized by the upregulation of genes related to pluripotency, the WNT pathway and the TGF-β pathway, along with the downregulation of genes involved in FGC differentiation. The limited KS FGCs that are capable of reaching the late stage remain relatively naive. X chromosomes are not inactivated and the dosage of X-linked genes is excessive in KS FGCs. X-linked genes dominate the differentially expressed genes and are enriched in critical biological processes associated with the developmental delay of KS FGCs. Moreover, aberrant interactions between Sertoli cells and FGCs disrupt the migration of late FGCs to the basement membrane in KS. Notably, inhibition of the TGF-β pathway improves the differentiation of KS FGCs. Our findings elucidate how the extra X chromosome impairs the development of male FGCs and reveal the initial molecular events preceding germ cell loss in KS.",

It is highly desired yet very challenging to assemble MXene flakes into macroscopic high-performance materials in a scalable manner. Here we demonstrate a scalable strategy to fabricate high-performance MXene films by roll-to-roll-assisted blade coating (RBC) integrated with sequential bridging, providing good photothermal conversion and osteogenesis efficiency under near-infrared irradiation. MXene flakes were first bridged with silk sericin by hydrogen bonding and then assembled into macroscopic films using a continuous RBC process, followed by ionic bridging to freeze their aligned structure. The resultant large-scale MXene films with strong interlayer interactions are highly aligned and densified, exhibiting high tensile strength (755 MPa), toughness (17.4 MJ m−3) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding capacity (78,000 dB cm2 g−1), as well as good ambient stability, photothermal conversion and bone regeneration performance. The proposed strategy not only paves a feasible way for realizing the practical applications of MXene in the fields of flexible EMI shielding materials and bone tissue engineering but also provides an avenue for the high-performance and scalable assembly of other two-dimensional flakes.",

Through quantitative analysis of high-resolution phylogenies including 260,922 single cells from normal, inflamed and neoplastic intestinal tissues, we identified tens of independent cell lineages undergoing parallel clonal expansions within each lesion. We also found polyclonal origins of human sporadic colorectal polyps through bulk whole-exome sequencing and single-gland whole-genome sequencing. Genomic and clinical data support a model of polyclonal-to-monoclonal transition, with monoclonal lesions representing a more advanced stage. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed extensive intercellular interactions in early polyclonal lesions, but there was significant loss of interactions during monoclonal transition. Therefore, our data suggest that colorectal precancer is often founded by many different lineages and highlight their cooperative interactions in the earliest stages of cancer formation.

          "abstract": "How the olfactory system detects and distinguishes odorants with diverse physicochemical properties and molecular configurations remains poorly understood. Vertebrate animals perceive odours through G protein-coupled odorant receptors (ORs)1. In humans, around 400 ORs enable the sense of smell. The OR family comprises two main classes: class I ORs are tuned to carboxylic acids whereas class II ORs, which represent most of the human repertoire, respond to a wide variety of odorants2. A fundamental challenge in understanding olfaction is the inability to visualize odorant binding to ORs. Here we uncover molecular properties of odorant–OR interactions by using engineered ORs crafted using a consensus protein design strategy3. Because such consensus ORs (consORs) are derived from the 17 major subfamilies of human ORs, they provide a template for modelling individual native ORs with high sequence and structural homology. The biochemical tractability of consORs enabled the determination of four cryogenic electron microscopy structures of distinct consORs with specific ligand recognition properties. The structure of a class I consOR, consOR51, showed high structural similarity to the native human receptor OR51E2 and generated a homology model of a related member of the human OR51 family with high predictive power. Structures of three class II consORs revealed distinct modes of odorant-binding and activation mechanisms between class I and class II ORs. Thus, the structures of consORs lay the groundwork for understanding molecular recognition of odorants by the OR superfamily.",

We uncover new optical phonon modes, coupling strongly with electrons, in the energy range of 75–99 meV. These modes are characterized by out-of-plane vibrations of oxygen atoms in the interfacial double-TiOx layer and the apical oxygens in STO. Our results also demonstrate that the EPC strength and superconducting gap of 1 uc FeSe/STO are closely related to the interlayer spacing between FeSe and the TiOx terminated STO.

          "abstract": "Softening of the transverse optical (TO) phonon, which could trigger ferroelectric phase transition, can usually be achieved by enhancing the long-range Coulomb interaction over the short-range bonding force1, for example, by increasing the Born effective charges2. However, it suffers from depolarization effects3,4 as the induced ferroelectricity is suppressed on size reduction of the host materials towards high-density nanoscale electronics. Here, we present an alternative route to drive the TO phonon softening by showing that the abnormal soft TO phonon in rocksalt-structured ultrawide-bandgap BeO (ref. 5) is mainly induced by a substantial reduction in the short-range bonding interaction due to the Be–O bond stretching caused by an electron cloud-overlap-induced Coulomb repulsion between two adjacent oxygen ions that are arranged octahedrally around an extremely small Be ion. We further demonstrate the emergence of robust ferroelectricity in strain-induced perovskite BaZrO3 and ultrathin HfO2 and ZrO2 films6,7 grown epitaxially on lattice-mismatched SiO2/Si substrate arising from the softening of the TO phonon driven by a reduction in the short-range bonding strength of biaxial strain-induced stretching bonds. These findings shed light on developing a unified theory for ferroelectricity enhancement in ultrathin films free from depolarization fields by tailoring chemical bonds using ionic radius differences, strains, doping and lattice distortions.",

Leptin regulates food intake by inhibiting orexigenic agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons and activating anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons 2 . However, whereas AGRP neurons regulate food intake on a rapid time scale, acute activation of POMC neurons has only a minimal effect 3–5 . This has raised the possibility that there is a heretofore unidentified leptin-regulated neural population that rapidly suppresses appetite. Here we report the discovery of a new population of leptin-target neurons expressing basonuclin 2 ( Bnc2 ) in the arcuate nucleus that acutely suppress appetite by directly inhibiting AGRP neurons. Opposite to the effect of AGRP activation, BNC2 neuronal activation elicited a place preference indicative of positive valence in hungry but not fed mice. The activity of BNC2 neurons is modulated by leptin, sensory food cues and nutritional status. Finally, deleting leptin receptors in BNC2 neurons caused marked hyperphagia and obesity, similar to that observed in a leptin receptor knockout in AGRP neurons. These data indicate that BNC2-expressing neurons are a key component of the neural circuit that maintains energy balance, thus filling an important gap in our understanding of the regulation of food intake and leptin action.",

We estimate that an area of 215 million hectares—an area greater than the entire country of Mexico—has potential for natural forest regeneration, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration potential of 23.4 Gt C (range, 21.1–25.7 Gt) over 30 years. Five countries (Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Colombia) account for 52% of this estimated potential, showcasing the need for targeting restoration initiatives that leverage natural regeneration potential.

Here, to quantify dynamics of long-term stem cell engraftment, we sequenced genomes from 2,824 single-cell-derived haematopoietic colonies of ten donor–recipient pairs taken 9–31 years after HLA-matched sibling HCT 3 . With younger donors (18–47 years at transplant), 5,000–30,000 stem cells had engrafted and were still contributing to haematopoiesis at the time of sampling; estimates were tenfold lower with older donors (50–66 years). Engrafted cells made multilineage contributions to myeloid, B lymphoid and T lymphoid populations, although individual clones often showed biases towards one or other mature cell type. Recipients had lower clonal diversity than matched donors, equivalent to around 10–15 years of additional ageing, arising from up to 25-fold greater expansion of stem cell clones. A transplant-related population bottleneck could not explain these differences; instead, phylogenetic trees evinced two distinct modes of HCT-specific selection. In pruning selection, cell divisions underpinning recipient-enriched clonal expansions had occurred in the donor, preceding transplant—their selective advantage derived from preferential mobilization, collection, survival ex vivo or initial homing. In growth selection, cell divisions underpinning clonal expansion occurred in the recipient’s marrow after engraftment, most pronounced in clones with multiple driver mutations. Uprooting stem cells from their native environment and transplanting them to foreign soil exaggerates selective pressures, distorting and accelerating the loss of clonal diversity compared to the unperturbed haematopoiesis of donors.",

In fact, it remains physically connected to and can be influenced by the peripheral immune system1. How the CNS retains such responsiveness while maintaining an immunologically unique status remains an outstanding conundrum. In searching for molecular cues that derive from the CNS and allow its direct communication with the immune system, we discovered an endogenous repertoire of CNS-derived regulatory self-peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecules at the CNS borders. During homeostasis, these regulatory self-peptides were found to be bound to MHC II molecules throughout the path of lymphatic drainage from the brain to its surrounding meninges and its draining cervical lymph nodes. With neuroinflammatory disease, however, the presentation of regulatory self-peptides diminished. Upon boosting the presentation of these regulatory self-peptides, a population of suppressor CD4+ T cells was expanded, controlling CNS autoimmunity in a CTLA-4 and TGFβ dependent manner. This unexpected discovery of CNS-derived autoimmune self-peptides may be the molecular key adapting the CNS to maintain continuous dialogue with the immune system while balancing overt autoreactivity. This sheds new light on how we conceptually think about and therapeutically target neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.",

Recent studies of antigenic variation in vivo have focused near exclusively on parasites in the bloodstream6,7,8, but research has shown that many, if not most, parasites reside in the interstitial spaces of tissues9,10,11,12,13. We sought to explore the dynamics of antigenic variation in extravascular parasite populations using VSG-seq7, a high-throughput sequencing approach for profiling VSGs expressed in populations of T. brucei. Here we show that tissues, not the blood, are the primary reservoir of antigenic diversity during both needle- and tsetse bite-initiated T. brucei infections, with more than 75% of VSGs found exclusively within extravascular spaces. We found that this increased diversity is correlated with slower parasite clearance in tissue spaces. Together, these data support a model in which the slower immune response in extravascular spaces provides more time to generate the antigenic diversity needed to maintain a chronic infection. Our findings reveal the important role that extravascular spaces can have in pathogen diversification.",

However, the processes of englacial water accumulation, storage and ultimate release remain poorly constrained. Here we show that a noticeable amount of the summertime meltwater mass is temporally buffered along the entire GrIS periphery, peaking in July and gradually reducing thereafter. Our results arise from quantifying the spatiotemporal behaviour of the total mass of water leaving the GrIS by analysing bedrock elastic deformation measured by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations. The buffered meltwater causes a subsidence of the bedrock close to GNSS stations of at most approximately 5 mm during the melt season. Regionally, the duration of meltwater storage ranges from 4.5 weeks in the southeast to 9 weeks elsewhere. We also show that the meltwater runoff modelled from regional climate models may contain systematic errors, requiring further scaling of up to about 20% for the warmest years. These results reveal a high potential for GNSS data to constrain poorly known hydrological processes in Greenland, forming the basis for improved projections of future GrIS melt behaviour and the associated sea-level rise 6 .",

However, we lack an understanding of metastatic cell states and the mechanisms by which they transition. Here, in a cohort of biospecimen trios from same-patient normal colon, primary and metastatic colorectal cancer, we show that, although primary tumours largely adopt LGR5+ intestinal stem-like states, metastases display progressive plasticity. Cancer cells lose intestinal cell identities and reprogram into a highly conserved fetal progenitor state before undergoing non-canonical differentiation into divergent squamous and neuroendocrine-like states, a process that is exacerbated in metastasis and by chemotherapy and is associated with poor patient survival. Using matched patient-derived organoids, we demonstrate that metastatic cells exhibit greater cell-autonomous multilineage differentiation potential in response to microenvironment cues compared with their intestinal lineage-restricted primary tumour counterparts. We identify PROX1 as a repressor of non-intestinal lineage in the fetal progenitor state, and show that downregulation of PROX1 licenses non-canonical reprogramming.",

          "abstract": "Prokaryotic anti-phage immune systems use TIR and cGAS-like enzymes to produce 1′′-3′-glycocyclic ADP-ribose (1′′-3′-gcADPR) and cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) and cyclic trinucleotide (CTN) signalling molecules, respectively, which limit phage replication1,2,3. However, how phages neutralize these distinct and common systems is largely unclear. Here we show that the Thoeris anti-defence proteins Tad14 and Tad25 both achieve anti-cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling system (anti-CBASS) activity by simultaneously sequestering CBASS cyclic oligonucleotides. Apart from binding to the Thoeris signals 1′′-3′-gcADPR and 1′′-2′-gcADPR, Tad1 also binds to numerous CBASS CDNs and CTNs with high affinity, inhibiting CBASS systems that use these molecules in vivo and in vitro. The hexameric Tad1 has six binding sites for CDNs or gcADPR, which are independent of the two high-affinity binding sites for CTNs. Tad2 forms a tetramer that also sequesters various CDNs in addition to gcADPR molecules, using distinct binding sites to simultaneously bind to these signals. Thus, Tad1 and Tad2 are both two-pronged inhibitors that, alongside anti-CBASS protein 2 (Acb26,7,8), establish a paradigm of phage proteins that use distinct binding sites to flexibly sequester a considerable breadth of cyclic nucleotides.",

Here we analysed 38 ancient genomes and found 4 distinct population ancestries in the aurochs—European, Southwest Asian, North Asian and South Asian—each of which has dynamic trajectories that have responded to changes in climate and human influence. Similarly to Homo heidelbergensis, aurochsen first entered Europe around 650 thousand years ago2, but early populations left only trace ancestry, with both North Asian and European B. primigenius genomes coalescing during the most recent glaciation. North Asian and European populations then appear separated until mixing after the climate amelioration of the early Holocene. European aurochsen endured the more severe bottleneck during the Last Glacial Maximum, retreating to southern refugia before recolonizing from Iberia. Domestication involved the capture of a small number of individuals from the Southwest Asian aurochs population, followed by early and pervasive male-mediated admixture involving each ancestral strain of aurochs after domestic stocks dispersed beyond their cradle of origin.",

A substantial and expanding category of 3D-printing processes — sometimes called digital light manufacturing — uses patterns of light projected onto a liquid resin to trigger the liquid to solidify at defined positions, thereby forming solid structures in desired shapes. The ultimate goal is to develop these processes to rapidly print features at microscopic scales using a range of materials, with excellent surface finishes and at sizes suitable for industrial applications (potentially up to a scale of many centimetres). However, practical issues limit the speeds of current processes, and the quality of the resulting objects is reduced by the scattering, refraction and absorption of the light patterns in the liquid. Writing in Nature, Vidler and colleagues1 report a 3D-printing strategy that could solve these problems.",

Devices made from materials that can retain information without electricity would therefore save huge amounts of energy, so these ‘non-volatile’ memory systems are highly sought after. Ferroelectrics are a promising option; these materials have an intrinsic polarization that can take one of two values (corresponding to the 1 and 0 bits), and an electric field can switch between them. But ferroelectric polarization tends to disappear when these materials are very thin, which is a problem in the constant march towards miniaturization1. In a paper in Nature, Cao et al.2 present an innovative framework for designing ferroelectric materials that have a robust polarization — but are also ultrathin.",

In this work, we illustrate use of a new regulatory framework to enable computational research on film that permits circumvention of technological protection measures on digital video discs (DVDs). We use this exemption to legally digitize a collection of 2,307 films representing the top 50 movies by U.S. box office over the period 1980 to 2022, along with award nominees. We design a computational pipeline for measuring the representation of gender and race/ethnicity in film, drawing on computer vision models for recognizing actors and human perceptions of gender and race/ethnicity. Doing so allows us to learn substantive facts about representation and diversity in Hollywood over this period, confirming earlier studies that see an increase in diversity over the past decade, while allowing us to use computational methods to uncover a range of ad hoc analytical findings. Our work illustrates the affordances of the data-driven analysis of film at a large scale.",

          "abstract": "While female education has long been recognized as a key driver of fertility decline during the process of demographic transition and most population projection models consider it implicitly or explicitly in their forecasts of overall fertility, there still is need for a method to forecast education-specific fertility trends directly. Here we propose a method for projecting education-specific fertility declines for cohorts of women in Sub-Saharan Africa based on all available demographic and health surveys data for African countries (including 1.03Mio cases). We study at different levels of aggregation (sample clusters, strata, and national) the associations between ideal family size and completed cohort fertility for education groups, on the one hand, and the average level of education in those units, on the other. The consistently very strong empirical associations suggest a plausible narrative by which a higher prevalence of educated women in a spatial unit influences the fertility levels of women in all specific education categories. Empirical associations between education-specific cohort fertility trends at the national level and newly available quality-adjusted human capital data for these cohorts are then operationalized to produce education-specific population projections as they are needed for—among other uses—the shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios that are widely used in the climate change research community. Sensitivity analyses including out-of-sample projections support the validity of the proposed method which is then applied to 37 African countries.",

But how well these factors are managed within and between firms may be a key determinant of a country’s productivity and its GDP. Although social scientists have long studied the role of management practices in shaping business performance, their primary tool has been individual case studies. While useful for theory-building, such qualitative work is hard to scale and quantify. We present a large, scalable dataset measuring structured management practices at the business level across multiple countries. We measure practices related to performance monitoring, target-setting, and human resources. We document a set of key stylized facts, which we label “the international empirics of management”. In all countries, firms with more structured practices tend to also have superior economic performance: they are larger in scale, are more profitable, have higher labor productivity and are more likely to export. This consistency was not obvious ex-ante, and being able to quantify these relationships is valuable. We also document significant variation in practices across and within countries, which is important in explaining differences in the wealth of nations. The positive relationship between firm size and structured management practices is stronger in countries with more open and free markets, suggesting that stronger competition may allow firms with more structured management practices to grow larger, thereby potentially raising aggregate national income.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, economic activity has become increasingly concentrated in major global metropolises. Yet, the rise of working from home threatens this dominance of cities. Using multiple high-frequency datasets on spending, commuting, migration, and housing, we provide global evidence that remote work has dispersed economic activity away from city centers. We label this the “Donut Effect,” which is much larger and more persistent in cities with high levels of remote work. Using detailed household microdata from the United States, we show that three-fifths of households that left city centers in big cities moved to the suburbs of the same city. This is likely explained by the rise of hybrid work, in which employees still commute to the office a few days a week. The enduring popularity of hybrid work into 2024 suggests that the Donut Effect will persist while also leaving broader metropolitan areas intact.",

          "abstract": "How are societal stereotypes transmitted to individual-level group preferences? We propose that exposure to a stereotype, regardless of whether one agrees with it, can shape how one experiences and learns from interactions with members of the stereotyped group, such that it induces individual-level prejudice—a process involving the interplay of semantic knowledge and instrumental learning. In a series of experiments, participants interacted with players from two groups, described with either positive or negative stereotypes, in a reinforcement learning (RL) task presented as a money-sharing game. Although players’ actual sharing rates were equated between groups, participants formed more positive reward associations with players from positively stereotyped than negatively stereotyped groups. This effect persisted even when stereotypes were described as unreliable and participants were instructed to ignore them. Computational modeling revealed that this preference was due to stereotype effects on priors regarding group members’ behavior as well as the learning rates through which reward associations were updated in response to player feedback. We then show that these stereotype-induced preferences, once formed, spread unwittingly to others who observe these interactions, illustrating a pathway through which stereotypes may be transmitted and propagated between society and individuals. By identifying a mechanism through which stereotype knowledge can bypass explicit beliefs to induce prejudice, via the interplay of semantic and instrumental learning processes, these findings illuminate the impact of stereotype messages on the formation and propagation of individual-level prejudice.",

          "abstract": "As the world’s climate continues to change, human populations are exposed to increasingly severe and extreme weather conditions that can promote migration. Here, we examine how extreme weather influences the likelihood of undocumented migration and return between Mexico and the United States. We used data from 48,313 individuals observed between 1992 and 2018 in 84 Mexican agricultural communities. While controlling for regional and temporal confounding factors, we related individual decisions to migrate to the United States without documents and subsequently return to Mexico with lagged weather deviations from the historical norm during the corn-growing season (May to August). Undocumented migration was most likely from areas experiencing extreme drought, and migrants were less likely to return to their communities of origin when extreme weather persisted. These findings establish the role of weather shocks in undocumented Mexican migration to, and eventual settlement in, the United States. The findings also suggest that extreme weather conditions, which are likely to increase with climate change, promote clandestine mobility across borders and, thus, expose migrants to risks associated with crossing dangerous terrain and relying upon smugglers.",

          "abstract": "The “27 Club” refers to the widespread legend that notable people, particularly musicians, are unusually likely to die at age 27. A 2011 inquiry in The BMJ showed this is not the case, dismissing the 27 Club as a myth. We expand on this discourse by demonstrating that although the existence of the phenomenon cannot be empirically validated, it is real in its consequences. Using Wikipedia data, we show that while age 27 does not hold greater risk of mortality for notable persons, those who died at 27 are as a group exceptionally notable compared to those who died at other young ages. The 27 Club legend originated from a statistically improbable event circa 1970, wherein four superstar musicians died within the span of 2 y all at age 27. This coincidence captured the public imagination such that our fascination with the 27 Club brought itself into being, producing greater interest in those who died at age 27 than would have been otherwise. This demonstrates path dependence in cultural evolution, whereby an effectively random event evolves into a narrative that shapes otherwise unrelated events and thus the way we make and interpret history.",

          "abstract": "One of the first organizing processes during animal development is the assembly of embryonic cells into epithelia. Common features unite epithelialization across select bilaterians, however, we know less about the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive epithelial emergence in early branching nonbilaterians. In sea anemones, epithelia emerge both during embryonic development and after cell aggregation of dissociated tissues. Although adhesion is required to keep cells together, it is not clear whether cell polarization plays a role as epithelia emerge from disordered aggregates. Here, we use the embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to investigate the evolutionary origins of epithelial development. We demonstrate that lateral cell polarization is essential for epithelial organization in both embryos and aggregates. With disrupted lateral polarization, cell contact in the aggregate is not sufficient to trigger epithelialization and further tissue development. Specifically, knockdown of the conserved lateral polarity and tumor suppressor protein Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) disrupts epithelia in developing embryos and impairs the capacity of dissociated cells to epithelialize from aggregates. In contrast to other systems, cells in Nematostella lgl knockdown embryos do not undergo excessive proliferation. Cells with reduced Lgl levels lose their columnar shape and proper positioning of their mitotic spindles and basal bodies. Due to misoriented divisions and aberrant shapes, cells arrange nonuniformly without forming a monolayer. Together our data show that, in Nematostella, Lgl drives epithelialization in embryos and cell aggregates through its effect on cell shape and organelle localization.",

          "abstract": "Mutations modification enzymes including the tRNA N 7 -methylguanosine (m 7 G) methyltransferase complex component WDR4 were frequently found in patients with neural disorders, while the pathogenic mechanism and therapeutic intervention strategies are poorly explored. In this study, we revealed that patient-derived WDR4 mutation leads to temporal and cell-type-specific neural degeneration, and directly causes neural developmental disorders in mice. Mechanistically, WDR4 point mutation disrupts the interaction between WDR4 and METTL1 and accelerates METTL1 protein degradation. We further uncovered that impaired tRNA m 7 G modification caused by Wdr4 mutation decreases the mRNA translation of genes involved in mTOR pathway, leading to elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, and increases neural cell apoptosis. Importantly, treatment with stress-attenuating drug Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) significantly decreases neural cell death and improves neural functions of the Wdr4 mutated mice. Moreover, adeno-associated virus mediated transduction of wild-type WDR4 restores METTL1 protein level and tRNA m 7 G modification in the mouse brain, and achieves long-lasting therapeutic effect in Wdr4 mutated mice. Most importantly, we further demonstrated that both TUDCA treatment and WDR4 restoration significantly improve the survival and functions of human iPSCs-derived neuron stem cells that harbor the patient’s WDR4 mutation. Overall, our study uncovers molecular insights underlying WDR4 mutation in the pathogenesis of neural diseases and develops two promising therapeutic strategies for treatment of neural diseases caused by impaired tRNA modifications.",

          "abstract": "Active systems of self-propelled agents, e.g., birds, fish, and bacteria, can organize their collective motion into myriad autonomous behaviors. Ubiquitous in nature and across length scales, such phenomena are also amenable to artificial settings, e.g., where brainless self-propelled robots orchestrate their movements into spatial-temporal patterns via the application of external cues or when confined within flexible boundaries. Like their natural counterparts, these approaches typically require many units to initiate collective motion, so controlling the ensuing dynamics is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple mechanism that leverages nonlinear elasticity to tame near-diffusive motile particles in forming structures capable of directed motion and other emergent behaviors. Our elasto-active system comprises two centimeter-sized self-propelled microbots connected with elastic beams. These microbots exert forces that suffice to buckle the beam and set the structure in motion. We first rationalize the physics of the interaction between the beam and the microbots. Then we use reduced-order models to predict the interactions of our elasto-active structures with boundaries, e.g., walls and constrictions, and demonstrate how they can exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors such as maze navigation. These findings demonstrate that allowing and understanding changes in body morphology can enhance the capabilities of active matter systems and enable the design of robotic materials capable of space exploration, adaptation, and complex interactions with their surrounding environment.",

These results confirmed the exposure of Shigella to plasma components during its virulence cycle. We demonstrated that all the tested Shigella strains survived plasma exposure in vitro, and we showed that Serine Protease Autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs) contribute to Shigella dissemination within the colonic mucosa and in the bloodstream. We have confirmed that SPATEs are expressed and secreted in poorly oxygenated environments encountered by Shigella during late infection stages. We further demonstrated that SPATEs promoted Shigella survival in plasma, by cleaving complement component 3 (C3), thereby impairing the complement system activation. We have shown here that the ability of Shigella to survive plasma exposure is a key factor in its virulence, both within primary foci and systemically.",

          "abstract": "How can a single protein domain encode a conformational landscape with multiple stably folded states, and how do those states interconvert? Here, we use real-time and relaxation-dispersion NMR to characterize the conformational landscape of the circadian rhythm protein KaiB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides . Unique among known natural metamorphic proteins, this KaiB variant spontaneously interconverts between two monomeric states: the “Ground” and “Fold-switched” (FS) states. KaiB in its FS state interacts with multiple binding partners, including the central KaiC protein, to regulate circadian rhythms. We find that KaiB itself takes hours to interconvert between the Ground and FS state, underscoring the ability of a single-sequence to encode the slow process needed for function. We reveal the rate-limiting step between the Ground and FS state is the cis–trans isomerization of three prolines in the fold-switching region by demonstrating interconversion acceleration by the prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A. The interconversion proceeds through a “partially disordered” (PD) state, where the C-terminal half becomes disordered while the N-terminal half remains stably folded. We found two additional properties of KaiB’s landscape. First, the Ground state experiences cold denaturation: At 4 °C, the PD state becomes the majorly populated state. Second, the Ground state exchanges with a fourth state, the “Enigma” state, on the millisecond-timescale. We combine AlphaFold2-based predictions and NMR chemical shift predictions to predict this Enigma state is a beta-strand register shift that relieves buried charged residues, and support this structure experimentally. These results provide mechanistic insight into how evolution can design a single-sequence that achieves specific timing needed for its function.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling storage lipid accumulation will inform strategies to enhance seed oil quality and quantity in crop plants. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor (WRI1 TF) is a central regulator of lipid biosynthesis. We characterized the genome-wide binding profile of soybean (Gm)WRI1 and show that the TF directly regulates genes encoding numerous enzymes and proteins in the fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthetic pathways. GmWRI1 binds primarily to regions downstream of target gene transcription start sites. We showed that GmWRI1-bound regions are enriched for the canonical WRI1 DNA binding element, the ACTIVATOR of Spomin::LUC1/WRI1 (AW) Box (CNTNGNNNNNNNCG), and another DNA motif, the CNC Box (CNCCNCC). Functional assays showed that both DNA elements mediate transcriptional activation by GmWRI1. We also show that GmWRI1 works in concert with other TFs to establish a regulatory state that promotes fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. In particular, comparison of genes targeted directly by GmWRI1 and by GmLEC1, a central regulator of the maturation phase of seed development, reveals that the two TFs act in a positive feedback subcircuit to control fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Together, our results provide unique insights into the genetic circuitry in which GmWRI1 participates to regulate storage lipid accumulation during seed development.",

However, the realization of this promise is hindered by the unavailability of generalizable ground-truth information, data incompleteness and heterogeneity, and the lack of generalization to multiple cohorts. We present here a data-driven approach to identify clinical states that we implement for 585 critical care patients with suspected pneumonia recruited by the SCRIPT study, which we compare to and integrate with 9,918 pneumonia patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. We extract and curate from their structured EHRs a primary set of clinical features (53 and 59 features for SCRIPT and MIMIC-IV, respectively), including disease severity scores, vital signs, and so on, at various degrees of completeness. We aggregate irregular time series into daily frequency, resulting in 12,495 and 94,684 patient-day pairs for SCRIPT and MIMIC, respectively. We define a “common-sense” ground truth that we then use in a semisupervised pipeline to optimize choices for data preprocessing, and reduce the feature space to four principal components. We describe and validate an ensemble-based clustering method that enables us to robustly identify five clinical states, and use a Gaussian mixture model to quantify uncertainty in cluster assignment. Demonstrating the clinical relevance of the identified states, we find that three states are strongly associated with disease outcomes (dying vs. recovering), while the other two reflect disease etiology. The outcome associated clinical states provide significantly increased discrimination of mortality rates over standard approaches.",

Our findings reinforce PXR, LXR, FXR, and PPARα as regulators of lipid absorption. Furthermore, known hepatic effects of AHR and VDR activation were recapitulated in the human small intestine.

          "abstract": "The precise control of flowering time is of utmost importance for crop adaptation to varying environmental conditions and consequently determines grain yield and plant fitness. Soybean E2 , the homolog of Arabidopsis GIGANTEA , is a major locus contributing to high-latitude adaptation and is involved in photoperiod sensitivity. However, due to major effects of E2 , additional genetic loci controlling soybean flowering and adaptation have historically been masked and difficult to identify. Here, by eliminating the effect of E2 , we identified a Tof9 locus controlling flowering in which ZEITLUPE 2 ( ZTL2 ) is the causal gene. ZTL2 encodes an F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase with homology to Arabidopsis ZEITLUPE and is shown to play a key role in the soybean photoperiodic flowering pathway. ZTL2 physically interacts with E2 to mediate its degradation. Intriguingly, ZTL2 and FKF1, both belong to the F-box-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase family, exhibit opposite roles in regulating soybean flowering. ZTL2 degrades E2, leading to early flowering, while FKF1 stabilizes E2, resulting in delayed flowering. The balance between ZTL2-mediated degradation and FKF1-mediated stabilization enables soybeans to finetune flowering time and maximize grain yield. Field-grown ztl2 mutants are taller, flower late, and have increased yield parameters. ZTL2 and FKF1b bear contrasting artificial-selection patterns to adapt to different latitudes. This antagonistic regulation is crucial for soybean adaptation to diverse ecological settings and allows plants to fine-tune their flowering time in response to photoperiod and latitudinal changes.",

          "abstract": "The biomechanical properties of cells and tissues play an important role in our fundamental understanding of the structures and functions of biological systems at both the cellular and subcellular levels. Recently, Brillouin microscopy, which offers a label-free spectroscopic means of assessing viscoelastic properties in vivo, has emerged as a powerful way to interrogate those properties on a microscopic level in living tissues. However, susceptibility to photodamage and photobleaching, particularly when high-intensity laser beams are used to induce Brillouin scattering, poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a transformative approach designed to mitigate photodamage in biological and biomedical studies, enabling nondestructive, label-free assessments of mechanical properties in live biological samples. By leveraging quantum-light-enhanced stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) imaging contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly elevated, thereby increasing sample viability and extending interrogation times without compromising the integrity of living samples. The tangible impact of this methodology is evidenced by a notable three-fold increase in sample viability observed after subjecting the samples to three hours of continuous squeezed-light illumination, surpassing the traditional coherent light-based approaches. The quantum-enhanced SBS imaging holds promise across diverse fields, such as cancer biology and neuroscience where preserving sample vitality is of paramount significance. By mitigating concerns regarding photodamage and photobleaching associated with high-intensity lasers, this technological breakthrough expands our horizons for exploring the mechanical properties of live biological systems, paving the way for an era of research and clinical applications.",

ALKBH8 is a tRNA-modifying enzyme that methylates wobble uridines in a subset of tRNAs to modulate translation. Through methylation of tRNA-selenocysteine, ALKBH8 promotes selenoprotein synthesis and regulates redox homeostasis. Pathogenic variants in ALKBH8 have been linked to intellectual disability disorders in the human population, but the role of ALKBH8 in the nervous system is unknown. Through in vivo studies in Drosophila , we show that ALKBH8 controls oxidative stress in the brain to restrain synaptic growth and support learning and memory. ALKBH8 null animals lack wobble uridine methylation and exhibit reduced protein synthesis in the nervous system, including a specific decrease in selenoprotein levels. Either loss of ALKBH8 or independent disruption of selenoprotein synthesis results in ectopic synapse formation. Genetic expression of antioxidant enzymes fully suppresses synaptic overgrowth in ALKBH8 null animals, confirming oxidative stress as the underlying cause of dysregulation. ALKBH8 null animals also exhibit associative memory impairments that are reversed by pharmacological antioxidant treatment. Together, these findings demonstrate the critical role of tRNA wobble uridine modification in redox homeostasis in the developing nervous system and reveal antioxidants as a potential therapy for ALKBH8-associated intellectual disability.",

However, almost all previous observational and modeling studies have focused on the zonal mean two-dimensional AMOC feature, while recent progress in the understanding of modern AMOC reveals a more complicated three-dimensional structure, with NADW penetrating from the subpolar North Atlantic to lower latitude through different pathways. Here, combining 231 Pa/ 230 Th reconstructions and model simulations, we uncover a significant change in the three-dimensional structure of the glacial AMOC. Specifically, the mid-latitude eastern pathway (EP), located east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and transporting about half of the PD NADW from the subpolar gyre to the subtropical gyre, experienced substantial intensification during the LGM. A greater portion of the GNAIW was transported in the eastern basin during the LGM compared to NADW at the PD, resulting in opposite 231 Pa/ 230 Th changes between eastern and western basins during the LGM. Furthermore, in contrast to the wind-steering mechanism of EP at PD, the intensified LGM EP was caused primarily by the rim current forced by the basin-scale open-ocean convection over the subpolar North Atlantic. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for three-dimensional oceanographic changes to achieve more accurate reconstructions of past AMOC.",

          "abstract": "Attraction and mating between male and female animals depend on effective communication between conspecifics. However, in mosquitoes, we have only a rudimentary understanding of the sensory cues and receptors critical for the communication that is essential for reproductive behavior. While it is known that male Aedes aegypti use sound to help them identify females, it is not unclear whether sound detection is absolutely required since other cues such as vision may also participate in mating behavior. To determine the effect of eliminating hearing on mating success, we knocked out the Ae. aegypti TRPVa channel, which is a protein expressed in chordotonal neurons in the Johnston’s organ (JO) that respond to sound-induced movements in the antenna. Loss of trpVa eradicated sound-induced responses from the JO, thereby abolishing hearing. Strikingly, mutation of trpVa eliminated mating behavior in males. In contrast, trpVa -null females mated, although this behavior was slightly delayed relative to wild-type females. Males and females produce sounds as they beat their wings at distinct frequencies during flight. Sound mimicking the female wingbeat induced flight, attraction, and copulatory-like behavior in wild-type males without females present, but not in trpVa -null males. Males are known to modulate their wingbeat frequencies before mating in the air, which is a phenomenon referred to as rapid frequency modulation (RFM). We found that RFM was absent in mosquitoes lacking TRPVa. We conclude that the requirement for trpVa and hearing for male reproductive behavior in Aedes is absolute, as mating in the deaf males is eliminated.",

In this study, we validated that de novo DDX3X variants are enriched in female developmental delay (DD) patients and mainly affect the evolutionarily conserved amino acids based on a meta-analysis of 46,612 NDD trios. We generated a ddx3x deficient zebrafish allele, which exhibited reduced survival rate, DD, microcephaly, adaptation defects, anxiolytic behaviors, social interaction deficits, and impaired spatial recognitive memory. As revealed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing and biological validations, ddx3x deficiency leads to reduced neural stem cell pool, decreased total neuron number, and imbalanced differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which are responsible for the behavioral defects. Indeed, the supplementation of L-glutamate or glutamate receptor agonist ly404039 could partly rescue the adaptation and social deficits. Mechanistically, we reveal that the ddx3x deficiency attenuates the stability of the crebbp mRNA, which in turn causes downregulation of Notch signaling and defects in neurogenesis. Our study sheds light on the molecular pathology underlying the abnormal neurodevelopment and behavior of NDD patients with DDX3X mutations, as well as providing potential therapeutic targets for the precision treatment.",

Upon activation, OAS-RNase L suppresses virus replication by promoting the decay of host and viral RNAs and inducing translational shutdown. However, whether OASs and RNase L are the only factors involved in this pathway remains unclear. Here, we develop CRISPR-Translate, a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening method that uses translation levels as a readout and identifies IRF2 as a key regulator of OAS3. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that IRF2 promotes basal expression of OAS3 in unstressed cells, allowing a rapid activation of RNase L following viral infection. Furthermore, IRF2 works in concert with the interferon response through STAT2 to further enhance OAS3 expression. We propose that IRF2-induced RNase L is critical in enabling cells to mount a rapid antiviral response immediately after viral infection, serving as the initial line of defense. This rapid response provides host cells the necessary time to activate additional antiviral signaling pathways, forming secondary defense waves.",

          "abstract": "Tough soft materials such as multiple network elastomers (MNE) or filled elastomers are typically stretchable and include significant energy dissipation mechanisms that prevent or delay crack growth. Yet most studies and fracture models focus on steady-state propagation and damage is assumed to be decoupled from the local stress and strain fields near the crack tip. We report an in situ spatial-temporally resolved 3D measurement of molecular damage in mechanophore-labeled MNE just before a crack propagates. This technique, complemented by digital image correlation, allows us to compare the spatial distribution of both damage and deformation in single network (SN) elastomers and in MNE. Compared to SN, MNE have a wide-spread damage in front of the crack and, surprisingly, delocalize strain concentration. A continuum model, where damage distribution is fully coupled to the crack tip fields, is proposed to explain these results. Additional measurements of time-dependent molecular damage during fixed grips relaxation in the presence of a crack reveal that the less localized damage distribution delays fracture initiation. The observations and exploratory modeling reveal the dynamic fracture mechanism of MNE, providing guidance for rational design of high-performance tough elastomers.",

          "abstract": "The female reproductive lifespan is highly dependent on egg quality, especially the presence of a normal number of chromosomes in an egg, known as euploidy. Mistakes in meiosis leading to egg aneuploidy are frequent in humans. Yet, knowledge of the precise genetic landscape that causes egg aneuploidy in women is limited, as phenotypic data on the frequency of human egg aneuploidy are difficult to obtain and therefore absent in public genetic datasets. Here, we identify genetic determinants of reproductive aging via egg aneuploidy in women using a biobank of individual maternal exomes linked with maternal age and embryonic aneuploidy data. Using the exome data, we identified 404 genes bearing variants enriched in individuals with pathologically elevated egg aneuploidy rates. Analysis of the gene ontology and protein–protein interaction network implicated genes encoding the kinesin protein family in egg aneuploidy. We interrogate the causal relationship of the human variants within candidate kinesin genes via experimental perturbations and demonstrate that motor domain variants increase aneuploidy in mouse oocytes. Finally, using a knock-in mouse model, we validate that a specific variant in kinesin KIF18A accelerates reproductive aging and diminishes fertility. These findings reveal additional functional mechanisms of reproductive aging and shed light on how genetic variation underlies individual heterogeneity in the female reproductive lifespan, which might be leveraged to predict reproductive longevity. Together, these results lay the groundwork for the noninvasive biomarkers for egg quality, a first step toward personalized fertility medicine.",

          "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. C. difficile proliferates and produces toxins that damage the colonic epithelium, leading to symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea to severe pseudomembranous colitis. The host’s innate response to CDI occurs in two phases: an early phase in which neutrophils reduce the bacterial load and a late phase involving repair mechanisms to restore epithelial integrity. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are crucial in protecting the gut from CDI. Previous studies have shown that ILC3-derived IL-22 is essential in the late phase of CDI for epithelial repair and maintaining an intestinal microbiota that competes with C. difficile , preventing its expansion. Our study finds that ILC3s also protect during the early stages of CDI by sustaining neutrophils through GM-CSF. Less neutrophil production, accumulation, and activation was evident in ILC3-deficient mice than in wild-type (WT) mice, which led to exacerbated symptoms, impaired pathogen clearance, a compromised epithelial barrier, and increased mortality. The adoptive transfer of ILC3s into ILC3-deficient mice restored neutrophil responses and improved disease outcomes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that GM-CSF production by ILC3s is crucial for neutrophil production and effective resistance during CDI. Using mice lacking NKp46 + ILC3s, we found that this subset significantly contributes to GM-CSF production in CDI. These findings highlight the critical role of the ILC3-neutrophil connection in early innate responses to CDI. Enhancing ILC3 production of GM-CSF could be a promising strategy for improving host defense against CDI and other enteric infections.",

          "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cells and hold great promise as a class of biomarkers. This promise has led to increased interest in measuring EV proteins from both total EVs as well as brain-derived EVs in plasma. However, measuring cargo proteins in EVs has been challenging because EVs are present at low levels, and EV isolation methods are imperfect at separating EVs from free proteins. Thus, knowing whether a protein measured after EV isolation is truly inside EVs is difficult. In this study, we developed methods to measure whether a protein is inside EVs and quantify the ratio of a protein in EVs relative to total plasma. To achieve this, we combined a high-yield size-exclusion chromatography protocol with an optimized protease protection assay and Single Molecule Array (Simoa) digital enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) for ultrasensitive measurement of proteins inside EVs. We applied these methods to analyze α-synuclein and confirmed that a small fraction of the total plasma α-synuclein is inside EVs. Additionally, we developed a highly sensitive Simoa assay for phosphorylated α-synuclein (phosphorylated at the Ser129 residue). We found enrichment in the phosphorylated α-synuclein to total α-synuclein ratio inside EVs relative to outside EVs. Finally, we applied the methods we developed to measure total and phosphorylated α-synuclein inside EVs from Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia patient samples. This work provides a framework for determining the levels of proteins in EVs and represents an important step in the development of EV diagnostics for diseases of the brain, as well as other organs.",

          "abstract": "In sexual reproduction, selfish genetic elements known as killer meiotic drivers (KMDs) bias inheritance by eliminating gametes that do not carry them. The selective killing behavior of most KMDs can be explained by a toxin–antidote model, where a toxin harms all gametes while an antidote provides resistance to the toxin in carriers. This study investigates whether and how the KMD element tdk1 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe deploys this strategy. Intriguingly, tdk1 relies on a single protein product, Tdk1, for both killing and resistance. We show that Tdk1 exists in a nontoxic tetrameric form during vegetative growth and meiosis but transforms into a distinct toxic form in spores. This toxic form acquires the ability to interact with the histone reader Bdf1 and assembles into supramolecular foci that disrupt mitosis in noncarriers after spore germination. In contrast, Tdk1 synthesized during germination of carrier spores is nontoxic and acts as an antidote, dismantling the preformed toxic Tdk1 assemblies. Replacement of the N-terminal region of Tdk1 with a tetramer-forming peptide reveals its dual roles in imposing an autoinhibited tetrameric conformation and facilitating the assembly of supramolecular foci when autoinhibition is released. Moreover, we successfully reconstituted a functional KMD element by combining a construct that exclusively expresses Tdk1 during meiosis (“toxin-only”) with another construct that expresses Tdk1 specifically during germination (“antidote-only”). This work uncovers a remarkable example of a single protein employing structural duality to form a toxin–antidote pair, expanding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying toxin–antidote systems.",

          "abstract": "Killer meiotic drivers (KMDs) are selfish genetic elements that distort Mendelian inheritance by selectively killing meiotic products lacking the KMD element, thereby promoting their own propagation. Although KMDs have been found in diverse eukaryotes, only a limited number of them have been characterized at the molecular level, and their killing mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify that a gene previously deemed essential for cell survival in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a single-gene KMD. This gene, tdk1 , kills nearly all tdk1Δ progeny in a tdk1+ × tdk1Δ cross. By analyzing polymorphisms of tdk1 among natural strains, we identify a resistant haplotype, HT3. This haplotype lacks killing ability yet confers resistance to killing by the wild-type tdk1 . Proximity labeling experiments reveal an interaction between Tdk1, the protein product of tdk1 , and the epigenetic reader Bdf1. Interestingly, the nonkilling Tdk1-HT3 variant does not interact with Bdf1. Cryoelectron microscopy further elucidated the binding interface between Tdk1 and Bdf1, pinpointing mutations within Tdk1-HT3 that disrupt this interface. During sexual reproduction, Tdk1 forms stable Bdf1-binding nuclear foci in all spores after meiosis. These foci persist in germinated tdk1Δ progeny and impede chromosome segregation during mitosis by generating aberrant chromosomal adhesions. This study identifies a KMD that masquerades as an essential gene and reveals the molecular mechanism by which this KMD hijacks cellular machinery to execute killing. Additionally, we unveil that losing the hijacking ability is an evolutionary path for this single-gene KMD to evolve into a nonkilling resistant haplotype.",

          "abstract": "Pastures, on which ruminant livestock graze, occupy one third of the earth’s surface. Removing livestock from pastures can support climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration in regrowing vegetation and recovering soils, particularly in potentially forested areas. However, this would also decrease food and fiber production, generating a tradeoff with pasture productivity and the ruminant meat production pastures support. We evaluate the magnitude and distribution of this tradeoff globally, called the “carbon opportunity intensity” of pastures, at a 5-arcminute resolution. We find that removing beef–producing cattle from high–carbon intensity pastures could sequester 34 (22 to 43) GtC i.e. 125 (80 to 158) GtCO 2 into ecosystems, which is an amount greater than global fossil CO 2 emissions from 2021–2023. This would lead to only a minor loss of 13 (9 to 18)% of the global total beef production on pastures, predominantly within high- and upper-middle-income countries. If areas with low–carbon intensity pastures and less efficient beef production simultaneously intensified their beef production to 47% of OECD levels, this could fully counterbalance the global loss of beef production. The carbon opportunity intensity can inform policy approaches to restore ecosystems while minimizing food losses. Future work should aim to provide higher-resolution estimates for use at local and farm scales, and to incorporate a wider set of environmental indicators of outcomes beyond carbon.",

          "abstract": "Fe–S clusters are essential cofactors involved in many reactions across all domains of life. Their biogenesis in Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria involves two machineries: Isc and Suf. Under conditions where cells operate with the Suf system, such as during oxidative stress or iron limitation, the entry of aminoglycosides is reduced, leading to resistance to these antibiotics. The transition between Isc and Suf machineries is controlled by the transcriptional regulator IscR. Here, we found that two small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), FnrS and OxyS, control iscR expression by base pairing to the 5′-UTR of the iscR mRNA. These sRNAs act in opposite ways and in opposite conditions: FnrS, expressed in anaerobiosis, represses the expression of iscR while OxyS, expressed during oxidative stress, activates it. Using an E. coli strain experiencing protracted oxidative stress, we further demonstrate that iscR expression is rapidly and significantly enhanced in the presence of OxyS. Consequently, we further show that OxyS induces resistance to aminoglycosides during oxidative stress through regulation of Fe–S cluster biogenesis, revealing a major role for this sRNA.",

This study revealed that foliar application of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs; 30 to 80 nm, 0.67 mg/d per plant, 6 d) to rice leaves under heatwave (HW) stress increased the grain yield and nutritional quality. Compared with the HW control, the HWs+ZnO group presented increases in the grain yield, grain protein content, and amino acid content of 22.1%, 11.8%, and 77.5%, respectively. Nanoscale ZnO aggregated on the leaf surface and interacted with leaf surface molecules. Compared with that at ambient temperature, HW treatment increased the dissolution of ZnO NPs on the leaf surface by 25.9% and facilitated their translocation to mesophyll cells. The Zn in the leaves existed as both ionic Zn and particulate ZnO. Compared with the HW control, foliar application of ZnO NPs under HW conditions increased leaf nutrient levels (Zn, Mn, Cu, Fe, and Mg) by 15.8 to 416.9%, the chlorophyll content by 22.2 to 24.8%, Rubisco enzyme activity by 21.2%, and antioxidant activity by 26.7 to 31.2%. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that ZnO NPs reversed HW-induced transcriptomic dysregulation, thereby enhancing leaf photosynthesis by 74.4%. Additionally, ZnO NPs increased the diversity, stability, and enrichment of beneficial microbial taxa and protected the phyllosphere microbial community from HW damage. This work elucidates how NPs interact with the phyllosphere, highlighting the potential of NPs to promote sustainable agriculture, especially under extreme climate events (e.g., HWs).",

Here, we present the crystal structure of the signaling-competent Lotus japonicus NFR5 intracellular domain, comprising the juxtamembrane region and pseudokinase domain. The juxtamembrane region is structurally well defined and forms two α-helices, αA and αA′, which contain an exposed hydrophobic motif. We demonstrate that this “juxtamembrane motif” promotes NFR5–NFR5 and NFR1–NFR5 interactions and is essential for symbiotic signaling.

It has also become of increasing practical importance over the last half-century as the energetic cost of digital devices has exploded. Importantly, real-world computers obey multiple physical constraints on how they work, which affects their thermodynamic properties. Moreover, many of these constraints apply to both naturally occurring computers, like brains or Eukaryotic cells, and digital systems. Most obviously, all such systems must finish their computation quickly, using as few degrees of freedom as possible. This means that they operate far from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, many computers, both digital and biological, are modular, hierarchical systems with strong constraints on the connectivity among their subsystems. Yet another example is that to simplify their design, digital computers are required to be periodic processes governed by a global clock. None of these constraints were considered in 20th-century analyses of the thermodynamics of computation. The new field of stochastic thermodynamics provides formal tools for analyzing systems subject to all of these constraints. We argue here that these tools may help us understand at a far deeper level just how the fundamental thermodynamic properties of physical systems are related to the computation they perform.",

          "abstract": "Selective attention relies on neural mechanisms that facilitate processing of behaviorally relevant sensory information while suppressing irrelevant information, consistently linked to alpha-band oscillations in human M/EEG studies. We analyzed cortical alpha responses from intracranial electrodes implanted in eight epilepsy patients, who performed a visual spatial attention task. Electrocorticographic data revealed a spatiotemporal dissociation between attention-modulated alpha desynchronization, associated with the enhancement of sensory processing, and alpha synchronization, associated with the suppression of sensory processing, during the cue-target interval. Dorsal intraparietal areas contralateral to the attended hemifield primarily exhibited a delayed and sustained alpha desynchronization, while ventrolateral extrastriatal areas ipsilateral to the attended hemifield primarily exhibited an earlier and sustained alpha synchronization. Analyses of cross-frequency coupling between alpha phase and broadband high-frequency activity (HFA) further revealed cross-frequency interactions along the visual hierarchy contralateral to the attended locations. Directionality analyses indicate that alpha phase in early and extrastriatal visual areas modulated HFA power in downstream visual areas, thus potentially facilitating the feedforward processing of an upcoming, spatially predictable target. In contrast, in areas ipsilateral to the attended locations, HFA power modulated local alpha phase in early and extrastriatal visual areas, with suppressed interareal interactions, potentially attenuating the processing of distractors. Our findings reveal divergent alpha-mediated neural mechanisms underlying target enhancement and distractor suppression during the deployment of spatial attention, reflecting enhanced functional connectivity at attended locations, while suppressed functional connectivity at unattended locations. The collective dynamics of these alpha-mediated neural mechanisms play complementary roles in the efficient gating of sensory information.",

We report that biallelic COX15 pathogenic variants cause human oocyte ferroptosis and female infertility in a recessive inheritance pattern. COX15 variants impaired mitochondrial respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and led to reduced protein levels in HeLa cells. Oocyte-specific deletion of Cox15 led to impaired Fe 2+ and reactive oxygen species homeostasis that caused mitochondrial dysfunction and ultimately sensitized oocytes to ferroptosis. In addition, ferrostatin-1 (an inhibitor of ferroptosis) could rescue the oocyte ferroptosis phenotype in vitro and ex vivo.

Pseudoaromatic dicarboxylic acids are promising alternatives with chemical structures similar to widely used petroleum-based aromatic dicarboxylic acids. However, their use in polyester synthesis has been limited due to production challenges. Here, we report the fermentative production of five pseudoaromatic dicarboxylic acids, including 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) and pyridine dicarboxylic acids (PDCAs: 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, and 2,6-PDCA), from glucose using five engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum strains. A platform C. glutamicum chassis strain was constructed by modulating the expression of nine genes involved in the synthesis and degradation pathways of precursor protocatechuate (PCA) and the glucose-uptake system. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the engineered strain against wild-type C. glutamicum identified iolE ( NCgl0160 ) as a target for PDC production. Optimized fed-batch fermentation conditions enabled the final engineered strain to produce 76.17 ± 1.24 g/L of PDC. Using this platform strain, we constructed 2,3-, 2,4-, and 2,5-PDCA-producing strains by modulating the expression of key enzymes. Additionally, we demonstrated a previously uncharacterized pathway for 2,3-PDCA biosynthesis. The engineered strains produced 2.79 ± 0.005 g/L of 2,3-PDCA, 494.26 ± 2.61 mg/L of 2,4-PDCA, and 1.42 ± 0.02 g/L of 2,5-PDCA through fed-batch fermentation. To complete the portfolio, we introduced the 2,6-PDCA biosynthetic pathway to an L-aspartate pathway–enhanced C. glutamicum strain, producing 15.01 ± 0.03 g/L of 2,6-PDCA in fed-batch fermentation.

In its most common form, a N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) chemical modification is introduced into nascent messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) by a specialized methyltransferase complex and removed by the RNA demethylases, Fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO), and ALKBH5. The fate of m 6 A-marked mRNA is uniquely diverse, ranging from degradation to stabilization/translation, which has been suggested to be largely dependent on its interaction with the family of YT521-B homology (YTH) domain-containing proteins. Here, we highlight a series of control levers that impinge on the RNA demethylases. We present evidence to indicate that intermediary metabolism and various posttranslation modifications modulate the activity, stability, and the subcellular localization of FTO and ALKBH5, further dispelling the notion that m 6 A methylation is not a dynamic process. We also discuss how examination of these underappreciated regulatory nodes adds a more nuanced view of the role of FTO and ALKBH5 and should guide their study in cancer and nonmalignant conditions alike.",

These organisms utilize macromolecules like peptides and proteins to facilitate the nucleation and growth of carbonate minerals, serving as an effective method for CO 2 sequestration. However, the precise mechanisms behind this process remain elusive. In this study, we report the use of sequence-defined peptoids, a class of peptidomimetics, to achieve the accelerated calcite step growth kinetics with the molecular level mechanistic understanding. By designing peptoids with hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, we systematically investigated the acceleration in step growth rate of calcite crystals using in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), varying peptoid sequences and concentrations, CaCO 3 supersaturations, and the ratio of Ca 2+ / HCO 3 − . Mechanistic studies using NMR, three-dimensional fast force mapping (3D FFM), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) were conducted to reveal the interactions of peptoids with Ca 2+ and HCO 3 − ions in solution, as well as the effect of peptoids on solvation and energetics of calcite crystal surface. Our results indicate the multiple roles of peptoid in facilitating HCO 3 − deprotonation, Ca 2+ desolvation, and the disruption of interfacial hydration layers of the calcite surface, which collectively contribute to a peptoid-induced acceleration of calcite growth. These findings provide guidelines for future design of sequence-specific biomimetic polymers as crystallization promoters, offering potential applications in environmental remediation (such as CO 2 sequestration), biomedical engineering, and energy storage where fast crystallization is preferred.",

Specifically, we demonstrate via two microscopic models that LMR with a universal slope arises ubiquitously near ordered phases, provided the order parameter either i) has a finite wave-vector, or ii) has nodes on the Fermi surface. We elucidate the distinct physical mechanisms at play in these two scenarios and derive upper and lower bounds on the field range for which LMR is observed.

In this study, we identify hyponatremia as an independent inducer of NETs release, a common clinical condition that disrupts sodium/calcium exchange within neutrophils. This disruption leads to an excess of intracellular calcium, subsequent elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the citrullination of histone H3, culminating in the activation of NETs-release pathways. Notably, under hyponatremic conditions, this mechanism is exacerbated during infectious states, leading to the deposition of NETs in the lungs and increasing the risk of life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Our findings underscore the critical role of sodium and calcium homeostasis in neutrophil functionality and provide insights into the pathogenesis of hyponatremia-associated diseases, highlighting potential therapeutic interventions targeting NETs dynamics.",

We found that, in addition to the foramina Magendie and Luschka for CSF flow toward the subarachnoid space and glymphatic system, CSF outflow could also occur along periaxonal spaces (termed “PAS pathway”) from the spinal cord to peripheral organs, such as the liver and pancreas. When interrogating the latter route, we found that serotonin, acting through 5-HT 2B receptors expressed in ependymocytes that line the central canal, triggered Ca 2+ signals to induce polymerization of F-actin, a cytoskeletal protein, to reduce the volume of ependymal cells. This paralleled an increased rate of PAS-mediated CSF redistribution toward peripheral organs. In the liver, CSF was received by hepatic stellate cells. CSF efflux toward peripheral organs through the PAS pathway represents a mechanism dynamically connecting the nervous system with the periphery. Our findings are compatible with the traditional theory of CSF efflux into the glymphatic system to clear metabolic waste from the cerebral parenchyma. Thus, we extend the knowledge of CSF flow and expand the understanding of connectivity between the CNS and peripheral organs.",

Studies in vitro and in anesthetized animals suggest that nonlinearities emerge in cells’ input–output (IO; activation) functions as network activity increases, yet how neurons transform inputs in vivo has been unclear. Here, we characterize cortical principal neurons’ activation functions in awake mice using two-photon optogenetics. We deliver fixed inputs at the soma while neurons’ activity varies with sensory stimuli. We find that responses to fixed optogenetic input are nearly unchanged as neurons are excited, reflecting a linear response regime above neurons’ resting point. In contrast, responses are dramatically attenuated by suppression. This attenuation is a powerful means to filter inputs arriving to suppressed cells, privileging other inputs arriving to excited neurons. These results have two major implications. First, somatic neural activation functions in vivo accord with the activation functions used in recent machine learning systems. Second, neurons’ IO functions can filter sensory inputs—not only do sensory stimuli change neurons’ spiking outputs, but these changes also affect responses to input, attenuating responses to some inputs while leaving others unchanged.",

          "abstract": "Carboxysomes are protein microcompartments found in cyanobacteria, whose shell encapsulates rubisco at the heart of carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle. Carboxysomes are thought to locally concentrate CO 2 in the shell interior to improve rubisco efficiency through selective metabolite permeability, creating a concentrated catalytic center. However, permeability coefficients have not previously been determined for these gases, or for Calvin-cycle intermediates such as bicarbonate ( HCO 3 − ), 3-phosphoglycerate, or ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Starting from a high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a synthetic β -carboxysome shell, we perform unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics to track metabolite permeability across the shell. The synthetic carboxysome shell structure, lacking the bacterial microcompartment trimer proteins and encapsulation peptides, is found to have similar permeability coefficients for multiple metabolites, and is not selectively permeable to HCO 3 − relative to CO 2 . To resolve how these comparable permeabilities can be reconciled with the clear role of the carboxysome in the CO 2 -concentrating mechanism in cyanobacteria, complementary atomic-resolution Brownian Dynamics simulations estimate the mean first passage time for CO 2 assimilation in a crowded model carboxysome. Despite a relatively high CO 2 permeability of approximately 10 −2 cm/s across the carboxysome shell, the shell proteins reflect enough CO 2 back toward rubisco that 2,650 CO 2 molecules can be fixed by rubisco for every 1 CO 2 molecule that escapes under typical conditions. The permeabilities determined from all-atom molecular simulation are key inputs into flux modeling, and the insight gained into carbon fixation can facilitate the engineering of carboxysomes and other bacterial microcompartments for multiple applications.",

          "abstract": "Caste differentiation involves many functional traits that diverge during larval growth and metamorphosis to produce adults irreversibly adapted to reproductive division of labor. Investigating developmental differentiation is important for general biological understanding and has increasingly been explored for social phenotypes that diverge in parallel from similar genotypes. Here, we use Monomorium pharaonis ants to investigate the extent to which canalized worker development can be shifted toward gyne (virgin-queen) phenotypes by juvenile hormone (JH) treatment. We show that excess JH can activate gyne-biased development in workers so that wing-buds, ocelli, antennal and genital imaginal discs, flight muscles, and gyne-like fat bodies and brains emerge after pupation. However, ovary development remained unresponsive to JH treatment, indicating that JH-sensitive germline sequestration happens well before somatic differentiation. Our findings reveal important qualitative restrictions in the extent to which JH treatment can redirect larval development and that these constraints are independent of body size. Our findings corroborate that JH is a key hormone for inducing caste differentiation but show that this process can be asymmetric for higher colony-level germline versus somatic caste differentiation in superorganisms as defined a century ago by Wheeler. We quantified gene expression changes in response to JH treatment throughout development and identified a set of JH-sensitive genes responsible for the emergence of gyne-like somatic traits. Our study suggests that the gonadotropic role of JH in ovary maturation has shifted from the individual level in solitary insects to the colony level in an evolutionary-derived and highly polygynous superorganism like the pharaoh ant.",

Unphosphorylated CFTR engages PKA-C at two locations, establishing two “catalytic stations” near to, but not directly involving, the R domain. This configuration, coupled with the conformational flexibility of the R domain, permits transient interactions of the eleven spatially separated phosphorylation sites.

Here, we describe in vitro characterization of the secretory function of pancreatic islets, derived from transgenic pigs expressing the GLP-1M3R cassette under the porcine insulin promoter (InsGLP-1M3R), and their usage to treat insulin-dependent diabetes in an immunodeficient mouse model. Our results show that InsGLP-1M3R islets isolated from neonatal and adult pigs secrete up to 15-fold more insulin in response to glucose stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) islets.

We identified the known ribosomal RNA methyltransferase rsmF as the enzyme responsible for m 5 C synthesis in tRNA and enzyme transcript levels are responsive to elevated levels of ROS in the cell.

First-principles searches are impeded by the computational complexity of solving the Eliashberg equations for large, complex crystal structures. Here, we adopt a simplified approach using electronic indicators previously established to be correlated with superconductivity in hydrides. This is used to study complex hydride structures, which are predicted to exhibit promisingly high critical temperatures for superconductivity. In particular, we propose three classes of hydrides inspired by the Fm 3 ¯ m RH 3 structures that exhibit strong hydrogen network connectivity, as defined through the electron localization function. The first class [RH 11 X 3 Y] is based on a Pm 3 ¯ m structure showing moderately high T c , where the T c estimate from electronic properties is compared with direct Eliashberg calculations and found to be surprisingly accurate. The second class of structures [(RH 11 ) 2 X 6 YZ] improves on this with promisingly high density of states with dominant hydrogen character at the Fermi energy, typically enhancing T c . The third class [(R 1 H 11 )(R 2 H 11 )X 6 YZ] improves the strong hydrogen network connectivity by introducing anisotropy in the hydrogen network through a specific doping pattern. These design principles and associated model structures provide flexibility to optimize both T c and the structural stability of complex hydrides.",

Here, we conducted biochemical analysis of the two most frequent exon 20 insertion variants, V769_D770insASV (insASV) and D770_N771insSVD (insSVD) to better understand their drug sensitivity and resistance. From kinetic studies, we found that EGFR insASV and insSVD are similarly active, but have lower K m, ATP values compared to the L858R variant, which contributes to their lack of sensitivity to 1st-3rd generation EGFR TKIs. Biochemical, structural, and cellular studies of a diverse panel of EGFR inhibitors revealed that the more recently developed compounds BAY-568, TAS6417, and TAK-788 inhibit EGFR insASV and insSVD in a mutant-selective manner, with BAY-568 being the most potent and selective versus wild-type (WT) EGFR. Cocrystal structures with WT EGFR reveal the binding modes of each of these inhibitors and of poziotinib, a potent but not mutantselective inhibitor, and together they define interactions shared by the mutant-selective agents. Collectively, our results show that these exon20 insertion variants are not inherently inhibitor resistant, rather they differ in their drug sensitivity from WT EGFR. However, they are similar to each other, indicating that a single inhibitor should be effective for several of the diverse exon 20 insertion variants.",

Mammalian cells are known to sense and respond to sterol status changes to maintain them within strict limits, a process associated with various human diseases. However, this process is not understood in oomycete pathogens, most of which are sterol auxotrophic and must obtain sterols from host plants. Here, we report that Phytophthora sojae SSRK1 (sterol-sensing receptor kinase 1) detects host sterols by coupling with elicitins, thereby controlling signaling and sterol absorption. Sterols are recruited by extracellular soluble elicitins, and these complexes then bind to SSRK1 to form trimolecular complexes. These complexes subsequently trigger downstream calcium influx, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, and transcriptome reprogramming through the receptor’s kinase activity. Our data demonstrate a unique sterol sensing pathway where elicitins and a transmembrane receptor kinase SSRK1 act as coreceptors for extracellular sterols. These findings also portray a sterol-based war between oomycetes and plants, providing a unique perspective on how a pathogen detects host signals during infection.",

          "abstract": "In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , exit from mitosis is coupled to spindle position to ensure successful genome partitioning between mother and daughter cells. This coupling occurs through a GTPase signaling cascade known as the mitotic exit network (MEN). The MEN senses spindle position via a Ras-like GTPase Tem1 which localizes to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs, yeast equivalent of centrosomes) during anaphase and signals to its effector protein kinase Cdc15. How Tem1 couples the status of spindle position to MEN activation is not fully understood. Here, we show that Cdc15 has a relatively weak preference for Tem1 GTP and Tem1’s nucleotide state does not change upon MEN activation. Instead, we find that Tem1’s nucleotide cycle establishes a localization-based concentration difference in the cell where only Tem1 GTP is recruited to the SPB, and spindle position regulates the MEN by controlling Tem1 localization to the SPB. SPB localization of Tem1 primarily functions to promote Tem1–Cdc15 interaction for MEN activation by increasing the effective concentration of Tem1. Consistent with this model, we demonstrate that artificially tethering Tem1 to the SPB or concentrating Tem1 in the cytoplasm with genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles could bypass the requirement of Tem1 GTP and correct spindle position for MEN activation. This localization/concentration-based GTPase signaling mechanism for Tem1 differs from the canonical Ras-like GTPase signaling paradigm and is likely relevant to other localization-based signaling scenarios.",

Maternal oxycodone (OXY) exposure of pregnant mice leads to disturbances in the layer of invasive parietal trophoblast giant cells (pTGC) that forms the interface between the placenta and uterus. These cells are analogous to extravillous trophoblasts of the human placenta. They are crucial to coordinating the metabolic needs of the conceptus with those of the mother and are primary participants in the placenta–brain axis. Their large nuclear size, however, has precluded both single-cell (sc) and single-nucleus (sn) RNA-seq analyses beyond embryonic day (E) 8.5. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of placentas from pregnant mice exposed to OXY with unexposed controls at E12.5, with particular emphasis on the pTGC. The nonfluidic Parse snRNA-seq approach permitted characterization of the nuclear transcriptomes of all the major placental cell lineages and their presumed progenitors at E12.5. OXY exposure had a negligible effect on components of the placental labyrinth, including the two syncytial cell layers, but caused transcriptomic changes consistent with metabolic stress throughout the spongiotrophoblast. Most notably, there was loss of the majority of pTGC, whose normal gene expression is consistent with elevated energy demand relating to biosynthesis of multiple secretory products, especially hormones, and endoduplication of DNA. This unusual sensitivity of pTGC presumably puts the pregnancy and future health of the offspring at particular risk to OXY exposure.",

Here, we introduce Adaptive CVgen, a universal adaptive sampling framework designed to tackle these issues. Our approach utilizes a set of collective variables (CVs) to comprehensively cover the system’s potential evolutionary phase space, generating diverse reaction coordinates to address the first challenge. Moreover, we integrate reinforcement learning strategies to dynamically adjust the generated reaction coordinates, thereby effectively balancing the exploration-exploitation dilemma. We apply this framework to sample the conformational space of six proteins transitioning from completely disordered states to folded states, as well as to model the chemical synthesis process of C60, achieving conformations that perfectly match the standard C60 structure. The results demonstrate Adaptive CVgen’s effectiveness in exploring new conformations and escaping local minima, achieving both sampling efficiency and exploration accuracy. This framework holds potential for extending to various related challenges, including protein folding dynamics, drug targeting, and complex chemical reactions, thereby opening promising avenues for application in these fields.",

          "abstract": "White matter (WM) abnormalities are an emerging feature of schizophrenia, yet the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. Disruption of ErbB signaling, which is essential for peripheral myelination, has been genetically associated with schizophrenia and WM lesions in schizophrenic patients. However, the roles of ErbB signaling in oligodendrocytes remain elusive. Here, we used an in vivo pan-ErbB inhibition strategy and demonstrated the functions of endogenous ErbB receptors in oligodendrocytes. Through analyses of the cellular, histological, biochemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological differences in mice with manipulated ErbB activities in oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages, we found that ErbB signaling regulates myelination and aerobic glycolysis in oligodendrocytes, and both functions are required for working memory. ErbB inhibition in oligodendrocytes at early differentiation stages induces hypomyelination by suppressing the myelinating capacity of newly formed oligodendrocytes. In contrast, ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes alters neither myelination nor oligodendrocyte numbers, but accelerates axonal conduction decline under energy stress. Mechanistically, ErbB inhibition attenuates K-Ras activities, leading to the reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase A that promotes aerobic glycolysis in mature oligodendrocytes. Supplementation of L-lactate restores axonal conduction and working memory capacity that are suppressed by ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes. These findings emphasize the indispensable roles of ErbB signaling in WM integrity and function and provide insights into the multifaceted contributions of WM abnormalities to cognitive impairment.",

          "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein to recognize and infect host cells by binding to the cell surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 receptor is composed of peptidase domain (PD), collectrin-like domain, transmembrane domain, and short cytoplasmic domain, and may exist as a dimer on cell surface. The RBD binding site is located atop of the ACE2 PD, but the involvement of other domains in virus infection is uncertain. We found that the ACE2 PD alone, whether anchored to cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor or attached to another surface protein, is fully functional as a receptor for spike-mediated cell fusion and virus infection. However, for ACE2 to function as the viral receptor, the RBD binding site must be positioned in close proximity to the cell membrane. Elevating the surface height of ACE2 using long and rigid protein spacers reduces or eliminates cell fusion and virus infection. Moreover, we found that the RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies, nanobodies, and de novo designed miniprotein binders, when present on cell surface, also act as viral receptors, facilitating cell fusion and virus infection. Our data demonstrate that RBD binding and close membrane proximity are essential properties for a receptor to effectively mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, we show that soluble RBD-binders can be engineered to make cells either susceptible or resistant to virus infection, which has significant implications for antiviral therapy and various virus-mediated applications.",

Mitigating this strain-induced loss in mechanical integrity is a significant challenge, especially in the development of active and shape-memory materials. We report the additive manufacturing of mechanical metamaterials made with a protein-based polymer that undergo a unique stiffening and strengthening behavior after shape recovery cycles. We utilize a bovine serum albumin-based polymer and show that cyclic tension and recovery experiments on the neat resin lead to a ~60% increase in the strength and stiffness of the material. This is attributed to the release of stored length in the protein mechanophores during plastic deformation that is preserved after the recovery cycle, thereby leading to a “strain learning” behavior. We perform compression experiments on three-dimensionally printed lattice metamaterials made from this protein-based polymer and find that, in certain lattices, the strain learning effect is not only preserved but amplified, causing up to a 2.5× increase in the stiffness of the recovered metamaterial. These protein–polymer strain learning metamaterials offer a unique platform for materials that can autonomously remodel after being deformed, mimicking the remodeling processes that occur in natural materials.",

Despite all these exciting observations, the field appears to have stagnated since then. We argue that this is a consequence of the shortcomings of technologies to model these diseases, limiting our understanding of which transcripts are being oxidized, which RNA-binding proteins are interacting with these RNAs, what their implications are in RNA processing, and as a result, what their potential role is in disease onset and progression.

While it is now well established that metastatic tumor cells must up-regulate their antioxidant capacity to effectively spread and that regulation of antioxidant enzymes is imperative to disease progression, relatively few studies have assessed how translation and the hijacking of RNA systems contribute to antioxidant responses of tumors. Here, we review the major stress signaling pathways involved in translational regulation and discuss how these are affected by oxidative stress to promote prosurvival changes that manipulate antioxidant enzyme expression. We describe how tumors elicit these adaptive responses and detail how stress-induced translation can be regulated by kinases, RNA-binding proteins, RNA species, and RNA modification systems. We also highlight opportunities for further studies focused on the role of mRNA translation and RNA systems in the regulation of antioxidant enzyme expression, which may be of particular importance in the context of metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance.",

We recently reported that subinhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim induce vast changes in both the primary and secondary metabolome of B. thailandensis . In the current work, we show that the folate biosynthetic enzyme FolE2 is permissive under standard growth conditions but essential for B. thailandensis in the presence of subinhibitory doses of trimethoprim. Reasoning that FolE2 may serve as an attractive drug target, we screened for and identified ten inhibitors, including dehydrocostus lactone (DHL), parthenolide, and β-lapachone, all of which are innocuous individually but form a chemical-synthetic lethal combination with subinhibitory doses of trimethoprim. We show that DHL is a mechanism-based inhibitor of FolE2 and capture the structure of the covalently inhibited enzyme using X-ray crystallography. In vitro, the combination of subinhibitory trimethoprim and DHL is more potent than Bactrim, the current standard of care against melioidosis. Moreover, unlike Bactrim, this combination does not affect the growth of most commensal and beneficial gut bacteria tested, thereby providing a degree of specificity against B. pseudomallei . Our work provides a path for identifying antimicrobial drug targets and for utilizing binary combinations of molecules that form a toxic cocktail based on metabolic idiosyncrasies of specific pathogens.",

Tree planting is one of the most widely employed nature-based heat mitigation methods worldwide. Therefore, city policy makers require knowledge of how much temperature will be reduced by increasing urban tree canopy (UTC). Cooling efficiency (CE), which was been proposed to quantify the magnitude of temperature reduction associated with a 1% increase in UTC, has been primarily investigated at smaller scales previously. However, such small-scale results cannot be used to develop policy at the whole-city scale. This study developed a method that reveals the scaling relations of CE so as to predict its effects at the city scale. CE was found to follow the form of a power law as spatial scale increased from the small analytical units through intermediate size units up to the extent of a whole city. The power law form appeared consistently across cities with different climate backgrounds during summer daylight hours. Furthermore, the power law form was robust within cities under different summer weather conditions. The power-law scaling approach can thus be used to predict CE at the whole-city scale, providing a useful tool for managers to set UTC goals to mitigate extreme urban heat.",

Indeed, it was shown to be involved in DNA G-quadruplex biology and RNA metabolism, most importantly in the miRNA maturation pathway and the decay of oxidized or abasic miRNAs during oxidative stress conditions. In recent years, several noncanonical pathways of miRNA biogenesis have emerged, with a specific focus on guanosine-rich precursors that can form RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) structures. Here, we show that several miRNA precursors, dysregulated upon APE1 depletion, contain an rG4 motif and that their corresponding target genes are up-regulated after APE1 depletion. We also demonstrate, both by in vitro assays and by using different cancer cell lines, that APE1 can modulate the folding of an rG4 structure contained in pre-miR-92b, with a mechanism strictly dependent on lysine residues present in its N-terminal disordered region. Furthermore, APE1 cellular depletion alters the maturation process of miR-92b, mainly affecting the shuttling between the nucleus and cytosol. Bioinformatic analysis of APE1-regulated rG4-containing miRNAs supports the relevance of our findings in cancer biology. Specifically, these miRNAs exhibit high prognostic significance in lung, cervical, and liver tumors, as suggested by their involvement in several cancer-related pathways.",

This requires selectively doping of 1D moiré chain, which seems to be not within the grasp of today’s technology. Therefore, an experimental demonstration of the 1D moiré chain with partially filled electronic states remains absent.

Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more the 50,000 uterine cells from both the endometrium and myometrium of five healthy premenopausal individuals, and jointly analyzed the data with a previously published dataset from 15 subjects. The resulting normal uterus cell atlas contains more than 167K cells, representing the lymphatic endothelium, blood endothelium, stromal, ciliated epithelium, unciliated epithelium, and immune cell populations. Focused analyses within each major cell type and comparisons with subtype labels from prior studies allowed us to document supporting evidence, resolve naming conflicts, and propose a consensus annotation system of 39 subtypes. We release their gene expression centroids, differentially expressed genes, and messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) patterns of literature-based markers as a shared community resource. We identify multiple potential progenitor cells: compartment-wide progenitors for each major cell type and potential cross-lineage multipotent stromal progenitors that may replenish the epithelial, stromal, and endothelial compartments. Furthermore, many cell types and subtypes exhibit shifts in cell number and transcriptomes across different phases of the menstrual cycle. Finally, comparisons between premenopausal, postpartum, and postmenopausal samples revealed substantial alterations in tissue composition, particularly in the proportions of stromal, endothelial, and immune cells. The cell taxonomy and molecular markers we report here are expected to inform studies of both basic biology of uterine function and its disorders.",

          "abstract": "Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) reduce ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides using radical-based chemistry. For class Ia RNRs, the radical species is stored in a separate subunit (β2) from the subunit housing the active site (α2), requiring the formation of a short-lived α2β2 complex and long-range radical transfer (RT). RT occurs via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) over a long distance (~32-Å) and involves the formation and decay of multiple amino acid radical species. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy and a mechanism-based inhibitor 2′-azido-2′-deoxycytidine-5′-diphosphate (N 3 CDP) to trap a wild-type α2β2 complex of Escherichia coli class Ia RNR. We find that one α subunit has turned over and that the other is trapped, bound to β in a midturnover state. Instead of N 3 CDP in the active site, forward RT has resulted in N 2 loss, migration of the third nitrogen from the ribose C2′ to C3′ positions, and attachment of this nitrogen to the sulfur of cysteine-225. In this study, an inhibitor has been visualized as an adduct to an RNR. Additionally, this structure reveals the positions of PCET residues following forward RT, complementing the previous structure that depicted a preturnover PCET pathway and suggesting how PCET is gated at the α–β interface. This N 3 CDP-trapped structure is also of sufficient resolution (2.6 Å) to visualize water molecules, allowing us to evaluate the proposal that water molecules are proton acceptors and donors as part of the PCET process.",

          "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a considerable threat to human health with a significant risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, currently, both the molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic treatment of IBD remain limited. In this report, using both systemic and intestinal epithelium-specific gene knockout mouse models, we demonstrate that FBXO22, a substrate receptor within the SKP1-Cullin 1-F-box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, plays an inhibitory role in the Azoxymethane / Dextran Sodium Sulfate–induced colorectal inflammatory responses and CRC. FBXO22 targets the serine 2448-phosphorylated form of mammalian mechanistic target of rapamycin (pS2448-mTOR) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This proteolytic targeting effect is established based on multiple lines of evidence including the results of colon tissue immunoblots, analysis of cultured cells with altered abundance of FBXO22 by depletion or overexpression, comparison of protein decay rate, effects on mTOR substrates S6K1 and 4E-BP1, analysis of protein–protein interactions, phosphor–peptide binding and competition, as well as reconstituted and cellular ubiquitination. Finally, we have shown that mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA) was able to alleviate the effects of fbxo22 deletion on colorectal inflammatory response and CRC. These RAPA effects are correlated with the ability of RAPA to inhibit pS2448-mTOR, pS6K1, and p4E-BP1. Collectively, our data support a suppressive role for FBXO22 in colorectal inflammation signaling and CRC initiation by targeting pS2448-mTOR for degradation.",

          "abstract": "RNA oxidation, predominantly through the accumulation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxo-rG), represents an important biomarker for cellular oxidative stress. Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease that has been shown to preferentially recognize 8-oxo-rG-containing RNA and protect E scherichia coli cells from oxidative stress. However, the impact of 8-oxo-rG on PNPase-mediated RNA degradation has not been studied. Here, we show that the presence of 8-oxo-rG in RNA leads to catalytic stalling of E. coli PNPase through in vitro RNA degradation experiments and electrophoretic analysis. We also link this stalling to the active site of the enzyme through resolution of single-particle cryo-EM structures for PNPase in complex with singly or doubly oxidized RNA oligonucleotides. Following identification of Arg399 as a key residue in recognition of both single and sequential 8-oxo-rG nucleotides, we perform follow-up in vitro analysis to confirm the importance of this residue in 8-oxo-rG-specific PNPase stalling. Finally, we investigate the effects of mutations to active site residues implicated in 8-oxo-rG binding through E. coli cell growth experiments under H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress. Specifically, Arg399 mutations show significant effects on cell growth under oxidative stress. Overall, we demonstrate that 8-oxo-rG-specific stalling of PNPase is relevant to bacterial survival under oxidative stress and speculate that this enzyme might associate with other cellular factors to mediate this stress.",

The primary visual cortex (V1) is thought to extract local borders, and higher visual areas are thought to identify the perceptually relevant borders between objects and the background. To test this conjecture, we used natural images that had been annotated by human observers who marked the perceptually relevant borders. We assessed the effect of perceptual relevance on V1 responses using human neuroimaging, macaque electrophysiology, and computational modeling. We report that perceptually relevant borders elicit stronger responses in the early visual cortex than irrelevant ones, even if simple features, such as contrast and the energy of oriented filters, are matched. Moreover, V1 neurons discriminate perceptually relevant borders surprisingly fast, during the early feedforward-driven activity at a latency of ~50 ms, indicating that they are tuned to the features that characterize them. We also revealed a delayed, contextual effect that enhances the V1 responses that are elicited by perceptually relevant borders at a longer latency. Our results reveal multiple mechanisms that allow V1 neurons to infer the layout of objects in natural images.",

          "abstract": "Northeast China’s Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation preserves spectacular fossils that have proved extraordinarily important in testing evolutionary hypotheses involving the origin of birds and the distribution of feathers among nonavian dinosaurs. These fossils occur either flattened with soft tissue preservation (including feathers and color) in laminated lacustrine strata or as three-dimensional (3D) skeletons in “life-like” postures in more massive deposits. The relationships of these deposits to each other, their absolute ages, and the origin of the extraordinary fossil preservation have been vigorously debated for nearly a half century, with the prevailing view being that preservation was linked to violent volcanic eruptions or lahars, similar to processes that preserved human remains at Pompeii. We present high-precision zircon U-Pb geochronology from cores and outcrops, demonstrating that Yixian Formation accumulation rates are more than an order of magnitude higher than usually estimated. Additionally, we provide zircon provenance and sedimentological data from 3D dinosaur fossils, which imply that their death and burial occurred in collapsed burrows, rather than via a catastrophic volcanogenic mechanism. In the studied area, the three principal fossil-rich intervals of the Yixian occur as a cyclic sequence that correspond to periods of high precipitation. Using Bayesian–Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches, we constrain the total duration of the sequence to less than ~93,000 y and suggest that climatic precession paced the expression of these cyclic sediments. Rather than representing multiple, Pompeii-like catastrophes, the Yixian Formation is instead a brief snapshot of normal life and death in an Early Cretaceous continental community.",

          "abstract": "The role of ventral hippocampus (vHipp) astroglial gliotransmission in depression was studied using chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rodent models. CRS increased Cx43 hemichannel activity and extracellular glutamate levels in the vHipp and blocking astroglial Cx43 hemichannel-dependent gliotransmission during CRS prevented the development of depression and glutamate buildup. Moreover, the acute blockade of Cx43 hemichannels induced antidepressant effects in rats previously subjected to CRS or CUMS. This antidepressant effect was prevented by coinjection of glutamate and D-serine. Furthermore, Cx43 hemichannel blockade decreased postsynaptic NMDAR currents in vHipp slices in a glutamate and D-serine-dependent manner. Notably, chronic microinfusion of glutamate and D-serine, L-serine, or the NMDAR agonist NMDA, into the vHipp induced depressive-like symptoms in nonstressed rats. We also identified a small molecule, cacotheline, which blocks Cx43 hemichannels and its systemic administration induced rapid antidepressant effects, preventing stress-induced increases in astroglial Cx43 hemichannel activity and extracellular glutamate in the vHipp, without sedative or locomotor side effects. In conclusion, chronic stress increases Cx43 hemichannel-dependent release of glutamate and D-/L-serine from astrocytes in the vHipp, overactivating postsynaptic NMDARs and triggering depressive-like symptoms. This study highlights the critical role of astroglial gliotransmitter release in chronic stress-induced depression and suggests it can be used as a target for the prevention and treatment of depression.",

          "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), the anion channel mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, is activated by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C). PKA-C activates CFTR both noncatalytically, through binding, and catalytically, through phosphorylation of multiple serines in CFTR’s regulatory (R) domain. Here, we identify key molecular determinants of the CFTR/PKA-C interaction essential for these processes. By comparing CFTR current activation in the presence of ATP or an ATP analog unsuitable for phosphotransfer, as well as pseudosubstrate peptides of various lengths, we identify two distinct specific regions of the PKA-C surface which interact with CFTR to cause noncatalytic and catalytic CFTR stimulation, respectively. Whereas the “substrate site” mediates CFTR phosphorylation, a distinct hydrophobic patch (the “docking site”) is responsible for noncatalytic CFTR activation, achieved by stabilizing the R domain in a “released” conformation permissive to channel gating. Furthermore, by comparing PKA-C variants with different posttranslational modification patterns, we find that direct membrane tethering of the kinase through its N-terminal myristoyl group is an unappreciated fundamental requirement for CFTR activation: PKA-C demyristoylation abolishes noncatalytic, and profoundly slows catalytic, CFTR stimulation. For the F508del CFTR mutant, present in ~90% of CF patients, maximal activation by demyristoylated PKA-C is reduced by ~10-fold compared to that by myristoylated PKA-C. Finally, in bacterial genera that contain common CF pathogens, we identify virulence factors that demyristoylate PKA-C in vitro, raising the possibility that during recurrent bacterial infections in CF patients, PKA-C demyristoylation may contribute to the exacerbation of lung disease.",

For nearly 100 y, a mysterious mud harvested from an undisclosed river site in New Jersey (USA) has been the agent of choice in the USA’s Major League Baseball for “de-glossing” new baseballs. It is unclear, however, what makes this “Rubbing Mud” work. Here, we perform a multiscale investigation of the rheology and tribology of this mud material under baseball-relevant conditions and identify three mechanisms by which the mud alters the surface properties of the baseball. First, the mud creates a more uniform baseball surface by filling in pores in the leather; this is possible because of its relatively high cohesion (clays and organics) making the material remarkably shear thinning. Second, the residue of cohesive particles coating the baseball effectively doubles contact adhesion. Third, a sparse population of angular sand grains are bonded to the baseball by clay-sized particles, leaving a studded surface that enhances friction. The proportions of cohesive, frictional, and viscous elements in Rubbing Mud conspire to create a soft material with an unusual mix of properties, that could find other applications in the development of sustainable geomaterials. Our improved understanding of the flow and friction of natural muds may also find use in modeling natural hazards such as mudslides and for locomotion in muddy environments.",

The rates exhibit a complex dependence on oxygen coverage and step density, which can be quantitatively explained by a density functional and transition-state theory–based kinetic model involving a cooperatively stabilized configuration of at least three oxygen atoms at steps. Here, two oxygen atoms recruit a third oxygen atom to a nearby binding site to produce an active configuration that is far more reactive than isolated oxygen atoms.

ILC2s expanded and produced IL-13 in the developing brain meninges. Loss of ILC2s or IL-13 signaling to interneurons decreased inhibitory, but not excitatory, cortical synapses. Conversely, ILC2s and IL-13 were sufficient to increase inhibitory synapses. Loss of this signaling pathway led to selective impairments in social interaction. These data define a type 2 neuroimmune circuit in early life that shapes inhibitory synapse development and behavior.",

We show that incorporating N,N -dimethylmethyleneiminium chloride into the perovskite precursor solution formed dimethylammonium cation and that previously unobserved methyl tetrahydrotriazinium ([MTTZ] + ) cation effectively improved perovskite film. The in situ formation of [MTTZ] + cation increased the formation energy of iodine vacancies and enhanced the migration energy barrier of iodide and cesium ions, which suppressed nonradiative recombination, thermal decomposition, and phase segregation processes. The optimized PSMs achieved a record (certified) PCE of 23.2% with an aperture area of 27.2 cm 2 , with a stabilized PCE of 23.0%. The encapsulated PSM retained 87.0% of its initial PCE after ~1900 hours of maximum power point tracking at 85°C and 85% relative humidity under 1.0-sun illumination.",

However, the extent to which bats utilize their highly local and directional echolocation for kilometer-scale navigation is unknown. In this study, we translocated wild Kuhl’s pipistrelle bats and tracked their homing abilities while manipulating their visual, magnetic, and olfactory sensing and accurately tracked them using a new reverse GPS system. We show that bats can identify their location after translocation and conduct several-kilometer map-based navigation using solely echolocation. This proposition was further supported by a large-scale echolocation model disclosing how bats use environmental acoustic information to perform acoustic cognitive map–based navigation. We also demonstrate that navigation is improved when using both echolocation and vision.",

Here, we report pathogenic variants in the core protein-folding machinery TRiC/CCT in individuals with brain malformations, intellectual disability, and seizures. The chaperonin TRiC is an obligate hetero-oligomer, and we identify variants in seven of its eight subunits, all of which impair function or assembly through different mechanisms. Transcriptome and proteome analyses of patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrate the various consequences of TRiC impairment. The results reveal an unexpected and potentially widespread role for protein folding in the development of the central nervous system and define a disease spectrum of “TRiCopathies.”",

Although fundamental for plant multicellularity, the molecular events leading to bridge stabilization, as opposed to severing, remain unknown. Using electron tomography, we mapped the transition from cell plate fenestrae to plasmodesmata. We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) connects daughter cells across fenestrae, and as the cell plate matures, fenestrae contract, causing the plasma membrane (PM) to mold around constricted ER tubes. The ER’s presence prevents fenestrae fusion, forming plasmodesmata, whereas its absence results in closure. The ER-PM protein tethers MCTP3, MCTP4, and MCTP6 further stabilize nascent plasmodesmata during fenestrae contraction. Genetic deletion in Arabidopsis reduces plasmodesmata formation. Our findings reveal how plants undergo incomplete division to promote intercellular communication.",

However, the mechanism underlying their ability to generate a spectrum of vibrant yellows, reds, and greens remains enigmatic. We uncover a unifying chemical basis for a wide range of parrot plumage colors, which result from the selective deposition of red aldehyde- and yellow carboxyl-containing psittacofulvin molecules in developing feathers. Through genetic mapping, biochemical assays, and single-cell genomics, we identified a critical player in this process, the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2 , which oxidizes aldehyde psittacofulvins into carboxyl forms in late-differentiating keratinocytes during feather development. The simplicity of the underlying molecular mechanism, in which a single enzyme influences the balance of red and yellow pigments, offers an explanation for the exceptional evolutionary lability of parrot coloration.",

We show that, in the presence of antibiotics, MRSA adopts an alternative mode of cell division and shows an altered peptidoglycan architecture at the division septum. PBP2a can replace the transpeptidase activity of the endogenous and essential PBP2 but not that of PBP1, which is responsible for the distinctive native septal peptidoglycan architecture. Successful division without PBP1 activity requires the alternative division mode and is enabled by several possible chromosomal potentiator ( pot ) mutations. MRSA resensitizing agents differentially interfere with the two codependent mechanisms required for high-level antibiotic resistance, which provides opportunities for new interventions.",

They usually rely on carrier tunneling between two quantum wells or two layers to hybridize with nondipolar excitons to gain oscillator strength. In this work, we uncovered a new type of bright infrared dipolar exciton by stacking 90°-twisted black phosphorus (BP) structures. These excitons, inherent to the reconstructed band structure, exhibit high oscillator strength. Most importantly, they inherit the linear polarization from BP, which allows light polarization to be used to select the dipole direction. Moreover, the dipole moment and resonance energy can be widely tuned by the thickness of the BP. Our results demonstrate a useful platform for exploring tunable correlated dipolar excitons.",

We report that Arabidopsis Decapping 5 (DCP5) functions as a multifunctional cytoplasmic osmosensor that senses and responds to extracellular hyperosmolarity. DCP5 harbors a plant-specific intramolecular crowding sensor (ICS) that undergoes conformational change and drives phase separation in response to osmotically intensified molecular crowding. Upon hyperosmolarity exposure, DCP5 rapidly and reversibly assembles to DCP5-enriched osmotic stress granules (DOSGs), which sequestrate plenty of mRNA and regulatory proteins, and thus adaptively reprograms both the translatome and transcriptome to facilitate plant osmotic stress adaptation. Our findings uncover a cytoplasmic osmosensing mechanism mediated by DCP5 with plant-specific molecular crowding sensitivity and suggest a stress sensory function for hyperosmotically induced stress granules.",

Rationing restricted sugar intake to levels within current dietary guidelines, yet consumption nearly doubled immediately post-rationing. Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35% and 20%, respectively, and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years. Protection was evident with in-utero exposure and increased with postnatal sugar restriction, especially after six months when solid foods likely began. In-utero sugar rationing alone accounted for about one third of the risk reduction.",

There is widespread concern that they do, but little systematic evidence that search engine algorithms, rather than user-expressed preferences, are driving current exposure to and engagement with unreliable information sources. Using two datasets totaling roughly 14 billion search engine result pages (SERPs) from Bing, the second most popular search engine in the U.S., we show that search exposes users to few unreliable information sources. The vast majority of engagement with unreliable information sources from search occurs when users are explicitly searching for information from those sites, despite those searches being an extremely small share of the overall search volume. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for user preference when examining engagement with unreliable sources from web search.",

          "abstract": "Random noise in information processing systems is widely seen as detrimental to function. But despite the large trial-to-trial variability of neural activity, humans show a remarkable adaptability to conditions with uncertainty during goal-directed behavior. The origin of this cognitive ability, constitutive of general intelligence, remains elusive. Here, we show that moderate levels of computation noise in artificial neural networks promote zero-shot generalization for decision-making under uncertainty. Unlike networks featuring noise-free computations, but like human participants tested on similar decision problems (ranging from probabilistic reasoning to reversal learning), noisy networks exhibit behavioral hallmarks of optimal inference in uncertain conditions entirely unseen during training. Computation noise enables this cognitive ability jointly through “structural” regularization of network weights during training and “functional” regularization by shaping the stochastic dynamics of network activity after training. Together, these findings indicate that human cognition may ride on neural variability to support adaptive decisions under uncertainty without extensive experience or engineered sophistication.",

          "abstract": "Supersonic turbulence occurs in many environments, particularly in astrophysics. In the crucial case of isothermal turbulence, the probability density function (PDF) of the logarithmic density, s , is well measured, but a theoretical understanding of the processes leading to this distribution remains elusive. We investigate these processes using Lagrangian tracer particles to track s and ds dt in direct numerical simulations, and we show that their evolution can be modeled as a stochastic differential process with time-correlated noise. The temporal correlation functions of s and ds dt decay exponentially, as predicted by the model, and the decay timescale is ≈ 1 / 6 the eddy turnover time. The behaviors of the conditional averages of ds dt and d 2 s dt 2 are also well explained by the model, which shows that the density PDF arises from a balance between stochastic compressions/expansions, which tend to broaden the PDF, and the acceleration/deceleration of shocks by density gradients, which tends to narrow it.",

An in-depth analysis revealed a direct link between the observed variations in SHG intensity and the pitch. The highly contrasted 3D images provided unprecedented detail into liquid crystal’s native structure. Local alignment, morphology, as well as the presence of defects are readily revealed, and a provisional framework relating the SHG response to the orientational distribution of CNC nanorods within the liquid crystal structure is presented. This paper illustrates the numerous benefits of using SHG microscopy for visualizing CNC chiral nematic systems directly in the suspension-liquid phase and paves the road for using SHG microscopy to characterize other types of aligned CNC structures, in wet and dry states.",

The structure shows striking similarity to MSA-amplified and PD-associated E46K fibrils.

Furthermore, mouse α-synuclein fibrils exhibit exacerbated pathological spread in neurons and humanized α-synuclein mice.

Current intensified therapeutic protocols coincide with severe side effects, and no salvage therapy is available for primary therapy-resistant or relapsed patients. This highlights the need to identify new therapeutic targets in T-ALL. PSIP1, dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, is a dependency factor in KMT2A -rearranged myeloid leukemia. Nonetheless, loss-of-function mutations suggest a tumor suppressor role for PSIP1 in T-ALL. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of Psip1 accelerates T-ALL initiation in mice which we correlated with reduced H3K27me3 binding. Contrastingly, loss of PSIP1 impaired cell proliferation in several T-ALL cell lines. In cell lines, PSIP1 down-regulation leads to a reduction of COX20, an assembly factor of the cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria, and to a reduction in mitochondrial respiration. This indicates that PSIP1 can exert a dual role in the context of T-ALL, either as a tumor suppressor gene during tumor initiation or as a dependency factor in tumor maintenance.",

Here, we report an important in vivo role for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number during lung adenocarcinoma progression in the mouse. We found that lung tumors induced by KRAS G12D expression have increased mtDNA levels and enhanced mitochondrial respiration. To experimentally assess a possible causative role in tumor progression, we induced lung cancer in transgenic mice with a general increase in mtDNA copy number and found that they developed a larger tumor burden, whereas mtDNA depletion in tumor cells reduced tumor growth. Immune cell populations in the lung and cytokine levels in plasma were not affected by increased mtDNA levels. Analyses of large cancer databases indicate that mtDNA copy number is also important in human lung cancer. Our study thus reports experimental evidence for a tumor-intrinsic causative role for mtDNA in lung cancer progression, which could be exploited for development of future cancer therapies.",

The resulting polarons play a central role in many materials properties including electrical transport, interaction with light, surface reactivity, and magnetoresistance, and polarons are typically investigated indirectly through these macroscopic characteristics. Here, noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) is used to directly image polarons in Fe 2 O 3 at the single quasiparticle limit. A combination of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations shows that the mobility of electron polarons can be markedly increased by Ti doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that a transition from polaronic to metastable free-carrier states can play a key role in migration of electron polarons. In contrast, hole polarons are significantly less mobile, and their hopping is hampered further by trapping centers.",

Here, inspired by organic photovoltaic structures, we demonstrate a bio-artificial photosynthetic system based on the hybridization of polymer semiconductor films and bacteria. The study suggests that the polymer-based semiconductor film can efficiently drive the non-photosynthetic bacteria to convert CO 2 to acetate. By systematically characterizing the charge transport behavior of the bio-artificial photosynthetic system, the bulk-heterojunction structure and charge transport layers are proven to enhance the system performance markedly. The scalable floating artificial bio-leaf system can produce acetate to gram scale in a week. Notably, the semiconductor film is easy to recycle and maintains stable performance, showing good sustainable production capability of the system. A quasi–solid-state artificial bio-leaf is successfully prepared using agar to simulate the morphology and function of natural leaves. Last, the acetate production converted from CO 2 was used to grow yeast for food production, thus achieving a complete simulation of natural photosynthesis.",

Here, we demonstrate that 3.3 positive charges are translocated with the negatively charged substrate in each transport step. They can be assigned to three positively charged residues of the central substrate-binding site and two asparagine/arginine pairs. In this way, the membrane potential stimulates not only the ATP 4− export step, as a net −0.7 charge is transported, but also the ADP 3− import step, as a net +0.3 charge is transported with the electric field. These positive charge movements also inhibit the import of ATP and export of ADP in the presence of a membrane potential, allowing these nucleotides to be maintained at high concentrations in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix to drive the hydrolysis and synthesis of ATP, respectively. Thus, this is the mechanism by which the membrane potential drives adenine nucleotide exchange with high directional fluxes to fuel the cellular processes.",

Here, we demonstrate that loss of cortical actin filaments generated by the formins mDia1 and mDia3 drastically compromises cell migration and mechanics in highly adherent fibroblasts. Biophysical analysis of the mechanical properties of the mutant cells revealed a markedly softened cell cortex in the poorly adherent state. Unexpectedly, in the highly adherent state, associated with a hyperstretched morphology with exaggerated focal adhesions and prominent high-strain stress fibers, they exhibited even higher cortical tension compared to control. Notably, misguidance of intracellular forces, frequently accompanied by stress-fiber rupture, culminated in the formation of tension- and contractility-induced macroapertures, which was instantly followed by excessive lamellipodial protrusion at the periphery, providing critical insights into mechanotransduction of mechanically stressed and highly adherent cells.",

To this end, we conducted insulin clamp studies combining intravenous infusion of a lipid overload with intake of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (mitoquinone). Under lipid overload, selective modulation of mitochondrial redox state by mitoquinone enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, mitoquinone did not affect canonical insulin signaling but augmented insulin-stimulated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation while reducing the mitochondrial oxidative burden under lipid oversupply. Complementary ex vivo studies in human muscle fibers exposed to high intracellular lipid levels revealed that mitoquinone improves features of mitochondrial bioenergetics, including diminished mitochondrial H 2 O 2 emission. These findings provide translational and mechanistic evidence implicating mitochondrial oxidants in the development of lipid-induced muscle insulin resistance in humans.",

How inorganic carbon inputs ultimately generate lake CO 2 outgassing remains a blind spot. We develop and introduce a calcite module in a coupled one-dimensional physical-biogeochemical model that we use to simulate the carbon cycle of the large Lake Geneva over the past 40 years. We mechanistically demonstrate how the so-far neglected process of calcite precipitation boosts net CO 2 emissions at the annual scale.

In animal models, suppressing the NM II–NKX3-2–ADGRB3 pathway in T cells effectively suppressed tumor growth and improved the efficacy of the checkpoint-specific immunotherapy.

          "abstract": "Uncovering the effects of radical injection into responsive organic molecules is a long-sought goal, and the single-molecule junctions provide a unique way to investigate molecular conductance evolution during the radical injection. We can modulate the main channel conductance by using electronic injection from off-site neutral radicals acting as gating terminals. Two families of cyclopentadienone derivatives were synthesized, featuring the inter-pyridyl main conductance channel and the inter-radical paths that are linear (FCF) or cross conjugated (PCP). Using a scanning tunneling microscope break junction technique, we find that the injection of mono- and diradicals in the PCP system unexpectedly decreases the conductance regarding the closed-shell analog, while that of FCF systems increases. Through-bond and through-space conductance mechanisms are found in the FCF and PCP series, respectively, and jointly modulate the overall charge transmission. This off-site injection concept offers a promising approach for developing molecular devices by manipulating electrical conductance in single-molecule junctions.",

Here, we demonstrate that intracellular S. aureus surviving well even in the presence of vancomycin can be effectively eliminated using an emerging cell-mimicking therapeutic strategy. These cell mimics with natural killer cell–like activity (NKMs) are composed of a redox-responsive degradable carrier, and perforin and granzyme B within the carrier. NKMs perform far more effectivly than clinical antibiotics in treating intracellular bacterial infections, providing a direct evidence of the NK cell–mimicking immune mechanism in the treatment of intracellular S. aureus .",

This platform revealed unique single-cell immune response mechanisms and sensitivities to standard-of-care immunotherapies. Furthermore, we were able to identify a synergistic combination of anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti–PD-1) together with a Casitas B lineage lymphoma-b inhibitor that overcame anti–PD-1 resistance in selected patient samples. Activation of the interferon-γ–stimulated cytokines predicted combination efficacy, while immunosuppressive cytokines were associated with poor response.

Despite the low response rate of TNBC to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), here, we report that inhibition of Notch-driven cytokine-mediated programs reduces TAMs and induces responsiveness to sequentially delivered ICB. This is characterized by the emergence of GrB + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the primary tumor. A more impressive effect of sequential treatment is observed in the lung where TAM depletion and increased CTLs are accompanied by near-complete abolition of metastases. This is due to (i) therapeutic reduction in Notch-dependent, prometastatic circulating factors released by the primary tumor, and (ii) elevated PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in lung metastases, rendering them profoundly sensitive to ICB.

We find that brain areas critically involved in observing conspecifics interacting (i) develop in clusters, (ii) have prolonged developmental trajectories, (iii) differentiate during the period of negotiations between immatures and multiple caregivers, and (iv) do not share stronger connectivity than with other regions. Overall, developmental timing of social brain areas correlates with social and behavioral milestones in marmosets and, as in humans, extends into adulthood. This rich social input is likely critical for the emergence of their strong socio-cognitive skills.

We have investigated the structure and bonding of Bi 18 − to understand its remarkable resistance to oxidation. We find that the most stable structure of Bi 18 − consists of two Bi 8 cages linked by a Bi 2 dimer, where each atom is bonded to three neighboring atoms. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that each Bi uses its three 6 p electrons to form three covalent bonds with its neighbors, resulting in a Bi 18 − cluster without any dangling bonds. We find that the robust Bi 18 framework along with the totally delocalized unpaired electron is responsible for the surprising inertness of Bi 18 − toward O 2 . The Bi 18 framework is similar to that in Hittorf’s phosphorus, suggesting the possibility to create bismuth nanoclusters with interesting structures and properties.",

Our study shows that blocking the JAK2/STAT3 pathway enhances immunogenic efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib (Ali)–induced senescence by reducing immunosuppressive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) while preserving immunogenic SASP. Hypothesizing that SASP reprogramming with Ali and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Rux) will benefit cancer immunotherapy, we create nanoparticulate crystals (Ali-Rux) composed of Ali and Rux with a fully active pharmaceutical ingredient. Immunization with Ali-Rux–orchestrated senescent cells promotes stronger activation of antigen-presenting cells, enhancing antitumor immune surveillance. This approach remodels the TME by increasing CD8 + T cell and NK recruitment and activation while decreasing MDSCs. Combined with PD-L1 blockade, Ali-Rux elicits a durable antitumor immune response, suggesting the TME reshaping approach as a potential cancer immunotherapy.",

We used a heterostructure comprising SrSnO 3 /La:SrSnO 3 /GdScO 3 (110), and applied electrostatic gating, which allow us to effectively separate charge carriers in SrSnO 3 from dopants and achieve phonon-limited transport behavior in strain-stabilized tetragonal SrSnO 3 . This led to a modulation of carrier density from 10 18 to 10 20 cm −3 , with room temperature mobilities ranging from 40 to 140 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . The phonon-limited mobility, calculated from first principles, closely matched experimental results, suggesting that room temperature mobility could be further increased with higher electron density. In addition, the sample exhibited 85% optical transparency at a 300-nm wavelength.

This enhancement is universally applicable to any scintillating material and dopant when the material’s nanoscale geometry is engineered. We design a thin multilayer nanophotonic scintillator, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced scintillation with 50% enhancement in emission rate and 80% enhancement in light yield.

Compared with common planktonic probiotic formulations, probiotic biofilms forming on a robust GCS exhibit enhanced stress tolerance and better colonization capacity in the mouse vagina. Moreover, DNA nanodevices are decorated on the GCS and dynamically report the microenvironment change of biofilms for timely evaluating bacterium activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, GCS-LBs are used for treating AV in an Escherichia coli –infected mouse model, which shows enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared with conventional antibiotic or lactobacillus monotherapy.

Computer-based individual behavioral tracking of worker bees with biallelic stop mutations in colonies revealed that the dsx gene is required for the rate and duration of group-supporting behavior that scales the relationship between bees and their work. General sensorimotor functions remained unaffected. Unexpectedly, unlike in other insects, the dsx gene is required for the neuronal wiring of the mushroom body in which the gene is spatially restricted expressed.

Here, we report two cryo–electron microscopy structures of amyloid fibrils formed by H46R and G85R. These mutations lead to the formation of amyloid fibrils with unique structures distinct from those of the native fibril. The core of these fibrils features a serpentine arrangement with seven or eight β strands, secured by a hydrophobic cavity and a salt bridge between arginine-85 and aspartic acid–101 in the G85R fibril. We demonstrate that these mutant fibrils are notably more toxic and capable of promoting the aggregation of wild-type SOD1 more effectively, causing mitochondrial impairment and activating ferroptosis in cell cultures, compared to wild-type SOD1 fibrils.

          "abstract": "Because of the depth of the hippocampal-entorhinal complex (HC-EC) in the brain, understanding of its role in spatial navigation via neuromodulation was limited in humans. Here, we aimed to better elucidate this relationship in healthy volunteers, using transcranial temporal interference electric stimulation (tTIS), a noninvasive technique allowing to selectively neuromodulate deep brain structures. We applied tTIS to the right HC-EC in either continuous or intermittent theta-burst stimulation patterns (cTBS or iTBS), compared to a control condition, during a virtual reality–based spatial navigation task and concomitant functional magnetic resonance imaging. iTBS improved spatial navigation performance, correlated with hippocampal activity modulation, and decreased grid cell–like activity in EC. Collectively, these data provide the evidence that human HC-EC activity can be directly and noninvasively modulated leading to changes of spatial navigation behavior. These findings suggest promising perspectives for patients suffering from cognitive impairment such as following traumatic brain injury or dementia.",

          "abstract": "Living therapeutics is an emerging antitumor modality by living microorganisms capable of selective tropism and effective therapeutics. Nevertheless, primitive microbes could only present limited therapeutic functionalities against tumors. Hybridization of the microbes with multifunctional nanocatalysts is of great significance to achieve enhanced tumor catalytic therapy. In the present work, nitric oxide synthase (NOS)–engineered Escherichia coli strain MG1655 (NOBac) was used to hybridize with the sonopiezocatalytic BaTiO 3 nanoparticles (BTO NPs) for efficient tumor-targeted accumulation and antitumor therapy. Under ultrasound irradiation, superoxide anions created by the piezocatalytic reaction of BTO NPs could immediately react with nitric oxide (NO) generated from NOBac to produce highly oxidative peroxynitrite ONOO − species in cascade, resulting in robust tumor piezocatalytic therapeutic efficacy, prompting prominent and sustained antitumoral immunoactivation simultaneously. The present work presents a promising cancer immunotherapy based on the engineered and hybridized microbes for highly selective and sonopiezo-controllable tumor catalytic therapy.",

          "abstract": "Geminal bromofluoroalkenes are an important subclass of versatile organic interhalide, which can serve as useful synthetic precursors to monofluoroalkenes that are valuable amide group isosteres. Nonetheless, despite the vast advancement of olefination methodologies, the broadly applicable stereoselective synthesis remained elusive for geminal bromofluoroalkenes before our work. In particular, the seemingly straightforward Wittig-type approach with interhalogenated phosphorus ylide has been unsuccessful because of the difficulty in the diastereoselective oxaphosphetane formation. Here, we describe a conceptually distinctive strategy, by which the stereoselectivity is gained via the selective decomposition of the oxaphosphetane intermediates. The suitably identified phosphorus(III) reagent and reaction medium enabled efficient kinetic differentiation, which was supported by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and density functional theory calculation. Through our method, the highly diastereoselective synthesis of geminal E -bromofluoroalkenes was accomplished in one step. Furthermore, the generality was demonstrated by accommodating a wide range of readily available carbonyl compounds, including ketones and pharmaceutical substrates.",

          "abstract": "Secondary metabolites often function as antipredator defenses, but when bioactive at low concentrations, their off-target effects on other organisms may be overlooked. Candidate “keystone molecules” are proposed to affect community structure and ecosystem functions, generally originating as defenses of primary producers; the broader effects of animal chemistry remain largely unexplored, however. Here, we characterize five previously unreported polyketides (alderenes A to E) biosynthesized by sea slugs reaching exceptional densities (up to 9000 slugs per square meter) in Northern Hemisphere estuaries. Alderenes comprise only 0.1% of slug wet weight, yet rendered live slugs or dead flesh unpalatable to three co-occurring consumers, making a potential food resource unavailable and redirecting energy flow in critical nursery habitat. Alderenes also displaced infauna from the upper sediment of the mudflat but attracted ovipositing snails. By altering communities, such compounds may have unexpected cascading effects on processes ranging from bioturbation to reproduction of species not obviously connected to the producing organisms, warranting greater attention by ecologists.",

          "abstract": "Centrosomes are membrane-less organelles that orchestrate a wide array of biological functions by acting as microtubule organizing centers. Here, we report that caspase-2–driven apoptosis is elicited in blood cells failing cytokinesis and that extra centrosomes are necessary to trigger this cell death. Activation of caspase-2 depends on the PIDDosome multi-protein complex, and priming of PIDD1 at extra centrosomes is necessary for pathway activation. Accordingly, loss of its centrosomal adapter, ANKRD26, allows for cell survival and unrestricted polyploidization in response to cytokinesis failure. Mechanistically, cell death is initiated upstream of mitochondria via caspase-2–mediated processing of the BCL2 family protein BID, driving BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Remarkably, BID-deficient cells enforce apoptosis by engaging p53-dependent proapoptotic transcriptional responses initiated by caspase-2. Consistently, BID and MDM2 act as shared caspase-2 substrates, with BID being kinetically favored. Our findings document that the centrosome limits its own unscheduled duplication by the induction of PIDDosome-driven mitochondrial apoptosis to avoid potentially pathogenic polyploidization events.",

NK cells have impaired cytotoxicity when cultured in hypoxia (1% oxygen) but not physiologic (&gt;5%) or atmospheric oxygen (20%). We found that changes to cytotoxicity were regulated at the transcriptional level and accompanied by metabolic dysregulation. Dosing with interleukin-15 (IL-15) enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity in hypoxia, but preactivation with feeder cells bearing IL-21 and 4-1BBL was even better. Preactivation resulted in less perturbed metabolism in hypoxia; greater resistance to oxidative stress; and no hypoxia-induced loss of transcription factors (T-bet and Eomes), activating receptors, adhesion molecules (CD2), and cytotoxic proteins (TRAIL and FasL). There remained a deficit in CD122/IL-2Rβ when exposed to hypoxia, which affected IL-15 signaling. However, tri-specific killer engager molecules that deliver IL-15 in the context of anti-CD16/FcγRIII were able to bypass this deficit, enhancing cytotoxicity of both fresh and preactivated NK cells in hypoxia.",

          "abstract": "Slim cameras are essential in state-of-the-art consumer electronics such as smartphones or augmented/virtual reality devices. However, reducing the camera thickness faces challenges primarily due to the thick lens systems. Current lens systems, composed of stacked refractive lenses, are fundamentally constrained from becoming thinner due to the presence of empty spaces between lenses and the excessive volume of each lens. Here, we present a lens system using metasurface folded optics to overcome these pervasive issues. In our design, metasurfaces are arranged horizontally on a glass wafer and direct light along multifolded paths inside the substrate. This approach achieves an ultra-slim lens system with a thickness of 0.7 millimeters and 2× thinner relative to the EFL, thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional optical platforms. It delivers quasi-diffraction–limited imaging quality with a 10° field of view and an f number of 4 at an operational wavelength of 852 nanometers. Our findings provide a compelling platform for compact cameras using folded nano-optics.",

In this study, we developed a biomimetic hydrogel to improve the osteogenic microenvironment and promote stem cell homing. This hydrogel served as a container for S-nitrosoglutathione and Ca 2+ , promoting the release of bioactive nitric oxide (NO) from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and human vascular endothelial cells and activating the NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling pathway. These changes promote osteogenic and angiogenic couplings. The hydrogel simultaneously recruited BMSCs by conjugating the stem cell homing peptide SKPPGTSS. Using a rat distal femoral defect model, it was demonstrated that this hydrogel can effectively increase the formation of bone tissue and new blood vessels and has immune-regulating functions. We envision that this hydrogel may be a minimally invasive yet highly effective strategy for expediting the healing of osteoporotic bone defects.",

To investigate mechanisms that restrain combination immunotherapy sensitivity in immune-excluded tumors, we used imaging mass cytometry to explore cellular distribution in an immune-evasive KRAS mutant lung cancer model. Cellular spatial pattern characterization revealed a community where CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and dendritic cells were gathered, suggesting localized T cell activation. KRAS-G12C inhibition led to increased PD-1 expression, proliferation, and cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells, and CXCL9 expression by dendritic cells, indicating an effector response. However, suppressive regulatory T cells (T regs ) were also found in frequent contact with effector T cells within this community. Lung adenocarcinoma clinical samples showed similar communities. Depleting T regs led to enhanced tumor control in combination with anti–PD-1 and KRAS-G12C inhibitor. Combining T reg depletion with KRAS inhibition shows therapeutic potential for increasing antitumoral immune responses.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are frequent in cancer, yet their precise role in cancer progression remains debated. To functionally evaluate the impact of mtDNA variants on tumor growth and metastasis, we developed an enhanced cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) generation protocol and established isogenic human melanoma cybrid lines with wild-type mtDNA or pathogenic mtDNA mutations with partial or complete loss of mitochondrial oxidative function. Cybrids with homoplasmic levels of pathogenic mtDNA reliably established tumors despite dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation. However, these mtDNA variants disrupted spontaneous metastasis from primary tumors and reduced the abundance of circulating tumor cells. Migration and invasion of tumor cells were reduced, indicating that entry into circulation is a bottleneck for metastasis amid mtDNA dysfunction. Pathogenic mtDNA did not inhibit organ colonization following intravenous injection. In heteroplasmic cybrid tumors, single-cell analyses revealed selection against pathogenic mtDNA during melanoma growth. Collectively, these findings experimentally demonstrate that functional mtDNA is favored during melanoma growth and supports metastatic entry into the blood.",
