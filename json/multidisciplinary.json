          "abstract": "Plasma membrane integrity is vital for nearly all aspects of cell functioning1. Mechanical forces can cause plasma membrane damage2, but it is not known whether there are large molecules that regulate plasma membrane integrity under mechanical strain. Here we constructed a 384-well cellular stretch system that delivers precise, reproducible strain to cultured cells. Using the system, we screened 10,843 siRNAs targeting 2,726 multi-pass transmembrane proteins for strain-induced membrane permeability changes. The screen identified NINJ1, a protein recently proposed to regulate pyroptosis and other lytic cell death3,4, as the top hit. We demonstrate that NINJ1 is a critical regulator for mechanical strain-induced plasma membrane rupture (PMR), without the need of stimulating any cell death programs. NINJ1 level on the plasma membrane is inversely correlated to the amount of force required to rupture the membrane. In the pyroptosis context, NINJ1 on its own is not sufficient to fully rupture the membrane, and additional mechanical force is required for full PMR. Our work establishes that NINJ1 functions as a bona fide determinant of membrane biomechanical properties. Our study also suggests that PMR across tissues of distinct mechanical microenvironments is subjected to fine tuning by differences in NINJ1 expression and external forces.",

          "authors": "Alyssa Ney",
          "abstract": "This week, physicists are gathering on the German island of Helgoland to commemorate 100 years since the discovery of quantum mechanics. In the century following Werner Heisenberg’s theoretical masterstroke — made while convalescing from hay fever on that island — this theory has become ever more precise in its descriptions and successful in its applications. With technologies such as quantum computers, we stand at the cusp of a revolution that promises to bring the quantum world into many aspects of our lives.\n\nYet there is still no consensus about what it all means — about the deep lessons that quantum mechanics reveals about the fundamental nature of reality. Addressing this issue takes us from the domain of physics into the realm of philosophy. Although physicists are best placed to develop and extend the mathematical framework of quantum theory and design experiments to test it, philosophers of physics are needed to come to conceptual grips with the result: they have the tools to contextualize that framework and set it in a coherent account of reality.\n\nLong-running disputes\n\nYet physicists and philosophers cannot agree about even the basics. A common refrain among philosophers of physics, and indeed some physicists, is that the textbook formulation of quantum mechanics has a ‘measurement problem’ — an unmanageable emphasis on the role of observers and their observations that makes it impossible to even begin to answer questions about the theory’s connection to the structure of reality. Many physicists beg to differ: some even argue that the emphasis on observers is the key to unlocking the deeper meaning of quantum mechanics.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nThese two camps remain at loggerheads. But there might be a way to bring them together — by revisiting connections between ideas that have been around for more than half a century.\n\nDisagreements about the meaning of quantum mechanics start with its description of physical systems through ‘wave functions’ that assign probabilities for the many possible values of a system’s measurable properties, such as its position. Repeated measurements of the same quantum system deliver a range of results in accordance with the probabilities encoded in the wave function. The standard explanation makes use of the Copenhagen interpretation, an approach championed by Heisenberg and the Danish physicist Niels Bohr in quantum theory’s early years. It says that physical objects fail to have definite values for their properties until they come into contact with an external observer or measuring device. This interaction between observers and quantum systems is essential to creating a definite reality. It is typically described as ‘wave function collapse’, although Bohr and Heisenberg were sceptical of interpreting this collapse as a genuine physical process.\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation was controversial from the start. Bohr and Albert Einstein, two titans of physics, notoriously maintained a decades-long debate about its validity, lasting until Einstein’s death in 1955. Much later, physicist John Bell laid out1 a series of objections to interpretations of quantum mechanics in which measurement played a fundamental part. According to this take, observers and measurements are imprecise and subjective concepts that don’t correspond to fundamental physical entities; they arise, rather, from the complex behaviour of more-basic entities, and so shouldn’t be referenced in fundamental physical laws.\n\nOver the decades, alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics have been proposed that remove reference to measurements or observers from the fundamental description of the quantum world. There are, for example, spontaneous-collapse theories, in which wave functions collapse into determinate realities independently of any observer or measurement process2,3. And the many-worlds interpretation, initially proposed4 by the physicist Hugh Everett in his PhD dissertation at Princeton University in New Jersey in the mid-1950s, suggests that observers do not collapse the wave function at the point of measurement. Instead, they pass into one of several parallel universes corresponding to the possible outcomes encoded in the wave function. By making a measurement, observers are not playing any fundamental part in creating reality, but merely choosing their route through it.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nThis idea has many detractors, not least because a potentially infinite number of parallel universes seems a profligate solution to the measurement problem. But the dominant narrative among philosophers has become that only by starting from ‘objective’, observer-free mathematical frameworks, and escaping the clutches of the (in their view) confused and confusing Copenhagen interpretation, can we begin to draw concrete conclusions about what quantum mechanics tells us about the fundamental nature of the Universe (or, if the many-worlds theory is right, multiverse)5,6.\n\nBut many physicists working in quantum foundations espouse a counter-narrative: although there isn’t absolute truth in the Copenhagen interpretation, quantum mechanics does force a reinterpretation of the observer’s part in fundamental scientific theories. In this view, textbook formulations of quantum mechanics do not face a measurement ‘problem’. They make central use of observers and measurements — but so they must. The interesting question is not how to get rid of observers, but rather how exactly to understand their role, and what that implies for the relationship of quantum theory to the world beyond the observer.\n\nMaking the Universe\n\nSeveral contemporary interpretations of quantum mechanics build on this idea. These include quantum Bayesianism, or QBism, which interprets quantum states in terms of the subjective probabilities that agents assign to events7, and the approaches of Anton Zeilinger8 and Časlav Brukner9, both quantum physicists at the University of Vienna, which stress the centrality of information. But this work is proceeding mostly without the support of philosophers of physics, who remain reluctant to embrace what they see as the central fallacy of Copenhagen and its offspring: a fundamental role for observers.\n\nOne common reason expressed for this reluctance6,10 is that such a move would equate to embracing instrumentalism: the idea that a theory doesn’t provide a true description of reality, but is a tool that allows observers to make better predictions about it. If the goal is to understand the fundamental nature of reality using quantum physics, any instrumentalist interpretation is thus a dead end.\n\nInstrumentalism was promoted in the early days of the Copenhagen interpretation — it is explicit in Heisenberg’s work, for example. But physicists today are more likely to espouse realism, viewing quantum mechanics as an attempt to gain knowledge of the fundamental structure of reality. In the words of the Christopher Fuchs, a physicist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston and one of the creators of QBism, “what is at stake with quantum theory is the very nature of reality. Should reality be understood as something completely impervious to our interventions, or should it be viewed as something responsive to the very existence of human beings?”11. In this view, the privileged status of observers in creating reality is the distinctive claim that quantum mechanics makes.\n\nParticle, wave, both or neither? The experiment that challenges all we know about reality\n\nThis position has little to do with instrumentalism. But it does go down the road of idealism — the philosophical position that reality is fundamentally composed of mental entities such as ideas. Contemporary philosophers of science are strongly disposed against this concept, and that position is not purely dogmatic. Idealism was the dominant position for most of the 2,500-year history of philosophy in the West, defining the work of influential thinkers from Plato in ancient Greece to George Berkeley, Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It was rejected only in the twentieth century, after a long march of breakthroughs in physics, chemistry, molecular biology and neuroscience that established the molecular nature of biological processes, demystified much of the operation of the brain and dispelled notions of the ‘vital forces’ that supposedly gave life to inert matter12.\n\nQuantum physics has played a huge part in establishing this reductive, supposedly objective world view — the one also referenced in Bell’s critique1 — which makes plain that human observers are far from fundamental entities. So it might seem odd that increasing numbers of physicists working on the foundations of quantum theory are inclined to treat observers as such entities.\n\nOne towering figure of twentieth-century physics, John Archibald Wheeler, argued forcefully in defence of this approach. Wheeler’s work includes pioneering early studies with Bohr on nuclear fission and extensive contributions to the study of the general theory of relativity and black holes (a term that he popularized), but his contributions to quantum foundations have, in my view, not been adequately recognized. I further feel that the key to resolving the current impasse in the understanding of quantum mechanics could come from revisiting his idea of a ‘participatory universe’ — a concept in which reality is not static, but shaped by the perception of conscious observers — and his motivations for proposing it.\n\nIn 1978, Wheeler devised13 a seminal thought experiment on the nature of quantum reality, known as the delayed-choice experiment. In one version, he considers an iteration of the double-slit experiment, in which a stream of single electrons, photons, atoms or molecules — any object obeying the rules of quantum mechanics — is sent through a screen with two narrow apertures. If a detector is placed at the slits, each object seems to pass through one or the other, behaving like a particle. But if the objects pass through the slits and are instead measured on a second screen behind the first, over time, an interference pattern will emerge — as if each object went through both slits at once, diffracting and interfering with itself as a wave would.\n\n‘Shut up and calculate’: how Einstein lost the battle to explain quantum reality",

          "abstract": "Many US hospitals rely on medical AI tools that assist with diagnoses and other tasks.Credit: Hilary Swift for The Washington Post via Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) already helps clinicians to make diagnoses, triage critical cases and transcribe clinical notes in hospitals across the United States. But regulation of medical AI products has not kept up with the rapid pace of their adoption, argue researchers in a report published on 5 June in PLOS Digital Health1.\n\nThe authors point to limitations in how the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves these devices, and propose broader strategies that extend beyond the agency to help ensure that medical AI tools are safe and effective.\n\nMore than 1,000 medical AI products have been cleared by the FDA, and hospitals are rapidly adopting them. Unlike most other FDA-regulated products, AI tools continue to evolve after approval as they are updated or retrained on new data. This raises the need for continuous oversight, which current regulations have limited capacity to ensure.\n\nGoogle AI better than human doctors at diagnosing rashes from pictures\n\nThe discussion is especially timely amid signs that the federal government might scale back AI regulation. In January, President Donald Trump revoked an executive order focused on AI safety, citing a need to remove barriers to innovation. The following month, lay-offs affected staff in the FDA division responsible for AI and digital health.\n\nWithout proper oversight, there is a risk that medical algorithms could give misleading recommendations and compromise patient care. “There have to be safeguards,” says Leo Anthony Celi, a clinical researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a co-author of the report. “And I think relying on the FDA to come up with all those safeguards is not realistic and maybe even impossible.”\n\nLow bar for approval\n\nThe criteria used by the FDA to review and authorize AI medical tools are often less rigorous than those for drugs. And because other countries rely on the FDA to inform their own decisions, its approach could have global implications. According to the FDA, only those tools that might pose a higher risk to patients are required to go through a clinical trial, for example. Another concern is that medical algorithms often perform poorly when applied to populations that differ from the ones they were trained on. Because of these limitations, regulatory approval does not ensure that a medical AI product is beneficial for the people it is intended to help, Celi says.\n\nGoogle AI has better bedside manner than human doctors — and makes better diagnoses\n\nIdeally, hospitals should assess how well the algorithms perform in their own patient populations, and train clinicians to interpret the outputs and respond appropriately before adopting these technologies. “One of the biggest challenges is that the vast majority of hospitals and clinics do not have the resources to hire AI teams” to perform such tests, Celi says, adding that a study published this year2 found that many hospitals are buying AI tools ‘off the shelf’ and using them without local validation. “That is a recipe for disaster,” he says.",

          "abstract": "Rory Lambe recommends finding a community and establishing clear work–life boundaries to make PhD life more fun.Credit: Vincent Hoban/UCD\n\nSarah looked horrified. She was nearing the end of her PhD, and I had asked her how it was going. I had assumed she would be excited to finish. Instead, she explained that ahead of her lay the end of funding, no job offers and the ache of leaving friends behind to move home. We were used to comparing pain: in the same month that Sarah was facing her future, I was juggling four studies, two ethics applications, three assignments and an important upcoming exam. I, too, felt I was at breaking point.\n\nI’m in the second half of my PhD at University College Dublin, developing a machine-learning model that uses data from wearable sensors to assess heart health. I’m passionate about the technology’s potential to transform cardiovascular care — but passion had turned to pressure. The harder I worked, the more impossible progress seemed. The wall I was trying to climb felt taller by the day.\n\nIn my conversation with Sarah, a strong realization struck me. The finishing line that we race towards offers only an illusion of relief. Really, it’s a shift in perspective that we need — a pause and a breath that lets us rediscover joy in the journey. Here are five ways I’ve managed to achieve just that.\n\nKnit your own community\n\nMy friend Giulio studies the general theory of relativity — specifically, a variation involving something called asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-time. He is also an avid knitter. The beauty of knitting, according to Giulio, is that it has absolutely nothing to do with general relativity. But what he enjoys most is the friendship it fosters. His knitting club includes some of his closest friends, all of whom he met after he moved to Ireland from his native Italy.\n\nThe importance of having a genuine community cannot be overstated. The warmth of like-minded friends kindles my heart at the best of times and gave me a shoulder to lean on when Reviewer 2 dismissed six months of my work. These connections are hard to build on online platforms such as LinkedIn or Zoom, so I make an extra effort to get to the office in the morning rather than working alone from home. When it’s sunny, I suggest a short walk to those sitting around me, and I say ‘yes’ when a colleague whom I might not know that well invites me for coffee.\n\nI’ve learnt that taking an interest in others is key when it comes to building community. When I first joined my research centre, I made a concerted effort to remember just a few important details about people’s lives — such as a specific task they were working on, or their plans for the coming weekend. I am always greeted with a smile when I ask how it went.\n\nEstablish clear work boundaries\n\nWorking late, or even at the weekend, might be unavoidable when demands are at their highest, but it should not become the norm. I learnt this the hard way. In the early stages of writing my systematic review, I completed more tasks when I worked for longer — but it was a path to burnout.\n\nWithout a true weekend rest, by Wednesday or Thursday, I would feel as if I had been thrown around in a washing machine. Now, I choose quality of work over quantity.\n\nAnd as for those e-mail notifications that ping late at night? I saved myself so much heartache when I muted my phone’s notifications in the evenings. It can save you, too.\n\nRoutine and resilience can lower stress levels\n\nSimilarly, flexible working hours can quickly turn from friend to enemy if not treated with respect. Flexible schedules are beneficial, but those benefits are best when used sparingly. I found that disregarding my nine-to-five simply led to late nights and weekend work. My body and mind thrive with routine. This routine is grounded in a consistent sleep schedule, and helps me to be resilient to stressful situations.\n\nResponding positively to scenarios that can cause stress is a crucial skill and, to my surprise, I have found that I have much more control over this than I realized. I spent time working in a hospital, and I used to become frustrated when I was frequently contradicted by a senior staff member. However, stepping back from situations such as these and giving my thoughts some extra space facilitated a calmer and more assured response. Each morning, I would do ten minutes of mindfulness. This greatly calmed the traffic in my mind and allowed me to detach whenever I was caught up in it.\n\nAcknowledge your own progress",

          "authors": "Humberto Basilio",
          "abstract": "Levels of the amino acid taurine did not correlate reliably with strength measures in older humans.Credit: Karen Haibara/AFP/Getty\nResearch suggests that blood levels of the amino acid taurine might not be as closely linked to ageing as previous research had suggested. Led by scientists at the US National Institute on Aging (NIA) in Baltimore, Maryland, the study casts doubt on the use of taurine as anageing biomarker— something that could be measured to help determine a person’s health status — and on its use as a dietary supplement to stave off the effects of ageing1.\n\n“We clearly show that there’s no need for taurine supplementation as long as you have a healthy diet,” says Rafael de Cabo, a gerontologist at the NIA. The results were published today in Science.\n\nScientists not involved in the research highlight the rigour of the analysis, which looked at taurine levels in hundreds of humans over time, as well as in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and mice. “Taurine levels were not decreasing [with age] and are not related to any abnormality that they could see in this very good longitudinal study,” says geneticist Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Nevertheless, the study looked only at natural taurine levels in the body, and not at whether supplements have any benefits. “That’s something that has yet to be tested,” he says.\n\nBullish on taurine\n\nTaurine is sold over-the-counter as a dietary supplement, and it is an ingredient in popular caffeinated energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster Energy. Various health effects have been attributed to taurine, including improving focus and energy levels. But these claims have not been thoroughly evaluated.\n\nTaurine, first isolated from ox bile in 1827, is not considered an essential amino acid.\n\nIn a 2023 study, also published in Science2, researchers found that levels of taurine seemed to decline in mice, monkeys and humans as they aged. Daily supplements of the amino acid seemed to extend the lifespan and improve the health of taurine-deficient mice.\n\nBut something about the research “didn’t click”, de Cabo says. His team had been collecting results that showed taurine levels increasing or remaining stable with age.\n\nWhereas the previous study on taurine was cross-sectional in design, meaning that it collected data from animals of different ages at a single point in time, de Cabo’s team also collected longitudinal data, taking samples from the same individuals over time.\n\nIn humans, they studied three different populations, one of which (the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging) included more than 740 participants aged 26–100. In animals, they followed monkeys until they were up to 32 years old and mice up until 27 months — almost their entire lifespan.\n\nIn nearly all cohorts, except the male mice group, taurine levels increased with age.\n\nThe authors also examined taurine’s relationship with things such as muscle strength and body weight. Although there were some associations — such as higher taurine levels being linked to stronger knee strength in one human cohort — the results were inconsistent across age groups, sexes and species. In some cases, higher taurine levels correlated with strength deficiencies. On the basis of these findings, levels of taurine in the blood “are unlikely to serve as a good biomarker of ageing”, says co-author Maria Emilia Fernandez, a gerontologist at the NIA. Finding simple, reliable biomarkers for ageing has long been a goal for the field, because they might provide a shortcut in evaluating drugs and treatments for the maladies of ageing.\n\nDe Cabo’s study is “more convincing” than the previous one, says geneticist David Sinclair at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. In recent years, there has been an over-reliance on cross-sectional data sets, such as those used in the earlier study, he says — and those are highly variable. That variability, he says, can lead to misinterpretations and false-positive conclusions.\n\n‘Big question marks’",

          "title": "Trump moves to slash NSF: why are the proposed budget cuts so big?",
          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "The US National Science Foundation has, in recent years, funded one-quarter of federally backed basic research at US universities.Credit: Briscoe Savoy for Nature\n\nLess than a month after the US National Science Foundation (NSF) marked its 75th anniversary, President Donald Trump has targeted it for an unprecedented budget cut. Scientists are reeling following the Friday release of the Trump team’s proposal for the agency, which funds 25% of federally backed basic research at US universities, and asking: why?\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\n\nTrump has requested cuts to science funding across the board — the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) would lose roughly 40% of its budget compared with 2024 levels, and NASA would be pruned by about one-quarter — but the NSF would lose a whopping 57%, taking its roughly US$9-billion budget down to $3.9 billion. These top-line numbers aren’t new: the administration released a ‘skinny’ budget with similar figures in early May. But the detailed budget released last week gives a fuller look at the historic cuts intended for the NSF — including the elimination of 99% of funding for clean-energy research and the surprise shuttering of a gravitational-wave observatory.\n\nThe president’s budget request will not necessarily be put into practice: it must be approved by the US Congress. But policy watchers are worried that lawmakers might not stand up to Trump by rejecting many of his cuts, as they did during his first term as president.\n\nIf the NSF budget were to be enacted as is, it “would spell the end of any pretence that the US leads the world in science and technology, handing that position to China”, says Neal Lane, who directed the agency under Democratic former president Bill Clinton. Agency staff members, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press, told Nature that they are unsurprised, but deeply concerned. “The president’s request is a stab in the back of US science,” one staff member says.\n\nA spokesperson for the NSF told Nature that the request “reflects a strategic alignment of resources in a constrained fiscal environment”.\n\nHits across the board\n\nThe vast majority of the $5-billion cut would be to research-grant funding, although certain disciplines would be hit harder than others: the geosciences directorate faces a 44.6% cut; the education directorate would be reduced by 75%; and the maths and physics directorate would decline by 66.8%. These three would account for about $2.6 billion of the cutback.\n\nNSF slashes prestigious PhD fellowship awards by half\n\nThe president’s budget would reduce the number of people who receive support for NSF activities annually from 330,000 to about 90,000, in part by making grants much more competitive: the current 26% success rate for applicants would dwindle to just 7%. On the social-media platform Bluesky, researchers lamented their prospects. “It ain’t worth my time now,” posted Dan Collier, a scientist studying higher education at the University of Memphis in Tennessee. Mike Boylan Kolchin, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote: “One of the worst effects of having success rates this low: review panels & funding agencies will become *extremely* risk-averse.”\n\nEven the Trump administration’s stated priorities, such as artificial intelligence and quantum information science, would take a hit: they would see increases of 3.1% and 0.4%, respectively, but that is not enough to keep pace with inflation.\n\nIn a shock move, the proposed budget would cut funding by about 40% for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The project, which has sites in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana, is one of the NSF’s biggest success stories. In 2016, LIGO directly detected gravitational waves emanating from the merger of two black holes, and its scientists went on to win a share of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nIf Trump’s request comes to fruition, one of LIGO’s two detectors will close. The budget request does not provide a rationale. Losing one of its two detectors would be “devastating”, says astrophysicist David Reitze, executive director of LIGO at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The programme would lose much of its ability to locate gravitational-wave events and would be more susceptible to ‘noise’, such as that produced by earthquakes, so that it might incorrectly classify the events it does detect, Reitze says.",

Credit: SusanneB/Getty\n\nA university-scoring method that highlights research-integrity ‘red flags’ could make it easier to spot institutions that are chasing conventional publishing metrics at the expense of rigorous science, researchers say.\n\nThe Research Integrity Risk Index, described in a preprint on arXiv last month1, categorizes institutions according to how many of their papers are retracted and how many are published in journals delisted from the scholarly databases Scopus and Web of Science. Researchers say that the index could improve university ranking systems that currently reward quantity of research output over quality.\n\nElite university strategies might boost profile and rankings, but at what cost?\n\n“Universities want to be seen as rising stars”, but it is not always clear whether they are “rising on solid ground or statistical quicksand”, says Lokman Meho, an information scientist at the American University of Beirut, who says he developed the index as a way to help identify “environments where integrity may be compromised by pressure to maximize metrics” such as publication rates. The measure is not designed to identify research misconduct, he stresses, “but reveal vulnerabilities warranting further review”.\n\nThe index is “a good first step” and “should be used by the ranking agencies”, says Achal Agrawal, a data scientist in Raipur, India, and founder of India Research Watch, an online group of researchers and students who highlight integrity issues. It “offers a strong and timely correction to a system that too often equates research excellence with sheer volume”, says Kiran Sharma, a data scientist at BML Munjal University in Gurugram, India. “It shifts attention from quantity to integrity, helping realign academic incentives with genuine scholarly value.”\n\nRanking rethink\n\nGlobal university rankings often track how many papers an institution publishes and how often its research gets cited. Meho says that such ‘positive data’ can be misleading — and that some institutions exploit them to climb the rankings. “I wanted to go the other way, the research-integrity part,” he says.\n\nMeho’s index ranks universities by the proportion of their papers that are published in delisted journals and how often their papers have been retracted over the past two years. Meho says he chose these two criteria because they were ‘objective’ and based on publicly available data, although he explored other ways to quantify integrity concerns, such as the presence of hyper-prolific authors and whether there had been a decrease in the proportion of papers that listed an institution's researchers as first or corresponding authors. The tool places institutions into one of five categories, ranging from ‘low risk’ to ‘red flag’, which suggests high rates in both measures and indicates a need for urgent scrutiny.\n\nSurge in number of ‘extremely productive’ authors concerns scientists\n\nWhile developing the index, Meho analysed 18 institutions — located in Saudi Arabia, India, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates — which had seen ‘extreme publication growth’ and rapidly climbed international rankings over the past few years.",

Credit: tadamichi/Getty\n\nA group of research-integrity experts has launched a toolkit for researchers that outlines how to spot suspicious scientific papers.\n\nThe guide’s creators hope that it will be a useful resource for sleuths who review published work for signs of sloppy, fake or fraudulent science, and will perhaps inspire others to get started. “The sleuthing community is growing. And this will be the essential handbook,” says Jana Christopher, an image-integrity analyst at FEBS Press in Heidelberg, Germany, who contributed to the project.\n\nWhat makes an undercover science sleuth tick? Fake-paper detective speaks out\n\nThe Collection of Open Science Integrity Guides (COSIG) brings together 27 freely available resources that explain how to spot image duplication, citation manipulation, plagiarism, tortured phrases and other hallmarks of paper mills — businesses that produce fake papers to order. The guides also provide tips for reviewing papers in specific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, statistics and computer science.\n\n“COSIG is really a compendium of all the tips and tricks that various sleuths have acquired over the years,” says Reese Richardson, a metascientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who led the project and authored a preprint on COSIG posted to the repository Zenodo on 4 June1. “We want to arm scientists with the tools to uphold the integrity of the literature.”\n\n“It will really help publishers, as well,” says Christopher, adding that research-integrity officers could use the guide as the basis for checklists to evaluate manuscripts.\n\n‘Anybody can do it’\n\nRichardson came up with the idea for COSIG last year, while at a meeting of science-integrity specialists in Paris. Concerned about the surge in formulaic research and flawed publications that continue to circulate largely unnoticed, he and other delegates wanted to broaden participation in correcting the literature and to help more people learn how to scrutinize papers.\n\n“A lot of people assume that you need some special talent, you need eagle eyes to see things, or you need to be at your computer ten hours a day looking through the scientific literature. But really, anybody can do it,” says Richardson. “That’s one of our mantras.”\n\nAI beats human sleuth at finding problematic images in research papers\n\nThe guides describe how to spot issues that are common across all disciplines, such as text that has been generated using artificial intelligence (AI), and publications from hijacked journals — scam websites that impersonate legitimate journals. They include instructions for how to use online tools such as the Feet of Clay Detector, which flags papers citing retracted or problematic research, and Imagetwin and Proofig, which use AI to detect integrity issues in scientific figures.\n\nSome of the guides home in on areas of research that have seen a recent surge in formulaic publications, and those that are frequently targeted by paper mills.\n\nFor example, one guide shows how to detect experiments that use non-existent cell lines, or contaminated ones that are no longer suitable for studying certain cancers. Another outlines how to check that tumour sizes in rodent studies fall within limits approved by institutional ethics committees (a reported size that is too large to have been approved can be a sign of manipulated or fabricated experiments).",

          "abstract": "Jayanta Bhattacharya, head of the US National Institutes of Health, testified about proposed budget cuts to his agency at a Senate hearing on 10 June.Credit: Win McNamee/Getty\n\nCapitol Hill, Washington DC\n\nUS senators grilled National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Jayanta Bhattacharya at a hearing on 10 June about how his professed support for science squares with unprecedented funding delays and research-grant terminations at the agency this year, as well as enormous cuts that have been proposed for its 2026 budget.\n\nCan NIH-funded research on racism and health survive Trump’s cuts?\n\nWhat would normally be a routine hearing about government spending was anything but: hundreds of scientists and advocates for Alzheimer’s disease research packed into a cramped room on Capitol Hill to denounce US President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget request, which calls for cutting the NIH’s budget by about 40% and collapsing its 27 institutes and centres into 8.\n\nSuch a cut “would stop critical Alzheimer’s research in its tracks”, Tonya Maurer, an advocate for the Alzheimer’s Association, a non-profit group based in Chicago, Illinois, told Nature at the hearing. “We’ve worked too damn hard to see this happen.”\n\nBhattacharya defended his leadership at the agency — the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world — noting that there is a “need for reform at the NIH” and that to restore its reputation, the NIH “cannot return to business as usual”. (The NIH has been accused by Trump and his Republican allies of funding ‘woke’ science and research on coronaviruses that they say could have sparked the COVID-19 pandemic.) To help fix the agency, Bhattacharya told the senators that he wants to focus on increasing reproducibility in biomedical research, upholding academic freedom and studying the cause of autism, which US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr has pledged to find an answer to by September.\n\nLetters of dissent\n\nThe hearing comes the day after more than 300 NIH staff members sent Bhattacharya a fiery letter decrying the mass termination of jobs at the agency and its cancellation of thousands of research projects on a growing list of topics that the Trump team has said are ‘politicized’, including those investigating the biology of COVID-19, the health of sexual and gender minorities (LGBT+) and reasons that people might be hesitant to receive a vaccine.\n\nExclusive: NIH to cut grants for COVID research, documents reveal\n\n“We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,” the staff members wrote.\n\nThey named their letter the ‘Bethesda Declaration’, after the Maryland community and Washington DC suburb where most of the NIH is located. The title also alludes to the ‘Great Barrington Declaration’, an open letter that Bhattacharya co-signed in October 2020 that argued against COVID-19 lockdowns except for the most vulnerable citizens, instead allowing for children and others to be infected so that ‘herd immunity’ could be reached ― a proposal that numerous scientists and NIH officials called dangerous at the time.\n\nAt the hearing, Patty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington, implored Bhattacharya to “heed their warning”, and said that she expects that “none of them face retaliation for raising those concerns”.\n\nBhattacharya didn’t respond to this comment at the hearing but said in a statement on 9 June that the Bethesda Declaration “has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months”, but that “respectful dissent in science is productive”.\n\nGavin Yamey, a global-health researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, who signed the latest declaration, said, “he can talk about freedom, but his own staff are decrying his censorship. How he’s actually acting and what he says are not one in the same.”",

          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "In her professional life, Sophia Newcomer analyses vaccination trends and safety in the United States. The epidemiologist, at the University of Montana, Missoula, has investigated the factors that stop some people from completing their children’s recommended immunizations.\n\nSo it’s no surprise that in her personal life, Newcomer is asked questions about vaccines, too. “I’m a mom — I’ve had plenty of playground conversations,” she says. “When people find out I study vaccines, they love to ask questions. What I try to do is listen and, as best as I can, share what I know.”\n\nQuestions and doubts about vaccines are on the rise worldwide. A major global study found that perceptions of vaccines’ importance for children dropped in 52 of 55 countries studied during the COVID-19 pandemic1 (see ‘Lost confidence’). In the United States, about 20% of parents are hesitant about vaccines — one reason for an outbreak of measles this year that has killed three unvaccinated people.\n\nPublic-health specialists worry that these trends could worsen, in part because of the influence of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has repeatedly questioned the safety of vaccines and inaccurately connected them to autism. Kennedy was tapped this year by US President Donald Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which approves vaccines and makes recommendations about their use.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThe shift in public attitudes towards immunizations can leave scientists, physicians and many others feeling disheartened because vaccines are among the most cost-effective ways to prevent disease and have saved more than 150 million lives over the past 50 years. So what should you say to someone who has doubts? What kind of information or argument might help when talking to family or friends? Fortunately, a surge of research on vaccine hesitancy over the past decade is starting to offer some answers. “There is a lot that we can draw from,” says Heidi Larson, who studies confidence in vaccines at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\n\nResearchers say that anyone can help to address vaccine hesitancy by listening to concerns and offering positive opinions. “If you think vaccination is a good idea, if you trust that, if you think it’s a good way to protect your children, I think you can share that view,” says Daphne Bussink-Voorend, who studies vaccine decisions at Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.\n\nListen, do not judge\n\nThe first thing to do if someone expresses uncertainty about vaccines to you, say researchers, is not to judge or dismiss them. It’s wrong to assume that people are ignorant, irrational or have naively swallowed online misinformation. A lot of people have genuine and legitimate questions and “you’re going to lose them if you immediately jump back and say ‘that’s silly’ or ‘that’s not the fact’”, Larson says. (Researchers distinguish between vaccine hesitancy — being unsure about vaccination — and ‘anti-vaccine’ activists who campaign against it.)\n\n154 million lives and counting: 5 charts reveal the power of vaccines\n\nInstead, researchers agree, it’s best to actively listen, ask questions and be curious about what’s behind the concerns. “I think that is sometimes difficult, but we should really be open to people’s views and ideas,” says Bussink-Voorend. “Once we know what the issues are, what specific barriers are, then we can address them, one by one,” says Mohammad Sharif Razai, a public-health researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nResearchers have identified a wide range of reasons that people hesitate about getting themselves or their children vaccinated. In 2014, an expert working group on vaccine hesitancy convened by the World Health Organization supported grouping these reasons into three buckets: confidence (I don’t trust the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, or the health system delivering them); complacency (I don’t need it because the risks are low); and convenience (I can’t access it easily)2. Context is also important, because people’s culture and religious or ethnic background can influence their attitudes.\n\nOne major European study pointed to the root of many concerns. The study, called VAX-TRUST, examined why parents hesitated to vaccinate their children in seven European countries between 2021 and 2024, a period that spanned the COVID-19 pandemic3. Typically, hesitancy “starts with personal concerns about, ‘what will this do to my child? How will it affect my health?’”, says Pia Vuolanto, a social scientist at Tampere University in Finland, who led the study.\n\nParticularly influential in seeding those doubts, Vuolanto says, were anecdotal stories from friends and in the media that involved possible vaccine side effects. “Previous cases were very important in shaping their views,” she says — even though serious side effects are rare and data show that, for most people, the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks.\n\nA child is vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella in Papua New Guinea.Credit: Kate Holt/eyevine\n\nA review published in 2023 measured the lasting damage one scare story can cause. The authors assessed 115 studies examining why parents in the United States hesitate over the childhood measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine4. The most common reason was fear of triggering autism, which stems partly from a prominent 1998 paper in the Lancet that claimed to show a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The paper was found to be fraudulent and was retracted, and subsequent studies have convincingly shown that no link exists, although Kennedy and others continue to draw connections. A spokesperson at the HHS says that the US National Institutes of Health is actively investigating the root causes of autism, and is confronting the issue of rising autism rates “employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science”.\n\nThe HHS spokesperson added that “blaming Secretary Kennedy for vaccine hesitancy ignores a broader and more complex reality: trust in public-health institutions declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven in large part by inconsistent messaging, shifting mandates and the failure to provide transparent, long-term safety and efficacy data”.\n\nExpress your view\n\nIt might sound obvious, but researchers say that it’s important in a conversation to provide information or opinions. “You need to elicit the concerns and then share accurate, reliable information,” Razai says.\n\nPhysicians and other health-care workers are best placed to provide that advice. A 2023 systematic review of studies, including 15 randomized trials, found that consistent, clear recommendations from trusted health-care professionals that addressed misconceptions and noted benefits were strongly associated with increased vaccination during pregnancy, particularly when the recommendations were delivered face-to-face5. It’s “one of the most important evidence-based strategies”, says Razai, who led the review. But the goal, he stresses, should be enabling someone to make their own informed decision, not telling them what to do. “I think that’s a really effective way of gaining people’s trust.”\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is slashing NIH-backed research — in charts\n\nOne method of doing this in a non-judgemental way is called ‘motivational interviewing’. This involves an empathetic, respectful conversation between a health-care worker and a prospective vaccine recipient that aims to strengthen their motivation. It typically starts with a recommendation to vaccinate, but if someone expresses ambivalence or reluctance, a health worker might ask ‘Why are you unsure?’, then acknowledge the concerns and offer information tailored to address them6.\n\nIf a parent expresses worry about the MMR vaccine and autism, for example, the health worker might say: ‘More than 500 studies around the world have demonstrated that there is no link between the vaccine and autism. The frequency of autism is the same in vaccinated children as it is in non-vaccinated children. What do you think?’ (This compares with a more didactic approach of: ‘The vaccine is safe, I assure you’ or ‘You should update your child’s vaccinations’.)\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that motivational interviewing can change behaviour. In one trial in Quebec, Canada, parents of around 1,100 babies received a session using motivational interviewing on the maternity ward after their children were born7. Seven months later, 76% of children in the experimental group had received all the recommended vaccines, compared with 69% in a control group that did not receive the intervention. This and other results convinced the government in Quebec to roll out the programme to all parents of newborns, starting in 2017. The programme led to a nearly 7% increase in vaccination coverage after 24 months.\n\nPeople who are not health professionals can share such messages, too, researchers say — they don’t have to know detailed facts and figures from studies. It also helps to get personal. “For those who are just a little bit unsure, often sharing your personal experience of why you vaccinated, why you trust vaccines, is enough,” says Vuolanto.\n\nBe honest\n\nTransparency and acknowledging uncertainties is key, researchers say. A systematic review8 of methods for combating vaccine misinformation in 2023 found that communicating with certainty, rather than recognizing that there are unknowns about risks or effectiveness, could backfire. Communicating the weight of evidence and scientific consensus about vaccines seemed more promising.",

          "abstract": "Stefano Sandrone as a child, on holiday.Credit: Image courtesy of Stefano’s mother, Elisabetta\n\nThe culture of long working days, often including weekends, is a troubling norm at many scientific institutions. A 2023 Nature survey of postdoctoral scholars, for example, found that 24% of respondents worked more than 10 extra hours over their contractual hours each week.\n\nI am from Italy, which grants students one of the most generous holiday allowances across all educational levels, from the beginning of primary school to secondary school: a three-month summer break plus days off for religious celebrations and bank holidays.\n\nThe lengthy summer break can be a joy for children and a nightmare for parents. Thanks to my family’s efforts to make the most of those three months while I was growing up, I’ve learnt to enjoy, value and plan holidays.\n\nAs a child, my holidays were filled with lengthy football matches with friends, cultural day trips with mum, gardening with my grandfather, many ice creams and sporadic swims at the nearby Mediterranean seaside with my cousins. There weren’t many moments when I didn’t know what to do, but books and television filled the days when needed.\n\nDuring this time, I learnt how to take holidays seriously. Now that I work as a neuroscientist at Imperial College London, researching how students can learn more effectively, I’ve seen colleagues fail to prepare for their time off. I’ve outlined four steps to nudge students and scientists to embrace stress-free holidays and treat them with the seriousness they deserve.\n\nAvoid the sense of guilt\n\nI sometimes felt guilty about taking time off during the early stages of my academic journey. For my PhD programme, I relocated overseas. I was the youngest member of the laboratory, keen to master new techniques. These factors led me to think, wrongly, that I had to outwork many senior colleagues. But learning takes time, and becomes even more powerful when combined with periods of reflection and relaxation. Plus, most of us are legally entitled, and sometimes even required, to take annual leave: we should feel guilty about not taking those days.\n\nTaking time off also boosts my productivity and creativity — which benefits the workplace much more than the days spent dragging out tasks and stubbornly refusing to leave my desk. Contrary to the popular belief that you must complete every task on your to-do list before taking leave, I can list at least nine papers and seven grant applications I have edited and resubmitted after returning from a holiday — and they were all successful!\n\nPlan ahead of time\n\nGoing on holiday does not have to be expensive or stressful: focus on what you can foresee, but do not worry too much about things you can’t control.\n\nThe real game-changer with preparing beforehand is not the ‘book ahead to secure the best deal’ aspect, but taking time to make a plan for work in your absence. For the sake of your co-workers, avoid taking time off during periods when you know you’ll be busy or your presence is absolutely required.\n\nBut at other times, embrace the risk. Tell your colleagues you will be away (one clear e-mail should do), take the necessary steps to minimize disruption — only you know what those are for your job — and trust your team. Regarding the destination, do not ignore staycations, or stay-at-home holiday options. Exploring your local area and its surroundings ‘as a tourist’ provides a chance to see them from a new perspective. There is probably a museum, a park or a lake near your home. Frequent visits to the Pinacoteca di Brera gallery in Milan, Italy, during my undergraduate studies and swims in the river in Zurich, Switzerland, before beginning my PhD training are memories I still cherish.\n\nA young Stefano Sandrone stands near sailboats on a beach.Credit: Image courtesy of Stefano’s mother, Elisabetta\nPut up an out-of-office message and stick to it",

His start-up company, FutureHouse in San Francisco, California, aims to build an ‘AI scientist’ that can command the entire research pipeline, from hypothesis generation to paper production.\n\nToday, his team took a step in that direction, releasing what it calls the first true ‘reasoning model’ specifically trained for scientific tasks. The model, called ether0, is a large language model (LLM) that’s purpose-built for chemistry, which it learnt simply by taking a test of around 500,000 questions. Following instructions in plain English, ether0 can spit out formulae for drug-like molecules that satisfy a range of criteria.\n\nWhat are the best AI tools for research? Nature’s guide\n\nEther0, which is open source and publicly available from today, joins a host of other efforts aimed at automating the scientific process, including at Google and the Japanese company Sakana AI. But unlike previous specialist models, ether0 tracks its ‘train of thought’ in natural language, providing a window into AI’s ‘black box’ and allowing it to answer questions that typically require complex reasoning. Although some general-purpose reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1, have shown improvement on standardized science tests, they have struggled to generate deep insights without targeted training.\n\nResearchers have expressed a mixture of excitement and concern about FutureHouse’s advance. “I think it’s very cool what they pulled off,” says Kevin Jablonka, a digital chemist at the University of Jena in Germany. When playing around with a preview version of ether0, Jablonka found that the model could draw meaningful inferences about chemical properties that it wasn’t trained on. “That’s impressive and [something] models before couldn’t do,” he says.\n\nAI for science\n\nThe model is the latest release from FutureHouse, which was launched in 2023 as a non-profit organization backed by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt with the mission of expediting the scientific process with AI. In the past year, the company has released an advanced scientific literature reviewer and a platform of AI agents — LLM-based tools designed for specific tasks. These agents draw from the scientific literature and deploy molecular design tools to analyse data and answer detailed questions on drug design. In May, the team announced that it had used these models to propose a new treatment1 for dry age-related macular degeneration, a major cause of blindness.\n\n“Agents are going to be really useful for finding all this stuff in literature that’s just kind of staring at us in plain sight,” says Andrew White, a chemical engineer at FutureHouse who is on sabbatical from the University of Rochester in New York. But like most LLMs, the agents are fundamentally limited by the amount of chemistry information available on the Internet. “There’s right now little real-world impact of those models in labs,” says Jablonka, who led a review published2 last month on the chemistry prowess of LLMs.\n\nFutureHouse was launched in 2023 with backing from former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt.Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty\n\nTo achieve something closer to true understanding, computer scientists have turned to ‘reasoning models’, such as the Chinese model DeepSeek-R1. These AIs are prompted to converse with themselves and show the work that led to their answers. Studies suggest that this internal dialogue seems to improve their accuracy on complex questions, leading Rodriques to suspect that they might be useful for generating new research ideas.\n\nPreviously, when leading reasoning models have taken on science problems, they’ve focused mainly on passing standardized exams with basic textbook understanding, Jablonka says. “There hasn’t been one model that’s reasoning in any useful way in chemistry so far.” FutureHouse set out to change that.\n\nThinking time\n\nFutureHouse researchers took a relatively small LLM from the French start-up firm Mistral AI, which is roughly 25 times smaller than DeepSeek-R1 — compact enough to run on a laptop. Rather than train the model on chemistry textbooks and papers, they found that they could let it learn from taking tests. To do this, White compiled lab-generated chemistry results from 45 scholarly papers, tracking properties such as molecular solubility and smell, and converted them into 577,790 verifiable questions.\n\nCan AI review the scientific literature — and figure out what it all means?\n\nThe researchers taught the base model to ‘think aloud’ by asking it to read incorrect solutions and reasoning chains generated by DeepSeek-R1. Seven versions of the model each tried to solve a specific subset of the chemistry questions, receiving reinforcement rewards for correct answers. The researchers then merged the reasoning chains from those specialist models into one generalist model. After running through the question set once more, they were left with ether0.\n\nThe team assessed ether0’s performance using a further set of questions, some of which were unrelated to those in the training set. Almost across the board, ether0 outperformed frontier models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1. For some problem types, the model more than doubled the accuracy of its competitors. And it did so for a bargain: training a similar state-of-the-art non-reasoning model to achieve comparable accuracy on reaction predictions used 50 times more data.\n\nBut because ether0 can generate solutions only in the form of molecular formulae and reactions, it’s hard to cross-check its performance against other models and humans on independent benchmarks, Jablonka says.\n\nNevertheless, Jablonka found that the model could correctly reason about molecular structures that it had not been trained on — for instance, by changing a molecule’s formula to fit a particular nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum. “I didn’t expect this,” he says.\n\nAdvances in AI could pave the way for robotic laboratories that completely automate parts of the scientific process. Credit: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nThe biggest opportunity presented by these reasoning models, Rodriques says, is that “you get to see what they are thinking throughout the entire process”. His team found that if it allowed the models to reason for longer, the responses became more accurate but less legible — mixing in different languages and inventing new words. The team decided to prioritize interpretability over accuracy by limiting the reasoning time.",

          "abstract": "Plaintiffs (L to R) Nicole Maphis, Brittany Charlton and Katie Edwards. Credit: L-R: Nicole Maphis/Andrew Flamang/Emily Seluta\n\nLawyers representing scientists are pursuing one of several court cases to reinstate US National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants terminated by the administration of US President Donald Trump on topics that it deems “unscientific” or that “no longer effectuate agency priorities”.\n\nThe plaintiffs say the “boilerplate” termination letters did not provide adequate reasoning as to how any specific study failed to meet the agency’s standards for research. The outcome is still uncertain, but a 16 June hearing is set for oral arguments on the legality of the agency’s directives to terminate the grants.\n\nThe plaintiffs include four individual researchers and three organizations with scientific members who conduct research on topics including sexual assault against women and people of colour, vaccine hesitancy, health disparities for people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+) and Alzheimer’s disease. They argue that the cancellations are unlawful for two reasons: they are arbitrary and capricious, and they violate the US Constitution’s separation of powers because they override congressional mandates on the NIH.\n\nLawyers for the researchers argued in court on 22 May for a preliminary injunction against the cancellations. At a 3 June hearing, William Young, a district judge in Massachusetts, decided to merge the researchers’ suit with another that was filed on 4 April by 16 state attorneys-general against the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH, along with its secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the NIH and its director Jay Bhattacharya, for unlawfully terminating existing grants for medical research.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs in the new challenge, epidemiologist Brittany Charlton at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, has lost five grants that supported her research on LGBTQ+ health disparities. The grants totaled US$16 million, of which at least $5 million had yet to be spent. “It had been my dream of the last 20 years, from the moment I stepped onto Harvard’s campus, to launch a centre on LGBTQ+ health, which I did last June,” she says. The vast majority of the centre was funded by her grants. “I don’t have funding to do my research anymore.”\n\nCharlton reached out to civil-rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), headquartered in New York City. Working pro bono, Protect Democracy, a non-profit organization in Washington DC that is representing the researchers, joined the ACLU, the ACLU of Massachusetts and the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit organization in Washington DC, to file the lawsuit on 2 April on the researchers’ behalf. “It was so abundantly clear that people were scared to speak out,” says Charlton. “Many of us [studying LGBTQ+ health] have been targeted our entire careers. We have gotten bomb threats in the past for the work we do. We were ready for this,” she says.\n\nYet the data are clear that LGBTQ+ health disparities exist on many levels. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data show that young LGBTQ+ people are disproportionately affected by poor mental health, suicidal behaviour, violence and sexually transmitted infections. LGBTQ+ individuals also face increased rates of discrimination and unfair treatment in health-care settings. Charlton says her yet-to-be-published research suggests that lesbian women are significantly more likely to have a stillbirth than are their heterosexual counterparts. “That research may never see the light of day because the grant is ended. That is not an efficient use of resources,” she says.\n\nCharlton’s first grant termination arrived roughly ten days after she spoke to the press about cuts to transgender-health funding. “I knew that was potentially the risk I was taking,” she says. A few days later, four more of her grants were terminated.\n\n‘This is so costly’\n\nCo-plaintiff Katie Edwards, a researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who studies violence against minority populations, including young transgender people, has lost six grants from the NIH and one from the National Science Foundation, totaling roughly $13.9 million — of which about half was lost on termination. “My research is helping us understand some of the most vulnerable people. We’re just trying to help kids be healthy and make good decisions to help themselves and others. I don’t know why that’s controversial,” she says.\n\nEdwards found that a curriculum that teaches participants how to recognize sexual-assault risk and gain self-defence knowledge dramatically improved Native American girls’ ability to thwart violence and harassment1. She has also developed an online programme for LGBTQ+ teenagers that reduced alcohol use and dating violence in this group2. “For an administration that wants to save money, this is so costly. Prevention is cost-effective,” she says. According to the CDC, the economic impact of sexual violence is around $122,000 per victim over their lifetime when accounting for lost work, health care and legal fees.\n\nEdwards has also conducted one of the largest studies so far on the public-health impact of sexual assault on men from sexual minorities, currently involving more than 3,000 participants. “We had to stop data collection and cannot analyse the data,” she says. “The whole point of the study was to inform policy.”\n\nEdwards has submitted roughly 30 grants to foundations and philanthropists in a bid to keep the research going and her 50-person staff employed. Working 15-hour days over the past 6 weeks, she’s amassed $10,000 — far short of the several million that she was awarded. \"We’ve already had to reduce a sizable fraction of my staff to part-time status, from full-time positions with benefits, as of 30 May,” she says; the vast majority will soon follow suit without more funding. Edwards is also forgoing her summer salary, which is paid from grants, to keep her team afloat.\n\n“This litigation is the only thing giving me a sense of hope. I feel so powerless,” she says of watching her career, her team and her efforts to serve communities fall apart.\n\n‘Immense bravery’",

          "abstract": "Controlled fires in laboratory safety simulations help lab workers to learn how to respond effectively to lab emergencies.Credit: JohnAlexandr/iStock/Getty\n\nIn August 2016, Margaret Braasch-Turi began her graduate studies in the department of chemistry at Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins. During orientation week, when she was getting familiarized with the laboratory-safety protocols, she couldn’t tell right away that something was wrong as she entered one of the labs, even though a very strong smell of almonds lingered in the air. Then she saw the pool of bodies lying on the floor at the end of the room. A few seconds later, she too was dead.\n\nAt least, that’s how it would have seemed to a casual observer. Braasch-Turi and the rest of the group had been participating in a simulated lab-accident drill. They were a little shocked when the instructors overseeing the exercise tapped them on the shoulder and told them their fate. “What do you mean, we’re dead?” she recalls thinking. “What did we miss?” It turned out to be a simulated leak of cyanide, which smells similar to almonds.\n\nFrom crevasse falls to polar bears, train fieldwork leaders for emergencies\n\nIt’s a dangerous situation that anyone working in a research lab might face, yet few researchers are trained to catch the warning signs and respond appropriately. With this in mind, Ben Reynolds, a lab coordinator at CSU’s chemistry department and one of the instructors, decided about ten years ago to take the standard laboratory safety training — based on online presentations or reading a safety manual — to a new level. He did so by recreating potential accidents, getting his students to respond to the situation and then assessing what they learnt. “I mean, how many more training modules can a grad student or an undergrad take where they’re just clicking through a PowerPoint presentation?” he asks.\n\nSimulations of real emergencies can trigger strong emotions and unexpected issues. To prepare students, institutions worldwide are using lab-accident drills, also known as fantasy lab accidents, and other activities to make training exercises more fun, while also teaching students to manage stress and understand emergency procedures. These drills help participants to identify hazards. They also enable staff to carry out assessments of safety culture, and spark open discussions. (CSU paused its lab-accident drills during the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize mental--health training, and has not resumed them.)\n\nOver the course of one afternoon, Braasch-Turi and the other participants encountered electrocutions, explosions, chemical spills and other emergencies, all acted out by other students and university staff who brought out their theatrical skills to make the scenarios as realistic as possible. They shattered glass, started controlled fires, screamed with despair, writhed on the floor and leaked out pools of fake blood in front of flustered students who had to work out how to respond to the situations without getting ‘injured’ themselves.\n\nHalloween make-up makes injuries look and feel real in fantasy lab-accident drills.Credit: Anthony Appleton\n\nThe scenarios ran from 15 to 20 minutes and students played various parts, such as taking notes, leading the response or making a 911 emergency call to Reynolds’ answering machine. Each exercise ended with a debriefing to run through what had gone right or wrong. Then they moved on to the next scenario. By the end of the afternoon, everyone had experienced each role.\n\n“Wow, this is really stressful. I don’t like this,” Braasch-Turi recalls thinking. As a new PhD student, she felt unprepared to be the person in charge of an accident scene as a lab member or teaching assistant. However, her perspective shifted after the training. Not only had it been more fun than a typical training session, but she also felt more confident and prepared to face an emergency in a range of lab settings. “It helped us be aware of what sort of hazards could exist,” in any lab, she says.\n\nReady for anything\n\nNumerous factors can lead to a lab accident. A study published in Nature Chemistry (A. D. Ménard and J. F. Trant Nature Chem. 12, 17–25; 2020) highlighted reasons including a lack of proper safety training and protective gear, researchers working alone and incorrect storage of equipment. Yet few accurate accounts of these incidents exist globally. In the United States, for example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) establishes and enforces safety standards and healthy working conditions at workplaces, but it doesn’t track the annual incidence of lab accidents.\n\nTo address these gaps, the Laboratory Safety Institute, a non-profit organization that provides lab-safety education from its headquarters in Natik, Massachusetts, has been mapping lab incidents around the world on the basis of newspaper reports or public-database contents. Its founder, James Kaufman, was inspired to start the institute in 1978, after witnessing the aftermath of a lab explosion at his PhD alma mater, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. So far, for the 2020s, the institute has recorded about 240 accidents, ranging from chemical and biological exposures to fires and explosions, the latter being the most common (See ‘Global laboratory safety incidents’). However, its executive director, Stephen Taylor, says that the numbers recorded are likely to be lower than the actual figures, owing to under--reporting. “There’s so much to uncover in the behaviours of scientists, and things that we might be doing that cause problems.”\n\nSource: Laboratory Safety Institute\n\nFurthermore, OSHA regulations vary from laboratory to laboratory depending on which state they are located in, says Anthony Appleton, former safety-culture coordinator at CSU, who is now retired but consults on research safety.\n\nAppleton says that although lab safety culture has improved since he was a student in the mid-2000s, fear of making mistakes or reporting accidents can still run deep. As a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta in 2008, Appleton accidentally stabbed himself with a glass pipette. It was through sheer luck that he reported the injury to a trusted department administrator who knew the proper procedures. That moment motivated Appleton to dedicate his career to improving lab safety. As a safety coordinator across several institutions, he often found that principal investigators were reluctant to engage with environmental health and safety (EHS) offices.\n\nAppleton says that one of the best things about the fantasy lab-accident programme is that it brings together researchers, lab managers, human--resource officers, principal investigators, administrators and EHS staff to have a conversation that says: “Look, we’re all here to help support research, and we can only do our job well if we are all well informed.”\n\nBehind the scenes in the biosafety office\n\nThese drills can also help students to anticipate problems. For example, on several occasions, Reynolds’ students were unable to call 911 because the lab was underground and they had no mobile-phone signal. This prompted conversations about what to do instead, such as how to get to the nearest land line.\n\nInstitutions must also consider people with disabilities when planning lab-safety measures. Yael Medley, a chemistry PhD student at Florida State University in Tampa, has a visual impairment, which means that safety is constantly on her mind. She used to work on a lab on the seventh floor, and although she had enough vision to find her way out of the building in an emergency, she realized that other people with less vision, or with other physical disabilities, wouldn’t be that lucky. “They can’t go down the stairs or take the elevator during a fire situation, so they basically have to wait for somebody to come get them,” she says.\n\nMedley, who once broke her leg falling down a carpeted stairwell that wasn’t clearly marked, thinks it’s important that office staff responsible for planning safety protocols include in their conversations people with disabilities, so as to properly address their needs.\n\nThe issue of disability sometimes surfaced during the fantasy lab drills at CSU, and is another reason why Reynolds thinks administrators should take part in the drills. “It makes their eyes much more wide open when you hear somebody else tell their story from their perspective,” he says.",

          "authors": "Christine Ro, Jack Leeming",
          "abstract": "In March, Omar, a biomedical researcher, posted a request in a private Facebook group for researchers. He was seeking to have his name added to a paper in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and medicine, in exchange for a payment.\n\nOmar is an assistant professor at a Saudi Arabian university. He published 20 papers in 2024 alone, a big jump from 2 the previous year. But it wasn’t enough, says Omar, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. To be promoted, he needed to publish at least ten more papers, in journals in the top half of those ranked by the Web of Science, a citation index. And to meet this demanding requirement, he’d turned to paper mills: fraudulent businesses that deceive publishers so as to arrange authorship, submission and other services related to publications.\n\nOmar wasn’t choosy. The paper could be on any branch of medicine with an AI theme, and he didn’t need to see it before submission. Nor did he mind what position he had in the author list, but he did not want to deal with reviews.\n\nScience’s fake-paper problem: high-profile effort will tackle paper mills\n\nOmar’s circumstances are not unusual: many countries operate a research culture that expects researchers to publish frequently to secure their career in science. Some, like Omar, are unable or unwilling to collect data, conduct analysis and write a paper that might be accepted in a journal. So they turn to organizations online that offer authorship status — for a price. The paper mills that make this their business have various techniques to take advantage of desperate or lazy researchers and to trick publishers: some operate as a marketplace in which extra authorship slots on already--accepted papers are up for grabs. Others take published papers and use AI to tweak text and graphics to escape plagiarism detectors. Still more generate entirely new data sets and text, without the inconveniences of any real laboratory work.\n\nOver WhatsApp, Omar told a reporter for Nature’s careers team, “I am dealing with many writers” as a co-author. Omar wrote that he had already paid for many papers, namechecking co-authors based in India and -Pakistan. He could afford to pay no more than US$400 per paper, he said. Communications he shared indicated that he had paid as little as 76 Saudi riyals (US$20) for one paper. He had marked one Western Union transfer, of 810 Saudi riyals, as an “Education/School fee” on his statement. The reporter contacted Omar after seeing his request on Facebook, and, to explore in more depth why he was offering payment to be included on a paper, posed as the representative of a paper mill.\n\nOmar isn’t the only researcher finding paper mills on Facebook. A separate post offered co-authorship of a paper on medicinal plants and trace elements in return for payment. According to the post, the paper had already been accepted for publication by a respected journal. The reviewers had asked for only minor revisions. Now, the author was seeking other researchers to attach their names to the paper — even though they had not been involved in the research, and would not be needed for substantial revisions.\n\nA US-based plant biologist who was asked by Nature why he had expressed interest in this co-authorship said: “Early-career researchers such as ourselves are under significant pressure to publish, which can sometimes be a challenging aspect of our work.” His Facebook account was then almost immediately deleted.\n\nIvan Oransky, the co-founder of research--integrity blog Retraction Watch, has repeatedly warned of the industrial-level scale of research misconduct, stressing that paper mills are just a symptom of an academic reward system focused on metrics such as university rankings and quantity of publications. In the absence of any other metric, retraction rates are often used to indicate rates of research misconduct, because retractions often occur only when a publisher decides that a paper is too flawed to be fixed with a correction or an erratum.\n\nAnna Abalkina says that pressure on researchers to publish is causing paper mills to multiply.Credit: Stefanie Loos for Nature\n\nAnd these pressures are only intensifying, according to Anna Abalkina, who researches academic fraud, including the use of paper mills, at the Free University of Berlin. She points to two reasons: the increasing number of researchers, and the introduction in many countries of requirements to publish in international journals. Paper mills have stepped in to meet this challenge, she adds.\n\nThe pressures are particularly intense in some countries. Gengyan Tang, a researcher in education at the University of Calgary, Canada, spent almost a year doing research at a teaching hospital affiliated with a medical university in southwest China. “I found that there was a significant demand for paper mills among nurses,” he reports. “Some paper mills even actively promoted their services within hospital departments by handing out business cards and making direct contact with staff.”\n\n“Early-career doctors and nurses in China are now facing even greater pressure to publish,” says Tang. As evaluation standards grow increasingly stringent, they are expected to produce more papers and publish in higher-impact journals than their predecessors, all while managing heavy clinical workloads, he says. “This struggle to balance research, clinical duties and personal life is one of the key factors driving some of them towards the services provided by paper mills.”\n\nTang’s concerns around pressures to publish faced by clinical staff are borne out in the data. A Nature analysis of paper retractions from 2014 to 2024, published in February, found that seven of the ten institutions with the highest proportion of retracted research articles were hospitals in China (see Nature 638, 596–599; 2025).\n\nPaper mills explained\n\nAbalkina defines paper mills as “commercial companies that organize on-demand writing of fraudulent academic manuscripts and offer co-authorship of these papers for sale”. For example, International Publisher LLC, a paper mill based in Russia, generated $6.5 million from co-authorship slots offered between 2019 and 2021, according to an analysis by Abalkina1. She estimates conservatively that the paper-mill industry as a whole is worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year (see ‘A case study of paper-mill purchases in Kazakhstan’).\n\nA case study of paper-mill purchases in Kazakhstan\n\nThe Soviet era left scientists ill-prepared to meet the demands of international journals.\n\nAnna Abalkina, who studies academic fraud at the Free University of Berlin, and her colleague Dorothy Bishop, a research-integrity sleuth and a retired psychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, carried out work that led to the retraction of a number of papers with authors in Kazakhstan. Many were at the country’s Ministry of Education and Science and its Institute for Strategic Studies, a research body based in the capital, Astana.\n\nA large market for paper mills exists in former Soviet countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, says Abalkina. It is driven by their history. During the Soviet era, social scientists at regional universities were accustomed to domestic publication, usually in Russian, and with the expectation that their work would adhere to Soviet ideology.\n\nA push to publish in international journals, she says, meant that many researchers had to grapple with new scientific disciplines and unfamiliar publishing norms. From around 2016, she adds, many scientists published in predatory journals, which tend to have weak editorial and publication practices, and might aggressively solicit submissions. And from around 2019, after Scopus and Web of Science removed a number of predatory journals, the market expanded to paper mills.\n\nIn her role as a research-integrity adviser at Springer Nature, Svetlana Kleiner corresponds with authors of disputed papers, including some who are based in the countries list above. (Springer Nature publishes Nature, but Nature journalists are editorially independent of the publisher.)\n\nShe thinks that some of them had genuinely contributed to the papers in some capacity, and had turned to a third-party service to handle translation or the daunting process of submission. They did not necessarily realize that this would include suggesting and responding to peer reviewers, or that doing so was a violation of journal policies. “It creates a problem when authors think they’re signing up to one service, but they get something more,” Kleiner says. “In some cases they didn’t know that what they were doing was wrong.”\n\nBut she stresses, too, that ignorance is not a reason for absolution. Abalkina says that authors have to remain responsible for their work throughout the publishing process. Otherwise paper mills can, and often do, manipulate reviews, revisions, authorships and citations.\n\nSvetlana Shakirova, head of science at Kurmangazy Kazakh National Conservatory in Almaty, confirms that among Kazakh researchers it was common several years ago to use intermediaries for publication.\n\nIn 2022, the Elsevier journal Thinking Skills and Creativity retracted 47 papers, citing manipulation of peer review. It did so after Abalkina pointed out links to the paper mill Scientific Publications, based in Kyiv. She dubbed the company Tanu.pro after the peculiar e-mail addresses it often used. Shakirova noticed that two of the authors of the retracted papers were based at her own university at the time. She sent a confidential survey to the Kazakh corresponding authors of 11 of the retracted Thinking Skills and Creativity papers. Six of these authors responded. They admitted to using intermediaries with the goal of achieving publication in a journal indexed by Scopus or Web of Science. One author mentioned taking out a loan to pay the intermediary’s fee of US$1,500.\n\nBecause papers are often mass--produced, typical signs include familiar text, duplicated images, suspicious e-mail addresses, implausible collaborations1 and irrelevant citations. Another red flag is “tortured phrases” resulting from attempts to hide plagiarism2 (examples include “profound neural organization” instead of “deep neural network”, and “subterranean insect settlement” instead of “ant colony”). Paper mills have also submitted, and occasionally been successful in publishing, plagiarized or duplicated papers.\n\nOne tactic is for companies to impersonate well-established researchers when offering papers for sale. In August 2024, a post appeared in a Facebook group selling co-authorship slots, for $200 to $700, on a paper about tracking COVID-19. Supposedly, this paper had already been accepted by the Lancet medical journal. The name on the Facebook account was Paul Robin Krugman, and photos of the Nobel prize-winning economist also appeared in profiles on Facebook and on the social-media app Telegram with the same name. The real Krugman confirmed to Nature’s careers team that this was not him. But not all attempts to use the names of genuine academics are this blatant or easy to detect.\n\nMore than 10,000 research papers were retracted in 2023 — a new record\n\nPaper mills offer a bevy of services. A researcher in a bind can find one through word of mouth or by searching online. They might need a paper written from scratch in a particular field, for a particular type of journal. They might already have a draft, but feel that they will have a better chance of acceptance if a third party handles the translation, submission, revision or communication with the journal. They might already have published a paper and want to boost its citations; paper mills often create citation networks to inflate the impact of their papers.\n\nAnd journal editors willing to accept bribes can accept a paper with little or no scrutiny. Similarly, peer reviewers can give a positive review in exchange for payment. One of Omar’s reviews is just 12 words long.\n\nAn unpublished analysis estimates that roughly 2% of all papers submitted to journals in 2022 bore the hallmarks of paper mills, and that the proportion was higher in biology and medicine (see Nature 623, 466–467; 2023). Mass-produced papers in these fields are especially worrying for academic--integrity researchers, because of the damaging effect that this junk science might have on patients.\n\nEasy pickings\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, sociologist Xinqu Zhang and criminologist Wang Peng, both at the University of Hong Kong, conducted anonymous interviews with natural-science academics at three elite Chinese universities, as well as obtaining internal documents3.\n\nOne faculty member told a research-ethics subcommittee that they had “indeed engaged in academic misconduct”. But they added that if university and faculty leaders “had not implemented such inhumane policies and forced us so harshly” to publish as many articles as possible, they “wouldn’t have resorted to unethical means”.\n\nMy ‘woke DEI’ grant has been flagged for scrutiny. Where do I go from here?\n\nThis researcher was found out by his colleagues in the faculty, but punishment was lenient: deductions of salary and research funding for that year, without the case being formally reported to others at the university. A committee member handling the case admitted that faculty members admired their colleague’s research, and wanted to avoid negative attention from the rest of the university and the public. A different researcher feared losing his job while dealing with health problems. He told Zhang and Peng that he “had no choice” but to commit research misconduct. He bought access to an official archive and altered the data to support his hypotheses. He then found someone who could help him to write up articles and have them published. “Money is the answer to everything,” he said. “I met all the required criteria in just a few months, and eventually secured a permanent position in the faculty.” These kinds of admission are rare. Authors whose papers have been retracted on suspicion of paper-mill activity tend to remain silent or to deny any participation in research misconduct.\n\nFor example, in 2019, Alexandr Litoy, a Moscow--based journalist, purchased an authorship slot for a paper sold by International Publisher. When Litoy, who made the purchase as part of an investigation into paper mills, confronted his two co-authors, who specialize in engineering and chemistry, about why they had contributed to a paper on entrepreneurship, both said that it was their first time using the services of the company. But neither admitted any wrongdoing.\n\nPaper mills continue to make it easy for authors to take shortcuts. Science Publisher, a company registered in Riga, offers co-authorship slots on already written (and sometimes already accepted) papers, in a variety of fields. Prices start from around $550, depending on the field, journal and position in the list of authors. Services are advertised on the company’s website, LinkedIn page and Facebook page.\n\nThe company Science Publisher is registered to a residential address in Riga.Credit: Jack Leeming\n\nThe company reassures potential buyers that the advertised title and abstract will be rewritten, to ensure that no one finds out that the paper has been purchased. On its website, photos of at least two purported staff members were copied and pasted from a stock-photo site and an entirely unrelated magazine.\n\nA reporter for Nature’s careers team corresponded with Science Publisher about an advertised position as a research-paper author. An employee asked whether she had any ready-made manuscripts, and whether she could provide extra services such as responding to reviewers’ comments.\n\nIn the Latvian business registry, Igor Vasilev — whose passport was issued in Volzhsky, in the Russian region of Volgograd — is named as the company’s owner. The Russian business registry indicates that a person of the same name and from the same region was previously chief executive of the company ANO Publishing House “Scientific Review”, which offers services similar to those provided by Science Publisher. Abalkina thinks that the Latvian company is a front for the Russian one.\n\nScience Publisher denies any connection to Vasilev, or even that the company is based in Latvia. A staff member responded to an inquiry from Nature’s careers team with hostility and suspicion, accusing the editor of “commercial espionage” and calling him a “fraudulent impostor”.\n\nIn one of its final e-mail communications with the team, a staff member for Science Publisher who described themselves as John Palomarez, director of Academic & Publisher Relations, wrote: “Show your press credentials of Nature on camera? Will you send the proof video of you or any personally [sic] how seeking our Company on behalf of Nature? We’re waiting.”\n\nAfterwards, the address listed on the website was changed from Riga to London, although it retained the Latvian phone number. Reporters representing Nature visited both the Riga and the London address. There were no traces of the company at either location.\n\nCurbs and clampdowns",

          "abstract": "In 2019, I met the health minister of a populous nation. After spending 30 minutes discussing the country’s dementia statistics, the minister politely stopped me mid-sentence — and asked whether I could define dementia. They had never heard the term before.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. As the chief executive of Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI), I’ve had more than one government minister tell me that their country is completely dementia-free. ADI’s 2024 World Alzheimer Report found that 65% of health-care professionals surveyed globally thought that dementia was a normal part of ageing — not a condition caused by a disease (see go.nature.com/3sxtjwj).\n\nEurope sidelines Alzheimer’s drug: lessons must be learnt\n\nThere are many factors behind this global lack of awareness. Dementia’s biological causes are complex and poorly understood, making them hard to explain to people without a scientific background. There’s a stigma associated with the condition that can make people unwilling to engage. And, perhaps because of this stigma, the first organizations to support and advocate for people with dementia weren’t set up until the 1980s — decades after comparable ones for people with cancer.\n\nHowever, in my view, the condition’s invisibility is also partly attributable to a failure of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations to class dementia as one of the world’s deadliest non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Inclusion of dementia in these organizations’ discussions about NCDs could drastically change attitudes worldwide — and could improve access to care and support for people living with the condition and their carers.\n\nIn September, there will be a chance to gain this recognition. During the UN’s fourth high-level meeting on the prevention and control of NCDs and the promotion of mental health and well-being, member states aim to develop a political declaration to chart how the world will address NCDs over the next five years.\n\nReading the signs of dementia\n\nHere’s why dementia must be part of that declaration.\n\nThe UN’s first high-level meeting on NCDs, in 2011, centred on a group of conditions known as the WHO’s ‘big four’ — cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. Being on this list has mattered ever since. The WHO uses it when proposing cost-effective interventions to prevent and control NCDs. Cash-strapped governments use these recommendations to allocate funds.\n\nBut the list is outdated. It is based on the numbers of people killed by NCDs before the age of 70. That might have made sense when the big four were first established — but today, people globally are living longer. In the United Kingdom, for instance, 2017 data showed that men aged 70 and women aged 72 had a remaining life expectancy of 15 years. Those ages are expected to rise.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse, Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "The Trump administration has issued travel restrictions for 19 countries.Credit: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nScientists have been quick to react to US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a new version of the controversial travel ban introduced during his first presidency.\n\nThe latest policy, issued on 4 June, places an indefinite ban on citizens from a dozen countries entering the United States and comes into effect on 9 June. Affected countries include those targeted by the 2017 travel bans, such as Iran and Libya, along with further countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad and Haiti. Partial restrictions on another seven countries, including Burundi, Cuba and Turkmenistan, will deny entry to all immigrants and some people visiting the United States on specific visas.\n\nKristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, says the travel restrictions will be extremely disruptive to infectious-disease research, response and collaboration. “We have multiple colleagues in the affected countries — including countries that are currently experiencing significant outbreaks and epidemics that may well evolve into larger public-health emergencies,” he says.\n\nThe travel ban will likely affect a relatively small number of students at universities in the United States, but it comes after several announcements restricting immigration for students, says a researcher at a major American university who requested anonymity to protect their institution. Last week, the administration announced it would revoke visas for Chinese students. “This feels like the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” they say. “On top of everything else, it is a question of survival for American research universities and I would not be surprised if you start to see, if this persists, universities taking some very drastic measures.” That could include institutions relocating outside the United States, they say.\n\nDisrupted projects\n\nDavid Levine, a health economist at the University of California, Berkeley, has just started a research project in Chad and is now worried about disruptions to that work. The project is looking at the distribution of oral rehydration salts, a life-saving treatment for diarrhoea. The results of that work would have direct implications for millions of children in the poorest countries around the world, he says. For now, Chad has not reciprocated with a travel ban on US citizens, but that is a risk, says Levine. Doing research in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad and Haiti is already hard, he says. “We don’t need more barriers.”\n\nIn a statement published by the White House, Trump said the travel restrictions were intended to prevent terror attacks, with the restrictions placed on each country determined by “the severity of the threat posed”. Visas already issued won’t be revoked, said the statement, and some travellers will be exempt, including those who belong to a persecuted minority group or have dual citizenship.\n\nThe administration is essentially banning the issuing of visas for workers or visitors from these countries, including scientists, says Sherwin Noorian, a US immigration lawyer at Globalised in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nOn the same day, Trump also suspended visas for all foreign nationals seeking to join Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, essentially preventing them from entering the country. The US administration is also considering revoking visas for current students at the prestigious institution. The decision was made “to safeguard national security”, according to the president’s statement. It came only weeks after the administration attempted to ban Harvard from enrolling foreign students, a move that was temporarily blocked by a judge in Massachusetts after Harvard filed a lawsuit against the government.\n\nChilling effect\n\nPedro Antonio Valdes-Sosa, a neuroscientist at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and Cuban Neuroscience Center in Chengdu, China, and co-chair of the scientific advisory board of the international Organization for Human Brain Mapping, says that given the current environment in the US, he and the organization’s other leaders are considering ceasing to hold meetings in the United States.\n\nAndersen, too, says his team has abandoned plans to host international conferences and workshops in the country.",

          "abstract": "Part of QuEra’s Aquila quantum computer.Credit: QuEra Computing Inc.\n\nSubatomic particles such as quarks can pair up when linked by ‘strings’ of force fields — and release energy when the strings are pulled to the point of breaking. Two teams of physicists have now used quantum computers to mimic this phenomenon and watch it unfold in real time.\n\nThe results, described in two Nature papers on 4 June1,2, are the latest in a series of breakthroughs towards using quantum computers for simulations that are beyond the ability of any ordinary computers.\n\n“String breaking is a very important process that is not yet fully understood from first principles,” says Christian Bauer, a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California. Physicists can calculate the final results of particle collisions that form or break strings using classical computers, but cannot fully simulate what happens in between. The success of the quantum simulations is “incredibly encouraging”, Bauer says.\n\nString simulations\n\nEach experiment was conducted by an international collaboration involving academic and industry researchers — one team at QuEra Computing, a start-up company in Cambridge, Massachusetts1, and another at the Google Quantum AI Lab in Santa Barbara, California2.\n\nThe researchers using QuEra’s Aquila machine encoded information in atoms that were arranged in a 2D honeycomb pattern, each suspended in place by an optical ‘tweezer’. The quantum state of each atom — a qubit that could be excited or relaxed — represented the electric field at a point in space, explains co-author Daniel González-Cuadra, a theoretical physicist now at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Madrid. In the other experiment, researchers encoded the 2D quantum field in the states of superconducting loops on Google’s Sycamore chip.\n\nQuantum-computing technology that makes qubits from atoms wins mega investment\n\nThe teams used diametrically opposite quantum-simulation philosophies. The atoms in Aquila were arranged so that the electrostatic forces between them mimicked the behaviour of the electric field, and continuously evolved towards their own states of lower energy — an approach called analogue quantum simulation. The Google machine was instead used as a ‘digital’ quantum simulator: the superconducting loops were made to follow the evolution of the quantum field ‘by hand’, through a discrete sequence of manipulations.\n\nIn both cases, the teams set up strings in the field that effectively acted like rubber bands connecting two particles. Depending on how the researchers tuned the parameters, the strings could be stiff or wobbly, or could break up. “In some cases, the whole string just dissolves: the particles become deconfined,” says Frank Pollmann, a physicist at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Garching, Germany, who helped to lead the Google experiment.",

          "title": "How to keep weight off after obesity drugs",
          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "Sheree had maintained a healthy weight for 15 years, thanks to a surgery that wrapped a silicone ring around the top of her stomach. But when the gastric band repeatedly slipped and had to be removed, the weight came back — fast. She gained nearly 20 kilograms in just 2 months.\n\nFrustrated, she turned to the latest generation of anti-obesity medications, hoping to slow the rapid weight gain. She cycled through various formulations of the blockbuster therapies semaglutide (sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Zepbound for weight loss), finding some success with higher doses of these drugs, which mimic the effects of the appetite-suppressing hormone GLP-1. But each time, drug shortages disrupted her treatment, forcing her to start again with a new formulation or to go without the drugs for weeks.\n\nTired of the uncertainty around the therapies, she decided to try something different. Sheree, who asked that her middle name be used to protect her privacy, underwent two minimally invasive procedures designed to reduce the size of her stomach and to blunt hunger cues.\n\nDozens of new obesity drugs are coming: these are the ones to watch\n\nDeveloped over the past two decades, these ‘endoscopic’ procedures — performed using flexible tubes inserted through the mouth, and no scalpels — are just one part of a growing toolkit to help people who want to move away from GLP-1 therapy. More-conventional bariatric surgeries, used routinely since the 1980s to reroute the flow of food through the gut or to restrict the stomach’s size, might also gain wider appeal. And the search is picking up for other drugs that could offer lasting alternatives for a post-GLP-1 population.\n\nThat momentum is driven by a convergence of factors: chronic shortages of GLP-1 therapies, high costs, insurance barriers and debilitating side effects. As a result, many people who start the drugs ultimately stop — with discontinuation rates in clinical trials ranging from 37% to 81% in the first year1. And once treatment ends, the weight lost often piles back on.\n\nAs demand grows for complementary strategies, the landscape of weight-loss treatment, which has been overtaken in recent years by semaglutide and tirzepatide, is now broadening again. In this way, says Ricardo Cohen, a weight-loss specialist at the Oswaldo Cruz German Hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, GLP-1 drugs are not just reshaping treatment — they’re pulling more people into often-overlooked avenues of support.\n\n“The new drugs are a gateway for people seeking obesity care,” he says.\n\nSurgical solution\n\nDuring their early ascent, GLP-1 drugs were often viewed not as a gateway, but as a pharmaceutical fix that might render older weight-loss strategies obsolete.\n\nFor decades, bariatric surgery had been the gold standard in obesity care. In its various forms, including the gastric-band surgery that Sheree first had, the treatment induces substantial and sustained weight loss and improves obesity-related health conditions. And it has a strong safety record, with rates of serious complications and mortality that are comparable to, or even lower than, those of common procedures such as gallbladder removal and knee replacement.\n\nStill, many people with obesity view bariatric surgery as a last resort. The proportion of eligible individuals who undergo the procedures has remained stubbornly low — around 1% in the United States, and not much higher in any other country.\n\nThe arrival of semaglutide and tirzepatide offered a way to reach the other 99% — promising to achieve similar weight reductions without the invasiveness, recovery time or stigma often associated with surgical intervention. “The hype generated by the drugs put surgery in a second tier,” acknowledges Cohen, president of the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) in Naples, Italy, a global professional organization for bariatric surgeons. But he hopes to shift that perception.\n\nIn 2022, the IFSO and its US counterpart revised their guidelines, lowering the recommended body mass index thresholds for surgery eligibility, aiming to make the procedure available to more people who could benefit2. Cohen now sees opportunities to expand the surgery’s reach to people who discontinue GLP-1 therapy or who fail to achieve results with medication alone — and he’s hoping to build the case with clinical data.\n\nAt his clinic in Brazil, for example, Cohen will soon begin enrolling participants for a randomized trial in which people who first lose weight on semaglutide will be assigned to receive bariatric surgery, continued semaglutide injections or undergo both treatments.\n\nTummy techniques\n\nRegardless of whether opinions of bariatric surgery shift, there are other ways to shrink the stomach. Starting in the late 2000s, weight-loss specialists began developing non-surgical approaches that achieve similar results (see ‘Shrinking the stomach’). As an added bonus, these techniques tend to be less expensive and simpler to deploy than are surgical methods, because they require fewer hospital resources and involve shorter recovery times.\n\nThe most widely adopted has been endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), a procedure performed under anaesthesia that internally folds and stitches the stomach into a narrow tube. This reduces the stomach’s volume by up to 70% — to about the size of a banana — limiting food intake and promoting a feeling of fullness, although the weight-loss results are generally more modest than with surgery.\n\nPichamol ‘Sigh’ Jirapinyo, a bariatric endoscopist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, says that nearly half of the people who underwent ESG last year at her hospital or at Bariendo, a US-based network of eight non-surgical weight-loss clinics where she serves as medical director, had previously taken a GLP-1 drug. That’s up from about one in six just two years earlier.\n\nESG systems are approved as obesity treatments in the United States, the United Kingdom and beyond, but the procedure doesn’t work consistently for everyone. Sheree, who is from North Carolina and in her 50s, learnt that first-hand in 2022. When she didn’t get the results she desired from the ESG procedure, her physician recommended an experimental endoscopic method that uses a medical device authorized for other applications.\n\nKnown as gastric mucosal ablation (GMA), the procedure uses argon gas and an electrical current to generate ionized plasma, rapidly raising tissue temperatures in the upper portion of the stomach. The result is a controlled thermal injury that creates scar tissue along the gastric lining.\n\nVivek Kumbhari, a bariatric endoscopist at Mayo Clinic Florida in Jacksonville, and his colleagues have shown in studies in rats, pigs and human tissue that this targeted tissue-burning technique can reduce the upper stomach’s secretion of ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates hunger. It also makes the stomach stiffer, effectively shrinking its capacity (see, for example, ref. 3).\n\nObesity drugs: huge study identifies new health risks\n\nEarly recipients of GMA, an outpatient procedure done under anaesthesia, have experienced some side effects, including cramping, nausea and bloating. But these have generally been mild and temporary, and are more than offset by the weight-loss benefits, according to Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who co-founded the True You Weight Loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina.\n\nMcGowan, in collaboration with Kumbhari and others, published a clinical trial of GMA last year4. The study involved ten people with obesity who had tried to lose weight with diet and exercise, but explicitly excluded anyone who had taken weight-loss medications. Now, the researchers aim to fill that gap with a trial targeting individuals who have discontinued GLP-1 therapy, which is more representative of real-world patients navigating multiple treatment options. Demonstrating the effectiveness of GMA in this population could help to persuade more physicians and potential candidates to consider the procedure, says McGowan — and might pave the way for reimbursement by insurers and health-care systems.\n\nIndividual experiences such as Sheree’s could prove anecdotally persuasive, too. Months after undergoing GMA at McGowan’s clinic — where she paid around US$6,000 for the procedure — she has reached a weight that she feels comfortable with, has had no adverse reactions and is maintaining her weight without GLP-1 drugs. “It gave me an outlet to stop chasing these medicines,” Sheree says.\n\nGut reset\n\nIn a mock surgical suite in an industrial park on the outskirts of Boston, Harith Rajagopalan is testing a proprietary device developed explicitly for post-GLP-1 weight maintenance. When he switches it on, a slender, squid-like catheter shimmers to life. Near the tip, a tiny balloon gently inflates with water that is heated to near-boiling point.\n\nThis tool, inserted endoscopically through the throat, creates a precisely controlled tissue burn much as GMA does, but is targeted at the duodenum, the upper portion of the small intestine, rather than the stomach. Called Revita, it aims to minimize tissue damage and promote regeneration, potentially rewiring how the gut senses nutrients and regulates metabolism.\n\nSuch changes could reverse the harm that chronic high-fat and high-sugar diets do over time, restoring “a more normal physiologic state”, says Rajagopalan, who is co-founder and chief executive of the firm Fractyl Health in Burlington, Massachusetts. “The duodenum is not designed to see Coca-Cola and McDonald’s,” he says.",

He brought together pure and applied mathematics, and was awarded the Abel Prize in mathematics in 2005. The prize citation described him as “the most versatile mathematician of his generation” and as “combining a deep understanding of analysis with an extraordinary capacity to find unifying concepts”.\n\nLax was born in Budapest to two Jewish physicians. Noticing his prodigious mathematical gifts, they arranged for him to be tutored by a leading mathematician, Rózsa Péter. Lax’s father resisted fleeing Europe in the 1930s, thinking that Hungary would be spared the worst Nazi atrocities, but the family finally departed for the United States in December 1941, settling in New York City.\n\nRevealed: the unusual mathematics that gives rose petals their shape\n\nLax published his first mathematical paper shortly after finishing secondary school. At the age of 18, he was drafted into the army, but he was sent to study engineering at Texas A&M University in College Station, and then to work on the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons in Los Alamos, New Mexico. He worked on calculations of shock waves, required for the initiation of nuclear chain reactions. After his wartime work, he took classes at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, Stanford University in California and New York University (NYU), where he received his undergraduate degree on the basis of his combined coursework. He also did his PhD at NYU, becoming a research assistant professor there in 1949.\n\nWhile in secondary school, Lax had begun to study with leading mathematician and German émigré Richard Courant, who headed the Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics at NYU (later renamed the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences). Courant emphasized the benefits of working on mathematical problems that were connected to real-world phenomena. Lax’s connection with Courant became lifelong: he spent his entire career at the Courant Institute. He also continued his involvement with Los Alamos throughout the 1950s, working during the summers at the cutting edge of the application of computers to solving problems in engineering.\n\n‘Mind blowing’: quantum computer untangles the mathematics of knots\n\nThe Lax equivalence theorem gives a good demonstration of the style of Lax’s work. Differential equations consider changes in one variable in response to infinitesimally small changes in others. Many cannot be solved formally, although computers can generate results for small — although not minuscule — changes. But do the computer’s results converge to the true answer as the steps become smaller and smaller? This crucial question can be difficult to answer for any given equation. By examining this in a formal way, Lax proved that convergence was equivalent to stability — a property that is easier to prove — facilitating more-robust analyses.\n\nBecause many phenomena can be analysed through partial differential equations, Lax’s work influenced many fields, including fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, weather forecasting and imaging. He also had a key role in applying high-performance computing to a wide range of problems.",

          "title": "A message from island leaders: protect the Pacific Ocean from deep-sea mining",
          "authors": "Moetai Brotherson, Surangel Whipps Jr",
          "abstract": "The Pacific Ocean’s seabed is rich in critical metals such as cobalt and nickel. Yet deep-sea mining of these materials, which are used in many technologies, threatens the region. If mining goes ahead, irreversible environmental harm, risks to ocean health and climate stability, as well as uncertain economic gains and geopolitical tensions, would destabilize this peaceful ‘ocean continent’ — known as the Blue Pacific.\n\nAs leaders of two Pacific island nations, Palau and Mā’ohi Nui–French Polynesia, we bear a profound responsibility to help protect this ocean. Our countries have combined national waters, known as exclusive economic zones (EEZs), spanning more than 5.3 million square kilometres, or 4% of the world’s total EEZ area. Beyond being a resource and crucial part of the planet, the ocean is deeply interwoven with the spiritual identity and cultural heritage of our communities. It is the cradle of life, deserving of respect and protection. This sacred connection, and more, compels us as collective stewards to oppose the intensifying global interest in ocean mining.\n\nWhy we should protect the high seas from all extraction, forever\n\nInternational consortia and state-backed enterprises are exploring deposits of polymetallic nodules, cobalt-rich crusts and sea-floor sulfides. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) in Kingston, Jamaica, has already issued more than 30 exploration contracts to 22 bodies, with almost two-thirds (61%) of these contracts linked to high-income countries. For Pacific nations hosting some of Earth’s richest metal deposits, valued in the trillions of dollars, the issue is urgent. Although several Pacific states are considering deep-sea mining in their EEZs, hoping for economic benefits, many Pacific communities remain strongly opposed.\n\nHere, we argue that ocean health and climate protection must outweigh risky short-term extraction. Pacific deep-sea mining must not advance without clear evidence of no irreversible harm1. Economic volatility, limited local benefits, devastating ecological impacts and climate risks represent unacceptable threats. Instead, we urge Pacific nations and the international scientific community to support sustainable ocean economies, innovation, cultural integrity and responsible global stewardship for future generations.\n\nQuestionable economic benefits\n\nProponents often portray deep-sea mining as an engine for economic development in the Pacific, promising revenues, jobs and infrastructure. But that won’t necessarily be the case. Economic considerations alone provide sufficient grounds for extreme caution.\n\nThe metals mined in deep seas — particularly cobalt, nickel, copper and manganese — are often subject to drastic and unpredictable price swings. And increased metal supply from deep-sea mining could depress global prices of these minerals, as happened in the 1970s2. Future demand also remains uncertain owing to rapid advancements in recycling and alternative materials.\n\nI’ve witnessed the wonders of the deep sea. Mining could destroy them\n\nDeep-sea mining’s capital-intensive nature requires small, specialized crews, limiting local employment opportunities because of the scarcity of relevant expertise in Pacific island nations. Training programmes, such as those proposed by the Cook Islands, might prove less effective at job creation than would investments in other sectors, such as coastal tourism or fisheries, which rely more heavily on local skills and employ more people per dollar invested.\n\nDeep-sea mining might yield minimal fiscal returns for Pacific nations. In international waters (the high seas), mining royalties must be shared among all ISA member states, drastically reducing any single country’s benefit. In national jurisdictions, anticipated taxes and royalties are likely to be modest, and are often weakened by inadequate fiscal regimes and investor-friendly agreements — some of which even waive corporate income taxes entirely for operators3.\n\nHurdles include adequate governance and sufficient institutional capacity, as highlighted in the 2024 Columbia University Capstone Report that assessed deep-sea mining around Mā’ohi Nui4. And governments would face costs as well as risks. Oversight and environmental monitoring require substantial public expenditure on regulatory capacity, scientific assessments and enforcement5. In the case of an environmental disaster or the mining company going bankrupt, the country might have to shoulder liabilities or clean-up costs.\n\nFor example, in 2019, Papua New Guinea’s government lost its entire investment of US$120 million to secure a 15% stake in a deep-sea mining project, Solwara 1, when the Canadian company behind it, Nautilus Minerals, went bankrupt. The resulting debt amounted to around 10% of the country’s 2019 budget deficit.\n\nNature collection: The ocean in humanity’s future\n\nEconomic risks would persist even if deep-sea mining took off. For instance, a sudden increase in resource production might prompt an appreciation in the value of the local currency and domestic inflation, which would undermine other export industries. A mining boom would draw labour, capital, attention and investments away from other industries that are crucial to many Pacific economies, such as tourism, fisheries and agriculture.\n\nSimilarly to oil-production operations that are dependent on volatile prices, deep-sea mining could quickly become economically unfeasible amid falling prices or rising environmental costs. Expanded mining operations could trigger intensified international competition, leading to a damaging race to the bottom. Declining global commodity prices would destabilize economies that are overly reliant on mining revenues. Governments might feel forced to deregulate environmental and labour standards to remain economically viable.\n\nIrreversible environmental harms\n\nThe deep sea, a vast wilderness of unique biodiversity, performs crucial planetary functions that are not fully understood. The case of the island of Nauru highlights the dangers of resource depletion and mismanagement: decades of intensive phosphate mining in its interior brought temporary wealth, but ultimately led to environmental degradation, economic hardship and public-health crises that affect Nauruans to this day.\n\nThe impacts of deep-sea mining extend far beyond the seabed, spreading through the water column and currents, potentially affecting fisheries, marine mammals and neighbouring jurisdictions. Whether extracting polymetallic nodules from sea-floor sediments or mining hydrothermal vents, operations risk extensive and irreversible habitat destruction.\n\nA rare species of Pacific octopus (left); a mushroom coral amid cobalt-rich deposits (centre) and an Iridogorgia spiral coral.Credit: Left and right, ROV SuBastian/Schmidt Ocean Institute; centre, Christopher Kelley/NOAA\n\nHydrothermal vent fields in regions such as the Manus Basin (off Papua New Guinea) and the Lau Basin (near Tonga) host unique, endemic species, including specialized shrimp, snails and tubeworms. Although commercial mining has not yet begun in these regions, alteration of these isolated habitats will inevitably lead to biodiversity loss. This could disrupt marine food webs and ecosystem functions that are crucial to fisheries and Pacific communities. Studies show that even experimental disturbances result in incomplete ecological recovery after decades6.\n\nSediment plumes from mining operations are a big concern, because they can drift across hundreds of kilometres for decades, smothering organisms and degrading water quality7. These plumes can cross national jurisdictions and diminish catch rates or contaminate seafood, potentially affecting fishing grounds that are crucial for coastal communities and threatening food security. Pelagic ecosystems, which are essential for migratory species such as tuna and whales, plankton and those in the broader marine food web, would also be at risk8.\n\nNoise and artificial light from mining machinery can disorient marine life and disrupt crucial processes, such as bioluminescence and vertical migrations, that are essential for nutrient cycling. These disturbances threaten commercially valuable fish populations, particularly tuna, through impaired respiration, bioaccumulation of metals and disruptions to reproduction and to feeding (including hunting difficulties caused by plumes)9.\n\nGeopolitical risks\n\nThe widespread impacts of deep-sea mining will create legal and geopolitical challenges. Neither the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea nor the ISA has a robust international mechanism by which to assign liability effectively and provide compensation for damage arising from mining activities10.\n\nTo save the high seas, plan for climate change\n\nIf pollution from high-seas mining affects fisheries or reefs in another nation’s territory, there is no clear recourse. A case in point is the 2009 Montara oil spill. Originating from a rig in Australian waters, the spill reached Indonesian waters, leading to claims of damage to fisheries and coastal livelihoods there. This underscores the urgent need for pre-emptive legal clarity before deep-sea mining operations commence.\n\nLarge-scale mining also introduces security and monitoring challenges across vast maritime areas. Addressing these pressures demands unwavering regional unity and a cautious approach that prioritizes long-term Pacific well-being. Pacific nations have strengthened their collaboration through the Blue Pacific approach, which has reimagined our maritime territories as an interconnected ‘ocean continent’ to foster collective identity and unified action.\n\nPractically, this translates into stronger joint advocacy in global forums on climate action, fisheries management and marine conservation. It also enables shared strategies for resource management and maritime security, aiding cooperation while respecting diverse national approaches in this common regional vision.\n\nClimate regulation disruption\n\nAn alarming, poorly understood risk is the potential of deep-sea mining to disrupt the ocean’s role in climate regulation as the largest carbon sink. Disturbing the sea bed can release carbon or methane that have been stored in sediments for millennia11, potentially exacerbating climate change and ocean acidification.\n\nAt experimental mining sites, more than two decades after simulated disturbance, sea-floor fauna remained depleted12, microbial communities were impaired and both groups showed a reduced capacity for carbon processing.\n\nA coastal village in Papua New Guinea. The country lost US$120 million on a failed deep-sea mining project.Credit: Joerg Boethling/Alamy\n\nFor low-lying Pacific islands, these risks are existential. Communities are already confronting the severe realities of climate change. In Palau, for instance, rising sea levels are not an abstract threat but a present danger, forcing coastal communities to watch as their homes are inundated, crucial freshwater sources are contaminated by saltwater intrusion and ancestral burial grounds become vulnerable. Intensified storms such as Typhoon Haiyan, which brought widespread devastation to Palau, increasingly threaten homes, infrastructure such as hospitals and schools, and the safety of our people.\n\nFurthermore, extensive coral bleaching events, driven by warming seas, decimate the reefs that are fundamental to Palauan livelihoods, leading to declining fish catches that underpin our food security and local economies. Bleaching also weakens the natural coastal defences that protect our islands. Any activity, such as deep-sea mining, that further destabilizes the climate system is therefore unacceptable11,12.",

          "authors": "Pragya Agarwal",
          "abstract": "Patriarchy Inc.: What We Get Wrong About Gender Equality and Why Men Still Win at Work Cordelia Fine Atlantic (2025)\n\nIn 2021, white men managed around 95% of US hedge-fund assets. In 2024, only one of the 40 largest banks in the world had a female chief executive. And in an average UK week, men spend more of their time in paid work or education than doing unpaid tasks such as household chores or taking care of children; for women, it’s the reverse.\n\nHow did we get here? We know the answer, as psychologist Cordelia Fine tells us in her engaging book Patriarchy Inc. Yes, the culprit is patriarchy: gender influences who gets power, status, money and access to opportunities. But where this patriarchal framework stems from and how to build a more equitable society are harder to pin down.\n\nSex and gender in science\n\nFine sets out to dismantle two existing “false visions” for gender equality. The first of these is the view that men and women are ‘different but equal’, a stance that emerged in the 1990s. The second is the concept of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) — a framework of policies and initiatives to increase workplace representation of people from marginalized groups — which has spread like wildfire in the business world and beyond since the 2010s. Fine focuses on critiquing ‘business DEI’ — but, in so doing, misses the chance to explore more effective ways to improve gender equity.\n\nThe various strategies that business DEI has sprouted to improve gender diversity in the workplace, such as diversity workshops and numbers games of equal-representational hiring, are aimed more at boosting productivity than at helping women. The approach is also often tokenistic, and fails to prompt much change: stereotypes and gendered norms continue to influence who gets ahead.\n\nViews about how gender bias arose tend to fall into two camps, explains Fine. Many anthropologists and psychologists point to biology and evolution to justify the widespread gendered division of labour: men tend to be stronger, they say, and women more caring. Others insist that cultural conditioning is at the root of gendered roles. In this world view, children pick up norms about what being a girl or a boy is supposed to mean through messaging from their parents, carers, peers and friends, from the media and books around them. They learn from an early age who typically sews clothes or writes computer code.\n\nFine proposes a compromise: both evolution and social conditioning, she suggests, led to the division of tasks by gender. She argues that this has helped societies to succeed in certain situations: everyone is more efficient when roles are clearly defined. But in my field — behavioural science — extensive research has shown how it has also created status hierarchies, in which men continue to assume ‘important’ leading roles (often well-paid) while women are pushed into supportive, invisible ones (often remunerated poorly or not at all).\n\nDispelling intrinsic differences\n\nAlthough Fine doesn’t discuss it, many feminist movements have long challenged gender norms and the gender binary more generally. And many scholars, including me, have been critiquing the insular and superficial approaches of DEI for a while. But clearly, women continue to carry much of the invisible mental load in the workplace and at home.\n\nYet, at the same time, other pockets of society are strengthening gender norms. There is more pressure on women than on men to have children. Once they do, women are expected to carry the majority of the caring responsibilities. Moves to take away women’s bodily autonomy and choices, along with regular media panic about falling birthrates, contribute to this divide. And toxic ideas of masculinity — that men need to be providers, as well as leaders at work and at home, for example — are gaining traction, perpetuated notably by Internet influencers.\n\n‘Different but equal’ approaches to gender equality lose sight of within-group differences.Credit: Eduardo Gonzlez/500px/Getty\n\nIn any case, it’s a mistake to attribute inherently different abilities to women and men simply because of the sex they were assigned at birth — not least because it ignores within-group differences. Not all women are the same. And beyond individual differences, we know how gender norms are racially grounded and how historic legacies of oppression have played out. Black and Brown women often report being held to different expectations from their white colleagues, as I describe in my 2022 book Hysterical. Efforts to ‘define’ gender through biological parameters — such as testosterone levels, used as a primary indicator of eligibility for women’s sports — typically take white European women as a baseline, even though typical ranges can vary with race and ethnicity.\n\nMore broadly, the idea that there is some sort of ‘feminine’ way of thinking and working has hindered efforts to tackle gender inequalities. It pigeonholes women, putting them into new boxes rather than disrupting the ones in which they have long been held captive.\n\nMissing the mark on DEI\n\nFine touches on the idea that gender equality will improve the lives of everyone — not just those of women. This can at first seem counter-intuitive, because men are at a clear advantage in the current patriarchal framework; on the face of it, it might seem as if giving equal rights to women means limiting men’s rights. I wish Fine had laid out more clearly how gendered norms can also harm men by stifling them into a specific role. Emotional vulnerability, for example, is deemed unsuitable for men, a position that can lead to mental-health issues.\n\nBlack women on the academic tightrope: four scholars weigh in\n\nAnd so gender equality should be the goal in itself. But organizations don’t work to break gender barriers just for the greater good — they want to see value and profit. It is to get them on board that some have endeavoured to ‘sell’ equality work by highlighting that diverse teams perform better. Although originally well-intentioned, this approach has moved away from the original goals of DEI and created new forms of gendered labour. It is mostly women, and people from other marginalized groups, who carry the load of DEI initiatives, for example through informal mentorships.",

          "authors": "Mette Bendixen, Lars Iversen",
          "abstract": "Sand is the most extracted commodity in the world.Credit: Marco Longari/AFP via Getty\n\nWe started our faculty positions in Canada after spending two years as postdocs in the United States. At the time, the COVID-19 pandemic was winding down and in-person activities were slowly returning to normal.\n\nIn this phase of our careers at McGill University in Montreal (where M.B., a geographer, started working in 2021, followed a year later by her husband, L.I., a biologist), we noticed that students seemed hesitant to engage during classes and were often reluctant to approach us.\n\nThis felt like a stark contrast to our PhD studies in Denmark, in which students and faculty members interacted more casually, calling professors by their first name or simply knocking on their door to ask questions.\n\nWe noticed a similar reticence from students seeking to join our laboratories as research assistants. We wondered whether, after years of studying in isolation (some of them, like us, new to the country), the students were reluctant to engage informally with both peers and instructors. \n\nTo attract their interest and inject some informality, in March 2022, we launched SandClub; an interdisciplinary journal club focused on global sand scarcity.\n\nSand is the world’s most extracted commodity and most-used natural resource after water. Together with gravel and crushed stone, it is a key ingredient in modern societies, because it goes into concrete and glass. Yet, its extraction remains mostly unregulated and is still an understudied topic.\n\nWe felt that a journal club would be a great place to start raising awareness of the important issue, and provide a casual, welcoming community for students from all backgrounds and disciplines. \n\nWe wondered whether the name was too provocative, because it builds off the 1999 cult movie Fight Club, in which a disillusioned main character establishes a hidden and exclusive brotherhood through a fight club. But with a witty spin, our point was the exact opposite: ‘First rule of SandClub: you talk about SandClub’.\n\nAt first, we followed a classic journal-club format — reading and discussing relevant and recently published articles. We quickly realized that students wanted more than just paper critiques, but we were careful not to add more extracurricular work to their plates. We surveyed the club and were surprised to learn that many indeed wanted presentations and opportunities to undertake research themselves.\n\nAs a result, we expanded the focus to include broader sedimentary processes and impacts of climate change, and pivoted SandClub towards more-participatory activities. Participants have described how they now feel more confident speaking up in class settings, and that it has given them a better understanding of what often seems like a ‘black box of research’; they’ve developed critical-thinking skills and learnt to analyse data and review manuscripts. Some 3 years in, we have run 25 journal-club sessions, involving more than 60 students from 5 faculties, coming from more than 30 majors. SandClub typically is held twice a month during the semester with about 10–15 attendees, and we bring plenty of snacks. At first, the afternoon meetings conflicted with our young son’s schedule, so we just brought him along. At times, he participated in the discussion, at others, he finished homework, sometimes helped by one or more of the students. Their interactions helped to create a relaxed atmosphere, and reinforced the idea that academia does not have to be rigid — it can be a community in which all are welcome. \n\nWe heard that students appreciate the open atmosphere for conversation and learning. One described that the “almost horizontal relationship” between students and professors as “something they had not experienced elsewhere at the university during their studies”. This informal and non-hierarchical relationship helps us to foster a the kind of atmosphere and learning environment in which students flourish. \n\nWe expanded the format and activities in response to student feedback and the growing interest, offering activities that could be included in their CVs. For example, when asked to review papers, we now ask editors whether we can share the manuscript with SandClub members, enabling students to formally participate in the reviewing process. We incorporate some of their comments in our reviews, including for papers in Nature Geoscience and Nature Sustainability. We update the students on manuscript decisions and hope that, by demystifying the peer-review and publishing process, the students are exposed to this often hidden aspect of research, helping them to understand how research moves from draft to publication.\n\nA SandClub session, at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.Credit: Mette Bendixen\n\nWe have been impressed by their ability to think critically about complex topics around sand scarcity. With student backgrounds spanning geography, biology and the environment, anthropology, engineering and political science, it is helpful for us as reviewers to get perspectives that we might not have thought about. And students say that it has deepened their respect for this lengthy, often tedious process of research publishing and peer review, and shown them that their voice matters.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Africa’s first continent-wide space agency, the African Space Agency (AfSA), which was inaugurated in April, is looking to secure funding as its first projects get under way.\n\nAfSA is an initiative of the 55-member African Union (AU) and is headquartered in Cairo. It was established to coordinate the work of Africa’s existing efforts in space — more than 20 African countries have space programmes. Priorities will include improving satellite communication, which provides crucial connectivity for rural populations. It also aims to generate and access data from space to track the effects of climate change, provide disaster relief and aid agriculture and water and food security.\n\nHowever, the agency is not yet fully staffed and its budget, detailed programme of action and funding sources have not yet been confirmed. AfSA’s core funding will come from the AU’s overall budget, which was US$606 million in 2024. But it will be supplemented by external sources, such as development banks, says Meshack Kinyua Ndiritu, a space engineer with AfSA. Another challenge will be to get countries at different stages of development to agree on common priorities, he adds.\n\nAn analysis by market-research firm Space in Africa, based in Lagos, Nigeria, shows that African nations’ combined space budgets amounted to $465 million in 2024. Although this is less than 1% of the global space expenditure, the value has grown by 64% since 2018.\n\nSource: Spacehubs Africa\n\nThe European Space Agency, Russia’s Roscosmos and the United Arab Emirates Space Agency all signed cooperation agreements with AfSA at its inauguration event on 20 April. China and the United States also sent delegations.\n\nAmong AfSA’s first joint projects is the Africa–EU Space Partnership, an EU-funded, €45-million (US$51-million), four-year project designed to bolster collaboration between the regions and strengthen the space ecosystem in Africa.\n\nAfSA should seek to make connections equally around the globe, while keeping its focus on the continent’s priorities, says Danielle Wood, an aerospace engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, who specializes in collaboration with African space leaders.\n\nChina has also long worked with Africa’s national agencies, and its role in the continent’s space sector is growing. By value, China’s state-backed technology firms won around one-fifth of foreign satellite contracts in Africa from 2005 to 2013 (US$871.5 million), which was second to France and more than 3 times the $250 million going to US firms (see ‘Satellites over Africa’).\n\nChinese state banks have provided loans for various African space projects, says Rebecca Nadin, a specialist in China’s politics and foreign policy at the ODI Global think tank, based in London. Chinese organizations have built and launched communications and remote-sensing satellites for African countries, as well as providing loans for facilities, and such involvement is likely to grow, says Nadin.\n\nChina helped Egypt to send remote-sensing satellite MISRSAT-2 into orbit in 2023.Credit: Wang Jiangbo/Xinhua via Alamy\n\nThe withdrawal of the United States from international-development funding is likely to have consequences. “International partnerships will change over time, and there will be some evolution, which means that the traditional partnerships may not be working for a long time, and we need to devise ways on how to sustain our programmes without, or creatively with, existing partnerships,” says Ndiritu. AfSA will need to become innovative in its approaches, Meshack adds.",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "A surge of mpox infections in the small African nation of Sierra Leone has pummelled the country’s health-care system, raising the possibility that the virus will spread to neighbouring countries and spark a larger outbreak throughout the densely populated region of West Africa.\n\nSierra Leone has confirmed 15 deaths and more than 3,000 mpox infections — more than half of all new infections for Africa — over the past month. According to an analysis of 76 viral genomes posted on the discussion forum Virological.org on 28 May, the outbreak began in November. The work also suggests that there have been at least four times more infections than officials have reported, says Edyth Parker, a genomic epidemiologist at the Institute of Genomics and Global Health in Ede, Nigeria, who is a co-author.\n\n“The situation is so dire — the number of cases keeps increasing rapidly,” says Jia Kangbai, an infectious-diseases epidemiologist at Njala University in Freetown. “Things are getting very challenging now.”\n\nA surge in cases\n\nThe virus that causes mpox can lead to painful, fluid-filled lesions on the skin, to fever and, in severe cases, to death. The virus, which is thought to persist in some wild rodent species, is endemic in several African countries, including Sierra Leone, and occasionally spills into people.\n\nHealth officials have been on high alert for surges of the virus ever since it spread to regions that it had never reached before, causing a global outbreak of the disease in 2022. That outbreak, which continues today at a slower pace, has infected more than 100,000 people, mainly men who have sex with men.\n\nThe virus that causes mpox (pink) is shown infecting a cell (green) in this colourized electron microscope image.Credit: NIAID/Alamy\n\nBut the boom in infections in Sierra Leone is making virologists worry once again: the country has reported a near-exponential growth in mpox cases that seem to be spreading from person to person, mainly among young people, including men and women. Epidemiological data suggest that sexual contact is a driver of the outbreak, because several sex workers have been infected and many people have reported genital lesions, according to a 27 May study posted on the preprint server medRxiv ahead of peer review1.\n\nThe surge in cases, which has been concentrated in Sierra Leone’s capital city of Freetown, is fuelled by the same strain, clade IIb, that caused the global outbreak, according to the Virological.org analysis. This shows that when mpox is “put into a densely populated area where you have these dense sexual networks, it can take off very easily”, says Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who co-authored the medRxiv preprint.\n\nThe number of reported infections is likely to continue increasing sharply, because Sierra Leone’s health-care system lacks the capacity to curb the outbreak, Kangbai says. He adds that the country is entering its rainy season, meaning that more people will congregate indoors, creating more opportunities for the virus to spread.\n\nA lack of aid\n\nThis outbreak comes as several African countries continue to battle their own mpox outbreaks, putting pressure on resources across the continent. A concerning strain of the virus called clade Ib has gained the ability to spread through sexual contact, causing a boom in infections across Central Africa, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), since 2024.\n\nMonkeypox virus: dangerous strain gains ability to spread through sex, new data suggest",

          "abstract": "The ExoMars mission’s Rosalind Franklin rover (artist’s impression) will carry a drill to search for signs of ancient life on Mars.Credit: Adrian Mann/Stocktrek Images via Alamy\n\nEurope’s beleaguered ExoMars rover is one of several international collaborations whose future looks bleak owing to unprecedented cuts to US science funding proposed by US President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nLast year, NASA agreed to provide both launch and landing gear for ExoMars’s Rosalind Franklin rover after the European Space Agency (ESA) cut ties with its former partner, the Russian space agency Roscosmos, over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The rover is designed to hunt for ancient life on the red planet.\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\n\nBut Trump’s proposed budget for NASA for fiscal year 2026 — published on 30 May — would slash to zero the US contributions to ExoMars, as part of a cut of almost 50% to NASA’s science division, compared with 2024 levels.\n\nOther ESA missions that could lose US contributions include ARIEL, a space telescope scheduled to launch in 2029 that is designed to study the atmosphere of exoplanets; LISA, a space-based gravitational-wave detector set to fly in 2035; and Envision, a spacecraft planned to head to Venus in the 2030s. The proposal would also cut all US funding to Euclid, an ESA probe already in space monitoring dark energy.\n\nIn a statement to Nature, ESA said that the agency is “in discussions with NASA” and “analysing the potential implications” of the budget proposals with its member states, which will discuss potential action and alternative scenarios at an ESA Council meeting on 11 and 12 June.\n\n“We can only hope that these proposed budget cuts never come to pass,” says Leigh Fletcher, a planetary scientist at the University of Leicester, UK. “But either way, it may take time to recover from the erosion of trust between agencies after these proposals.”\n\nLarge cuts likely\n\nTrump’s budget proposal is just a starting point for negotiations in the US Congress, which will ultimately decide how to allocate the federal budget.\n\nIn the past, a call to slash funding for science would have been robustly rejected, but “that is not true at the moment”, says Michael Lubell, a physicist who tracks science policy at the City University of New York. Although Congress might soften the cuts, they are still likely to be large, he says. The president’s strategy to put “America first” could play against international projects, Lubell adds.\n\nTrump moves to slash NSF: why are the proposed budget cuts so big?\n\nThe budget also includes large cuts to the US National Science Foundation (NSF), including a 40% reduction for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which has sites in Louisiana and Washington state. NSF contributions to the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope in Chile would be cut by 20%, and funds for the Large Hadron Collider, based at CERN, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, would fall by around 40%.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "A Japanese spacecraft has probably crashed on the Moon, the second failed landing attempt for Tokyo-based private firm ispace.\n\nThe HAKUTO-R Mission 2 (M2) lander — also called Resilience — began its landing sequence from a 100-kilometre-altitude orbit at 3.13am local time on 5 June. The craft was due to land near the centre of Mare Frigoris (Sea of Cold) at 4.17am.\n\nThe ispace team said at a press conference that it lost contact with M2 when the craft was 192 metres above the Moon’s surface and descending faster than expected. An attempt to reboot M2 was also unsuccessful.\n\nM2 didn't receive measurements of the distance between itself and the lunar surface in time to slow down and reach its correct landing speed, the team said.\n\n“It eventually slowed down, but not softly enough,” says Clive Neal, who studies the Moon at the University of Notre Dame in Indianapolis, US. He speculates that the failure was probably caused by a systems issue that wasn’t identified and addressed during the M1 landing attempt. “It’s something that I believe will definitely be fixable, because getting that close means there’s a few tweaks that are going to be needed for the next one,” he adds.\n\nIf M2 had successfully landed on the lunar surface, the mission would have been the second time a commercial company had achieved the feat and a first for a non-US company. ispace's Mission 1 (M1) probably crashed during a landing attempt in April 2023.\n\nSecond chance\n\nLunar landings are challenging. When M1 crashed, Ryo Ujiie, ispace’s chief technology officer said the telemetry — which collects data on the craft’s altitude and speed — estimated that M1 was on the surface when it wasn’t, causing the lander to free fall.\n\nSpeaking to Nature last week, Ujiie said the company had addressed the telemetry issue with M2 and modified its software. “We also carefully selected how to approach the landing site,” he added.\n\nHad M2 landed successfully, the craft would have supplied electricity for its cargo, including water electrolyzing equipment and a module for food production experiments — developed by Japan-based Takasago Thermal Engineering and biotechnology firm Euglena. A deep space radiation probe made by Taiwan’s National Central University, and the 54-centimetre Tenacious rover were also be on board. The rover, created by ispace’s European subsidiary in Luxemburg, was going to be released from the lander to collect imagery, location data and lunar sand known as regolith. Tenacious also carries a small red house made by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg.",

Here we present data from n = 6,720 participants from 5 to 72 years old, freely viewing 40 natural scenes. We found that the development of scene viewing is surprisingly protracted. Semantic salience for social features continuously changes until adolescence, and text salience increases over the first two decades of life. Basic oculomotor biases towards the image centre and along the horizontal meridian develop until adolescence, matching developmental changes in visual sensitivity and cortex. Finally, while the tendency for visual exploration continuously increases, fixation patterns become less idiosyncratic and more canonical throughout adolescence. These findings show that fundamental aspects of adult gaze take up to two decades of continuous development and push individuals towards more canonical viewing patterns. We suggest that development is key to understanding the general mechanisms of active vision.",

          "abstract": "Historically, the USA has enjoyed greater academic freedom than many countries, and this has likely contributed to its centrality in global research networks. For years, state-level attacks (such as those by Governor Ron DeSantis in Florida) have undermined academic freedom at single campuses or across public university systems2. But under the Trump administration, coordinated attacks on academic freedom are being carried out at the national level and are targeting both public and private universities. The administration has targeted institutional autonomy by threatening large-scale federal funding freezes to specific universities, such as Columbia University, Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania. These attacks on universities and federally funded research undermine the arrangements (such as having university faculty members rather than political appointees review proposals for federal grants) that make the USA a globally competitive producer of scholarly scientific publications. Even private industry works in partnership with universities on basic research. Bibliometric analyses estimate that 85–90% of publications in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, plus health (STEM+) — including those funded by industry contracts — are co-authored by university-based scientists3,4.\n\nAlthough new for American higher education, the Trump administration’s approach is similar to policies followed by Cold War autocratic regimes such as East Germany, where research funding was politicized and research production stalled. Much of the world experienced exponential growth in science production during the latter half of the twentieth century. By contrast, East Germany stood out for its decrease in STEM+ research production5. When former German Chancellor Angela Merkel reflected on working as a physicist in East Germany before reunification, she described the danger of becoming comfortable with the boundaries imposed by the state, and the benefits — after reunification — of a more open society that pushed you “to your limits” as a scientist. Merkel realized how autocratic rule had badly constrained East German physics research.",

          "abstract": "Much of the research quantifying volume and spread of online misinformation measures the construct at the source level, identifying a set of specific unreliable domains that account for a relatively small share of news consumption. This source-level dichotomy obscures the potential for users to repurpose factually true information from reliable sources to advance misleading narratives. We demonstrate this potentially far more prevalent form of misinformation by identifying articles from reliable sources that are frequently co-shared with (shared by users who also shared) ‘fake’ news on social media, and concurrently extracting narratives present in fake news content and claims fact checked as false. Specifically in this study, we use Twitter/X data from May 2018 to November 2021 matched to a US voter file. We find that narratives present in misinformation content are significantly more likely to occur in co-shared articles than in articles from the same reliable sources that are not co-shared, consistent with users using information from mainstream sources to enhance the credibility and reach of potentially misleading claims.",

Establishing whether and how pro-FGMC norms are maintained through social transmission is a key priority for global eradication efforts. Here we present the first large-scale socio-centric social network study estimating social influence and social selection on preference for cutting female relatives using data from 5,163 Ethiopian Arsi Oromo adults. Statistical modelling, which accounts for network dependence in cross-sectional data, finds signals of ‘contagion’ within chatting, respect and money-borrowing networks. This indicates that social influence contributes to FGMC maintenance. We find no clear evidence of social selection within marriage-advice networks, suggesting these networks are not implicated in FGMC maintenance. Contrary to assumptions underpinning current eradication efforts, we find negligible evidence that FGMC is a social coordination norm (with only 6.3% endorsement) or an empirical or normative expectation. We conclude by making intervention design recommendations.",

Three quarters of Europeans and half of Americans support the GCS, even as they understand its cost to them. Using several experiments, we show that the support for the GCS is sincere and that political programmes that include it are preferred to programmes that do not. We document widespread support for other globally redistributive policies, such as increased foreign aid or a wealth tax funding low-income countries.

Feature neurons encode groups of faces regardless of their identity, broad semantic categories or familiarity; and the coding regions (that is, receptive fields) predict feature neurons’ response to new face stimuli. Together, our results reveal a new class of neurons that bridge perception-driven representation of facial features with mnemonic semantic representations, which may form the basis for declarative memory.",

          "abstract": "Individual sensitivity to environmental exposures may be genetically influenced. This genotype-by-environment interplay implies differences in phenotypic variance across genotypes, but these variants have proven challenging to detect. Genome-wide association studies of monozygotic twin differences are conducted through family-based variance analyses, which are more robust to the systemic biases that impact population-based methods. We combined data from 21,792 monozygotic twins (10,896 pairs) from 11 studies to conduct one of the largest genome-wide association study meta-analyses of monozygotic phenotypic differences, in children, adolescents and adults separately, for seven psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, autistic traits, anxiety and depression symptoms, psychotic-like experiences, neuroticism and wellbeing. The proportions of phenotypic variance explained by single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these phenotypes were estimated ( h 2 = 0–18%), but were imprecise. We identified 13 genome-wide significant associations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, genes and gene sets), including genes related to stress reactivity for depression, growth factor-related genes for autistic traits and catecholamine uptake-related genes for psychotic-like experiences. This is the largest genetic study of monozygotic twins to date by an order of magnitude, evidencing an alternative method to study the genetic architecture of environmental sensitivity. The statistical power was limited for some analyses, calling for better-powered future studies.",

For understanding its origins, its computational role and its behavioural implications, computational models are of central importance. Yet, vision is commonly modelled using convolutional neural networks, which are hard-wired to learn identical features across space and thus lack topography. Here we overcome this limitation by introducing all-topographic neural networks (All-TNNs). All-TNNs develop several features reminiscent of primate topography, including smooth orientation and category selectivity maps, and enhanced processing of regions with task-relevant information. In addition, All-TNNs operate on a low energy budget, suggesting a metabolic benefit of smooth topographic organization. To test our model against behaviour, we collected a dataset of human spatial biases in object recognition and found that All-TNNs significantly outperform control models. All-TNNs thereby offer a promising candidate for modelling primate visual topography and its role in downstream behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Several cross-country examinations have found larger gender differences in Western countries. More recently, it has been argued, from an evolutionary standpoint, that equality may paradoxically increase gender differences, because it provides more freedom for men and women to pursue innate preferences. However, this paradox has primarily been examined with this cross-country methodology, opening up for other cultural differences to drive the results. For instance, measures developed in Protestant and Germanic-speaking countries, may not work the same in other cultural clusters of countries, and may not have the same statistical qualities there (e.g., in terms of reliability). Here, we reanalyze the results from multiple studies on the gender-equality paradox with country-level data available. We find that gender differences covary more strongly with cultural regions and data quality than gender equality, and that any variable higher in the West appears to achieve similar correlations as gender equality. Also, controlling for cultural regions consistently and strongly attenuates the association with gender equality, including to become statistically nonsignificant, or to switch direction. In other words, the baseline associations differ between and within cultural clusters (a Simpson’s paradox), suggesting there is no simple causal relation between gender equality and expressed gender differences. Similarly, controlling for data quality indicators strongly attenuates the paradox. Finally, we show that, with and without controls, there is no consistent paradoxical association across many of the largest cross-cultural studies on gender differences, including newly analyzed data. The same is true for other country development variables considered in the gender-equality paradox literature.",

          "abstract": "Inequality in outcomes may emerge through a reinforcement process in which stochastic variation in values is determined by prior values but may also originate in preexisting differences in unobserved factors. A common approach toward differentiating between these origins in longitudinal data is to attribute systematic differences between units—differences in means or differences proportional to a time-varying group average—to unobserved heterogeneity. We show that any longitudinal data with systematic differences can also be produced by a reinforcement-driven data generating process. This result reconciles findings in three distinct research areas—science of science, personal culture, and sexual networks—where reinforcement is a strong theoretical prior, yet longitudinal data analyses advance an explanation of interpersonal differences based on heterogeneity. Future studies may bound the role of heterogeneity and reinforcement from below by measuring fixed traits that systematically vary with the outcome and isolating random events that trigger emergent differences.",

          "abstract": "As the renewable energy transition continues into less receptive communities, local opposition is expected to intensify, potentially slowing the process. Since the local impacts are neither well quantified nor widely recognized, we lack policies and common practices to mitigate the potential associated welfare loss in affected communities. Based on a nationwide dataset combining property transactions and large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSSPV) sites, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of LSSPV on property prices and the associated causal pathways. Difference-in-differences estimates show that LSSPV significantly increases agricultural or vacant land value by about 19.4% within a 2-mile radius, while simultaneously reducing residential property values within 3 miles by about 4.8%. The estimated average negative impact on home values is primarily driven by site proximity and diminishes with both distance and time. Effect estimates are more robust to alternative specifications when proximity pairs with visibility rather than invisibility, but no evidence suggests visibility significantly amplifies the proximity effect. Heterogeneous effect estimates indicate that high solar lease potential, being in heavily Democratic-leaning counties, and brownfield redevelopment largely mitigate the negative residential value impact. The analysis reveals no significant heterogeneity across a few factors, including varying site visibility, directional orientation of properties relative to the LSSPV site, and different tracking systems. Evidence indicates that the negative impact on residential values might mainly stem from negative perceptions, but channels through physical conditions cannot be entirely dismissed. Our assessment provides benchmark information for local externality mitigation plans, potentially reducing community opposition and expediting the renewable energy transition.",

We examine emotional alignment among football fans during a high-stakes match in Brazil, focusing on both the game and the preceding Rua de Fogo, a pregame ritual marked by chants, flares, and collective anticipation. Using wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) sensors to monitor heart rate patterns, we apply multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to track group synchrony over time. We find that the Rua de Fogo, driven by its sensory-rich and ritualized interactions, elicited the highest levels of emotional synchrony, surpassing even key moments of the game. This synchrony was sustained across participants, including the driver of the team delegation bus, who was not physically engaged in the ritual. Our results demonstrate the importance of pregame rituals in enhancing shared emotional experiences, underscoring the broader appeal of sports as a cultural phenomenon. By identifying the mechanisms underlying emotional alignment, this work contributes to understanding how collective gatherings promote unity and shared identities, with implications extending to other domains, such as religious ceremonies, political rallies, and public celebrations.",

          "abstract": "Despite living in an era where the mere concept of truth is increasingly contested, the cognitive processes underlying the processing of information we believe or disbelieve remain largely unexplored. In this fMRI study, we investigated how belief modulates narrative processing through belief context—the initial information indicating the speaker’s credibility—and actual belief—the truth value ultimately assigned by the listener. Across two experiments, participants listened to narratives preceded by contexts explicitly stating whether the speaker was lying or telling the truth. Then, after listening to the narratives, they were asked to rate their actual belief. To investigate the effects of (dis)belief on narrative processing, we analyzed neural synchronization using inter-subject-correlation analysis and inter-subject representational similarity analysis. In both experiments, we successfully differentiated (dis)belief contexts by modeling neural synchronization patterns, despite an actual “belief-bias” at the behavioral level. This indicates a unique neural pattern related to each belief context. Furthermore, our results revealed a dissociation between belief and disbelief in both contextual and actual (dis)belief. Per each narrative, belief and disbelief were associated with increased synchrony within the default mode network, but in distinguishable parcels. These findings highlight the influence of (dis)belief on narrative processing at both behavioral and neural levels. Behaviorally, the observed belief-bias supports the notion of belief as a cognitive default. Neurally, we suggest that belief and disbelief can be understood as fostering qualitatively distinct processing or interpretation of the same narrative, which are then reflected in shared neural responses among individuals who hold similar belief states.",

          "abstract": "Though racial disparities in shortened life expectancy have been well established, racial disparities in the burden of bereavement after such premature deaths are severely understudied. This is, in part, due to a lack of measurement tools for characterizing lifetime exposure to loss. We propose three indices that simultaneously quantify premature and cumulative lifetime loss—two typically unmeasured dimensions of loss. Using a longitudinal US sample of 27,985 participants from the Health and Retirement Study (1992 to 2020) who experienced at least one lifetime loss, hierarchical linear models accounting for participants nested within households showed that Black participants and Native American participants had higher premature and cumulative burden of family member loss over the lifetime than all other racial groups across all three indices. These effects remained for Black participants after controlling for covariates such as parental education, household size, and years in the study. Second, we found that loss burden at study enrollment prospectively related to all-cause mortality. Depending on prematurity, each additional loss related to higher odds of dying during the study period after controlling for covariates such as chronic health conditions. Together, our work leverages prospective, longitudinal methodologies to identify racial disparities in exposure to earlier and repeated death and its impact on mortality among the bereaved. The proposed measurement approach has future applications for understanding how loss exposure—both “too soon” and “too much”—predicts poor health and earlier mortality.",

At the city level, population density has the largest effect on walk mode share and has a positive impact on cycling too, as higher densities bring destinations within feasible walk and cycle distances. Density has the strongest effects in wealthier countries where travelers often have more travel choices, while in lower-income places, walking and cycling may be primarily driven by financial constraints. We also find positive effects of bicycle lanes (proxying for a wider array of street design practices) on both walking and cycling. In the median city, each new km of bicycle lanes is associated with ~13,400 additional km yr -1 of bicycle travel. If every city increased the extent of its bicycle network to the level of Copenhagen, Denmark, our simulations indicate reductions in private vehicle emissions of ~6% and health benefits of ~US$435 billion per year.",

The mechanical design enhances sensitivity and durability, enabling continuous, wireless monitoring of essential vital signs (respiration rate, heart rate and corresponding variability, temperature) and various physical activities. Systematic physiology-based analytics involving explainable machine learning allows both precise sleep characterization and transparent tracking of each factor’s contribution, demonstrating the dominance of respiration, as validated through a diverse range of human subjects, both healthy and with sleep disorders.

          "abstract": "The influence of seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation on subsurface biogeochemical processes remains poorly understood. In the Lavey-les-Bains thermal system in the Swiss Alps, annual variations in electrical conductivity are observed to depths of 500 m, suggesting a potential link to surface environmental changes. Here we show, through year-round analyses of stable water isotopes, noble gases, and conductivity, that seasonally varying contributions of shallow groundwater from the Rhône alluvial aquifer mix with deep groundwater. Despite vertically similar fluid geochemical compositions suggesting high hydrological connectivity, microbial communities exhibit significant depth-dependent variation with minimal seasonal change. This decoupling of dynamic water source partitioning and stable microbial community structure has not been previously observed and fills a critical gap in our understanding of geothermal systems and microbial life in the deep subsurface. At 200 m, the communities are dominated by sulfur-disproportionating Bacteria ( Dissulfurispira ) and Micrarchaeota, while at 500 m the major groups include sulfate- and iron-reducers and/or hydrogen-oxidizers (Thermales, Thermodesulfobacteriota, and Bathyarchaeota). Our study highlights the resilience of terrestrial subsurface microbial communities to temporal variations in water sources and fluid composition. We propose that intrinsic environmental properties—such as temperature—are more critical drivers of microbial community structure in hydrologically connected deep aquifers than seasonal hydrological changes.",

          "abstract": "Cellular senescence, a major contributor to aging and age-related pathologies, is characterized by irreversible proliferative arrest and a disease-linked, proinflammatory profile known as the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). A critical unanswered question is whether these properties are regulated by specific enhancer subsets, potentially licensing strategies that selectively block deleterious SASP components. Here, we identify two functionally distinct and independently regulated enhancer programs underlying senescence that are controlled by different TGF-β family ligands. Whereas Activin A stimulates recruitment of nuclear factor IA/C (NFIA/C) and SMAD2/3 transcription factors to an enhancer network that induces proliferation arrest, TGF-β2 promotes SMAD2/3-mediated suppression of a p65-dependent enhancer cohort driving the SASP. We have also uncovered reciprocal SMAD2/3-super-enhancer-regulated feedback loops that govern expression of the TGF-β2 ( TGFB2) and Activin A ( INHBA ) transcription units, both of which are significantly up-regulated in replicative senescence. The characteristic enhancer usage and transcriptional landscape of high-passage senescent cells are sensitive to rapamycin treatment, discontinuation of which results in robust but selective senescent enhancer activation and exacerbation of the SASP. Collectively, this study uncovers separable enhancer programs and their key constituent transcription factors that contribute to the canonical features of cellular senescence, potentially informing the development of SASP-targeted therapies.",

          "abstract": "tRNA introns are a universally conserved feature of eukaryotic genomes, but the reason for their conservation has remained obscure. We have previously shown that a defect in the essential tRNA splicing endonuclease of yeast results in transcriptome remodeling, resembling that of the integrated stress response (ISR). In this study, we show that ISR activation in this mutant requires the canonical ISR components, including the collided ribosome sensor Gcn1. We further show that splicing of tyrosine tRNA, but not splicing of any of the other intron-containing tRNAs, controls the ISR. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we show that the intron of tyrosine tRNA affects m1 A58 modification in the T arm loop of the mature tRNA. In support of these results, we show that deletion of either subunit of the enzyme that adds the m1 A58 modification also controls the ISR. Unlike the few intron-dependent modifications previously described, the intron-dependent m1 A58 modification site is distal from the intron and has a clear physiological impact. Finally, we survey the occurrence of tRNA introns in eukaryotic genomes and show that the tyrosine tRNA intron is more prevalent than any other tRNA intron. These data suggest that tRNA splicing is conserved in eukaryotes because hypomodified tyrosine tRNAs lead to collided ribosomes, resulting in stress to cell physiology.",

The mechanisms underlying the vastly different activities of PCs in the rodent hippocampal CA1 area are unknown. Here, we measured the in vivo activity of CA1 PCs using two-photon [Ca 2+ ] imaging in head-restrained mice during navigation in a virtual corridor and then performed in vitro patch-clamp recording to probe their intrinsic electrical properties and anatomical investigation to characterize their input synapses. The active and passive electrical properties of PCs were similar between PCs with different prior in vivo activities. Perisomatic inhibitory synapse density was also comparable among PCs. The average dendritic spine density and spine head area did not correlate with the mean in vivo activity of PCs, but the size of the spines of place cells was significantly larger compared to that of silent cells. Our results are consistent with excitatory synaptic plasticity as a major mechanism underlying spatially tuned activity of place cells in hippocampal networks.",

These algorithms are typically evaluated computationally, using test sets generated by sampling the edges uniformly at random. However, as we demonstrate, this evaluation approach introduces a bias toward “rich nodes,” i.e., those with higher degrees in the network. More concerningly, this bias persists even when different network snapshots are used for evaluation, as recommended in the machine learning community. This creates a cycle in research where newly developed algorithms generate more knowledge on well-studied biological entities while understudied entities are commonly overlooked. To overcome this issue, we propose a weighted validation setting specifically focusing on low-degree nodes and present AWARE strategies to facilitate bias-aware training and evaluation of link prediction algorithms. These strategies can help researchers gain better insights from computational evaluations and promote the development of new algorithms focusing on novel findings and understudied proteins.",

          "abstract": "Metabolism fuels cell growth and functions. While it is well established that cellular growth rate scales with cell size, how cells alter their metabolism as they change size remains largely unexplored. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of cell size–dependent metabolism across the NCI60 cancer cell line panel comprising a diverse range of cell sizes. We demonstrate that cellular metabolism and growth rate display 2/3 allometric scaling due to differential scaling of overall nutrient uptake and waste metabolite release with respect to cell size, with waste elimination decreasing less rapidly than nutrient uptake rate as cells grow larger. This results in cell size–dependent growth rate and predicts a maximum cell size where net nutrient uptake equals zero and cell enlargement ceases despite active metabolism. We experimentally confirm this prediction and identify that electron acceptor demand constrains cell enlargement as evidenced by depletion of intracellular aspartate and scaling of aspartate uptake, which is more than proportional to cell volume. Overall, these findings may have implications for understanding cell size homeostasis, developmental biology, and the design principles of living organisms.",

          "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness among the elderly. It is characterized by degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which can develop into choroidal neovascularization (CNV) to cause severe and rapid vision loss. Preventing this progression might help save vision, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, using clinical AMD samples and the gene knockout mice, we reported that the m 1 A eraser ALKBH3 reshaped retinal metabolism to promote this progression. In RPE, the dm 1 ACRISPR system demonstrated that ALKBH3 demethylated the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme HK2 to activate glycolysis, resulting in excess lactate production. This lactate promoted histone lactylation at H3K18, which in turn bound to ALKBH3 to amplify its transcription, establishing a positive feedback loop. The ALKBH3 inhibitor HUHS015 disrupted this loop, effectively mitigating RPE degeneration. Furthermore, ALKBH3 directly targeted the proangiogenic factor VEGFA to modulate the metabolic cross-talk between RPE and choroidal capillaries, thus promoting CNV. HUHS015 inhibited CNV synergistically with the anti-VEGF drug Aflibercept. Overall, our study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms and metabolic events that facilitates the progression from RPE degeneration to CNV in AMD, laying the groundwork for new treatments of age-related retinal disorders.",

          "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a prevalent pathogen that chronically infects the majority of human population. Among the many features that allow such widespread HCMV infection, one is its ability to maintain a transcriptionally dormant immune-evasive state called latency by suppressing its own major immediate early promoter (MIEP) via epigenetic alterations. In this study, we show a mechanism of MIEP regulation in which the major immediate early (MIE) gene product, immediate early 1 (IE1) transcript, downregulates its own promoter activity in an m 6 A modification-dependent manner. We found that the loss of the m 6 A writer, METTL3, in host cells impedes latency establishment in these cells. Through transcriptome-wide m 6 A profiling of latently infected monocytes, we identified that the major immediate early gene product IE1 transcript is m 6 A-modified during latent infection. Using IE1-specific m 6 A-abolished mutants, we found that m 6 A modification of the IE1 transcript was necessary for the efficient repression of MIEP, and these mutant viruses exhibited a significant defect in establishing latency and progressed toward lytic-like infection in the human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and primary CD14+ monocytes. Our findings demonstrate that HCMV exploits the host m 6 A machinery to suppress its own lytic program to establish latency and uncover an unexpected role of immediate early gene messenger RNA (mRNA) in regulating its own expression.",

These compounds differentially activate JA responses through selective binding of specific COI-JAZ coreceptor complexes. Notably, In-Ile treatments enhanced rice resistance to brown planthopper attack, a destructive rice pest, under both laboratory and field conditions, without compromising rice’s growth or yield. Mechanistically, this agonist activates the OsMYB55-mediated lignin biosynthesis defense receptor module [OsCOI1a/2-OsJAZs (3,4,6,7,12)] without activating the growth-suppression receptor module (OsCOI1b-OsJAZs).

The physical model explains the dynamics of slow and fast ruptures on transparent materials, as well as the amount of light transmitted across the interface during laboratory ruptures. The constitutive framework elucidates the origin of empirical friction laws, and the simulated ruptures can be described by linear elastic fracture mechanics.

          "abstract": "Germ cells transmit genetic information to offspring and maintain the genome of the species. In many animals including Drosophila , germ cell formation relies on maternal determinants in the germ plasm. Several proteins present in the germ plasm of oocytes also localize to the perinuclear nuage in nurse cells, where they contribute to the production of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These piRNAs guide the silencing of transposons, thereby protecting the germline genome from invading mobile elements. Aubergine (Aub) is a germ plasm/nuage protein and a piRNA-directed endonuclease that inactivates transposons. Aub is also essential for germ plasm assembly. The Aub-bound piRNAs in the germ plasm are inherited by the progeny germline and serve as templates for piRNA biogenesis in the next generation. Thus, piRNA production in the nurse cell nuage is thought to be coordinated with germ plasm assembly in the oocyte. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that a maternal factor, named tiny pole plasm ( tpp ), mediates this coordination. Tpp is a GTSF1 family PIWI cofactor. In tpp − ovaries, the production of piRNAs, particularly Aub-bound piRNAs, is defective, resulting in reduced Aub localization to the germ plasm and impaired germ cell formation. Notably, the levels of piRNA production required for proper Aub localization are much higher than those required for transposon silencing. We propose that producing abundant piRNAs beyond what is required for transposon silencing in the ovary promotes germ plasm assembly, thereby enabling the progeny germline to properly silence transposons for species survival.",

          "abstract": "Human emissions continue to influence Earth’s climate. Effective radiative forcing quantifies the effect of such anthropogenic emissions together with natural factors on Earth’s energy balance. Evaluating the exact rate of effective radiative forcing is challenging, because it can not be directly observed. Therefore, estimating the effective forcing usually relies on climate models. Here, we present an estimate of effective radiative forcing that makes optimal use of observations. We use machine learning to learn the relationship between surface temperature and radiation caused by internal variability in a multimodel ensemble. Combining this with observations of surface temperature and the Earth’s net radiative imbalance, we predict an effective forcing trend of 0.71 ± 0.21 Wm − 2 per decade for 2001–2024. This is an independent assessment of the observed effective radiative forcing since 1985, that can be updated simultaneously with available observations and aligns with our physical understanding of radiative feedbacks. We make advances to close the Earth’s energy budget on annual timescales, by separating the influence of forcing versus the radiative response to surface temperature variations. Effective radiative forcing has substantially increased since 2021 and has not been countered by a strongly negative radiative response until 2024, consistent with exceptional warmth in 2023 and 2024.",

Removal of the senescent cells (SNCs) delays OA pathologies, but little is known about the heterogeneity of SNCs and their roles in OA pathogenesis. Here, we identify a subpopulation of senescent synovial cells and proposed a molecular mechanism governing pathogenic synovium-cartilage crosstalk in OA progression. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and synovial organoids, we demonstrate that RCAN1 + IL1α + senescent synovial fibroblasts, predominantly located in the lining layer of human OA synovium, exhibit proinflammatory phenotype, mitochondrial dysfunction, and promote cartilage degeneration. Mechanistically, RCAN1 stabilizes ATF4 mRNA and mediates saturated fatty acids (SFA) secretion from synovial fibroblasts, which could promote chondrocyte senescence and cartilage matrix degradation. Synovium-targeted delivery of anti-RCAN1 siRNA significantly ameliorated posttraumatic OA development in mice, reducing of SNC accumulation in synovium and increasing cartilage regeneration. Coculture experiments with human OA cartilage explants and synovial organoids confirm that RCAN1 silencing in synovial fibroblasts suppressess chondrocyte senescence and cartilage degradation. Our findings reveal a prodegenerative interaction between RCAN1 + IL1α + senescent synovial fibroblasts and chondrocytes mediated by secreted lipid in OA progression. Targeted RCAN1 knockdown in senescent synovium could be a new treatment strategy for restoring the joint homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "Seismic low-velocity layers (LVLs), frequently attributed to hydrous-silicate melts, are detected globally but exhibit lateral discontinuities. Geophysical and laboratory studies of water content in the mantle transition zone (MTZ) and upper mantle solubility limits suggest these layers likely form through global dehydration melting near the 410 km discontinuity (D410). A key hypothesis posits that melts form globally but are preserved only where melt stability permits retention. However, challenges in quenching melts into glass or fine-grained crystals at mantle pressures have precluded precise determination of melt composition, fueling debates over the mechanisms governing LVLs’ sporadic distribution. Here, we developed a fast-quenching high-pressure cell assembly to synthesize hydrous glasses or fine-grained quench crystals at pressures &gt;10 GPa, enabling high-precision analysis of incipient melt composition. Experiments at 13 GPa reveal that the 410 melt contains 43 mol% H 2 O, 9.2 mol% CaO, 30.5 mol% (Mg, Fe)O, 0.2 mol% Al 2 O 3 , and 17 mol% SiO 2 . The melt’s high water content necessitates Fe enrichment to achieve neutral buoyancy, which can only be sourced from Fe-rich heterogeneities (Fe # = 100Fe/(Mg+Fe) in mole; Fe # &gt;18) within the MTZ. In contrast, melts derived from normal MTZ material (Fe # &lt;18) remain buoyant and migrate upward, precluding stable layer formation. We conclude that global dehydration melting generates hydrous melts, but only Fe-rich heterogeneities enable melt retention, reconciling the coexistence of widespread LVL detections and their lateral discontinuities.",

Here, we studied transcriptional cytonuclear expression in synthetic alloplasmic allohexaploid wheat lines having the same nuclear subgenomic composition (the nuclear genome of Chinese Spring) but with varying cytoplasmic organelles (plasmon donors from B- and D- lineage Triticum/Aegilops species). A positive association between the extent of plastid organellar divergence from naturally occurring organelles in euplasmic Chinese Spring and transcriptional cytonuclear responses was observed.

          "abstract": "SMAX1-LIKE (SMXL) proteins in plants are cellular signaling hubs, many of which are posttranslationally regulated by karrikins from smoke, the plant hormones strigolactones (SLs), and/or cues such as light and nutrients. SMXL proteins control diverse aspects of growth, development, and environmental adaptation in plants through transcriptional corepression and interactions with transcriptional regulator proteins. In flowering plants, the SMXL family comprises four phylogenetic clades with different roles. Functions of the aSMAX1 clade include control of germination and seedling development, while the SMXL78 clade controls shoot architecture. We investigated how SMXL roles are specified in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through promoter-swapping experiments, we found that SMXL7 can partially replicate SMAX1 function, but SMAX1 cannot replace SMXL7 . This implies that the distinct roles of these genes are primarily due to differences in protein sequences rather than expression patterns. To determine which part of SMXL proteins specifies downstream control, we tested a series of protein chimeras and domain deletions of SMAX1 and SMXL7. We found an N-terminal region that is necessary and sufficient to specify control of germination, seedling growth, or axillary branching. We screened 158 transcription factors (TFs) for interactions with SMAX1 and SMXL7 in yeast two-hybrid assays. The N-terminal domain was necessary and/or sufficient for most of the 33 potential protein–protein interactions that were identified for SMAX1. This finding unlocks different ways to engineer plant growth control through cross-wiring SMXL regulatory “input” and developmental “output” domains from different clades and lays a foundation for understanding how functional differences evolved in the SMXL family.",

We identify CARD14 short as a dual regulator that activates NF-κB while inhibiting IRF3 signaling. Psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations are less efficient in restricting IRF3 activation and cytokine production upon Poly (I:C) stimulation, highlighting a potential mechanism in psoriasis pathogenesis. BCL10 is essential for MAVS-induced IRF3 activation, while MALT1 limits IRF3 signaling by promoting MAVS cleavage, K48-linked ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Genetic and chemical inhibition of MALT1 enhances IRF3 activation and type I IFN expression. These findings reveal a MAVS-CBM regulatory network linking innate immunity to epithelial homeostasis.",

Thus, treating CF patients early is crucial for preventing or delaying irreversible organ damage. Here, we demonstrate proof-of-concept of multiorgan mutation correction in CF using peptide nucleic acids encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles and delivered systemically in utero. In utero editing was associated with sustained postnatal CFTR activity, at a level similar to that of wild-type mice, in both respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues, without detection of off-target mutations in partially homologous loci.

We found that HR-dependent TI is suppressed by Msh2 only when a homology arm of donor DNA is as short as 1.7 kb. In contrast, single-strand annealing–mediated TI, which is cell cycle–independent and becomes prominent when HR or non-homologous end joining is inactivated, is weakly but constantly affected by Msh2 irrespective of the size of homology arms.

We used an early-night LAN paradigm that was established in mice to examine behavioral and physiological consequences in adult male tree shrews. We found that 3-wk LAN exposure significantly impaired the mood and long-term memory of tree shrews without affecting the general activity pattern. We identified retinal projections to the perihabenular nucleus (pHb), a crucial area in LAN-induced negative mood, and demonstrated that the pHb continues to innervate the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in tree shrews. Moreover, the pHb was required for the LAN effect on mood but not long-term memory. Transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues containing the NAc area revealed drastic changes of several depression-related genes in NAc neurons post-LAN treatment, suggesting that long-term exposure to nighttime light could result in lasting changes in tree shrews. Collectively, we present behavioral and neural structural evidence that LAN exerts depression-inducing effects in diurnal animals via a pHb-related visual pathway, which may facilitate the translation from laboratory findings of excessive LAN exposure to clinical applications in humans.",

In this study, we utilized the ascidian notochord tube as a model to address the underlying mechanisms. We first quantitatively measured and calculated the geometric parameters and found that tube expansion experienced three distinct phases. During the growth processes, we identified and experimentally demonstrated that both Rho GTPase Cdc42 signaling-mediated cell cortex distribution and the stability of tight junctions (TJs) were essential for lumen opening and tube expansion. Based on these experimental data, a conservation-laws-based tube expansion theory was developed, considering critical cell communication pathways, including secretory activity through vesicles, asymmetric cortex tension driven anisotropic lumen geometry, as well as the TJs gate barrier function. Moreover, by estimating the critical tube expansion parameters from experimental observation, we successfully predicted tube growth kinetics under different conditions through the combination of computational and experimental approaches, highlighting the coupling between actomyosin-based active mechanics and hydraulic processes. Taken together, our findings identify the critical cellular regulatory factors that drive the biological tube expansion and maintain its stability.",

Daily behavior is usually governed by indirect incidental associations among sensory cues that have never been explicitly paired with a reinforcer. This phenomenon, known as higher-order conditioning, can be systematically investigated in laboratory animals through specific behavioral paradigms such as sensory preconditioning protocols. In this study, using “Targeted Recombination in Active Populations” (TRAP2) transgenic mice, we have interrogated which are the brain areas orchestrating the encoding of associations between olfactory and gustatory stimuli and the expression of an aversive odor–taste sensory preconditioning paradigm. We identified neuronal ensembles within the basolateral amygdala specifically activated during odor–taste associations. To demonstrate the causal involvement of this brain region in our sensory preconditioning task, we inhibited it during the preconditioning phase (i.e., incidental associations) using a chemogenetic approach, which caused a clear impairment of the mediated responses. In addition, using retrograde tracers in the basolateral amygdala of TRAP2 mice, we observed that the projections from the lateral entorhinal cortex to the basolateral amygdala are particularly activated during odor–taste associations. Notably, the chemogenetic inhibition of this brain circuit impaired the mediated aversion performance in our sensory preconditioning task. Overall, these findings highlight the amygdala as a pivotal modulator of incidental associations during an aversive sensory preconditioning task and point toward a brain circuit crucially involved in these complex cognitive processes.",

Results support a mechanistic role for cortical inhibition in significantly increasing focality and strength of SMRs leading to accelerated BCI control in healthy subjects and an individual with spinal cord injury.

To address this, we introduce an active learning framework, VIRAL (Viral Identification via Rapid Active Learning), that integrates protein language model, Gaussian process with uncertainty estimation, and a biophysical model to predict the fitness of novel variants in a few-shot learning setting. By benchmarking on past SARS-CoV-2 data, we demonstrate that our method accelerates the identification of high-fitness variants by up to fivefold compared to random sampling while requiring experimental characterization of fewer than 1% of possible variants. We also demonstrate that our framework effectively identifies sites that are frequently mutated during natural viral evolution with a predictive advantage of up to two years compared to baseline strategies, particularly those enabling antibody escape while preserving ACE2 binding. Through systematic analysis of different acquisition strategies, we show that incorporating uncertainty in variant selection enables broader exploration of the sequence landscape, leading to the identification of evolutionarily distant but potentially dangerous variants. Our results suggest that VIRAL could serve as an effective early warning system for identifying concerning SARS-CoV-2 variants and potentially emerging viruses with pandemic potential before they achieve widespread circulation.",

Identified plant taxa include acorns (Fagaceae), rice ( Oryza sp.), underground storage organs such as yam ( Dioscorea sp.), and wild grasses (Triticeae and Panicoideae), all present in the local botanical assemblages. Coefficients of variation in dental metrics further indicate the coexistence of both domestic and wild populations. Together, these lines of evidence point to multiple modes of human–pig interaction, including early domestic pigs under human management, pigs scavenging near settlements, and free-ranging individuals foraging beyond human influence. Pig domestication in the Lower Yangtze had begun by 8,000 y ago, likely following both commensal and prey pathways, in parallel with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifeways. This study also demonstrates the value of dental calculus analysis for revealing early human–animal relationships before the appearance of clear morphological markers of domestication in the archaeological record.",

          "abstract": "Munc13 family proteins are crucial for the secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones necessary for cell communication. They share a conserved C-terminal region that includes C 2 and the MUN domains, which facilitate membrane interactions and the assembly of soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. Neuronal isoforms of Munc13 possess a variable N-terminal region that is essential for neurotransmitter release and short-term plasticity, although the precise functions of this region remain not fully understood. Here, we identified a negatively charged sequence within the N terminus of Munc13-1, termed polyE, which is specific to Munc13-1 among all Munc13 isoforms and potentially derived from a common ancestor of homeotherms. We found that polyE binds significantly to the MUN domain through charge–charge interactions, inhibiting MUN activity in promoting SNARE complex assembly. Disrupting the polyE–MUN interaction by introducing pseudophosphorylated mutations in the MUN domain alleviates this inhibition, thereby enhancing neurotransmitter release. Strikingly, Ca 2+ ions exhibit significant binding to polyE. We found that 40 μM of Ca 2+ adequately competes with the polyE–MUN interaction to reduce polyE inhibition. This concentration is comparable to presynaptic local [Ca 2+ ] i triggered by a single action potential. Taken together, these results indicate an autoinhibition conformation of Munc13-1 mediated by the polyE–MUN interaction. In addition, the relief of this autoinhibition conformation of Munc13-1 by presynaptic Ca 2+ influx and/or posttranslational modifications in the MUN domain may underlie Munc13-1 function in neurotransmitter release and short-term plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) is an important part of the plant immune system, allowing plants to sense and respond to harmful pathogen proteins known as “effectors.” Effectors can be sensed directly or indirectly by NLR (Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat) proteins, many of which “guard” the plant proteins targeted by effectors. Although a few effector–target–NLR interactions have been characterized, a general understanding of how these molecular interactions give rise to a functioning immune system is lacking. Here, we present a physics-based model of ETI based on protein–protein interactions. We show that the simplest physical model consistent with the biology gives rise to a robust immune sensor and explains the empirical phenomenon of effector interference as a generic consequence of molecules competing for binding partners. Using the evolutionarily conserved ZAR1 defense gene as a model, we explain how more complex interaction networks integrate multiple pathogen signals into a single response. We then examine alternatives to a guarding architecture, including direct sensing, decoys, and blended “integrated decoy” strategies, and reveal that these sensing architectures obey functional trade-offs between their sensitivity, target protection, and proteomic cost. This allows a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs between different forms of ETI. We discuss these findings in the context of the evolutionary forces shaping the plant immune system.",

W. Stahle et al ., Q. Sci. Rev. 34 , 1–15 (2012)]. Here, we present analyses of bald cypress trees from a subfossil deposit at the mouth of the Altamaha River on the Georgia Coast, United States. Shifts in tree lifespans and growth rates correspond temporally to the onset of the Vandal Minimum environmental downturn, c. 500 CE. Trees that sprouted after c. 500 CE had significantly shorter lifespans on average (&lt;200 y) than those that sprouted before this point in time (&gt;470 y). Trees sprouting after c. 500 CE also grew significantly faster than those that sprouted before this point. Bald cypress lifespans at the Altamaha River mouth never recovered to pre-Vandal Minimum levels and, in fact, continued to decrease significantly over time. The last long-lived trees retrieved from the deposit died at the beginning of the Little Ice Age, another major climatic shift. This study suggests the enduring, localized impacts of climatic downturns and indicates the vulnerability to climate change of coastal cypress forests of the Southeast. These conclusions pertain to this location and, perhaps, other near-coastal forests. In remaining pockets of old-growth forest with bald cypress in the Southeast, 800 to 2600-y-old trees are still proven to be alive [D. W. Stahle et al ., Q. Sci. Rev . 34 , 1–15 (2012); D. W.

          "abstract": "Emergent patterns in biological systems arise through dissipative processes that balance reaction and transport phenomena, producing highly functional properties from self-regulating mechanisms. Synthetic fabrication, by contrast, often relies on user-controlled, multistep methods that lack the self-organizing capabilities of natural systems. Inspired by nature, we sought chemical systems that integrate strongly coupled reaction and transport phenomena, identifying frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) as a method capable of creating diverse forms and functions through reactive processing. By employing discrete molecular initiators, FROMP allows precise control of key reaction steps—inhibition, initiation, and propagation. Using an integrated computational and experimental framework, we uncover how near-equilibrium inhibition dynamics, coupled with far-from-equilibrium reaction kinetics, drive pattern formation in frontally polymerized synthetic materials. We propose the concept of equilibrium-gated pattern formation, demonstrating how initiator chemistry can be tuned to achieve programmable macroscale properties. Our study reveals a surprising insight: Emergent behavior in FROMP systems arises from the inhibition-dominated regime of resin composition, expanding prior observations that such behavior is confined to a narrow compositional space near the boundary between front quenching and uniform front propagation. We identify a broader compositional window, far from the quenching regime, where emergent behavior reliably manifests. This expanded design space significantly enhances the operational flexibility of reactive systems and their capacity for self-organization. These insights provide a roadmap for designing bioinspired materials with self-organizing capabilities, unlocking possibilities in synthetic manufacturing.",

          "abstract": "Species invasions spur costly and labor-intensive control efforts, yet even local eradication is seldom achieved. When control measures are initially effective, they may drive evolutionary adaptation that prevents full eradication, as has been documented for some chemical and biocontrol approaches. Although the intensity, directionality, and persistence of selection required to increase the frequency of resistant genotypes in complex natural ecosystems remains an open question, theory predicts that high mortality can cause life-history evolution even in the absence of a strong selective agent. Here, we use annually collected ecological and genetic data to show that rapid evolution of introduced smallmouth bass has undermined a 20-y manual suppression effort in a mid-sized lake. Despite nearly doubling annual mortality, our intensive control program produced a larger bass population dominated by young and early-maturing fish. These shifts were accompanied by large allele frequency changes in three genomic regions associated with earlier maturation and increased somatic growth. Our findings bear out the theoretical prediction that high mortality can drive evolutionary adaptation in target species. Controlling species invasions are worldwide practices that typically remove a substantial proportion of a population during each of many successive generations, hence life history adaptation may be commonplace. Such evolutionary responses could be salient in explaining the widespread failure of invasion control efforts. Genetic and phenotypic monitoring to detect cryptic adaptation and preemptive design of invader eradication programs to deliberately disrupt directional selection for resistance could improve invasion control outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The dense extracellular matrix (ECM) of stroma-rich solid tumors acts as a significant barrier to effective chemotherapy by hindering drug penetration. In this study, a supramolecular hydrogel was successfully developed, enabling the codelivery and sequential release of hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs designed to target the ECM. The hydrogel is easy to prepare, has self-healing properties and excellent biocompatibility. Upon administration, the hydrogel first releases pirfenidone to inhibit collagen production, weakening the ECM, followed by the release of paclitaxel, which improves tumor penetration. The effectiveness of this sequential drug delivery system was validated in both oral squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer models, a classic example of a tumor with abundant ECM. In vitro experiments showed controlled sequential release profiles, whereas in vivo experiments using cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models revealed that the hydrogel was more effective at tumor suppression compared to traditional methods. Single administration of the hydrogel led to long-term localized drug release, maintaining higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents in the tumor tissue and effectively reducing the tumor volume. This study provided a promising strategy to enhance chemotherapy in ECM-dense tumors, offering an efficient and minimally invasive method for localized, sustained-release cancer therapy.",

          "abstract": "Reduction of China’s SO 2 emissions has been found to nonlinearly decrease the atmospheric sulfate (SO 4 2− ) aerosol concentrations in East Asia. Compared to Europe and North America, the lower effectiveness of SO 4 2− reduction in East Asia suggested much effects of “acidity-sensitive” feedback mechanisms in this high anthropogenic emission region, which have not been yet examined. In this work, we investigated these feedback mechanisms in East Asia through long-term measurements of the mass-independent oxygen-17 anomaly (Δ 17 O) in sulfate aerosols, machine learning and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. As China’s emissions reduced, the atmospheric acidity decreased, enhancing the ozone-driven oxidation of S(IV) and production efficiency of sulfate formation. This explained the weaker declining SO 4 2− concentrations than SO 2 emissions. By the evidence from observed Δ 17 O in non-sea-salt sulfate (Δ 17 O-nss-SO 4 2− ) and CMAQ simulations, the highly enhanced contributions of S(IV)+O 3 to sulfate driven by reduced SO 2 emissions explained the low effectiveness of SO 4 2− reduction in East Asia. Additionally, the decreases of acidity by substantial NH 3 emissions are projected to continue until 2050, limiting SO 4 2− reduction effectiveness. Thus, we highlighted that global control of both SO 2 and NH 3 emissions are needed to efficiently mitigate the sulfate-related climate and pollution, especially in high NH 3 emission region, such as East Asia.",

          "abstract": "Fungal pathogens infect billions and kill millions of people each year. Many of these pathogens have evolved strategies to evade our antifungal immune defenses. Candida albicans, for example, masks the proinflammatory pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) β-1,3-glucan, in response to specific host signals such as lactate. In C. albicans , most β-1,3-glucan lies in the inner cell wall shielded, by the outer mannan layer, from recognition by certain immune cells such as macrophages. β-1,3-glucan that becomes exposed at the cell surface can be shaved off by secreted enzymes. By integrating mathematical modeling with experimentation, we show that the dynamics of this shaving, together with the dynamics of β-1,3-glucan exposure during growth, can account for a range of β-1,3-glucan masking phenotypes. The mathematical model accurately simulates the dynamics of β-1,3-glucan exposure during growth and predicts levels of β-1,3-glucan shaving under a variety of conditions, revealing how subtle differences in growth contribute to observed variabilities in lactate-induced β-1,3-glucan masking. For example, clinical isolates previously thought to display minimal lactate-induced masking are shown to mask robustly. Using a range of C. albicans mutants, we confirm the importance of Gpr1/Gpa2-protein kinase A signaling for lactate-induced β-1,3-glucan shaving and define the contributions of the Xog1 and Eng1 glucanases to this shaving. Furthermore, examination of a shielding-defective C. albicans mnn2 x6 mutant confirms that both β-1,3-glucan shaving and shielding contribute to the dynamism of β-1,3-glucan masking at the fungal cell surface. Dynamism in PAMP masking is likely to be relevant to other fungal pathogens of humans.",

However, the biological outputs associated with location-specific mTOR signaling events are poorly understood and challenging to decouple. Here, we engineered synthetic intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) that are capable of modulating mTOR signaling with genetically programmable spatial resolution. Epitope-directed phage display was exploited to generate high affinity synthetic antibody fragments (Fabs) against the FKBP12–Rapamycin binding site of mTOR (mTOR FRB ). We determined high-resolution crystal structures of two unique Fabs that discriminate distinct conformational states of mTOR FRB through recognition of its substrate recruitment interface. By leveraging these conformation-specific binders as intracellular probes, we uncovered the structural basis for an allosteric mechanism governing mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) stability mediated by subtle structural adjustments within mTOR FRB . Furthermore, our results demonstrated that synthetic binders emulate natural substrates by employing divergent yet complementary hydrophobic residues at defined positions, underscoring the broad molecular recognition capability of mTOR FRB . Intracellular signaling studies showed differential time-dependent inhibition of S6 kinase 1 and Akt phosphorylation by genetically encoded intrabodies, thus supporting a mechanism of inhibition analogous to the natural product rapamycin. Finally, we implemented a feasible approach to selectively modulate mTOR signaling in the nucleus through spatially programmed intrabody expression. These findings establish intrabodies as versatile tools for dissecting the conformational regulation of mTORC1 and should be useful to explore how location-specific mTOR signaling influences disease progression.",

Increased dependence on imports makes SSA vulnerable to geopolitical and economic risks, while further expansion of agricultural land is environmentally harmful. Cereals, in particular, maize, millet, rice, sorghum, and wheat, take nearly 50% of the cropland and 43% of the calories and proteins consumed in the region. Demand is projected to double until 2050. Here, we assess recent developments in cereal self-sufficiency and provide outlooks until 2050 under different intensification, area expansion, and climate change scenarios. We use detailed data for ten countries. Cereal self-sufficiency increased between 2010 and 2020 from 84 to 92% despite the 29% population increase. The production increase was achieved by increased yields per hectare (44%), area expansion (34%), and a shift from millet to the higher yielding maize (22%). Outlooks for 2050 are less pessimistic than earlier assessments because of the larger 2020 baseline area, higher shares of maize and somewhat less steep projected population increase. Yet, to halt further area expansion, a drastic trend change in annual yield increase from the present 20 to 58 kg ha −1 y −1 is needed to achieve cereal self-sufficiency. While such yield increases have been achieved elsewhere and are feasible given the yield potentials in SSA, they require structural changes and substantial agronomic, socioeconomic, and political investments. We estimate that amounts of added nitrogen need to at least triple to achieve such yield improvements, but it is essential that this comes with improved context-specific agronomy.",

Through comprehensive transcriptome deep sequencing (RNA-seq) and polysome profiling analyses, we elucidated the dynamic interplay of regulation at the transcriptional and translational levels during germination. We show that delayed germination in some ribosome-defective mutants is partially regulated by the gene ABSCISIC ACID DEFICIENT2 ( ABA2 ), with an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5′ untranslated region that represses translation of the downstream ORF encoding ABA2. In addition, disrupting rice OsABA2 uORF inhibited preharvest sprouting (PHS). Furthermore, we found two main haplotypes for the uORF among rice cultivars that result in different OsABA2 expression levels, thus contributing to diverse PHS phenotypes. This work highlights the critical role of translational control and genetic variation in seed dormancy and germination, with implications for crop improvement.",

          "abstract": "PARP7 is an enzyme that uses donor substrate NAD + to attach a single ADP-ribose moiety onto proteins related to immunity, transcription, and cell growth and motility. Despite the importance of PARP7 in these processes, PARP7 signaling networks remain underresearched. Here, we used genome-wide CRISPR screens and multiplex quantitative proteomics in distinct lung cancer cell lines treated with a PARP7 inhibitor to better understand PARP7 molecular functions. We find that manipulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) transcriptional activity mediates PARP7 inhibitor sensitivity and triggers robust changes to the AHR-controlled proteome (AHR-ome). One of the striking features of such AHR-ome remodeling was the downregulation of filamins A and B concurrent with the induction of the corresponding E3 ubiquitin ligase ASB2. We also show that suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) crosstalks to AHR. Inhibition of PARP7 in SOCS3 knockout cells leads to reduced viability compared to wild-type cells treated with a PARP7 inhibitor. Our results reveal signaling interplay between PARP7, AHR, and SOCS3 and establish an invaluable resource to study the role of PARP7 in the regulation of AHR signaling and innate immunity through its ADP-ribosyl transferase activity.",

          "abstract": "Prior studies have indicated that the transcription factor Creb5 is expressed in the joint interzone, which contains the progenitors for all synovial joint tissues in both mouse and human embryos. In the absence of Creb5 function, most synovial joint interzones fail to form and the cartilage templates in the long bones remain fused. This earlier work did not clarify whether Creb5 initiates a cascade of signaling molecules, such as growth and differentiation factor 5 (Gdf5) and Wnt-family members, that in turn induce the formation of the joint interzone, or instead directly activates the expression of joint interzone markers. In the present study, an integrative analysis of the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and Creb5-occupancy in joint progenitors revealed that Creb5 directly binds to both its own two promoters and to the regulatory regions of Gdf5 and Sfrp2 , each of whose expression in the joint interzone is Creb5-dependent. Functional enhancer analysis indicated that Creb5 binding sites in either the two Creb5 promoters, or in Gdf5 and Sfrp2 regulatory elements are necessary for these sequences to drive transgene expression in the developing synovial joints. While Creb5 directly drives Gdf5 and Sfrp2 expression in the inner joint interzone, Creb5 activates Barx1 expression specifically in the outer joint interzone. Our findings indicate that Creb5 initiates a regulatory network that both promotes the formation of synovial joints, and subsequently activates distinct transcriptional targets in the inner versus the outer regions of the joint interzone, thus regionalizing gene expression in the developing joint.",

Clinical studies have suggested a correlation between periodontitis and sleep deficiency, but the underlying mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we observed an elevated risk of periodontitis in individuals with sleep deficiency, as demonstrated in both clinical subjects and mouse models. Retrograde tracing from the periodontium revealed a neural connection from trigeminal TRPV1 neurons, which may mediate the aggravating effects of sleep deficiency on periodontitis. The ablation of TRPV1 neurons effectively mitigated the aggravating effects of sleep deficiency on periodontitis. Under periodontitis, sleep restriction increased the secretion of substance P from trigeminal neurons in the periodontium, enhancing vasodilation and vascular permeability, which in turn promoted the infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells. Blocking substance P signaling via a Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist or knocking down Tacr1 in vascular endothelial cells alleviated these detrimental effects. Our findings unveil a critical neuron-vessel-immune axis that exacerbates periodontitis during sleep deficiency and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting this axis for managing periodontitis in individuals suffering from sleep deficiency.",

These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures support long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development. We then examined whether these trajectories were associated with literacy (sub)skills or influenced by familial risk of reading difficulty and children’s home literacy environments, two common literacy-related covariates. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to early elementary school decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as one of the strongest behavioral predictors of decoding and word reading skills, may already begin to develop by birth but undergo further refinement between infancy and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.",

Here, we explored the regulation of neuronal ALKAL2 in a colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) model. We found that neuronal ALKAL2 is upregulated at early stages of CAC, which in turn activates ALK signaling in the colonic mucosa. Notably, treating mouse colonic organoids with exogenous ALKAL2 triggered ALK activation. In vivo, mice treated with the ALK inhibitor lorlatinib at the onset of colitis exhibited a remarkable 90% reduction in tumor burden without significantly affecting overall inflammation. Moreover, activating TRPV1+ neurons using DREADD technology exacerbated tumor growth, whereas silencing these neurons significantly reduced it.

Understanding and controlling factors affecting DNA–RNA strand displacement reactions is necessary to enable control of processes such as CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. By combining multiscale modeling with strand displacement experiments, we show that the distribution of bases within the displacement domain has a very strong effect on reaction kinetics, a feature unique to DNA–RNA hybrid strand displacement. Merely by redistributing bases within a displacement domain of fixed base composition, we are able to design sequences whose reaction rates span more than four orders of magnitude. We extensively characterize this effect in reactions involving the invasion of dsDNA by an RNA strand, as well as the invasion of a hybrid duplex by a DNA strand. In all-DNA strand displacement reactions, we find a predictable but relatively weak sequence dependence, confirming that DNA–RNA strand displacement permits far more thermodynamic and kinetic control than its all-DNA counterpart. We show that oxNA, a recently introduced coarse-grained model of DNA–RNA hybrids, can reproduce trends in experimentally observed reaction rates. We also develop a simple kinetic model for predicting strand displacement rates. On the basis of these results, we argue that base distribution effects may play an important role in natural R-loop formation and in the function of the guide RNAs that direct CRISPR-Cas systems.",

Endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) is a cell fate transition process by which endothelial cells acquire hematopoietic identity and become hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) and then hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, but the underlying CRE network dynamics and its regulation by TFs remain unclear. In this study, we characterized the dynamics of CRE activation and TF occupancy during zebrafish EHT, and found that the enhancer–promoter collaboration forms the basis for EHT. Moreover, a ubiquitously expressed TF AP-1 collaborates with diverse lineage-specific TFs to remodel enhancer landscape. Deletion of AP-1 family member Jund impaired hematopoietic specification, resulting from the enhanced endothelial identity in the HEC. Mechanistically, Jund and hematopoietic TF Hoxa9a collectively repress the activity of an endothelial-related dll4 enhancer through tight control of the active histone modification H3K27ac.

But such models have thus far exhibited low predictive skill with respect to subpopulation-level acute malnutrition indicators. We explore whether updating training data with high frequency monitoring of the predictand can help improve machine learning models’ predictive performance with respect to child acute malnutrition by directly learning the dynamic determinants of rapidly evolving acute malnutrition crises. We combine supervised machine learning methods and remotely sensed feature sets with time series child anthropometric data from EWS’ sentinel sites to generate accurate forecasts of acute malnutrition at operationally meaningful time horizons.

Here, we explore the self-assembly of neural circuits in Hydra , an organism with a simple nervous system but no centralized information processing, to enhance the understanding of nervous system evolution. We define self-assembly as spontaneous organization of neurons into functional circuits without requiring a prespecified structural template. In this context, the N4 neuronal circuit, which we have previously found to be particularly important in the feeding of the animal, develops in embryos through activity-driven self-assembly, a process in which intrinsic calcium activity drives connectivity and synchronization among spatially distributed neurons over time. Gap junctions and vesicle-mediated communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells drive rapid assembly, with the embryo’s prospective oral region exhibiting the highest neuronal density. An artificial electrical circuit–based model as a biophysically inspired simulation demonstrates dynamic increases in synchronization over time, along with predictions for selective dynamic adaptions of connections. Environmental factors, like temperature and an absent microbiome, modify neural architecture, suggesting the existence of a certain adaptability during neural development. We propose that these fundamental features originated in the last common bilaterian ancestor, supporting the hypothesis that the basic architecture of the nervous system is universal. Since in the natural habitat of Hydra both temperature fluctuations and changes in the microbiome can occur, our work not only illuminates a fundamental developmental process but also may guide environmental and evolutionary studies by explaining how organisms adapt to environmental variations.",

Activation of RIPK1 upon engagement of TNFR1 by TNFα may promote necroptosis by interacting with RIPK3 or apoptosis by activating caspases. RIPK1 is extensively regulated by a variety of dynamic posttranslational modifications which control its kinase activity and formation of downstream complexes to mediate necroptosis and apoptosis. Here, we investigate the functional significance and mechanism by which PARP12, a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, interacts with RIPK1 and RIPK3 in cells stimulated by IFNγ and TNFα. We show that PARP12 catalyzes the mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) of RIPK1 in both the intermediate domain and the kinase domain, as well as the MARylation of RIPK3. PARP12 deficiency reduces necroptosis by inhibiting the activation of RIPK1 kinase and its interaction with RIPK3, as well as sensitizes to apoptosis by promoting the binding of RIPK1 with caspase-8. Thus, upon induction by IFNs, PARP12 may function as a cellular checkpoint that controls RIPK1 to promote necroptosis and inhibit apoptosis. Importantly, while PARP12 is a known interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), PARP12 deficiency promotes the expression of a subset of ISGs and confers protection against influenza A virus-induced mortality in mice. Our study demonstrates that PARP12 is an important modulator of cellular antiviral response.",

          "abstract": "To fertilize an oocyte, mammalian spermatozoa must undergo a maturation step known as capacitation that takes place after ejaculation. Protein kinase A (PKA) plays a fundamental role in capacitation in all mammalian species. Before capacitation, PKA is maintained in an inactive state where the catalytic subunits are bound to a dimer of inhibitory regulatory subunits. A key element in the regulation of PKA lies in its intracellular compartmentalization achieved by docking at A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP). Despite the crucial role of the modulation of local PKA activity in fertilization, its localization and mechanism of compartmentalization are not well understood. Here, we approach this problem using quantitative laser scanning microscopy and superresolution imaging to dissect the interactions and relocalization of PKA subunits during capacitation. We find that in the resting state, both catalytic and regulatory subunits colocalize close to the axoneme. Upon capacitation, the PKA regulatory subunits, but not the catalytic subunits, relocate to a quadrilateral structure along the flagellum principal piece, in the vicinity of AKAP4 and the CatSper channel signaling complex. Furthermore, this quadrilateral localization of PKA regulatory subunits disappears in sperm from CatSper1 knockout mice. The sharp difference between the localization of PKA regulatory subunits in capacitated vs. noncapacitated sperm cells demonstrates its suitability as a biomarker for identifying capacitation, an enduring problem in the study of sperm physiology.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer has now overtaken lung cancer as the “world’s leading cancer,” yet detecting and implementing effective therapies remains a significant challenge. Substantial advances have been made in photothermal therapy (PTT), where photosensitizers use photonic energy to induce localized hyperthermia for cancer eradication. This pioneering approach is gaining traction in clinical settings. However, traditional PTT faces inherent limitations, including the risk of damage to neighboring healthy tissues and potential inflammatory responses due to overheating. Drawing inspiration from the distinct characteristics of aggregation-induced emission the small molecule, PM331, was chosen for study. This donor–acceptor–donor system displays good photothermal conversion efficiencies (40% and 66%) upon excitation at 808 nm and 1,064 nm, respectively. It is also characterized by attractive optical features in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window. Using nanoparticles containing PM331, PM331@F127 , we have developed a PTT strategy, termed dual-laser PTT (DLPTT), that involves successive excitation using 808 nm and 1,064 nm lasers guided by both NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. The DLPTT strategy involves two steps. First, it initiates DNA damage and downregulates heat shock protein expression as the result of an initial brief irradiation with an 808 nm laser. This is then followed by irradiation with a 1,064 nm laser to ablate tumor cells while minimizing inflammation and harm to surrounding healthy tissues. Based on the findings reported here, we suggest that DLPTT could represent an attractive approach to precision medicine and one that could make PTT more amenable to clinical implementation.",

It implies that gaining insights and ideas that lead to new discoveries and technologies allows victory in the marketplace, ahead of the competition. As the Trump administration continues to drastically defund and dismantle basic science in America, the United States is presenting other countries with opportunities to take the lead in seeing farther ahead, anticipate where scientific and technological prowess is going, and create the future, while the United States stands on the sidelines. This is a matter not only of scientific prestige but also of economic vitality. The country will no longer be at the forefront of commercializing breakthroughs and leveraging them for maximum economic and societal benefit. Moreover, this will trigger a massive transition for the global scientific community and alter the framework that shapes how the world’s economies connect and grow.",

The broad-spectrum coverage is made possible by a combination of narrow bandgaps, strong absorption, and engineered asymmetries. Implanted into blind mice, the TeNWNs restored pupillary reflexes and enabled visually cued learning under visible and near-infrared 1550-nanometer light. In nonhuman primates, TeNWNs elicited robust retina-derived neural responses, confirming biocompatibility and feasibility. By restoring lost photosensitivity and extending vision to near-infrared, this nanoprosthesis offers a promising approach for restoring vision.",

Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we developed an interfacial self-regulation concept in which a deformable secondary phase dynamically aggregates at the interface in response to local electro-chemo-mechanical stimuli, enhancing contact. The stripping of a lithium electrode that contains 5 to 20 mole % electrochemically inactive sodium domains causes spontaneous sodium accumulation across the interface, with the sodium deforming to attain intimate electrical contact without blocking lithium transport. This process, characterized with operando x-ray tomography and electron microscopy, mitigates voiding and improves cycling at low stack pressures. The counterintuitive strategy of adding electrochemically inactive alkali metal to improve performance demonstrates the utility of interfacial self-regulation for solid-state batteries.",

Ecological theory, supported by numerical simulations and genomics, frames NOB as opportunists exploiting a fleeting supply of oxygen. Consistent with in situ observations, simulated NOB contribute substantially to total oxygen consumption at AMZ boundaries, which implies that NOB may provide a major stabilizing feedback to AMZs.

Yet we found no statistical evidence that these interventions reduced poaching (horn demand, wealth inequality, embedded criminal syndicates, and corruption likely combine to drive even high-risk poaching).

          "abstract": "Carbon and nitrogen are central elements in global biogeochemical cycles. To effectively manage carbon and nitrogen in China, we developed a comprehensive model for quantifying their fluxes, investigating their interplay across 16 human and natural subsystems. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrogen losses in China increased 2.3-fold and carbon emissions surged 6.5-fold. Integrated carbon and nitrogen management holds the potential for a 74% reduction in nitrogen losses to air and water and a 91% decrease in carbon emissions to the atmosphere by 2060. Compared with separate control of carbon or nitrogen, integrated management delivers an additional reduction of 1.8 million tons of nitrogen and 26.5 million tons of carbon by 2060, bringing out a 37% decrease in unit abatement cost and a net societal benefit of 1384 billion USD.",

          "abstract": "The melanocortin system centrally regulates energy homeostasis, with key components such as melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and adenylyl cyclase 3 (ADCY3) in neuronal primary cilia. Mutations in MC4R and ADCY3 as well as ciliary dysfunction lead to obesity, but how melanocortin signaling works in cilia remains unclear. Using mouse random germline mutagenesis, we identified two missense mutations in G protein–coupled receptor 45 (Gpr45) that lead to obesity through hyperphagia. GPR45 was expressed in paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), where it localized to cilia and recruited Gα s to increase ciliary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) via ADCY3. GPR45 colocalized with MC4R in PVH cilia and promoted ciliary MC4R activation. Loss of GPR45 in the PVH or MC4R + neurons caused obesity. These findings establish GPR45 as a key regulator of the ciliary melanocortin system, bridging MC4R and ADCY3.",

We found that circulating taurine concentrations increased or remained unchanged with age in three geographically distinct human cohorts as well as in nonhuman primates and mice when measured longitudinally (repeatedly in the same population) or cross-sectionally (sampling distinct populations at various ages). Moreover, considerable variability was observed in associations between taurine and age-related changes in health outcomes pertaining to gross motor function and energy homeostasis. Our results suggest that changes in circulating taurine are not a universal feature of aging and that its pleiotropic effects may be dependent on the temporal and physiological context of each individual.",

Recent LIDAR (light detection and ranging) and excavation data have uncovered densely clustered ancient agricultural raised garden bed ridges covering an expanse far greater than previously realized. These raised agricultural fields are deeply enmeshed in the broader cultural landscape, as ceremonial and other features were also found. Our results demonstrate a rich anthropogenic landscape created by small-scale ancestral Menominee communities, located near the northern limits of maize agriculture. The excellent preservation of this site is exceptional in eastern North America and suggests that the precolonial landscape was more anthropogenically influenced than currently recognized.",

We identify a combination of vascular-inducing factors that give rise to cardiac vascularized organoids with a spatially organized and branched vascular network. To show the broader utility of our vascularization strategy, we use the same vascular-inducing factors to produce hepatic vascularized organoids.

In this work, we report structures of imitation switch (ISWI) bound to the nucleosome during active ATP hydrolysis and remodeling, revealing conformational transitions of the remodeling motor across the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) cycle. The DNA strands were distorted accordingly, showing one full base-pair bulge and a loss of histone contact at the site of motor binding in the adenosine diphosphate* (ADP*) and apo* (unbound) states. We also identified several important elements for regulation of the remodeling activity. Notably, an enzyme conformation exiting the remodeling cycle reveals a linker DNA–sensing brake mechanism. Together, our findings elucidate a multistate model of ISWI action, providing a comprehensive mechanism of DNA translocation and regulation underpinning chromatin remodeling.",

However, such liquid-like membraneless bodies can undergo aberrant liquid-to-solid transitions into amyloid-like pathological species, which necessitates their efficient clearance by the cellular protein quality control machinery comprising molecular chaperones. We present a unique case to demonstrate that a heat shock protein 40 (Ydj1) promotes the heterotypic phase separation of intrinsically disordered tau via a multitude of interactions. Using multicolor imaging, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, vibrational Raman spectroscopy, and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, we unmask the crucial molecular events associated with heterotypic phase separation of tau. We show that the presence of Ydj1 within condensates abolishes phase transitions into amyloids, unlike tau-only droplets that spontaneously mature into amyloid fibrils. We identify the amyloidogenic hexapeptide motifs located in the hydrophobic microtubule-binding region of tau that interacts with the peptide-binding regions of Ydj1 promoting tau-Ydj1 condensate formation. Our results provide mechanistic underpinnings of condensate-mediated protein homeostasis.",

Here, we sought to address this in the context of cold exposure, a well-studied metabolic perturbation. We performed proteomics across six metabolic tissues and plasma, quantifying 11,394 proteins. Beginning our investigation in brown adipose tissue (BAT), we identified a mechanism to explain enhanced glucose utilization in cold-adapted BAT. This was characterized by select remodeling of upper glycolysis and pentose cycling to increase oxygen consumption, likely by increasing uncoupling protein 1 activity through the production of reactive oxygen species. Cold-induced remodeling of the plasma proteome appeared to underpin the ability of BAT to modify its fuel preference, stimulating lipolysis in white adipose tissue and glucose production in the liver. These findings emphasize the importance of considering metabolic adaptations in the context of the whole body and suggest overlap between the mechanisms of cold adaptation and obesity.",

However, crustal generation remains enigmatic with both plate tectonic and non-plate tectonic modes proposed. In this study, we show that zircons from the ~2.5–billion years ago TTGs in the Eastern Block (EB) of the North China Craton have low water contents (median of 263 parts per million) and high δ 18 O values (median of 6.22‰) and a negative correlation between them, which suggest a thick hybridized and hydrated mafic source. By contrast, zircon water contents of the adjoining coeval TTGs in the Trans-North China Orogen, formed in a supra-subduction zone setting, are notably higher. These results support a two-stage mantle plume-sagduction process for TTG formation. Our study suggests that Archean continental crust, such as that in the EB, most likely originated from plume-related oceanic plateaus, rather than subduction-related island arc magmatism under a plate tectonic regime.",

However, achieving the deterministic creation of FDWs with nanoscale precision and controlled polarization of domains remains a substantial challenge for the scalable FDW-device fabrication and circuit design. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for FDW engineering by tailoring the interfacial electrostatic profile. Using SrRuO 3 islands as “nano-masks,” we spatially modulate the interfacial atomic termination to generate alternating positive and negative built-in electric fields. The boundaries where the electric field switches polarity drive the formation of 180° FDWs in BiFeO 3 thin films. This mechanism is validated through theoretical calculations and direct experimental observations. Furthermore, atomic-scale analysis reveals localized lattice distortions, structural chirality of the FDWs, as well as the edge effect of SrRuO 3 islands on the position precision of FDW nucleation.

Miniaturized microscopy enables investigators to track population activity at the cellular level, but the field of view (FOV) of these microscopes has often been limited and do not support multi-brain region imaging. To fill this technological gap, we have developed the eXtra Large FOV Miniscope (MiniXL) for mice, a 3.5-gram miniaturized microscope with an FOV measuring 3.5 mm in diameter. We demonstrate the capabilities of the MiniXL through large-scale neuronal population records in hippocampal dorsal CA1. We also demonstrate simultaneous multi-brain region imaging across bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mPFC and nucleus accumbens (NAc) during complex social behavior and stably track cells across multiple days. As with all microscopes in the UCLA Miniscope ecosystem, the MiniXL is fully open-source and designed to be shared with the neuroscience community to lower the barriers for adoption of this technology.",

By focusing on sequences where machine learning (ML) predictions deviate from conventional design strategies, we synthesized and tested 268 pentapeptides, successfully finding 96 forming β sheet assemblies, including unconventional sequences (e.g., ILFSM, LMISI, MITIY, MISIW, and WKIYI) not predicted by traditional methods. Our ML models outperformed conventional β sheet propensity tables, revealing useful chemical design rules. A web interface is provided to facilitate community access to these models.

Our previous studies showed that the protein product of PD-associated gene DJ-1 modulates metabolic efficiency through its interaction with the F1Fo-ATP-synthase β subunit (β-sub). Here, using proximity ligation assay (PLA), we compared mitochondrial DJ-1-β-sub association in distinct mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neuronal subpopulations and their intracellular compartments of PD and control postmortem brains. In PD brains, DJ-1-β-sub-PLA was lower than control in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) somata and neurites but unchanged in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. In PD and control cases, the PLA signal was reduced in distal neurites of SNpc compared to VTA neurons. These intracellular and region-specific differences suggest that impaired mitochondrial efficiency may contribute to the differential vulnerability of mesDA neurons in PD.",

Using Cleavage Under Targets &amp; Release Using Nuclease, we identified targets of Zelda important for the end of regeneration, including genes that control wing margin and vein specification, compartment identity, and cell adhesion.

This study further identifies a “direct” notable impact of both sea surface temperature (SST) and climate on ocean colorimetry tendency and anomaly, especially in the low-latitude oceans. Extreme SST events cause “distinct” ocean colorimetry anomalies, although 94% of cases involve relatively small SST fluctuations. Causal analysis reveals important impacts of climate change on equatorial ocean dynamics, particularly ENSO events.

Notably, L-cDC2s are predominantly distributed in barrier tissues such as the lungs and skin. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the enrichment of lymphocyte signature genes in L-cDCs. We identified lymphocyte-primed cDC precursors, which are distinct from pDC-like cells, as sources of L-cDCs. Compared with M-cDC2s, L-cDC2s weakly primed T cells under low-dose antigen stimulation and preferentially promoted T helper 2 (T H 2) differentiation under sufficient antigenic stimulation.

Untargeted mass spectrometry–based characterization of organic matter, along with elevated particulate organic carbon and chlorophyll concentrations, demonstrated production and accumulation of distinct organic compounds—including phytoplankton biomarkers—within a hurricane-generated phytoplankton bloom. 16 S rRNA transcripts from active microbes were dominated by degraders of phytoplankton-derived organic matter near the surface and by anaerobic bacteria (including sulfate-reducing bacteria) within the shoaled OMZ—indicating rapid microbial responses.

After defining a classical nuclear limit that is consistent with the quantum-classical equilibrium, we include nuclear quantum effects through a variational polaron transformation of the high-frequency vibrational modes. This approach is validated by comparison with fully quantum-mechanical benchmark calculations and applied to three prototypical light-harvesting complexes. For light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria, the inter-ring transfer is 1.5 times slower in the quantum treatment than in the classical treatment. For the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, the transfer rate is the same in both cases, whereas for light-harvesting complex II of spinach, the transfer is 1.7 times slower in the quantum treatment. The effect is most pronounced for systems with large excitonic energy gaps and strong vibronic coupling to high-frequency modes.

          "abstract": "High-entropy oxides (HEOs) have attracted attention due to their unique elemental synergistic effect and lattice distortion. However, mixing elements’ vastly different radii and valences leads to substantial element segregation during the reaction. In addition, the requirement for a harsh temperature (1100°C) to achieve entropy stabilization results in the volatilization of low–melting point components. Here, we propose a strategy for synthesizing functionalized Ga-based HEOs (GHEOs) at a low temperature (400°C) by the Ga integration mechanism. The negative mixing enthalpy between Ga and other metals reduces the Gibbs free energy, enabling the creation of homogeneous GHEOs through a hydrothermal process at a lower temperature. The Ga integration mechanism is supported by thermodynamic and density functional theory analyses. In particular, the perovskite, spinel, and rock salt crystal can be precisely tuned by choosing metal ions, enabling tailored applications in electrocatalysis, energy-saving materials, and methane sensors. Hence, this GHEOs strategy can be extended to realize many ideal GHEOs adjusted for specific applications.",

Here, we introduce RBPseg, a method that combines monomeric ESMFold predictions with a structural-based domain identification approach, to divide tail fiber sequences into manageable fractions for high-confidence modeling with AF2M. Using this approach, we generated complete tail fiber models, validated by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy of five fibers from three phages. A structural classification of 67 fibers identified 16 distinct classes and 89 domains, revealing patterns of modularity, convergence, divergence, and domain swapping.

We show that only chemokines able to bind these two phospholipids kill bacteria and that they exert rapid bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects with a higher potency than the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin 3. Both biochemical and genetic interference with the chemokine-cardiolipin interaction impaired microbial growth arrest, bacterial killing, and membrane disruption by chemokines.

Its potential applications are compelling and broad, spanning clinical assessment of retinal disease, investigation of fundamental scientific questions, and rapid evaluation of experimental therapeutics for blinding retinal diseases. Progress in all these domains hinges on the development of robust methods for quantifying observed responses in relation to visible stimuli. In this work, we describe an optoretinographic imaging platform: full-field swept-source optical coherence tomography with adaptive optics, measure cone responses in two healthy volunteers to a variety of stimulus patterns, and propose a simple model for predicting and quantifying responses to those stimuli.",

Here, we mapped eosinophils across evolutional hepatic granulomas in a mouse model and in a primary wild reservoir for human schistosomiasis in Brazil (water rat Nectomys squamipes ). With in-depth quantitative image analysis and three-dimensional histological reconstructions of entire granulomas, we find that eosinophils are spatially organized and occupy a major, peripheral niche conserved across space and time in all granuloma stages and both experimental and natural infections. Within this niche, immature and mature eosinophils coinhabit, compartmentalize their major basic protein-1 content, robustly interact with other immune cells, and secrete through piecemeal degranulation. This unveiled niche, unrelated to parasite eggs, challenges the concept of eosinophil as a “helminth killer” cell and invigorates its view as an immunoregulatory cell of the tissue microenvironment in Schistosoma granulomas.",

Changes in the trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)–type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play an essential role in synaptic plasticity, which is the cellular basis of learning and memory. To explore receptor trafficking, genetically encoded approaches (e.g., the fusion of fluorescent proteins to receptors) are often used. However, concerns remain that genetic approaches cannot fully reproduce the receptor functions that are inherent to neurons. Herein, we report on PFQX1(AF488), a fluorescent probe for the visualization of cell-surface AMPARs without any genetic manipulation to neurons. The rapid and reversible staining features of this probe enabled snapshot imaging, which showed the accumulation of native AMPARs in dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity. Moreover, the mechanism of this synaptic accumulation, for which genetically encoded approaches have given controversial results, was revealed by integrating two chemical methods: PFQX1(AF488) and covalent chemical labeling.",

Algorithms used in classical optimization methods cannot avoid assessing high-energy states where, for example, simulated annealing is designed to initially spend computational effort. We introduce a scalable, practical, and accurate approach using quantum annealing to efficiently sample low-energy configurations of disordered materials, avoiding the need for excessive high-energy calculations. Our method includes temperature and simulates large unit cells, producing a Boltzmann-like distribution to identify thermodynamically relevant structures.

Here, we summarize and discuss mechanisms whereby the CoREST complex coopts tissue-specific transcription factors to elicit pathogenic activity in cancer and neurodegenerative disease. We also identify tumor types with selective dependencies on the scaffolding properties of the CoREST complex. We argue that these tumor types may benefit from a KBTBD4-activating/CoREST complex degrader therapy, which could also enhance antitumor immunity and sensitize resistant tumors to immunotherapy. Overall, understanding how the CoREST complex operates abnormally and differences between its targeting through catalytic inhibitors or protein degraders will help discern all possible applications for targeting therapies now in clinical development.",

Our investigation of Syx17 function in Drosophila nephrocytes and salivary gland cells revealed unexpected effects. We find that Syx17 loss induces the formation of autophagosome-lysosome clusters in a HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting)–dependent manner, entrapping this tether, autophagosomes, and lysosomes. While locked in clusters, these organelles cannot participate in other vesicle fusions, impeding endosomal progression and autophagosome secretion. Therefore, the absence of Syx17 not only inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion but also prevents HOPS release from autophagosome-lysosome tethering sites causing a “tethering lock.” Preventing autophagosome formation or removing the HOPS adaptor Plekhm1 (pleckstrin homology domain–containing family M member 1) leads to release of HOPS and lysosomes from these clusters, thus rescuing secondary effects of Syx17 loss. Our findings show that a tethering lock can disrupt multiple vesicle trafficking routes.",

Bulk tissue δ 13 C and δ 15 N analysis showed that fishes in kelp forests had larger trophic niches and greater interspecific niche separation than fishes on turf reefs. Moreover, δ 13 C analysis of essential amino acids revealed that kelp-derived energy accounted for most of the energy used by kelp forest fishes (&gt; 50% on average), whereas fishes on turf reefs compensated for kelp decline via greater reliance on a phytoplankton-based energy channel.

Here, we present an empirical fitness seascape in E. coli harboring all combinations of four drug resistance mutations. Incorporating these data into PK-PD simulations of antibiotic treatment, we find that higher mutation supply increases the probability of resistance, and early adherence to the drug regimen is critical. In vitro studies further support the finding that the second dose in a drug regimen is important for preventing resistance.

Our simulations suggest that there is a mismatch between the timescales of coral reef decline and range expansion under future predicted climate change. Whereas the most severe declines in coral cover will likely occur within 40 to 80 years, large-scale coral reef expansion requires centuries.

We show that AOM coupled with denitrification markedly reduces soil N 2 O emissions, with the type I methanotroph Methylobacter species collaborating with the Methylophilaceae and Gemmatimonadaceae families to perform key roles. The suppression of N 2 O emissions by AOM primarily stems from its role in supplying electrons and carbon sources, fueling complete denitrification by associated bacteria. In addition, we uncovered distinct microbial interaction strategies for AOM-coupled nitrate and nitrite reduction. While nitrite reduction necessitates both bacterial cooperation and extracellular electron transfer during its initial stages, nitrate reduction predominantly depends on methanotrophic bacteria alone at the outset. These findings advance our understanding of carbon-nitrogen cycle coupling and underscore AOM’s potential to simultaneously mitigate both CH 4 and N 2 O emissions.",

One notable effect associated with the hepatobiliary tropism of PltC typhoid toxin is a reduction in bile acids, consequently promoting S. Typhi pathogenicity in infected mice.

Here, we report a small luminescent molecule, TPA2PyPh, as a potent antibacterial agent and its potential for lipid droplet–engineered macrophage transfer strategy in treating bacterial sepsis. Engineered macrophages, created by directly incubating TPA2PyPh with macrophages, enabled the luminogen to precisely bind to intracellular lipid droplets. Upon engulfment of bacteria, these TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages use natural lipid uptake mechanisms to deliver the luminogen to intracellular bacteria, disrupting their membranes and inserting into the bacterial DNA, thereby inducing bacterial elimination. Our findings show that the adoptive transfer of TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages substantially diminishes bacterial burden in septic mice and substantially reduces mortality rates. This study demonstrates the potential of TPA2PyPh as an effective antibacterial agent and supports the use of adoptive lipid droplet–engineered macrophage transfer as an effective approach for treating sepsis and managing severe infectious diseases.",

          "abstract": "Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a sexually dimorphic disease where aortic valve leaflets develop fibrosis and calcification, leading to heart failure if untreated. Sex differences in AVS progression depend on valvular interstitial cells (VICs) activating to myofibroblasts that drive aberrant extracellular matrix remodeling. To date, no treatment strategies have leveraged cellular sex differences to determine drug combinations that target VIC myofibroblast activation. Here, we harnessed IDentif.AI, an artificial intelligence (AI)–derived platform, to optimize sex-biased synergistic drug combinations that may prevent and reverse VIC myofibroblast activation on hydrogel biomaterials. The results reveal that sex-specific drug response models can be used to predict sex biases in drug efficacy and combinatorial interactions. This study provides a framework for developing AVS treatments through the integration of high-throughput hydrogel cell culture platforms and AI-driven drug optimization. Designing targeted AVS drug combinations may help accelerate AVS drug development and address health disparities in AVS treatment outcomes.",

The constructed perturbed TF-mediated eRNA-promoter regulatory landscape revealed that rewiring eRNA-promoter networks contributed to glioma malignancy.

In this study, we demonstrate that atypical signal sequences, characterized by high hydrophobicity and/or the absence of characteristic charges, are recognized by the signal recognition particle and targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum in a reverse orientation. These misoriented signal sequences are subsequently dislocated by the P5A-ATPase ATP13A1 and delivered to SEC61 for further translocation. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structures of human ATP13A1 in multiple conformations (3.40- to 3.87-angstrom resolution), revealing key residues within its substrate-binding pocket that engage signal sequences through polar interactions.

Here, we reveal a mechanism in which light chain 3 proteins (LC3s) and pericentrin (PCNT) form an adaptor complex that is required for vRNPs binding to the dynein 1 and IAV uncoating at endosomes. This function of LC3s and PCNT is independent from their established role in autophagy and centrosome assembly, respectively. LC3s or PCNT depletion severely impairs IAV cytoplasm entry and infection, which can be further inhibited by additional silencing of histone deacetylase 6, an APM component. Collectively, our results show that IAV has adopted two redundant strategies to hijack the dynein biomolecular motors and facilitate VP uncoating.",

However, its role and mechanisms against macroparasites remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila hosts use behavioral fever to defend against Leptopilina parasitoid wasps. This thermal preference increases wasp mortality and enhances host survival. We find that behavioral fever is mediated by up-regulation of Heat shock protein 70 ( Hsp70 ) genes in infected hosts as Hsp70 loss abolishes behavioral fever, whereas its overexpression induces heat-seeking behavior. We further find that behavioral fever up-regulates immune genes in infected hosts, including 12 antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) genes, which disrupt the gut microbiota homeostasis of parasitoid wasps and, in turn, lead to substantial wasp mortality. Our findings elucidate the detailed mechanisms of behavioral fever in Drosophila hosts, advancing our understanding of ectothermic animal defenses against macroparasites.",

Anthracene and phenanthrene were detected isomer-selectively using photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves and mass-selected threshold photoelectron (ms-TPE) spectra. While phenanthrene is produced through a radical-radical recombination of the carbon-centered radicals, anthracene may plausibly be formed through an unconventional radical addition to a low spin-density fluorenyl carbon.

Crystal structures reveal a steric clash between the rigid, bulky NIR tert -butyl group and the β-branched Val 166 , disrupting the covalent binding of NIR to the catalytic Cys 145 and leading to high resistance in BA.1 and WA1 replicons. NIR-resistant replicons remained susceptible to GC376, which can still covalently bind Cys 145 by avoiding a steric clash with Val 166 through “wiggling and jiggling.” Hence, strategic flexibility is a strategy that will help design second-generation antivirals against NIR-resistant viruses.",

To this end, adult human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) present one of the most relevant cell sources. However, iNs generated from adult hDFs using two-dimensional cultures are difficult to maintain in vitro and face challenges in survival upon transplantation into the adult brain, thus imposing constraints on biomedical applications of iN technology. Here, we present a platform for direct in vitro reprogramming of adult hDFs inside three-dimensional suspension microcultures (3D-iNs). We show that the 3D environment favors neuronal over fibroblast cellular identity to yield more robust conversion into functional neurons with extended culturing span. The 3D reprogramming approach also provides a platform for fusion into induced assembloids. 3D-iNs can be gently harvested and transplanted into the adult rodent brain to reproducibly generate neuron-rich grafts, thus eliminating a major bottleneck in the direct reprogramming field.",

Cd24a + cells gave rise to the dentin-pulp complex, while Pax9 + ones mainly generated periodontal tissues. During development, guided by alveolar bone–derived PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor, B polypeptide), Cd24a + / Pax9 + cells gradually concentrated on the apical region during the crown-to-root transition, collectively migrated and formed dental root. Cell ablation and conditional Wnt knockout notably compromised tooth establishment. Single-cell RNA sequencing, CUT&amp;Tag, and spatial mapping further revealed distinct features of Cd24a + / Pax9 + cells and their cellular organization. Last, the CD24 + / PAX9 + core was also present in human teeth, suggesting it as a conserved developmental program.

To explore mechanisms underlying these effects in SNCA Dupl neurons, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate isogenic control hiPSCs. Isogenic correction of SNCA dosage restored SNCA Dupl -induced neurite defects and bTubIII levels. Multi-omics analyses revealed SNCA Dupl -induced alterations in neuronal differentiation, with a notable down-regulation of PAX6. Moreover, SNCA Dupl induced an up-regulation of vimentin. Further characterization revealed heightened vimentin truncation associated with altered distribution and organization. Similar changes in vimentin levels and truncation were observed in postmortem putamen tissue from patients with sporadic PD.

Our reconstructions indicate remarkable stability of water table depth in a Pacific Northwest aquifer throughout the LGT despite increasing precipitation, closely matching independent Earth system model (ESM) simulations. In the American Southwest, ESM simulations and noble gas isotopes both suggest a pronounced LGT decline in water table depth in in response to decreasing precipitation, indicating distinct regional groundwater responses to climate.

Endothelial-specific knockdown of CLEC5A improved survival of CLP-challenged mice, which was completely ineffective with reexpression of endothelial CLEC5A.

Using ultracold gases, here, we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon- and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation.

By analyzing &gt;2000 canyons, we show that canyon occurrence correlates with the inclination of continental slopes. Onshore orogeny and associated surface processes, long considered key controls on canyon formation, play a subordinate role. Instead, our results suggest slope inclination as the primary control on submarine canyon density. Because continental slope morphology is fundamentally shaped by marine tectonic and thermal processes, these large-scale forces indirectly govern canyon formation and distribution globally. As a result, they influence the presence of pathways that facilitate the transfer of sediments, carbon, and nutrients to the deep ocean, with implications for biogeochemical cycles over geological timescales.",

Caspase-1–dependent tumor pyroptosis releases several inflammatory chemokines, converting αSMA + CAF into iCAFs in a CCR6-dependent manner. This is clinically relevant, as a fibroblast gene signature driven by iCAF markers and collagen type III is enriched in patients with chemoresistant bladder cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Contrary to the current notion, iCAFs, rather than myCAFs, produce collagen III in response to chemotherapy, supporting the expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs).

By irradiating with a single shot of a spatially shaped ultrashort laser pulse, the optical properties are momentarily changed on the picosecond scale, making the material considerably easier to machine by a successive laser pulse. The selective absorption of laser energy in regions with excited electrons leads to the rapid heating and evaporation of material at an extraordinarily high speed. Furthermore, the machining is achieved using a low-power light source, four orders of magnitude lower than conventional femtosecond lasers.

          "abstract": "Controlled doping of conjugated polymer-based semiconductors is crucial for optoelectronic applications. While p-type doping of conjugated polymers can be readily achieved with a variety of oxidants, n-type doping is more challenging, usually requiring highly reactive reducing agents. Here, we demonstrate that an air-stable photoredox catalyst (acridinium salt), together with a mild and air-stable reducing agent (amine), can effectively dope common n-type conjugated polymers under light at room temperature, yielding conductivity values on par with the highest obtained via other means. We elucidate the mechanism and show that this photoredox n-doping occurs via a one-photon–one-electron transfer process that is catalytic in nature. This simple and facile n-doping approach opens more avenues for doping organic semiconductors with the potential to revolutionize device design and substantially enhance doping efficiency.",

          "abstract": "Edholm’s law predicts exponential growth in data rate and spectrum bandwidth for communications. Owing to exponentially increasing deep neural network computing demands and the slowing of Moore’s law, new computing paradigms are required for future advanced communications like 6G. Optical neural networks (ONNs) are promising accelerators but struggle with scalability and system overhead. Here, we introduce our multiplicative analog frequency transform optical neural network (MAFT-ONN), an artificial intelligence hardware accelerator that experimentally computes fully analog deep learning on raw radio frequency (RF) signals, performing modulation classification that quickly converges to 95% accuracy. MAFT-ONN also exhibits scalability with nearly 4 million fully analog operations for MNIST digit classification. Because of the Shannon capacity–limited analog data movement, MAFT-ONN is also hundreds of times faster than traditional RF receivers.",

          "abstract": "Pacinian corpuscles are among the most sensitive mechanoreceptors found in vertebrates, and they are tuned to vibrations in the highest perceptible frequency range (100 to 2000 Hz). One of their anatomical hallmarks is the onion-like cell layers surrounding the central axon. The innermost layers consist of ~60 densely packed lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs), whose function remains largely unknown. Using high-resolution three-dimensional electron microscopy, we found that LSCs do not form concentric rings, but complex, multilayered, and intertwining assemblies that are connected via a high density of desmosomes and gap junctions. LSCs make multiple converging contacts with the afferent axon via desmosomes. Using optogenetic manipulations of LSCs, we demonstrate not only that their activation drives reliable time-locked spiking in the axon but also that their inactivation significantly elevates the thresholds in situ and increases perceptual thresholds behaviorally. Together, these findings provide evidence that LSCs are a key element of somatosensory processing, actively potentiating mechanosensitivity in Pacinian corpuscles.",

          "abstract": "Mercury compounds are potent neurotoxins that pose threats to human health, primarily through fish consumption. Rivers, critical for drinking water and food supply, have seen rapid increases in mercury concentrations and export to coastal margins since the Industrial Revolution (~1850). However, patterns of these changes remain understudied, limiting assessments of environmental policies. Here, we develop a global model to simulate preindustrial riverine total mercury and assess human perturbations by comparing it to present-day conditions. We find that global rivers transported ~390 megagrams annually of mercury to the oceans in the preindustrial era, with spatial variability. Human activities have elevated riverine mercury budgets by two to three times in the present day. Establishing a baseline riverine mercury level, our findings reveal rapid responses of riverine mercury to human perturbations and could be used to inform targets for global riverine mercury restoration. Total riverine mercury concentrations could also be used as indicators to comprehensively understand the effectiveness of mercury pollution governance.",

          "authors": "ZhongTing Zhang, Jian Luo, HengAn Wu, Hao Ma, YinBo Zhu",
          "abstract": "Amorphous carbons pose fundamental questions, including incomprehensible phase transformations, microtopology identification, and origins of anomalous properties. However, transition pathways from low-density, high-sp 2 structures to high-density, high-sp 3 forms remain poorly understood, within which thermodynamical behaviors are practically unexplored. Here, we investigated the phase transition and thermal transport properties of a recently reported amorphous carbon phase, amorphous diaphite (a-DG). The continuous transformation pathway of a-DG is characterized by distinctive heterogeneous microstructural evolutions across a wide density range. We observed anomalous thermal conductivities in a-DG, which initially decrease and then increase with the density and sp 3 /sp 2 ratio, deviating markedly from previously reported trends. This anomaly originates from changes in phonon mean free path and phonon lifetime at the medium-frequency range (7 to 30 terahertz), dictated by the unique two-stage microtopological transition. These findings challenge conventional views of thermal conductivity in amorphous carbons, and, in a wider context, our mechanistic understanding provides fundamental insights into phase transitions and thermodynamic mechanisms of other amorphous materials.",

Here, we construct a comprehensive spatiomolecular lipid atlas of the human kidney from 29 donor tissues using integrated multimodal molecular imaging. Our approach leverages high-spatial-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry for untargeted lipid mapping, stained microscopy for histopathological assessment, and tissue segmentation using autofluorescence microscopy. With a combination of unsupervised, supervised, and interpretable machine learning, the atlas provides multivariate lipid profiles of specific multicellular functional tissue units (FTUs) of the nephron, including the glomerulus, proximal tubules, thick ascending limb, distal tubules, and collecting ducts. In total, the atlas consists of tens of thousands of FTUs and millions of mass spectrometry measurements. Detailed patient, clinical, and histopathologic information allowed molecular data to be mined on the basis of these features. As examples, we highlight the discovery of how lipid profiles are altered with sex and differences in body mass index.",

          "abstract": "Oceanic mesoscale eddies play a crucial but underexplored role in regulating carbon fluxes and climate change. While they redistribute heat, salt, nutrients, and other tracers, their effects on CO 2 uptake remain uncertain. Using observation-based machine learning to estimate CO 2 fluxes throughout the lifetimes of thousands of eddies, we show that anticyclonic eddies substantially enhance CO 2 uptake on average, while cyclonic eddies marginally diminish it. This asymmetry yields an overall net increase in CO 2 absorption by 9.98 ± 2.28 and 13.82 ± 9.94% in the Kuroshio Extension and Gulf Stream, respectively, major carbon sequestration regions. The primary driver of this enhanced uptake is the downward pumping of dissolved inorganic carbon within anticyclonic eddies. Asymmetric biological responses between anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies contribute to the overall eddy-induced CO 2 flux imbalance. The finding suggests a potential underestimation of the ocean’s capacity for carbon sequestration because of insufficient incorporation of eddies in current observations, emphasizing the need for expanded monitoring in eddy-rich, undersampled regions.",
