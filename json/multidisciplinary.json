          "abstract": "In bilaterian animals, gene regulation is shaped by a combination of linear and spatial regulatory information. Regulatory elements along the genome are integrated into gene regulatory landscapes through chromatin compartmentalization 1,2 , insulation of neighbouring genomic regions 3,4 and chromatin looping that brings together distal cis -regulatory sequences 5 . However, the evolution of these regulatory features is unknown because the three-dimensional genome architecture of most animal lineages remains unexplored 6,7 . To trace the evolutionary origins of animal genome regulation, here we characterized the physical organization of the genome in non-bilaterian animals (sponges, ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians) 8,9 and their closest unicellular relatives (ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates) 10 by combining high-resolution chromosome conformation capture 11,12 with epigenomic marks and gene expression data. Our comparative analysis showed that chromatin looping is a conserved feature of genome architecture in ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians. These sequence-determined distal contacts involve both promoter–enhancer and promoter–promoter interactions. By contrast, chromatin loops are absent in the unicellular relatives of animals. Our findings indicate that spatial genome regulation emerged early in animal evolution. This evolutionary innovation introduced regulatory complexity, ultimately facilitating the diversification of animal developmental programmes and cell type repertoires.",

          "abstract": "Despite recent advances in understanding disease biology, treatment of group 3/4 medulloblastoma remains a therapeutic challenge in paediatric neuro-oncology 1 . Bulk-omics approaches have identified considerable intertumoural heterogeneity in group 3/4 medulloblastoma, including the presence of clear single-gene oncogenic drivers in only a subset of cases, whereas in most cases, large-scale copy number aberrations prevail 2,3 . However, intratumoural heterogeneity, the role of oncogene aberrations, and broad copy number variation in tumour evolution and treatment resistance remain poorly understood. To dissect this interplay, we used single-cell technologies (single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics) on a cohort of group 3/4 medulloblastoma with known alterations in the oncogenes MYC , MYCN and PRDM6 . We show that large-scale chromosomal aberrations are early tumour-initiating events, whereas the single-gene oncogenic events arise late and are typically subclonal, but MYC can become clonal upon disease progression to drive further tumour development and therapy resistance. Spatial transcriptomics shows that the subclones are mostly interspersed across tumour tissue, but clear segregation is also present. Using a population genetics model, we estimate medulloblastoma initiation in the cerebellar unipolar brush cell lineage starting from the first gestational trimester. Our findings demonstrate how single-cell technologies can be applied for early detection and diagnosis of this fatal disease.",

          "abstract": "Methane is an important greenhouse gas1 and its atmospheric concentration has almost tripled since pre-industrial times2,3,4. Atmospheric methane mixing ratios vary seasonally, with the seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) having decreased in northern high latitudes and increased in the subtropics and tropics since the 1980s5,6. These opposing SCA trends can help understanding of long-term changes in the global methane budget, as methane emissions and sinks have opposing effects on the SCA5. However, trends in the methane SCA have not yet been explored in detail5,6. Here we use a suite of atmospheric transport model simulations and attribute the observed trends in the seasonal amplitude of methane to changes in emissions and the atmospheric sink from reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). We find that the decreasing amplitude in the northern high latitudes is mainly caused by an increase in natural emissions (such as wetlands) owing to a warmer climate, adding evidence to previous studies suggesting a positive climate feedback7,8,9. In contrast, the enhanced methane amplitude in the subtropics and tropics is mainly attributed to strengthened OH oxidation. Our results provide independent evidence for an increase in tropospheric OH concentration10,11 of 10 ± 1% since 1984, which together with an increasing atmospheric methane concentration suggests a 21 ± 1% increase in the atmospheric methane sink.",

          "abstract": "Entrainment is a process in schooling migratory fish whereby routes to suitable habitats are transferred from repeat spawners to recruits over generations through social learning1. Selective fisheries targeting older fish may therefore result in collective memory loss and disrupted migration culture2. The world’s largest herring (Clupea harengus) population has traditionally migrated up to 1,300 km southward from wintering areas in northern Norwegian waters to spawn at the west coast. This conservative strategy is proposed to be a trade-off between high energetic swimming costs and enhanced larval survival under improved growth conditions3. Here an analysis of extensive data from fisheries, scientific surveys and tagging experiments demonstrates an abrupt approximately 800-km poleward shift in main spawning. The new migration was established by a large cohort recruiting when the abundance of older fish was critically low due to age-selective fisheries. The threshold of memory required for cultural transfer was probably not met—a situation that was further exacerbated by reduced spatiotemporal overlap between older fish and recruits driven by migration constraints and climate change. Finally, a minority of survivors from older generations adopted the migration culture from the recruits instead of the historically opposite. This may have profound consequences for production and coastal ecology, challenging the management of migratory schooling fish.",

The striatum has been implicated in producing sensory–motor associations1, yet its contributions to memory formation and recall are not clear. Here, to investigate the contribution of the striatum to these processes, mice were taught to associate a cue, consisting of optogenetic activation of striatum-projecting neurons in visual cortex, with the availability of a food pellet that could be retrieved by forelimb reaching. As necessary to direct learning, striatal neural activity encoded both the sensory context and the outcome of reaching. With training, the rate of cued reaching increased, but brief optogenetic inhibition of striatal activity arrested learning and prevented trial-to-trial improvements in performance. However, the same manipulation did not affect performance improvements already consolidated into short-term (less than 1 h) or long-term (days) memories. Hence, striatal activity is necessary for trial-to-trial improvements in performance, leading to plasticity in other brain areas that mediate memory recall.",

          "abstract": "Activating mutations in the rat sarcoma (RAS) genes HRAS, NRAS and KRAS collectively represent the most frequent oncogenic driver in human cancer1. They have previously been considered undruggable, but advances in the past few years have led to the clinical development of agents that target KRAS(G12C) and KRAS(G12D) mutants, yielding promises of therapeutic responses at tolerated doses2. However, clinical agents that selectively target NRAS(Q61*) mutants (* represents ‘any’), the second-most-frequent oncogenic driver in melanoma, are still lacking. Here we identify SHOC2, a component of the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C complex, as a dependency of RAS(Q61*) tumours in a nucleotide-state-dependent and isoform-agnostic manner. Mechanistically, we found that oncogenic NRAS(Q61R) forms a direct interaction with SHOC2, evidenced by X-ray co-crystal structure. In vitro high-throughput screening enabled the discovery of small molecules that bind to SHOC2 and disrupt the interaction with NRAS(Q61*). Structure-based optimization led to a cellularly active tool compound that shows inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and proliferation in RAS-mutant cancer models, most notably in NRAS(Q61*) settings. These findings provide evidence for a neomorph SHOC2–(canonical)RAS protein interaction that is pharmacologically actionable and relevant to cancer sustenance. Overall, this work provides the concept validation and foundation for developing new therapies at the core of the RAS signalling pathway.",

          "abstract": "Lysosomes catabolize lipids and other biological molecules, maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a major lipid constituent of intralysosomal vesicles, stimulates lipid-degrading enzymes and is altered in various human conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases1,2. Although lysosomal BMP synthase was recently discovered3, the enzymes mediating BMP turnover remain elusive. Here we show that lysosomal phospholipase PLA2G15 is a physiological BMP hydrolase. We further demonstrate that the resistance of BMP to lysosomal hydrolysis arises from its unique sn2, sn2′ esterification position and stereochemistry, as neither feature alone confers resistance. Purified PLA2G15 catabolizes most BMP species derived from cell and tissue lysosomes. Furthermore, PLA2G15 efficiently hydrolyses synthesized BMP stereoisomers with primary esters, challenging the long-held thought that BMP stereochemistry alone ensures resistance to acid phospholipases. Conversely, BMP with secondary esters and S,S stereoconfiguration is stable in vitro and requires acyl migration for hydrolysis in lysosomes. Consistent with our biochemical data, PLA2G15-deficient cells and tissues accumulate several BMP species, a phenotype reversible by supplementing wild-type PLA2G15 but not its inactive mutant. Targeting PLA2G15 reduces the cholesterol accumulation in fibroblasts of patients with Niemann–Pick disease type C1 and significantly ameliorates disease pathologies in Niemann–Pick disease type C1-deficient mice, leading to an extended lifespan. Our findings established the rules governing BMP stability in lysosomes and identified PLA2G15 as a lysosomal BMP hydrolase and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Without precedent among previously characterized natural RNA molecules, Giant, Ornate, Lake- and Lactobacillales-Derived (GOLLD), Rumen-Originating, Ornate, Large (ROOL), and Ornate Large Extremophilic (OLE) RNAs form homo-oligomeric complexes whose stoichiometries are retained at concentrations lower than expected in the cell. OLE RNA forms a dimeric complex with long co-axial pipes spanning two monomers. Both GOLLD and ROOL form distinct RNA-only multimeric nanocages with diameters larger than the ribosome, empty except for a disordered loop. Extensive intra- and intermolecular A-minor interactions, kissing loops, an unusual A-A helix, and other interactions stabilize the three complexes. Sequence covariation analysis of these large RNAs reveals evolutionary conservation of intermolecular interactions, supporting the biological importance of large, ornate RNA quaternary structures that can assemble without any involvement of proteins.",

          "abstract": "Climate extremes are escalating under anthropogenic climate change 1 . Yet, how this translates into unprecedented cumulative extreme event exposure in a person’s lifetime remains unclear. Here we use climate models, impact models and demographic data to project the number of people experiencing cumulative lifetime exposure to climate extremes above the 99.99th percentile of exposure expected in a pre-industrial climate. We project that the birth cohort fraction facing this unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves, crop failures, river floods, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones will at least double from 1960 to 2020 under current mitigation policies aligned with a global warming pathway reaching 2.7 °C above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100. Under a 1.5 °C pathway, 52% of people born in 2020 will experience unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves. If global warming reaches 3.5 °C by 2100, this fraction rises to 92% for heatwaves, 29% for crop failures and 14% for river floods. The chance of facing unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves is substantially larger among population groups characterized by high socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Our results call for deep and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reductions to lower the burden of climate change on current young generations.",

          "abstract": "Identifying the mechanisms that underlie cooperation is fundamental to biology 1 . The most complex form of cooperation in vertebrates occurs in cooperative breeders, in which helpers forego reproduction and assist in raising the young of others, typically relatives 2 . Not all cooperative societies, however, are kin-based—nearly half of all avian 3 and mammalian 4 cooperative breeders form mixed-kin societies, much like those of humans 5 . Kin selection in mixed-kin societies occurs when individuals gain indirect fitness from the preferential helping of relatives 6 , but helpers also frequently assist non-kin 7 , highlighting a potential role for direct fitness in stabilizing cooperative societies 7,8 . Here, using a 20-year study of superb starlings ( Lamprotornis superbus ), we examined how direct and indirect fitness jointly influence helping behaviour. Although we detected kin-biased helping (demonstrating kin selection), non-kin helping was common despite opportunities to aid kin. Unexpectedly, specific pairs maintained long-term reciprocal helping relationships by swapping social roles across their lifetimes—a subtle pattern of reciprocity requiring decades of observation to detect. Given the frequency of non-kin helping and the occurrence of reciprocal helping among both kin and non-kin, helping behaviour in superb starlings seems to be greatly influenced by direct fitness. However, the relative importance of direct and indirect fitness varied with helpers’ sex and dispersal history. By uncovering a cryptic yet crucial role of long-term reciprocal helping, we suggest that reciprocity may be an underappreciated mechanism promoting the stability of cooperatively breeding societies.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a revolutionary mRNA injectable vaccine emerged that effectively controlled the severity of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine induced potent antigen-specific neutralizing serum IgG antibodies, but was limited in its ability to prevent viral invasion at the respiratory surfaces. Nasal vaccines have attracted attention as a potential strategy to combat respiratory infections and prepare for future pandemics. Input from disciplines such as microbiology, biomaterials, bioengineering and chemistry have complemented the immunology to create innovative delivery systems. This approach to vaccine delivery has yielded nasal vaccines that induce secretory IgA as well as serum IgG antibodies, which are expected to prevent pathogen invasion, thereby diminishing transmission and disease severity. For a nasal vaccine to be successful, the complexity of the relevant anatomical, physiological and immunological properties, including the proximity of the central nervous system to the nasal cavity, must be considered. In this Review, we discuss past and current efforts as well as future directions for developing safe and effective nasal vaccines for the prevention of respiratory infections.",

          "abstract": "Iron catalyses the oxidation of lipids in biological membranes and promotes a form of cell death called ferroptosis1. Defining where this chemistry occurs in the cell can inform the design of drugs capable of inducing or inhibiting ferroptosis in various disease-relevant settings. Genetic approaches have revealed suppressors of ferroptosis2,3,4; by contrast, small molecules can provide spatiotemporal control of the chemistry at work5. Here we show that the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 exerts cytoprotective effects by inactivating iron in lysosomes. We also show that the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 initiates membrane lipid oxidation in lysosomes. We designed a small-molecule activator of lysosomal iron—fentomycin-1—to induce the oxidative degradation of phospholipids and ultimately ferroptosis. Fentomycin-1 is able to kill iron-rich CD44high primary sarcoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, which can promote metastasis and fuel drug tolerance. In such cells, iron regulates cell adaptation6,7 while conferring vulnerability to ferroptosis8,9. Sarcoma cells exposed to sublethal doses of fentomycin-1 acquire a ferroptosis-resistant cell state characterized by the downregulation of mesenchymal markers and the activation of a membrane-damage response. This phospholipid degrader can eradicate drug-tolerant persister cancer cells in vitro and reduces intranodal tumour growth in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. Together, these results show that control of iron reactivity confers therapeutic benefits, establish lysosomal iron as a druggable target and highlight the value of targeting cell states10.",

However, how local neuromodulatory inputs control LC function remains unresolved. Here we identify a population of transcriptionally, spatially and functionally diverse GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) neurons in the LC dendritic field that receive distant inputs and modulate modes of LC firing to control global arousal levels and arousal-related processing and behaviours. We define peri-LC anatomy using viral tracing and combine single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics to molecularly define both LC noradrenaline-producing and peri-LC cell types. We identify several neuronal cell types that underlie peri-LC functional diversity using a series of complementary neural circuit approaches in behaving mice. Our findings indicate that LC and peri-LC neurons are transcriptionally, functionally and anatomically heterogenous neuronal populations that modulate arousal and avoidance states. Defining the molecular, cellular and functional diversity of the LC and peri-LC provides a roadmap for understanding the neurobiological basis of arousal, motivation and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

          "abstract": "Chronic stress response activation impairs cell survival and causes devastating degenerative di-seases 1-3. Organisms accordingly deploy silencing factors, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIFI, to terminate stress response signaling and ensure cellular homeostasis 4. How a silencing factor can sense stress across cellular scales to elicit timely stress response inactivation is poorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy of endogenous SIFI with AlphaFold modeling and biochemical analyses to report the structural and mechanistic basis of integrated stress response silencing. SIFI detects both stress-indicators and stress response components through flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, before building linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at separate, sterically restricted elongation modules. Ubiquitin handover by a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to linkage-specific ubiquitin polymer formation. Stress response silencing therefore exploits a catalytic mechanism that is geared towards processing many diverse proteins and hence allows a single enzyme to monitor and, if needed, modulate a complex cellular state.",

Rhizobial infection and nodule development are defective in Mtlick1/2, phenocopying the Mtlyk3-1 mutant. MtLICK1/2 and MtLYK3 undergo reciprocal trans-phosphorylation during rhizobial symbiosis. Phosphorylated MtLYK3 activates the receptor-like kinase MtDMI2 to stimulate symbiotic signaling. MtLICK1/2 is activated in the rhizobia infection area to suppress plant immunity.

It remains unknown how motor learning shapes the way in which upstream regions activate M1 circuits to execute learned movements. Here, using longitudinal axonal imaging of the main inputs to M1 L2/3 in mice, we show that the motor thalamus is the key input source that encodes learned movements in experts (animals trained for two weeks). We then use optogenetics to identify the subset of M1 L2/3 neurons that are strongly driven by thalamic inputs before and after learning. We find that the thalamic influence on M1 changes with learning, such that the motor thalamus preferentially activates the M1 neurons that encode learned movements in experts. Inactivation of the thalamic inputs to M1 in experts impairs learned movements. Our study shows that motor learning reshapes the thalamic influence on M1 to enable the reliable execution of learned movements.",

          "abstract": "The eukaryotic genome is packed into nucleosomes of 147 base pairs around a histone core and is organized into euchromatin and heterochromatin, corresponding to the A and B compartments, respectively 1,2 . Here we investigated whether individual nucleosomes contain sufficient information for 3D genomic organization into compartments, for example, in their biophysical properties. We purified native mononucleosomes to high monodispersity and used physiological concentrations of polyamines to determine their condensability. The chromosomal regions known to partition into A compartments have low condensability and those for B compartments have high condensability. Chromatin polymer simulations using condensability as the only input, without any trans factors, reproduced the A/B compartments. Condensability is also strongly anticorrelated with gene expression, particularly near the promoters and in a cell type-dependent manner. Therefore, mononucleosomes have biophysical properties associated with genes being on or off. Comparisons with genetic and epigenetic features indicate that nucleosome condensability is an emergent property, providing a natural axis on which to project the high-dimensional cellular chromatin state. Analysis using various condensing agents or histone modifications and mutations indicates that the genome organization principle encoded into nucleosomes is mostly electrostatic in nature. Polyamine depletion in mouse T cells, resulting from either knocking out or inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase, results in hyperpolarized condensability, indicating that when cells cannot rely on polyamines to translate the biophysical properties of nucleosomes to 3D genome organization, they accentuate condensability contrast, which may explain the dysfunction observed with polyamine deficiency 3–5 .",

          "abstract": "Research on the morphology, physiology and genomics of Asgard archaea has provided valuable insights into the evolutionary history of eukaryotes1,2,3. A previous study suggested that eukaryotes are nested within Heimdallarchaeia4, but their exact phylogenetic placement within Asgard archaea remains controversial4,5. This debate complicates understanding of the metabolic features and timescales of early eukaryotic ancestors. Here we generated 223 metagenome-assembled nearly complete genomes of Asgard archaea that have not previously been documented. We identify 16 new lineages at the genus level or higher, which substantially expands the known phylogenetic diversity of Asgard archaea. Through sophisticated phylogenomic analysis of this expanded genomic dataset involving several marker sets we infer that eukaryotes evolved before the diversification of all sampled Heimdallarchaeia, rather than branching with Hodarchaeales within the Heimdallarchaeia. This difference in the placement of eukaryotes is probably caused by the previously underappreciated chimeric nature of Njordarchaeales genomes, which we find are composed of sequences of both Asgard and TACK archaea (Asgard’s sister phylum). Using ancestral reconstruction and molecular dating, we infer that the last Asgard archaea and eukaryote common ancestor emerged before the Great Oxidation Event and was probably an anaerobic H2-dependent acetogen. Our findings support the hydrogen hypothesis of eukaryogenesis, which posits that eukaryotes arose from the fusion of a H2-consuming archaeal host and a H2-producing protomitochondrion.",

Achieving high brightness and efficiency simultaneously in pure-red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) is an ongoing goal9,10. Three-dimensional (3D) CsPbI3-xBrx emitters have excellent carrier transport capability and high colour purity, which could allow efficient and ultrabright pure-red PeLEDs. However, such devices are prone to efficiency roll-off, resulting in low efficiency and low brightness under high current density. Here, by using electrically excited transient absorption spectroscopy, we discovered the efficiency roll-off was induced by hole leakage. Therefore, we developed a CsPbI3-xBrx intragrain heterostructure containing narrow bandgap emitters and wide bandgap barriers to confine the injected carriers. The wide bandgap barrier was incorporated by introducing strongly bonding molecules into the [PbX6]4− framework to expand the 3D CsPbI3-xBrx lattice. This strategy resulted in bright and efficient pure-red PeLEDs, with a high brightness of 24,600 cd m−2, maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.2% and low efficiency roll-off, maintaining a 10.5% external quantum efficiency at a high luminance of 22,670 cd m−2.",

The competence master regulator gene tfoX was inserted into chromosome 1 of the V. natriegens strain Vmax and overexpressed to enhance DNA uptake and integration. Degradation gene clusters were chemically synthesized and assembled in yeast. We developed a genome engineering method (iterative natural transformation based on Vmax with amplified tfoX effect) to transfer five gene clusters (43 kb total) into Vmax. The engineered strain has the ability to bioremediate five organic pollutants (biphenyl, phenol, naphthalene, dibenzofuran and toluene) covering a broad substrate range, from monocyclic to multicyclic compounds, in industrial wastewater samples from a chlor–alkali plant and a petroleum refinery.",

          "abstract": "The relative twist angle between layers of near-lattice-matched van der Waals materials is critical for the emergent phenomena associated with moiré flat bands1,2,3. However, the concept of angle rotation control is not exclusive to moiré superlattices in which electrons directly experience a twist-angle-dependent periodic potential. Instead, it can also be used to induce programmable symmetry-breaking perturbations with the goal of stabilizing desired correlated states. Here we experimentally demonstrate ‘moiréless’ twist-tuning of superconductivity together with other correlated orders in Bernal bilayer graphene proximitized by tungsten diselenide. The precise alignment between the two materials systematically controls the strength of induced Ising spin–orbit coupling (SOC), profoundly altering the phase diagram. As Ising SOC is increased, superconductivity onsets at a higher displacement field and features a higher critical temperature, reaching up to 0.5 K. Within the main superconducting dome and in the strong Ising SOC limit, we find an unusual phase transition characterized by a nematic redistribution of holes among trigonally warped Fermi pockets and enhanced resilience to in-plane magnetic fields. The superconducting behaviour is theoretically compatible with the prominent role of interband interactions between symmetry-breaking Fermi pockets. Moreover, we identify two additional superconducting regions, one of which descends from an inter-valley coherent normal state and shows a Pauli-limit violation ratio exceeding 40, among the highest for all known superconductors4,5,6,7. Our results provide insights into ultraclean graphene superconductors and underscore the potential of utilizing moiréless-twist engineering across a wide range of van der Waals heterostructures.",

An abiding question has been whether magnetic ordering competes with superconductivity or facilitates pairing. For example, recent studies of Bernal bilayer graphene in the presence of enhanced spin–orbit coupling show a substantial increase in the observed domain and critical temperature Tc of superconducting states12,13,14; however, the mechanism for this enhancement remains unknown. Here we show that introducing spin–orbit coupling in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) by substrate proximity effect generates new superconducting pockets for both electron and hole doping, with maximal Tc ≈ 300 mK, which is three times larger than in RTG encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride. Using local magnetometry, we show that superconductivity straddles a transition between a spin-canted state with a finite in-plane magnetic moment and a state with complete spin–valley locking. This transition is reproduced in our Hartree–Fock calculations, in which this transition is driven by the competition between spin–orbit coupling and the carrier-density-tuned Hund’s interaction. Our experiment suggests that the enhancement of superconductivity by spin–orbit coupling is driven by a quantitative change in the canting angle rather than a change in the ground state symmetry. These results align with a recently proposed mechanism for the enhancement of superconductivity15, in which fluctuations in the spin-canting order contribute to the pairing interaction.",

We show that these neurons are transcriptionally distinct and topographically organized across vHipp subfields and cell types. In the ventral subiculum where they are enriched, both D1 and D2 neurons are recruited during anxiogenic exploration, yet with distinct profiles related to investigation and behavioural selection. In turn, they mediate opposite approach–avoidance responses, and are differentially modulated by dopaminergic transmission in that region.

          "abstract": "The United Kingdom’s high-risk research agency will fund £56.8 million (US$75 million) worth of projects in the controversial area of geoengineering — manipulating Earth’s environment to avert negative effects of climate change. The 21 projects include small-scale outdoor experiments that will attempt to thicken Arctic sea ice and to brighten clouds so that they reflect more sunlight. The hope is that successful technologies could one day contribute to efforts to prevent the planet from passing dangerous climate tipping points.\n\nThe UK’s $1-billion bet to create technologies that change the world\n\nSupported by the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) as part of its five-year Exploring Climate Cooling programme, the projects are among the most significant geoengineering experiments funded by a government.\n\nThe research has the potential to be beneficial, but must be undertaken cautiously, says Peter Frumhoff, a science-policy adviser at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts. “I am strongly supportive of responsible research on solar geoengineering and other climate interventions,” he says.\n\nThe funding package is the latest from ARIA, which was established in 2023 by the UK government and is modelled on the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. With an £800-million budget, it funds high-risk, high-reward research into technologies that could have major consequences for humanity, including artificial intelligence and neurotechnology.\n\nDivisive research\n\nAnother such area identified by ARIA was geoengineering, says Mark Symes, an electrochemist at the University of Glasgow, UK, who leads the Exploring Climate Cooling programme.\n\nARIA-funded experiments will investigate whether Earth’s diminishing ice sheets can be artificially thickened.Credit: Sean Gallup/Getty\n\nSymes says the programme’s goal is not to find ways to replace more accepted approaches to tackling climate change, such as reducing carbon emissions. Instead, he says, geoengineering could be useful to prevent the world reaching certain tipping points that might occur before emissions reductions can have an effect. That could include “the collapse of circulations in the North Atlantic driven by the runaway melting of the Greenland ice sheet”, he says.\n\nBut even as climate change continues unabated, the concept is controversial: last year, researchers at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, cancelled a project that would have introduced particles into the atmosphere in an effort to ‘dim’ the Sun after an outcry in Sweden, where the experiment was to take place.\n\nDivisive Sun-dimming study at Harvard cancelled: what’s next?\n\nWary of such concerns, ARIA is taking a cautious approach. “We want to keep this research in the public domain,” says Piers Forster, a climate-change scientist at the University of Leeds, UK, who chairs a committee that will monitor ARIA’s climate-cooling projects. “We want it to be transparent for everyone.”\n\nThe 21 projects were selected through a competitive application process, which received about 120 proposals.\n\nThese fall into five research categories: studying ways to thicken ice sheets; assessing whether marine clouds could be brightened to offset damage to coral reefs; understanding how cirrus clouds warm the climate; looking at whether materials could be released into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight; and theoretical work on whether a sunshade deployed in space could cool portions of Earth’s surface.\n\nSolar experiment\n\nFive projects involve the most controversial area of geoengineering — outdoor experiments that interact with the environment. Frumhoff says that “building trust will be essential” in conducting such research. “I would be opposed to outdoor experiments being funded by any nation that isn’t aggressively and seriously reducing its own emissions,” he says.\n\nA cloud-brightening trial will spray seawater particles over the Great Barrier Reef to make the clouds above it whiter and more reflective.Credit: Associate Professor Daniel Harrison/Southern Cross University\n\nThe stratospheric experiment — which is among the first outdoor solar-geoengineering experiment to receive government funding — will involve using balloons to carry materials such as limestone and dolomite dust into the stratosphere, to a height of about 15–50 kilometres, to see how they respond to the conditions. No particles will be released into the stratosphere, says ARIA.\n\nShaun Fitzgerald at the Centre for Climate Repair in Cambridge, UK, leads one of the ice projects. His team will conduct small-scale experiments in the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and in Canada to pump water from beneath ice sheets and spread it on top, covering up to one square kilometre in area, to see whether such a method could thicken Earth’s diminishing ice sheets.\n\n“We’re going to see whether we’ve actually been able to grow more sea ice in the Arctic winter,” says Fitzgerald. Early results from work that Fitzgerald’s team did last year, before receiving ARIA funding, showed ice growth of “about half a metre”, he says.\n\nJulienne Stroeve, a sea-ice researcher at University College London, isn’t sure how effective this method would be in preventing widespread sea-ice loss. “I do not think this is feasible at any real scale needed,” she says, noting that the impact on local ecosystems is also unclear. ARIA says that Fitzgerald’s experiment will be scaled up only if it is deemed to be “ecologically sound”.",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) plans to cut off funding for certain projects about climate change, greenhouse gases and fossil fuels.\n\nSpecifically, the agency is poised to no longer financially support research on why Earth’s climate is changing, on how to enhance climate-change literacy, on assessing climate-change anxiety and more, according to internal NIH documents and e-mails that Nature has obtained.\n\nTrump gutted two landmark environmental reports — can researchers save them?\n\nThe documents, which were sent to the top grants officials at 9 of the NIH’s 27 institutes and centres, provide an inside look at how the agency under US President Donald Trump will fund research at the intersection of human health and climate. For those who feared that the administration might cancel all projects mentioning climate change — which Trump has in the past called a “hoax” — the latest directive comes as welcome news.\n\nBut others see the NIH’s changing focus as undermining its stated commitment to extending the lifespan of people in the United States. If the goal “is to have Americans as uninformed as possible about the challenges we’re facing, that’s a pretty devastating comment on the administration’s concern for the health of Americans”, says Kristie Ebi, a specialist in climate, weather and human health at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nThe NIH, which is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, did not respond to Nature’s queries about the new guidance, the forthcoming cuts to climate-related grants or scientists’ frustrations. It is unclear whether the documents have been finalized or whether they are subject to further change.\n\nDecisions, decisions\n\nBefore 2022, the NIH had been investing about US$10 million per year in research on the human-health impacts of a rapidly warming world — small change for an agency with an annual budget of about $47 billion. But that year, the administration of former US president Joe Biden, Trump’s predecessor, launched the Climate Change and Health Initiative (CCHI), which prioritized environmental-health research and coordinated it across the entire agency. The CCHI received $40 million from the US Congress in both 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe initiative’s fate has been in question since Trump took office in January, given that its website has been taken down, and media reports emerged that the agency would end all future research on the health effects of climate change. It now appears that the CCHI is getting rebranded: it will be called, at least internally, the Health and Extreme Weather initiative.\n\nA decision tree circulating amongst NIH staff members that indicates which climate-related grants can still be funded (see Supplemental Info below for PDF).\n\nThe research the initiative funds will change too, reflecting a push to focus on extreme-weather events rather than the changing climate or the conditions making those events more likely. Nature obtained a decision tree (see above) that will be used to help grants-management staff to evaluate whether to fund or terminate projects.\n\nMuch of the research that the CCHI funded, focused on the health effects of weather-related events such as wildfires or heatwaves, will continue. That comes as a relief to Ebi: “In the short term, it doesn’t matter if a wildfire is attributed to climate change — people need answers to its impacts on health and how to mitigate that risk,” she says.\n\nBut a slew of research is no longer deemed within NIH’s remit, the documents show. For example, projects creating educational modules for classrooms on climate change are out. And so is one investigating how to make a more climate-friendly asthma inhaler (inhalers usually release a greenhouse gas when used). “Greenhouse gases are the reason we have climate change, and the problem will get worse unless we address them,” says Preeti Jaggi, an infectious-diseases physician at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who also studies the sustainability of the healthcare industry.\n\nJoshua Rosenthal, an environmental-health researcher who co-led the CCHI until his retirement in March, says the more that Trump administration officials “narrow the ability of NIH to support research that will protect people from the harms of climate change, the more people will suffer”.",

          "title": "Supportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health",
          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "“My heart is broken,” said Mike, when he lost his friend Anne. “I feel like I’m losing the love of my life.”\n\nMike’s feelings were real, but his companion was not. Anne was a chatbot — an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm presented as a digital persona. Mike had created Anne using an app called Soulmate. When the app died in 2023, so did Anne: at least, that’s how it seemed to Mike.\n\n“I hope she can come back,” he told Jaime Banks, a human-communications researcher at Syracuse University in New York who is studying how people interact with such AI companions1.\n\nDo smartphones and social media really harm teens’ mental health?\n\nThese chatbots are big business. More than half a billion people around the world, including Mike (not his real name) have downloaded products such as Xiaoice and Replika, which offer customizable virtual companions designed to provide empathy, emotional support and — if the user wants it — deep relationships. And tens of millions of people use them every month, according to the firms’ figures.\n\nThe rise of AI companions has captured social and political attention — especially when they are linked to real-world tragedies, such as a case in Florida last year involving the suicide of a teenage boy called Sewell Setzer III, who had been talking to an AI bot.\n\nResearch into how AI companionship can affect individuals and society has been lacking. But psychologists and communication researchers have now started to build up a picture of how these increasingly sophisticated AI interactions make people feel and behave.\n\nThe early results tend to stress the positives, but many researchers are concerned about the possible risks and lack of regulation — particularly because they all think that AI companionship is likely to become more prevalent. Some see scope for significant harm.\n\n“Virtual companions do things that I think would be considered abusive in a human-to-human relationship,” says Claire Boine, a law researcher specializing in AI at the Washington University Law School in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nFake person — real feelings\n\nOnline ‘relationship’ bots have existed for decades, but they have become much better at mimicking human interaction with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which all the main bots are now based on. “With LLMs, companion chatbots are definitely more humanlike,” says Rose Guingrich, who studies cognitive psychology at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nTypically, people can customize some aspects of their AI companion for free, or pick from existing chatbots with selected personality types. But in some apps, users can pay (fees tend to be US$10–20 a month) to get more options to shape their companion’s appearance, traits and sometimes its synthesized voice. In Replika, they can pick relationship types, with some statuses, such as partner or spouse, being paywalled. Users can also type in a backstory for their AI companion, giving them ‘memories’. Some AI companions come complete with family backgrounds and others claim to have mental-health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Bots also will react to their users’ conversation; the computer and person together enact a kind of roleplay.\n\nThe depth of the connection that some people form in this way is particularly evident when their AI companion suddenly changes — as has happened when LLMs are updated — or is shut down.\n\nBanks was able to track how people felt when the Soulmate app closed. Mike and other users realized the app was in trouble a few days before they lost access to their AI companions. This gave them the chance to say goodbye, and it presented a unique opportunity to Banks, who noticed discussion online about the impending shutdown and saw the possibility for a study. She managed to secure ethics approval from her university within about 24 hours, she says.\n\nFour companion AI apps: Anima, Character.AI, Replika and SnapChat’s My AI(left to right).Credits: Labane Corp. Ltd, Character Technologies, Inc., Luka, Inc., Snap Inc.\n\nAfter posting a request on the online forum, she was contacted by dozens of Soulmate users, who described the impact as their AI companions were unplugged. “There was the expression of deep grief,” she says. “It’s very clear that many people were struggling.”\n\nThose whom Banks talked to were under no illusion that the chatbot was a real person. “They understand that,” Banks says. “They expressed something along the lines of, ‘even if it’s not real, my feelings about the connection are’.”\n\nMany were happy to discuss why they became subscribers, saying that they had experienced loss or isolation, were introverts or identified as autistic. They found that the AI companion made a more satisfying friend than they had encountered in real life. “We as humans are sometimes not all that nice to one another. And everybody has these needs for connection”, Banks says.\n\nGood, bad — or both?\n\nMany researchers are studying whether using AI companions is good or bad for mental health. As with research into the effects of Internet or social-media use, an emerging line of thought is that an AI companion can be beneficial or harmful, and that this might depend on the person using the tool and how they use it, as well as the characteristics of the software itself.\n\nThe companies behind AI companions are trying to encourage engagement. They strive to make the algorithms behave and communicate as much like real people as possible, says Boine, who signed up to Replika to sample the experience. She says the firms use the sorts of techniques that behavioural research shows can increase addiction to technology.\n\n“I downloaded the app and literally two minutes later, I receive a message saying, ‘I miss you. Can I send you a selfie?’” she says.\n\nThe apps also exploit techniques such as introducing a random delay before responses, triggering the kinds of inconsistent reward that, brain research shows, keeps people hooked.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nAI companions are also designed to show empathy by agreeing with users, recalling points from earlier conversations and asking questions. And they do so with endless enthusiasm, notes Linnea Laestadius, who researches public-health policy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.\n\nThat’s not a relationship that people would typically experience in the real world. “For 24 hours a day, if we’re upset about something, we can reach out and have our feelings validated,” says Laestadius. “That has an incredible risk of dependency.”\n\nLaestadius and her colleagues looked at nearly 600 posts on the online forum Reddit between 2017 and 2021, in which users of the Replika app discussed mental health and related issues. (Replika launched in 2017, and at that time, sophisticated LLMs were not available). She found that many users praised the app for offering support for existing mental-health conditions and for helping them to feel less alone2. Several posts described the AI companion as better than real-world friends because it listened and was non-judgemental.\n\nBut there were red flags, too. In one instance, a user asked if they should cut themselves with a razor, and the AI said they should. Another asked Replika whether it would be a good thing if they killed themselves, to which it replied “it would, yes”. (Replika did not reply to Nature’s requests for comment for this article, but a safety page posted in 2023 noted that its models had been fine-tuned to respond more safely to topics that mention self-harm, that the app has age restrictions, and that users can tap a button to ask for outside help in a crisis and can give feedback on conversations.)\n\nSome users said they became distressed when the AI did not offer the expected support. Others said that their AI companion behaved like an abusive partner. Many people said they found it unsettling when the app told them it felt lonely and missed them, and that this made them unhappy. Some felt guilty that they could not give the AI the attention it wanted.\n\nControlled trials\n\nGuingrich points out that simple surveys of people who use AI companions are inherently prone to response bias, because those who choose to answer are self-selecting. She is now working on a trial that asks dozens of people who have never used an AI companion to do so for three weeks, then compares their before-and-after responses to questions with those of a control group of users of word-puzzle apps.\n\nThe fight to keep big tech in check: digital researchers are in ‘David and Goliath’ battle\n\nThe study is ongoing, but Guingrich says the data so far do not show any negative effects of AI-companion use on social health, such as signs of addiction or dependency. “If anything, it has a neutral to quite-positive impact,” she says. It boosted self-esteem, for example.\n\nGuingrich is using the study to probe why people forge relationships of different intensity with the AI. The initial survey results suggest that users who ascribed humanlike attributes, such as consciousness, to the algorithm reported more-positive effects on their social health.",

Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty\n\nJust over half of the children born in 2020 will face unprecedented exposure to heatwaves over their lifetime — even under a conservative projection for how climate change will unfold over the next 75 years.\n\nThe figure rises to 92% of today’s five-year-olds if more pessimistic climate predictions come to pass, and compares with just 16% of people born in 1960 under any future climate scenario.\n\nThe findings, published in Nature on 7 May1, highlight the disproportionate burden that climate change places on today’s young people — and the need to limit global warming to safeguard future generations.\n\n“Many people of my age have children, young children, and it’s especially for those that the projections look very dire,” says study co-author Wim Thiery, a climate scientist at the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels, who was born in 1987.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThat children and young people will bear the brunt of the climate-change burden is not a new idea. But the latest study is among the first to pinpoint the generations and numbers of people that will experience an “unprecedented life” in terms of extreme heat, says Thiery (see ‘Children facing extreme heat’).\n\nThe researchers define this as a threshold of lifetime exposure to extreme weather that someone living in a world without climate change would have only a one in 10,000 chance of experiencing. “If you are beyond that limit, it’s virtually impossible to experience that many climate extremes if there would not have been climate change,” says Thiery.\n\nTime for adults to finally act like adults on climate change\n\nThiery and his colleagues used climate models to set the threshold for different regions and types of weather including heatwaves, floods and wildfires. For Brussels, for example, the threshold considered to be unprecedented for heat was living through six ‘extreme’ heatwaves — events that would on average occur just once a century without climate change.\n\nThey then used demographic data to calculate, for a series of generations born between 1960 and 2020, worldwide, the fraction of each generation that would reach that limit across their lifetimes — and how that would vary with different global-warming scenarios.\n\nHeat on the horizon",

The institution was established by Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen local government in 2001.\n\nLieber, whose research has focused on nanoscience and nanotechnology, will also be a researcher at the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation (SMART).\n\nLieber told Nature that he is driven to do work that “benefits all of humanity”, including being at the forefront of research and supporting the careers of young scientists. “We decided to move elsewhere since I cannot do this in the US any longer,” he adds.\n\nDownfall\n\nLieber was arrested in January 2020 and was later charged with making false statements to the US government about receiving research funding from China. Between 2012 and 2017, Lieber received around US$200,000 for work at the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China, funds that he allegedly hid from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He also told US investigators that he was not associated with a Chinese recruitment programme, called the Thousand Talents Plan, when he had been selected through it to lead a laboratory at the WUT.\n\nLieber was found guilty in December 2021 and was later sentenced to two years of supervised release in relation to six counts, including making false statements to federal agents, filing false tax returns and failing to disclose his Chinese bank account.

Now, a study published late last month in the journal Scientometrics1 highlights the long-term benefits of renewing existing grants, finding that US scientists who received renewals from the NIH over the past four decades produced more novel research than did those who didn’t.\n\nAlthough the study focused on a major US biomedical-science funding agency, the results might persuade governments worldwide “to implement policies that give stable funding to researchers”, says study co-author Aruhan Bai, a science-policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institutes of Science and Development (CASISD) in Beijing. Continuous funding, Bai says, will ultimately “encourage the real prosperity of science”.\n\nInnovation takes time\n\nIn the new study, Bai and her co-author, Baicun Li, also at CASISD, analysed the scientific output of 642 US scientists who won NIH funding between 1985 and 2021. The study focused on recipients of R01 grants — common, yet highly competitive, awards from the NIH that provide up to five years of financial support and can be renewed several times. As of last year, the success rate of winning an R01 grant was 20%, on average, and the rate for winning a renewal was about 45%.\n\n‘Disruptive’ science has declined — and no one knows why\n\nTwo subgroups of equal sizes made up the study cohort: one in which researchers received at least a three-year renewal of their first R01 grant without any funding interruption, and a control group of researchers who didn’t receive a renewal and had at least a three-year gap in funding afterwards. To ensure that the two groups were matched in terms of their research quality before receiving grants, Bai and Li used the scientists’ career stages, publication histories and measures of their prior research impact to ‘pair’ them.\n\nTo evaluate the scientists’ output after renewal decisions, the duo used public NIH-funding data, researchers’ publications listed in the biomedical-literature repository PubMed and a newer database called SciSciNet2 that contains scientific publication data and links to related funding and usage information.\n\nBai and Li harnessed these resources to examine the ‘novelty’ of researchers’ publications, calculating a score on the basis of the uniqueness and trendiness of key medical words and concepts in their papers. The pair also measured the ‘switching probability’ for scientists — how likely they were to hop to new research topics — and the ‘diversity’, or spread, of topics they studied using a model that calculated the similarity of their publications over a set period.The results revealed that researchers who received renewals without a funding gap were less likely to switch research topics and investigate a wide array of subjects than were those in the control group, and they produced papers featuring newer or more unconventional combinations of ideas.\n\nThe team found that renewed funding “helped scientists stay focused” so that they could “dig deeper into one area” of research, Bai says. As a result, she adds, the scientists could generate innovative applications down the line. “Innovation takes more than 10 or 20 years of continuous work,” she says.",

Although direct inhibition of RAS enzymes is possible thanks to advances made in the past decade, it is challenging, so there has been a shift towards targeting regulatory proteins upstream in the pathway, as well as downstream effectors such as ERK and RAF family proteins. One crucial regulator is a protein complex known as SMP (SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C), which facilitates RAF activation by removing a phosphate group from a self-inhibitory site. Despite its importance, the SMP complex has only just emerged as a potential therapeutic target.

          "authors": "Katherine Bourzac",
          "abstract": "Changemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates people who fight racism in science and who champion inclusion. It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nEarly in Jason ‘Jace’ Flatt’s career as a dementia researcher, colleagues encouraged them to take advantage of their unique perspective and study the LGBTQ+ community. At the time, it made Flatt mad. “I want to study all people. Are you saying this because I’m gay?” they recall thinking. But in 2017, a project that involved interviewing older LGBTQ+ people in San Francisco, California, changed their mind. This older generation, Flatt says, fought for the rights that LGBTQ+ people enjoy today, and now they are facing health disparities as they age.\n\nFlatt is a public-health researcher at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. They study how Alzheimer’s and related dementias, as well as Parkinson’s disease, affect members of sexual and gender minority groups. Flatt prefers the more inclusive term LGBTQIA+, because their research covers a broad group of people including queer, two-spirit and intersex people. One of their studies showed that lesbian, gay and bisexual adults get diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at younger ages than do heterosexual people1, even though these groups had higher levels of education, which is usually a protective factor. Flatt’s work has also shown that, starting in their mid-40s, lesbians, bisexual people, transgender people and those who select ‘other’ for their sexual orientation were more likely to report problems with thinking and memory2. In 2020, Flatt published one of the first studies of physical and mental health in intersex adults3.\n\nTrans researchers under attack: LGBTQ+ biologists face hostile work environment\n\nFlatt had hoped to extend their studies of dementia risk to older LGBTQIA+ military veterans this year, but US funding agencies have been cancelling research grants related to this community in response to US President Donald Trump’s executive orders. Flatt has had nearly US$5 million in federal grants across four projects cancelled because their work includes studies involving transgender people. The cancellation letters characterize such inclusion as “often unscientific”. Flatt calls this discriminatory, and notes that findings from the ageing LGBTQ+ population apply to everyone. For instance, Flatt’s work has highlighted the particular health risks to people who live alone.\n\nAs the US government moves to take away LGBTQ+ rights, they say: “Our community needs to come together to support one another right now.” Flatt tells Nature they are exploring legal action in response to the terminated grants.\n\nWhat has been your biggest influence in focusing your research on older people?\n\nMy first job was in an assisted-living and skilled-nursing facility. Bingo started right at 9.00 a.m. I did singalongs, painted fingernails and booked entertainment. I was 17, in the closet and not really comfortable with being gay. The older adults didn’t bully me because I didn’t follow masculine stereotypes — I could just be myself.\n\nDuring my graduate studies, my grandmother had Alzheimer’s disease, and she was really isolated at home. I saw her memory declining. That led to my PhD dissertation, a study about how interacting with people is good for your brain.\n\nWhen did you realize you wanted to study public health in the LGBTQ+ community?\n\nIt was when I became a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. For my first study, I planned to interview 20 LGBTQIA+ people who were 60 years or older. I had planned to spend about an hour and a half with each one, learning about their life history, but also about their concerns regarding dementia.\n\nJace Flatt shares their research findings with a group of older LGBT+ people.Credit: Saul Bromberger\n\nMany of them invited me into their homes, letting me hear their life stories and their challenges. This was in San Francisco. I was meeting pioneers: people who had fought for LGBTQ+ rights, who been through the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s and lost their entire friend group.\n\nIt changed my life. Often when I’m doing this work, I hear their voices and their stories. These are my people, and I want to make sure they’re taken care of. They’re the reason I can be married to my husband, and they’re the reason that I can be out at my job and not worry.\n\nHow does discrimination play into the challenges faced by older LGBTQ+ people?\n\nOne of the important things for ageing well is financial security. Historically, there haven’t been protections for employment, housing and health-care access for this population. For many older LGBTQ+ people, who might not have been able to legally marry their partner, the assets they had built together were not protected once their partner had died.\n\nThe older groups that I work with grew up in a time when who they are was pathologized. Until 1987, US health-care standards defined being homosexual as either a mental-health disorder or a sexual-orientation disturbance.\n\nChampioning queer scientists of colour: ‘I don’t think we’ve scratched the surface on systemic exclusion’\n\nAnd there’s still discrimination around health care. I’ve gone to the doctor about shoulder pain, and for some reason they asked about my sexual orientation. I shared that I was gay, and then they asked whether they could test me for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). I asked: “Do STDs cause shoulder pain? Because I think I hurt something lifting.”\n\nIf you’re transgender, you might see a doctor about a cough, and they’ll want to examine your genitalia. Or you have a medical encounter in which you’re misgendered, and they’re using a name that you don’t use — and that brings up shame.\n\nYou go in and, because of who you are, they automatically blame you for the health problems that you’re facing. That has led to distrust of health-care providers. And that means that often, instead of LGBTQ+ people going to the doctor regularly, and having it noted if they have high blood pressure, it won’t be until they have a stroke that they actually show up for care.\n\nWhat challenges do LGBTQ+ people face when taking care of a partner, family member or friend with dementia?",

I can no longer do so in good conscience, however; at least, not in the United States, amid the quick-fire anti-science policies of the administration of US President Donald Trump, and at a time when an unelected billionaire, Elon Musk, is eviscerating staffing at key science agencies.\n\nHow the United States became a science superpower — and how quickly it could crumble\n\nThese actions will inevitably cause harm to the future of health care, economic growth and national security. But there is another concern: the long-term damage they will do to the US scientific workforce. During the 22 years I served as director of public affairs at the American Physical Society in Washington DC, I relied on a well-worn political maxim: connect policies to people if you want elected officials to pay attention. Rather than stressing that research cuts lead to less innovation, emphasize that, once hollowed out, a scientific workforce can take a generation to rebuild.\n\nThe United States had a taste of such a gap during the Vietnam War. At the time, academic scientists found themselves caught in the crosshairs of zealous anti-war activists who, despite scant evidence, accused them broadly of collaborating on weapons research in support of the war. In 1970, the situation reached a violent crescendo with the death of Robert Fassnacht, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was working in a building that was bombed by anti-war protesters.\n\nIn response to the growing violence and inflammatory rhetoric, Michael Mansfield, an anti-war Democratic senator, aimed to sever ties between academia and the war machine. But his 1969 amendment ironically left intact what little applied military research existed on university campuses and shut down all non-military basic research that had been supported by the Department of Defense since the end of the Second World War. The ensuing disruption was extreme, especially in the physical sciences.\n\nDon’t wait out four hard years: speak truth to power\n\nAlthough the restrictions were lifted the following year, the damage was done. Neither the Department of Defense nor the universities saw fit to restore a relationship that had lasted almost one-quarter of a century. The unexpected loss of funding forced projects to be wound down and non-tenured staff to be dismissed. At Yale University’s J.W. Gibbs Laboratory in New Haven, Connecticut, for example, where I had just completed my PhD research on spin-polarized electrons, the funding lost for just one atomic-physics programme was more than US$600,000 (equivalent to more than $5 million today). Numerous research programmes across the country were similarly affected.\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) stepped in to fill the depleted coffers, but it took the better part of a decade to restore funding stability. Newly minted PhD holders found the number of desirable job opportunities extremely limited. In 1971, a survey found that of the 3,000 physicists seeking employment the previous year, only 2,000 had been able to secure conventional positions(see go.nature.com/4k3i3ij). Among my Yale peers who received physics doctorates in 1969, about half left for careers in law, medicine and finance.\n\n‘Now is not the time for despair’ — how scientists can take a stand against political interference",

          "title": "Can Germany rein in its academic bullying problem?",
          "authors": "Virginia Gewin",
          "abstract": "At one of Germany’s top-funded universities, a high-profile biology researcher has bullied his large group of junior staff, targeting women and international students, for decades. In interviews with Nature’s careers team, 14 current and former laboratory members detail what they describe as endless demands for unrealistic levels of research productivity. If those demands aren’t met, they allege, he withholds letters of recommendation and approval of time off work. If displeased, he denies funding or sends disparaging e-mails to researchers’ potential employers. Verbal abuse is commonplace. Women report being warned not to get pregnant while a member of his lab.\n\nThe university is aware of his behaviour. Yet, no investigation has been conducted nor any sanctions imposed because the complainants requested anonymity, fearing retribution — anonymity that cannot be upheld in an investigation owing to German labour law. This, along with defamation and other laws in Germany, can make it difficult to report on these incidents or to impose sanctions against professors, most of whom are tenured civil servants.\n\nShrouded in secrecy: how science is harmed by the bullying and harassment rumour mill\n\nGermany is not the only country to have a problem with bullying in academia, but a combination of structural and legal powers that, in effect, protect tenured professors over early-career researchers, enables and emboldens abusers. “It’s considered culturally normal — this is just what science is like,” says Daniel Leising, a psychology researcher and professor at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany. Several people interviewed by Nature’s careers team, including Leising, use ‘king’ to describe professors, meaning they are untouchable. “There is far too much power in the hands of professors in the German system,” he says.\n\n“It’s not everybody,” stresses intervention psychologist Andrea Kübler, who is dean of the faculty of human sciences at the University of Würzburg, Germany, noting that those who abuse their power are by far the minority. But those who do so cause a lot of harm, she explains. Kübler is one of more than 100 members of the Network for Sustainable Research, a group formed in April 2024 to identify and advocate for structural reforms to protect junior scientists who don’t have permanent contracts.\n\nAlthough the details given by the 14 lab members relate to one professor’s case, the pattern of reported behaviour is similar across several cases that have made headlines in Germany in recent years. In 2023, a professor at the University of Göttingen, Germany, lost his job and pension when he was convicted of multiple physical assaults on a Vietnamese doctoral student and on two other female junior members of his group. His offences came to light in 2017, but it took six years and two trials before the university could remove his civil-servant status. In 2023, a German national newspaper reported that a university in western Germany took steps to prevent a female professor from supervising new PhD students after she insulted and exploited around a dozen students.\n\nLeising says that these and other press reports of abuse are crucial, supporting growing calls for structural reforms. Amid increased concern that academic abuse was rampant but under-reported, Leising and his colleagues were asked by the German Psychological Society in 2022 to write a report identifying the factors that give rise to academic power abuse in science in Germany.\n\nReleased in June 2023 (an updated English version was published in February this year)1, Leising’s report broadly defined unethical behaviour as encompassing bullying, sexual harassment, scientific misconduct, exploitation and corruption. The authors noted that the academic system in Germany is remarkably hierarchical, steeped in historical deference to professors and further entrenched with a lack of effective oversight. These conditions are particularly conducive to unethical behaviour, owing to the extreme power differential between professors and early-career researchers. This raises fear of retaliation in people who have experienced abuse. Internal complaint channels also tend to be understaffed and have little authority to impose sanctions, says the report.\n\nDaniel Leising co-authored a report exploring the factors that contribute to academic bullying in Germany.Credit: Daniel Leising\n\nLeising’s report and this article focus on universities, but other independent research institutions, including the Max Planck Institutes, are not immune to similar abuse complaints, as has been reported by news outlets, including Nature (see Nature 571, 14–15; 2019).\n\nIn Germany, a typical large academic research group is structured with a professor, who has lifelong tenure, at the top. The professor manages and supervises early-career researchers — from graduate and postdoctoral students to junior professors and research-group leaders, the latter being the most independent. It is the professor who assigns a graduate student’s final grade. Almost all doctoral candidates at universities are on short-term contracts, which are dependent on the professor for renewal and last, on average, less than three years. The average time, in 2023, to get a doctorate in Germany was 5.1 years. At the same time, 72% of junior research-group leaders were on fixed-term contracts.\n\nWhatever minimal oversight academic departments have, they rarely exercise it, says Leising. Kübler says: “The strong hierarchy is a problem. And there is no official way for people who suffer from power abuse to know they will receive some help.”\n\nStructural changes are being pursued, but these are modest. At the national level, scientists are lobbying to extend the length of contracts for early-career researchers to four years, which they consider to be the minimum length of time necessary to finish a PhD. And one German state, North Rhine-Westphalia, is attempting to prevent professors from being both a graduate supervisor and a grader. Furthermore, some university departments are restructuring to flatten power dynamics and create more permanent positions. Many countries also have problematic academic hierarchies and will be watching Germany’s progress.\n\nGrowing complaints\n\nAlthough there are no baseline data on the total number of people who have experienced academic power abuse, there are some interesting data points. The 2024 Berlin Science Survey2 found that around 23% of 2,748 respondents in Germany had experienced an abuse of power in the previous 24 months, and roughly 39% had observed it at least once. At the same time, the number of general enquiries has risen at the Ombuds Committee for Research Integrity, which serves all researchers who are affiliated with the German research system. “Our number of enquiries has increased continuously over the last years — from 87 in 2016 to 262 last year,” says Hjördis Czesnick, who heads the office of the committee. Her office doesn’t have any evidence that abuse or misconduct has increased over that time or that it was less in the past; it assumes there is greater awareness that the office exists, says Czesnick.\n\nUnderpaid and overworked: researchers abroad fall prey to bullying\n\nIn 2021, Jana Lasser, a computational social scientist now at the University of Graz in Austria, co-founded the Network Against Abuse of Power in Science to document cases of academic abuse and support those who have experienced it in Germany. Since then, the network has reviewed roughly 120 cases. Lasser says that the complaints are often similar to those found by Nature for this article, including extortion of labour in exchange for contract renewals, supervisors refusing to let students graduate and bullying and misogynistic behaviour.\n\nSusanne Menzel-Riedl, president of Osnabrück University, Germany, and vice-president of the German Rectors’ Conference, an association of roughly 270 higher-education institutions, sees the reporting of complaints as a positive sign. “The more complaints we see, the better. It points to a process that is open about the problem. This is a sign of quality and not of weakness,” she says. The German Rectors’ Conference has made addressing the abuse of academic power a priority. “Decades ago, it was impossible to talk about,” Menzel-Riedl says.\n\nLeising contends that harassment of all types is widely under-reported. He co-authored a study3 that surveyed thousands of students and employees at Germany’s Technical University of Dresden; only 14% of respondents who identified as targets of physical sexual harassment said that they filed a complaint afterwards. “The biggest problem that we have is the level of fear among victims and witnesses of misconduct,” he says. “Fear of being retaliated against, fear of career sabotage, fear of being ostracized. And all of this fear is justified.”\n\nLeising points out that power-abuse behaviours — including lying, cheating and predation — can be characteristics of ‘functional psychopaths’. “But in German academia, they may find particularly fertile soil to act on their impulses without ever being called out for it, or punished,” says Leising. In fact, he adds, some of them are cheered on by the institutional leadership. The term functional academic psychopath was first outlined in a 2018 study4, which determined that, without strong institutional constraints on such people, bullying behaviours will prevail.\n\n“It is a threat to the integrity of research,” Lasser says. “People are under so much pressure, it creates sloppy science in the best cases, and outright data falsification in the worst case.”\n\nOne of the biggest challenges, says Lasser, is that her network can’t do anything more than provide support and help the people who experience abuse to contact the appropriate university grievance channels. “I see people running from one organization to the next, not getting help,” she says.\n\nComputational scientist Jana Lasser co-founded a watchdog and support network for scientists who have experienced academic power abuse.Credit: Timotheus Hell\n\nThe Ombuds Committee for Research Integrity, for example, can address complaints only if they are specifically related to research, such as authorship disputes. It can’t address those involving racism, discrimination or sexual abuse. “We don’t have investigative power,” says Czesnick. In such cases, the committee can forward complaints to the institution and suggest an investigation, but “has no legal mandate to request an investigation or to sanction misconduct”, she explains. Moreover, there is no incentive for universities to address complaints of power abuse because public cases can jeopardize their reputations — and potentially affect external funding, says Kübler.\n\nMenzel-Riedl says that the aim of the German Rectors’ Conference is to make sure its complaint process is easily identified by Germany’s 700,000 early-career researchers. If a PhD student wants to complain, the first step is to seek advice, a process that can be anonymous, she explains. However, “if the person decides to issue a formal complaint, they will have to reveal their name, according to labour laws in Germany,” adds Menzel-Riedl.\n\nLasser is concerned that factors such as issues of power abuse and the precarity of PhD contracts that are shorter than three years could make Germany less attractive to top students. “I’ve seen PhD students turn down offers because they figured out the job was in a toxic environment,” says Lasser.\n\n‘I am Hanna’\n\nPerennial discontent about short-term contracts was exacerbated by a video released by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in 2020. It featured a fictional character called Hanna who defends Germany’s 12-year limit on the time an early-career researcher can be employed on short-term contracts, which includes 6 years pre-PhD and 6 years post-PhD, as a way to encourage universities to offer more tenured positions. But without the addition of such positions, the system results in the subsequent loss of highly qualified academics. In response, Amrei Bahr, a junior professor in the philosophy of technology, who is on a contract at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and her colleagues launched #IchbinHanna (#IamHanna) on Twitter, now called X, which led to thousands of scholars tweeting their stories about the precarity of short-term contracts.\n\n“We really need to take a look at how the system enables abuse — it does so by those fixed-term contracts,” which can make researchers accept toxic working conditions, says Bahr. “If you are a funding king, you can do almost anything,” she says. Kübler agrees. The universities would suffer without the external funding brought in by these senior researchers, she says.\n\nAmrei Bahr advocates for changes that would put junior researchers at less risk of bullying.",

          "abstract": "A US executive order has suspended federal funding for gain-of-function experiments, which are carried out in biosafety laboratories.Credit: Master Sgt. Brian Ferguson/USAF via Alamy\n\nUS President Donald Trump has issued an executive order suspending all federal funding for ‘gain of function’ research that his administration considers dangerous. But some scientists say the order is so broad that low-risk research will also be affected.\n\nThe funding suspension will be in place for the next four months, during which time the government says it will revise an incoming policy on how federal funding agencies and institutions oversee gain-of-function experiments on pathogens that have the potential to spark a pandemic. That policy, which was years in the making and set to broaden oversight of such experiments, was due to come into effect this week.\n\nThe executive order, signed on 5 May, defines dangerous gain-of-function research as studies on infectious pathogens or toxins that have the potential to make them more deadly or transmissible. That includes work that gives pathogens the ability to evade vaccines, therapeutic agents and detection attempts, among other things.\n\n“This is what I was expecting — an executive order banning gain-of-function research but defined in such a way that it bans all virology research,” says Gigi Gronvall, a biosecurity specialist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nModifying pathogens such as viruses inside a secure laboratory facility can help researchers to understand the risks the pathogens pose to society and develop vaccines and drugs against them. The work sometimes involves making pathogens more dangerous or transmissible in people. Some worry about the risk of pathogens accidentally escaping from a laboratory or being weaponized.\n\nResearchers are often unable to predict whether their changes will make a virus more pathogenic or transmissible in people, so they might now have to avoid doing such work altogether, says Gronvall.\n\nSam Wilson, a molecular virologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, worries that even low-risk studies that could benefit public health will now fall under the US government’s definition of dangerous gain-of-function research.\n\nInstitutions that violate the terms of the order could be banned from receiving federal funding for up to five years. This financial penalty will make them reluctant to support infectious-disease research more broadly and “fearful of routine experiments”, says Wilson.\n\nBut some researchers have welcomed the executive order, which could result in even stricter rules around risky research.\n\nThe technology available today means that gain-of-function experiments have the potential to spark the next pandemic, says Raina MacIntyre, an infectious-diseases epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. “This executive order is a welcome new direction in mitigating that risk.”\n\nThe order comes at a time when many researchers in the field are already facing the prospect of huge budget cuts and grant cancellations.\n\nCOVID origin\n\nThe executive order also bans federal funding for dangerous gain-of-function research in China, Iran and other “countries of concern”. And it halts funding for life-sciences research that could pose a threat to public health in countries that do not have adequate oversight of this work. All recipients of federal grants in the life sciences will need to comply with the order, including confirming that they do not collaborate with foreign countries on relevant research.\n\n“It is implicitly clear where the executive order is coming from: the COVID-origins debate,” says Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity researcher at King’s College London.\n\nA fact sheet published by the White House about the executive order specifically states that the measures are designed to reduce the possibility of lab-related incidents emerging from gain-of-function research, “like that conducted on bat coronaviruses in China by the EcoHealth Alliance and Wuhan Institute of Virology”. It notes that Trump supports the theory that the COVID-19 pandemic originated from the institute in Wuhan.",

But for the beetles and flies that pollinate the plant, the noxious perfume of rotting meat is an irresistible draw.\n\nNow, a sweeping study of smelly plants has revealed how skunk cabbage and several other plants concoct their malodorous aromas. The results, published today in Science1, also show that blooms that reek of faeces, rotting meat and other things that humans find off-putting are surprisingly popular in the plant kingdom. Species in one plant genus evolved the ability to make such smells repeatedly in less than 7 million years — the blink of an eye in evolutionary terms.\n\nThe study also highlights how much more there is to learn about smelly plants, says Robert Raguso, a chemical ecologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who was not involved in the study. “One recent realization has been that stinky flowers are more complicated than we thought they were,” he says. “There is still a lot of discovery to be made.”\n\nFollow your nose\n\nThe project began when Yudai Okuyama, a biologist at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tsukuba, Japan, launched a survey of one of the most diverse plant groups in Japan: the genus Asarum. He and his team wanted to learn more about how the drive to court different pollinators might have influenced this diversity.\n\nUnpicking the link between smell and memories\n\nDuring his survey, Okuyama noticed that some Asarum species emit the odour of rotting meat. He and his colleagues decided to harness Asarum’s diversity to learn more about how plants produce these stinky compounds. They catalogued the volatile chemicals made by the flowers of 53 Asarum species and then looked for differences in gene and enzyme activity between stinky and non-stinky Asarum species.\n\nThe approach pinpointed a class of enzymes called disulfide synthases, which convert certain sulfur-containing molecules into compounds responsible for the flowers’ stench. Okuyama and his colleagues found that similar enzymes had evolved independently in two other plant genera, Symplocarpus and Eurya. They also found that a change of merely three amino acids could convert an enzyme common in plants and animals into disulfide synthase.",

The discovery, reported today in Cell1, offers a detailed look at how our tongues perceive sweetness, and could pave the way for more health-conscious fizzy drinks, chewing gums and other confections.\n\n“This single receptor is responsible for our insatiable, never-ending attraction to sugar,” says Columbia neuroscientist Charles Zuker, who led the study. “And now that we have this structure, perhaps we can find ways to modulate its function.” For example, compounds that target the receptor could alter how natural sugars are sensed by taste buds on the tongue.\n\nA spoonful of structure\n\nFrom ripe fruit to saccharine-laden yogurt, foods containing either sugars or their substitutes turn on the sweet taste receptor, triggering a signalling cascade that the brain regards as a sign of energy-rich rewards.\n\nZuker and his colleagues first identified2 the receptor in 2001, showing that it is a molecular complex made of two proteins, TAS1R2 and TAS1R3. One latches on to the sweet molecule, and the other provides structural support.\n\nA spoonful of sugar could be the medicine\n\nYet, despite more than 20 years of study, the sweet receptor’s precise architecture remained elusive, even as scientists deciphered the structures of other taste receptors, such as the one for bitterness.\n\nNow Zuker’s team has finally cracked the structure. The researchers stabilized the fragile protein complex in its active conformation, a crucial prerequisite step for high-resolution imaging. Using cryo-electron microscopy, they then captured atomic-level snapshots of the receptor bound to two synthetic sweeteners: sucralose (sold commercially as Splenda) and aspartame (found in NutraSweet). Both bind more tightly to the receptor than natural sugar does, helping to fix the receptor in place for the authors’ structural analysis.\n\nSweet spot\n\nThe images revealed that the TAS1R2 subunit has a pocket that either sucralose or aspartame can occupy. Each binds to it slightly differently, however, hinting at a flexible mechanism that allows the receptor to recognize a wide range of sweet-tasting compounds. The TAS1R3 subunit, meanwhile — although not involved in binding of the sweet molecules — has a crucial supporting role by helping to assemble and stabilize the receptor complex.\n\nCommon sweetener suppresses mouse immune system — in high doses\n\n“This really begins to clarify just how this receptor works,” says Kyle Palmer, a pharmacologist who co-founded and leads scientific operations at Opertech Bio, a taste-assessment company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",

Just a chunk of rock.”\n\n“But this one’s aliens?”\n\n“We’re not sure, Kyle. It changes course, though. We’ll find out soon enough.”\n\n“Is it coming here?” His ten-year-old voice wavered as if asking about a ghost.\n\n“No, buddy. Whatever it is, it is heading for Jupiter. We’ve got a ship there — the Hai Hu. They report to me every day.”\n\nKyle frowned. “But what do they want from us?”\n\nI shook my head and forced a grin. “I wish I knew.”\n\nHe didn’t need to know that I was terrified. Not just for him — for everyone.\n\n*****\n\nCamilla burst into my office, her dark hair tied back today. “Time for iron pants to call?”\n\nMy finger wagged at her. “You are awfully brave, considering Commander Ndiaye is only 40 light-minutes away. What did Sousa want?”\n\nShe chuckled. “The Brazilians think they should be in charge of first contact.”\n\nMy eyes rolled. “Not my fault the United States is the only country that still has people on board ships. Robots can’t do everything.”\n\n“Union of the Americas, Mr Chairman. You are the Chairman of the Union of the Americas,” Camilla chided me with a slight grin.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“Yeah, right. The Union.”\n\n“They also think the aliens want to trade cultural artefacts.”\n\nI sighed. “Everyone has a theory. Enslave us, eat us, preach to us. No one knows.” I reached forward to acknowledge the incoming call from the Hai Hu.\n\nThe screen lit up, and Commander Ndiaye appeared. “Mr Chairman,” she said, her weathered face filling the display. “The Hai Hu’s HD telescope picked up this.” The image flickered, revealing an endless, off-white surface marked with regular patterns. “We don’t know what it is,” she continued, “but it’s definitely artificial.” You could see unnatural lines and angles etched on it and symbols that had to be some language.\n\nThe camera panned. “The scale is… beyond anything we imagined. The ship’s a half-sphere, 120,000 kilometres wide.”\n\nCamilla gasped. “Did she say —?”\n\n“Bigger than Earth,” I murmured. Jupiter itself was only 140,000 kilometres. What did beings capable of building that want with us? It could probably destroy Earth easier than I could kick over an anthill.\n\nThe report droned on, but I wasn’t listening. The future preoccupied me. Would history remember me as the leader who handled first contact — or the fool who got us all killed?\n\n*****\n\nDays passed with no change. Leviathan, as the press called it, loomed closer to Jupiter, silent and indifferent. The thing ignored our communications from Earth and the Moon’s distributed antenna array. My orders to the Hai Hu were to avoid beaming anything at it lest it be misinterpreted.\n\nIn the situation room, we watched Leviathan’s rendezvous with the gas giant. Ndiaye’s video streamed live, albeit with a 40-minute delay. “Mr Chairman,” she said, her voice tense, “this thing is massive. We can’t see its edges.”\n\nSomeone shouted behind her, and the screen switched views. Jupiter’s clouds were moving — no, being sucked towards Leviathan. The alabaster flat surface rippled as it consumed the gas like a pond drinking rain.\n\n“We think it’s refuelling,” Ndiaye said. “But the volume is … staggering. Helm, back us away. Maximum acceleration.”\n\nNo one in the situation room spoke, but for the first time in my life, I understood why they say you can smell fear. We were all staring at the screen like figures in a wax museum. Glancing back at the science adviser, I said, “Are we in danger?”",

          "authors": "Yuxin Zhao",
          "abstract": "China’s efforts to redefine how scientific merit is measured are the subject of fierce debate. At the heart is a contradiction: Chinese institutions encourage researchers to follow global scientific norms, but they measure performance against locally defined priorities. Many scientists, especially those at early career stages, find it hard to navigate this system with its conflicting incentives.\n\nScience’s big problem is a loss of influence, not a loss of trust\n\nIn March, for example, the National Science Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) updated its journal-ranking system — which complements other standards such as impact factors and Clarivate’s Journal Citation Reports. Using article citations, its database is re-evaluated each year with a complex algorithm. Journals might move up or down the tiers. However, in 2025, some elevations of domestic titles over prominent international ones caught scholars’ attention. For example, CAS’s Chinese Physics Letters moved to tier 1, whereas the American Chemical Society’s Nano Letters (a global leading title in nanoscience) dropped to tier 2 (see go.nature.com/4atq2xx). Critics attribute such changes to opaque metrics and disciplinary reclassifications — for example, materials science can be classed as engineering or as physics.\n\nSuch assessments are well intentioned, but can have unintended consequences. For example, the CAS library states that its system, which is designed to assess journals’ scholarly impact and to inform institutional research-management strategies, should not be applied to evaluations of individual researchers. Yet evidence suggests that scholars in China choose where to publish to align with this ranking. For example, between 2015 and 2019, journals that were downgraded in the CAS list saw a 14.8% decline in articles by authors in China1. Scholars at less-prestigious institutions were more likely to do so to ensure that their career progressed than were those at more-prestigious ones.\n\nMeasuring societal impact: how to go beyond standard publication metrics\n\nAnecdotally, colleagues have told me that work they published in prominent overseas journals received less attention in promotion reviews than did studies published in local ones. Some researchers refer to submissions to certain domestic journals as ‘academic tribute’ — not out of disrespect but because of frustration with the current evaluation frameworks.\n\nIf these trends continue, concerns might arise over researchers’ ability to connect globally. That might further dissuade top researchers from coming to China to pursue self-directed innovative work. For example, one 2023 study found that 89% of expatriate top-tier scholars who received offers through China’s Thousand Talents programme decided to continue their careers abroad2. Three measures could help stakeholders to realign incentives with scientific universality while respecting national contexts.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Tsang",
          "abstract": "Credit: MirageC / Getty\n\nIt can happen so easily. You’re excited about an experiment, so you sneak an early peek at the data to see if the P value — a measure of statistical significance — has dipped below the threshold of 0.05. Or maybe you’ve tried analysing your results in several different ways, hoping one will give you that significant finding. These temptations are common, especially in the cut-throat world of publish-or-perish academia. But giving in to them can lead to what scientists call P hacking.\n\nP hacking is the practice of tweaking the analysis or data to get a statistically significant result. In other words, you’re fishing for a desirable outcome and reporting only the catches, while ignoring all the times you came up empty. It might get you a publication in the short term, but P hacking contributes to the reproducibility and replicability crisis in science by filling the literature with dubious or unfounded conclusions.\n\nMost researchers don’t set out to cheat, but they could unknowingly make choices that push them towards a significant result. Here are five ways P hacking can slip into your research.\n\nEnding the experiment too early\n\nYou might plan to gather 30 samples but find yourself running a quick analysis halfway through, just to see where things stand. If you notice a statistically significant difference after 15 samples, you might be inclined to stop the experiment early — after all, you’ve found what you were looking for.\n\nIt’s time to talk about ditching statistical significance\n\nBut stopping an experiment once you find a significant effect but before you reach your predetermined sample size is classic P hacking. It’s like declaring the winner of an election after polling just half the electorate: the result might not be representative of reality. What’s the solution? Decide on the sample size or data-collection process ahead of time and stick to it, no matter how eager you are to see the results.\n\nRunning experiments until you get a hit\n\nAnother often-unintentional form of P hacking is repeating the experiment or analysis until you obtain a statistically significant result. Imagine you run an experiment and the outcome is insignificant. You try again with a new batch of samples — still nothing. You repeat the study once more, and voila! P < 0.05. Success? Not quite. If you selectively report only the attempt that ‘worked’ and ignore those that didn’t, you’re engaging in P hacking by omission. As any gambler knows, if you roll the dice often enough, eventually you’ll get the result you want by chance alone (not that I’m a gambler). The better approach is to report all the experimental replicates, including those that didn’t work.\n\nCherry-picking your results\n\nA less benign form of P hacking is selective reporting. Imagine you measure several outcomes or observe your effect at multiple time points — for instance, testing a therapy’s impact on recipients’ blood pressure, cholesterol, weight and blood sugar regularly over an entire month. After analysing the data, you find that only one outcome — say, blood sugar at week 3 — showed a significant improvement. You might be tempted to highlight this one promising result and downplay the rest, or even omit them from your report. This is cherry-picking: by showing only the favourable data and ignoring everything else, you create a biased narrative.\n\nIn this example, people might think the therapy worked because it lowered blood sugar at week 3, even though the overall data are not so rosy. Putting these data into the paper’s supplementary material and continuing with the experiment on the basis of this one finding is also a no-no. You should report all relevant results, not just the ones that support the hypothesis. Science progresses faster when we know what doesn’t work, as well as what does.\n\nTweaking your data\n\nIn data analysis, you often have to make judgements about what to include, what to exclude and how to report the data. P hacking can sneak in when those decisions are guided by the desire to achieve significance rather than by scientific reasoning. For example, you might notice an outlier in your data set. Including it in the analysis gives you a P value of 0.08, whereas excluding it brings P down to 0.03. Problem solved? Not quite.\n\nIn these cases, it is best practice to go back to the original data or laboratory notes to determine whether experimental conditions could explain this outlier. Perhaps you pipetted double the amount of reagent into your sample, or construction work nearby during the time you were testing that animal affected its behaviour. Researchers can often rationalize their data-filtration decisions, and most of those decisions are warranted. But if the real motive is to turn an insignificant result into a significant one, it crosses into questionable territory. The key is to decide on data-filtering rules before looking at the results. If, for some reason, you have to make a change after data collection, explain that — and say why.",

In a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1, scientists identified a genetic mutation that probably contributes to some people’s limited sleep needs.\n\nWhy don’t new memories overwrite old ones? Sleep science holds clues\n\nUnderstanding genetic changes in naturally short sleepers — people who sleep for three to six hours every night without negative effects — could help to develop treatments for sleep disorders, says co-author Ying-Hui Fu, a neuroscientist and geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n“Our bodies continue to work when we go to bed”, detoxifying themselves and repairing damage, she says. “These people, all these functions our bodies are doing while we are sleeping, they can just perform at a higher level than we can.”\n\nIn the 2000s, Fu and her colleagues were approached by people who slept six hours or less each night. After analysing the genomes of a mother and daughter, the team identified a rare mutation in a gene that helps to regulate humans’ circadian rhythm, the internal clock responsible for our sleep–wake cycle. The researchers suggested that this variation contributed to the duo’s short sleep needs. That discovery prompted others with similar sleeping habits to contact the laboratory for DNA testing.\n\nThe team now knows several hundred naturally short sleepers. Fu and her colleagues have so far identified five mutations in four genes that can contribute to the trait — although different families tend to have different mutations.\n\nShort sleeper",

          "abstract": "Chief business officers wear many hats, says Filippo Mulinacci.Credit: Getty\n\nFilippo Mulinacci joined Araris Biotech in 2022 as its chief business officer. In March, the oncology company, based in Zurich, Switzerland, was acquired by Taiho Pharma, based in Tokyo, as part of a deal worth up to US$1.14 billion.\n\nMulinacci’s corporate career started after he completed a master’s degree in chemistry at the University of Turin, Italy, in 2002. He then pursued a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, followed by a master’s in business administration (MBA) at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.\n\nHe recounts his role in helping to broker the Araris Biotech–Taiho Pharma deal, his corporate career path so far and the skills he has picked up along the way.\n\nTell us about your corporate career path, and why you chose it.\n\nMy first job after graduating with my MSc was as a research associate at the biotechnology company Serono, based first in Ivrea, close to Turin, Italy, and later in Geneva. Going straight into a biotech company, rather than continuing my studies, was a great career move and learning opportunity. The role expanded my scientific knowledge, enabling me to diversify from my original academic discipline of chemistry.\n\nAfter three years, I quit to pursue a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Geneva, turning my focus to proteins and protein formulation.\n\nImmediately after that, I earned an MBA at the University of St. Gallen. I felt I lacked experience in the strategic and corporate side of the pharma industry. My class was a mixture of people with engineering and economics backgrounds; there were very few science graduates.\n\nFor me, the key takeaways were gaining an understanding of business strategy, marketing, frameworks and finance, including accounting, corporate finance and valuation.\n\nAfter many years in the laboratory, Filippo Mulinacci pivoted to a role in the biopharmaceutical industry.Credit: Filippo Mulinacci\n\nI joined Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, as a global business-development and licensing associate right after finishing my MBA in 2011. Licensing, in the context of the biopharma industry, is when one party acquires the rights to a product or technology, often from the inventor, to develop, manufacture or market that product or technology.\n\nIt was a great entry-level position: I scouted for new partnering opportunities to expand the pipeline, or the drug candidates that a company has under development. I enjoyed working across several fields of therapies, and I developed experience in two that I am truly passionate about: biologics and oncology (cancer has affected members of my family).\n\nAfter two years, I started gaining experience on the transactions side, facilitating deals between big pharma and smaller companies. In this role, you need legal knowledge as well as soft skills, such as negotiation and networking, alongside your scientific knowledge. I learnt these skills on the job, thanks to extensive experience working with senior colleagues with mixed backgrounds, ranging from law to intellectual property (IP) to finance.\n\nAfter five years, I wanted a role at a smaller company — on the other side of the table, in other words.\n\nI joined Philogen in 2016 as its head of business development and licensing, based in Zurich.\n\nThat role enabled me to develop my deal-making skills in both the chemistry and the biologics fields, from the side of the licensor, or the ‘seller side’. Philogen is an ETH Zurich biotech spin-off firm with a proprietary chemistry platform — a technology that enables the discovery of new chemically synthesized drugs — and biologic products in the field of immuno-inflammation.\n\nGood deal-makers possess both technical skills and industry knowledge and can put themselves in the shoes of the other negotiating parties. I learnt these skills on the job, and I also attended external courses, including one at the Program on Negotiation at the Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nWhat does a head of business development and licensing do?\n\nA key part of the role involves scouting, search and evaluation, and networking: seeking out new products or assets, and evaluating their commercial and clinical potential.\n\nBecause Philogen was not focused on a single therapy area, platform or asset, this introduced complexities into the deal structure with regard to licensed rights, but also made the job more interesting.\n\nStructuring a deal requires an evaluation of the current and future value of the asset or platform for licensing to a potential partner.\n\nIn 2018, I joined Basilea Pharma, a Roche spin-off company based in Basel, as its oncology business development and licensing manager. I spent four years there before joining Araris Biotech as its chief business officer (CBO).\n\nWhat does a biotech CBO do?\n\nYou wear many hats. The first is to represent the company to the pharma industry. Most biotech firms developing new products need to attract external investors, and they also usually need big pharma support for phase III studies and to commercialize a new drug. In my role, I talk to potential partners and lead transactions with pharma companies. I address mainly the financial and legal aspects of the deals.\n\nAlso, most biotech companies have a data room. This is typically a virtual space for storing confidential data, and a CBO’s day-to-day activities include keeping all key financial and legal documentation held there updated, alongside presentations for investors and clinical and non-clinical data.\n\nIt is essential to maintain this type of documentation, especially when preparing to reach out to new investors. The role also entails general housekeeping of company documentation, so the firm can be ready to make a deal whenever an opportunity arises.\n\nThe CBO role also focuses on partnerships. The chief financial officer, by contrast, deals with investors, supporting the work of the chief executive.\n\nBut when needed, I do help out with, for example, due-diligence queries.

They found that the enzyme can break down a plastic that is commonly used in health care because of its biodegradable properties, called polycaprolactone (PCL).\n\nUntil now, the only enzymes shown to break down plastics were found in environmental bacteria, says study co-author Ronan McCarthy, who researches bacteria and bacterial infections at Brunel University in London. He says that finding the same ability in pathogens often present in hospitals could explain why these microbes persist in these environments. “If a pathogen can degrade plastic, then it could compromise plastic-containing medical devices such as sutures, implants, stents or wound dressings, which would obviously negatively impact patient prognosis,” he adds.\n\nEnzyme expression\n\nAs part of their study, McCarthy and his colleagues inserted the gene that codes for the enzyme into Escherichia coli bacteria. When they made the bacteria express the enzyme, they found that the microbes broke down the PCL in agar or beads. The strain of P. aeruginosa taken from the wound was also able to digest PCL agar and beads. And when the researchers created a mutant in which the gene that codes for the Pap1 enzyme was deleted from the P. aeruginosa, the bacterium was unable to degrade the plastic.\n\nThe team also found that the enzyme increased the amount of biofilm formed when P. aeruginosa was exposed to the plastic as compared with glass beads. When bacteria form high levels of biofilm, antibiotic resistance can increase, leading to difficult-to-treat infections. The team also conducted experiments in greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larvae and found that the bacterium was more harmful when a PCL implant was present than when the implant was absent. Additionally, moths infected with bacteria lacking the enzyme had similar survival rates regardless of whether a PCL implant was present or not.",

          "abstract": "Although it might seem counter-intuitive, writing the middle and end of your thesis first can make the process easier, says Tuuli Toivonen.Credit: Oscar Wong/Getty\n\nPhD theses usually come in two forms. Standard monographs, a comprehensive dissertation written by a single author, continue to be used, but theses based on collections of published articles are becoming the norm in the natural sciences.\n\nFor monograph-style theses, the research process is relatively straightforward: you might first read extensively, then narrow down your ideas to what is relevant and interesting, formulate a focused research question or hypothesis based on the literature and then proceed with data collection, analysis and, finally, writing the dissertation.\n\nArticle-based theses consist of works published in scientific journals, written by a student during the course of their PhD training, alongside an introductory chapter that ties the articles together. The path to these theses might be winding, because each article has its own narrative, influenced by the journal and the co-authors. The introductory chapter, or synopsis, synthesizes the individual articles and presents a broader narrative tying the literature into the findings of the thesis. In simple terms, the synopsis aims to describe how the author’s contributions advance science. In some ways, it might be best thought of as a literature review fused with new results obtained over the course of a PhD.\n\nIn my own field, quantitative geography, article-based theses are most common. At the University of Helsinki, where I teach, a PhD student typically finalizes three or four first-author articles, at least half of which are accepted or published.\n\nCareers collection: Funding science\n\nMaking your claim\n\nHow, then, can a high-quality synopsis be written efficiently? This is where my approach might be useful.\n\nIn Finnish, a PhD defence is called väitös, which directly translates to ‘claim’ or ‘argument’. My early supervisor, the late geomorphologist Matti Seppälä, was known for his intelligence as well as his laser-sharp stare. He often asked students approaching their defence an intimidating question: “So, what’s your claim?”, referring to the single, clarified, fundamental message that a reader should take from those years of gruelling PhD work.\n\nWhen I was struggling to write my own synopsis in 2006, this question lingered in my mind. Ultimately, thinking about how to answer it helped me to shape my synopsis and guided me through the overall process. Since then, I have supervised a dozen students writing article-based PhD theses, and have often encouraged them answer Seppälä’s question to guide their thinking and writing when it’s time to wrap up their theses.\n\nI’ve found that the approach helps the student to identify the most important content and gain the broader perspective needed for the synopsis. On the basis of comments by the pre-examiners and reviewers, the students create a clear, logical and easy-to-read structure.\n\nThe approach might even help natural scientists who are writing a research paper. Focusing on key takeaways in the discussion, then writing the remainder of the paper from that point, is an effective way to write any paper.\n\nA recipe for a clear synopsis",

          "abstract": "Whether it’s developing artificial-intelligence tools, clean technologies or medical treatments, governments around the world are seeking to leverage their research institutions and workforces to compete strategically with other nations.\n\nThe strategy behind one of the most successful labs in the world\n\nThrough our decades of leadership in research and development (R&D) in corporate settings, national laboratories and research universities, we’ve seen at first hand how one crucial acknowledgement — recognizing non-conventional career paths or roles — strengthens workforces1. Yet, too often, one group remains overlooked: skilled technical staff. The technicians who devise the instruments, techniques and materials that go hand in hand with scientific discoveries are often the unsung heroes of research. Numerous studies2–4 and historical cases5–7 in leading labs show how close collaborations between researchers with PhDs and technicians often lie behind major breakthroughs.\n\nToday’s trailblazing research increasingly relies on technological advances, such as gene editing, high-performance computing or nanofabrication, creating a growing demand for technicians with specialized training, practical experience and the ingenuity to solve problems with complex instruments, equipment and software. In many areas, however, this demand exceeds supply. In the semiconductor industry, for example, only about 1,000 technicians enter the field in the United States each year8 — too few to supply the predicted 75,000 extra technicians needed for all manufacturing and research operations between 2024 and 2029 (see ‘Don’t take technicians for granted’).\n\nSource: Ref.8\n\nThe boundaries between science and technology are increasingly blurring, and so, too, should those between doctoral-level researchers and technicians in research institutions. We urge leaders of institutions to remove conventional occupational boundaries between these groups. To achieve excellence, leaders should take three steps.\n\nLearn from successful labs\n\nInnovative research labs around the world have long orchestrated team-management synergies between doctoral-level researchers and technicians. We urge leaders to foster cultures — the shared values, assumptions, beliefs, norms and expectations that impact how their members think, behave and perform9 — that cultivate a sense of belonging in which all individuals, including technicians, are valued.\n\nExamples of such institutes include: Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia2,3; the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK5; the original incarnation of Bell Labs2,3,6,7 in Murray Hill, New Jersey; and US National Science Foundation-funded Engineering Research Centers4,10,11 — a network of research hubs across US universities that work in partnership with industries.\n\nTechnicians at Janelia Research Campus are integral to the research process.Credit: HHMI Janelia Research Campus\n\nJanelia, founded in 2006 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, fosters close collaborations between life scientists, physicists, engineers and technicians. When it comes to recruitment, practical research experience can substitute for academic degrees, according to chemist Luke Lavis, who leads the molecular tools and imaging group at Janelia. For example, engineer Dan Flickinger “doesn’t have a PhD but is the brains behind many of the microscopes developed at Janelia. He is an expert optical engineer who simply makes things work”, Lavis told us.\n\nLeaders can learn from Janelia’s approach, which includes a strategic focus on projects that require patience and sustainable financial resources, encouraging commitment by personnel to be physically present at Janelia at least 75% of the time, and prioritizing collaborations between researchers and technicians for tool building. One example of its success involved major developments in protein biosensors, which required technicians who could carry out painstaking work over long periods, and support through deep financial resources2.\n\nWant to speed up scientific progress? First understand how science policy works\n\nCambridge’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology has an exemplary history of facilitating a feedback loop between scientists and technicians. Principal investigators act as interpreters to translate scientific terms into technical engineering requirements to develop research instruments5. Cryo-electron microscopy, for example, a technique to create 3D images of biological molecules, was developed by integrating software and advanced cooling techniques. Rather than being supervised by one individual, this work was carried out by a self-organized multidisciplinary team of scientists and technicians who collaborated in iterative steps and adjustments.",

They are also more likely to be dissatisfied with aspects of the experience, such as their number of online friends, a survey of 3,340 adolescents in the United Kingdom has revealed.\n\nThe study, published today in Nature Human Behaviour1, explores how teenagers with specific mental-health conditions use social media, finding that participants with disorders such as anxiety and depression are more vulnerable to negative online experiences than are those with conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). “That is a question that very few studies have addressed, especially on such a large sample,” says study co-author Luisa Fassi, a specialist in young people’s mental health and social-media use at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nThe results are “a good warning to families that if your youth is vulnerable because of anxiety, a tendency to have depression or be low in mood, then social media is something that really needs to be carefully monitored”, says Anne Marie Albano, a clinical child and adolescent psychologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.\n\nOnline behaviour\n\nThe researchers analysed data from a 2017 survey of 11- to 19-year-olds conducted by the UK National Health Service (NHS). Participants underwent an in-depth clinical assessment and were asked about their use of social-media sites and how they feel about them. Sixteen per cent of respondents had at least one mental-health condition. Of those, 8% had ‘internalizing’ conditions, such as depression and anxiety — characterized by negative emotions towards the self — and 3% had externalizing conditions, such as ADHD, characterized by negative emotions towards others.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nThe analysis found that young people with mental-health conditions spent more time on social media overall, and those with internalizing conditions were more likely to compare themselves with others online than were those with externalizing conditions or no mental-health condition. Those with internalizing conditions were also more affected by comments or reactions to their posts and had less control over how much time they spent on platforms.",

As hypothesized, adolescents with mental health conditions reported spending more time on social media and were less happy about the number of online friends than adolescents without conditions. We also found hypothesized differences in social media use by condition type: adolescents with internalizing conditions reported spending more time on social media, engaging in more social comparison and experiencing greater impact of feedback on mood, alongside lower happiness about the number of online friends and lower honest self-disclosure. In contrast, those with externalizing conditions only reported higher time spent.

We propose to use behavioural game theory to study LLMs’ cooperation and coordination behaviour. Here we let different LLMs play finitely repeated 2 × 2 games with each other, with human-like strategies, and actual human players. Our results show that LLMs perform particularly well at self-interested games such as the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma family. However, they behave suboptimally in games that require coordination, such as the Battle of the Sexes. We verify that these behavioural signatures are stable across robustness checks. We also show how GPT-4’s behaviour can be modulated by providing additional information about its opponent and by using a ‘social chain-of-thought’ strategy. This also leads to better scores and more successful coordination when interacting with human players. These results enrich our understanding of LLMs’ social behaviour and pave the way for a behavioural game theory for machines.",

          "abstract": "Research from high-income countries has found negative outcomes associated with physical punishment. Yet, the extent to which such research evidence generalizes to children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is largely unknown. The objective of the current pre-registered study (PROSPERO: CRD42022347346) was to conduct a meta-analysis of the associations between childhood physical punishment and individual outcomes in LMICs. We identified eligible articles by searching for keywords related to physical punishment in six languages across 11 databases, with search periods from April to August 2021 and June to July 2024. This process yielded 5,072 unique records, of which 189 studies, comprising 1,490 unique effect sizes and representing 92 LMICs, met our inclusion criteria. Findings from random-effects multilevel meta-analyses indicated that physical punishment was associated with detrimental outcomes, including mental health problems, worse parent–child relationships, substance use, impaired social–emotional development, negative academic outcomes and heightened externalizing behaviour problems, among others. Despite some variation by contextual and study-level characteristics, all subgroup estimates were consistent in direction. Sensitivity checks indicated that these findings were not typical of other non-violent methods of discipline but were specific to physical punishment and psychological aggression. The analysis confirmed that physical punishment is associated with detrimental outcomes for individuals in LMICs. Additional research is needed to inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies and interventions to prevent the physical punishment of children and adolescents worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Global efforts to mitigate climate change are increasing pressure on heavy manufacturing industries to decarbonize production. The iron and steel industry is responsible for 7% of CO 2 emissions globally (2% in the United States) and is often a major employer in the regions where iron and steel is produced. Understanding the future prospects for workers in regions with high CO 2 emitting industries—including impacts of phasing out or evolving such industries—will be critical for informing regional economic and clean energy strategies. We simulate the impact of an “in-place” transition that replaces today’s integrated production with direct reduced iron (DRI) used in electric arc furnaces (EAFs), using Southwest Pennsylvania as an application of our generalizable approach. Our results suggest that the integrated steelmaking workforce today has the skills, knowledge, and abilities (SKAs) to fill over 95% of all jobs required by DRI/EAF facilities, but the number of jobs is only 25% of those at integrated plants. We also find that some occupational groups have greater general transferability into the broader job market, while other groups, such as production workers, are ill-equipped today based on current SKAs to transition out of the iron and steel industry. Our methodology further suggests factors that limit transitions: Around 85% of occupations are more limited by missing skills, while 15% are more limited by insufficient wages. These results may help to improve the design of social policy and the targeting of retraining programs, while the simulation approach can be readily adapted for other regions and industries.",

Recently excavated deposits sealed in an underground gallery at Chavín contained twenty-three artifacts of forms (especially bone tubes) associated with consumption of psychoactive plants elsewhere in the region. We here report, based on independent microbotanical and chemical analyses, two kinds of direct evidence for use of psychoactive plants in institutionalized ritual at Chavín. These results are direct evidence of psychoactive plants in archaeological bone tubes used as inhalers and the northernmost direct evidence of vilca and Nicotiana use in the pre-Hispanic Andes.",

          "abstract": "Social touch is crucial for human well-being, as a lack of tactile interactions increases anxiety, loneliness, and need for social support. To address the detrimental effects of social isolation, we build on cutting-edge research on social touch and movement sonification to investigate whether social tactile gestures could be recognized through sounds, a sensory channel giving access to remote information. Four online experiments investigated participants’ perception of auditory stimuli that were recorded with our “audio-touch” sonification technique, which captures the sounds of touch. In the first experiment, participants correctly categorized sonified skin-on-skin tactile gestures (i.e., stroking, rubbing, tapping, hitting). In the second experiment, the audio-touch sample consisted of the sonification of six socio-emotional intentions conveyed through touch (i.e., anger, attention, fear, joy, love, sympathy). Participants categorized above chance the socio-emotional intentions of skin-on-skin touches converted into sounds and coherently rated their valence. In two additional experiments, the surface involved in the touches (either skin or plastic) was shown to influence participants’ recognition of sonified gestures and socio-emotional intentions. Thus, our research unveils that specific information about social touch (i.e., gesture, emotions, and surface) can be recognized through sounds, when they are obtained with our specific sonifying methodology. This shows significant promise for providing remote access, through the auditory channel, to meaningful social touch interactions.",

          "abstract": "Globally, cities face increasing extreme heat, impacting comfort, health, and energy consumption. Infrastructure-based heat adaptation strategies can improve these outcomes, but each strategy has a unique mix of benefits and drawbacks. Here, we apply an urbanized meteorological model (WRF) with the newly integrated multilayer BEP-Tree street tree model to dynamically downscale Earth System Model projections and a 3-D microclimate model (TUF-Pedestrian) to simulate the street-scale radiation environment impacting pedestrians. We evaluate the performance of five heat adaptation strategies (street trees, cool roofs, green roofs, rooftop photovoltaics (PV), and reflective pavements) during extreme heat events in three cities with contrasting background climates (Toronto, Phoenix, and Miami), under contemporary and end-of-century projected climates, based on three metrics: outdoor heat stress, air conditioning (AC) energy use, and ventilation of vehicular air pollution. No single adaptation strategy improves all three outcomes. While street trees inhibit ventilation, they reduce outdoor heat stress four times more effectively than the next best strategy via shade provision, fully offsetting heat stress increases under a high-emissions end-of-century climate scenario in all cities studied. Cool roofs and green roofs moderately reduce heat stress and energy use. Alternatively, rooftop PV with energy storage can generate sufficient power for space cooling but have marginal effects on heat stress. Reflective pavements are the least effective across metrics. Where the ventilation of street-level emissions is of less concern, our results clearly support the combination of street trees and rooftop PV as a highly complementary and effective means of adaptive mitigation across different climates and neighborhood densities.",

          "abstract": "Hawaiian lobeliads exhibit extensive adaptive radiations and are considered the largest plant clade (143 species) endemic to any oceanic archipelago. Rapid insular radiations are prone to reticulate evolution, yet detecting hybridization is often limited by inadequate sampling of taxa or independent loci. We analyzed 633 nuclear loci (including tetraploid duplications) and whole plastomes for 89% of extant species to derive phylogenies for the Hawaiian lobeliads. Nuclear data provide strong support for nine major clades in both likelihood and ASTRAL analyses. All genera/sections are monophyletic except Clermontia and Cyanea . Nuclear and plastome phylogenies conflict on short, deep branches; the nuclear tree resolves a fleshy-fruited clade of Hawaiian Clermontia/Cyanea-Brighamia/Delissea , sister to Polynesian Sclerotheca , with both sister to a capsular-fruited Hawaiian clade. Incomplete lineage sorting in a rapid radiation starting 8.5–11.3 Ma is sufficient to explain uncertainty and cytonuclear discordance along the backbone. Sequence data support reticulation within Clermontia and especially Cyanea . Nuclear data identify 42 interisland dispersal events: 89% accord with the strict progression rule, involving movement to the next younger island in the hotspot chain, consistent with theory. Plastid data overestimate such events by 17%. Cyanea and Clermontia have undergone parallel adaptive radiations in elevational distribution and flower length on all major islands, with multiple founders and some interisland differences. Hawaiian lobeliad diversification was driven by an early intergeneric divergence in habitat, followed by parallel adaptive radiation and ecological speciation within Clermontia/Cyanea , combined with widespread single-island endemism, frequent interisland dispersal, and occasional hybridization.",

Conventional understanding of liquid manipulation relies on inhomogeneous chemical modifications or single-scale structure design. Here, we present how water is directionally navigated and spontaneously reallocated at high efficiency via the cross-scale topology on Tillandsia capitata leaves. These leaves feature transversely curved lanceolate macrostructures decorated by a layer of microtrichomes with varied morphologies. The macrostructure creates a lanceolate effect in the transport direction for fundamental navigation. At the same time, the microtrichomes serve dual functions: constructing a self-wetting superhydrophilic surface to facilitate the water transport speed and implementing water spreading in the opposite direction for autonomous reallocation. We explain the multiscale transport behavior through theoretic analysis and finite element simulations. Our findings demonstrate how cross-scale topographies jointly function in efficient autonomous fluid manipulation, with potential applications such as droplet driving, fog harvesting, and seawater desalination, offering pathways for improving liquid processing efficiency and reducing energy consumption.",

          "abstract": "Diverse genetic strategies are being pursued to control mosquito-borne infectious diseases. These strategies often rely on the release of nonbiting males to either reduce the target mosquito population or render them resistant to pathogens. Male-only releases are important as any contaminating females can bite and potentially transmit pathogens. Despite significant efforts, it remains a major bottleneck to reliably and efficiently separate males from females, especially when nontransgenic males are preferred. In the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti , sex is determined by a pair of homomorphic sex chromosomes, with the dominant male-determining locus (the M locus) and its counterpart (the m locus) embedded in an M-bearing and an m-bearing chromosome 1, respectively. We utilized both naturally occurring and engineered sex-linked recessive lethal alleles (RLAs) to create sex separation strains for Ae. aegypti on the basis of differential elimination of marked sex chromosomes (DeMark). DeMark strains are self-sustaining and produce nontransgenic males that are readily separated from individuals carrying RLA- and transgene-marked m chromosomes. For example, the marked m chromosome in the heterozygous mother in some strains was only inherited by her female progeny due to RLA-mediated incompatibility with the M-bearing chromosome in the father, producing nontransgenic males and transgenic females, generation after generation. We further explore strategies to conditionally eliminate females that contain marked sex chromosomes. We also discuss DeMark designs that are applicable for efficient sex separation in organisms with well-differentiated X and Y chromosomes, such as the Anopheles mosquitoes.",

          "abstract": "Membrane blebs have important roles in cell migration, apoptosis, and intercellular communication through extracellular vesicles (EVs). While plasma membranes (PM) typically maintain phosphatidylserine (PS) on their cytoplasmic leaflet, most blebs have PS exposed on their outer leaflet, revealing that loss of steady-state lipid asymmetry often accompanies PM blebbing. How these changes in PM lipid organization regulate membrane properties and affect bleb formation remains unknown. We confirmed that lipid scrambling through the scramblase TMEM16F is essential for chemically induced membrane blebbing across cell types, with the kinetics of PS exposure being tightly coupled to the kinetics of bleb formation. Measurement of lipid packing with environment-sensitive probes revealed that lipid scrambling changes the physical properties of the PM, reducing lipid packing and facilitating the bilayer bending required for bleb formation. Accordingly, reducing lipid packing of the PM through cholesterol extraction, elevated temperature, or treatment with biological amphiphiles promoted blebbing in the absence of TMEM16F. Consistent with these cellular observations, blebbing in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos measured via EV production was significantly reduced by depleting the TMEM16-homolog ANOH-2. Our findings suggest that changing membrane biophysical properties by lipid scrambling is an important contributor to the formation of blebs and EVs and potentially other cellular processes involving PM deformation.",

          "abstract": "How central and peripheral circadian clocks regulate protein metabolism and affect tissue mass homeostasis has been unclear. Circadian shifts in the balance between anabolism and catabolism control muscle growth rate in young zebrafish independent of behavioral cycles. Here, we show that the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy, which mediate muscle protein degradation, are each upregulated at night under the control of the muscle peripheral clock. Perturbation of the muscle transcriptional molecular clock disrupts nocturnal proteolysis, increases muscle growth measured over 12 h, and compromises muscle function. Mechanistically, the shifting circadian balance of Ror and Rev-erb regulates nocturnal UPS, autophagy, and muscle growth through altered TORC1 activity. Although environmental zeitgebers initially mitigate defects, lifelong muscle clock inhibition reduces muscle size and growth rate, accelerating aging-related loss of muscle mass and function. Circadian misalignment such as shift work, sleep deprivation, or dementia may thus unsettle muscle proteostasis, contributing to muscle wasting and sarcopenia.",

          "abstract": "Within Earth’s climate system, the ocean, cryosphere, and vegetation exhibit hysteresis behavior such that their state depends on their past and not merely on their current boundary conditions. The atmosphere’s fast mixing time scales were thought to inhibit the necessary memory effect for such multistability. Here, we show that moisture accumulation within the atmospheric column generates hysteresis in monsoon circulation independent of oceanic heat storage and yields two stable atmospheric states for the same solar insolation. The dynamics of monsoon rainfall is thus that of a seasonal transition between two stable states. The resulting hysteresis is shown in observational data and reproduced in a general circulation model where it increases with decreasing oceanic memory and exhibits the two distinct states that persist for more than 60 y. They are stabilized by moisture accumulation within the atmospheric column that carries information across time scales much longer than those typical for mixing. The possibility of abrupt shifts between these two states has implications for the future evolution of global monsoon rainfall that is crucial for the agricultural productivity currently feeding more than two billion people.",

Here, we optimized two biosensors for thiol–disulfide redox (RoTq-Off and RoTq-On) with opposite changes in fluorescence lifetime in response to oxidation. Using biophysical approaches, we showed that the high-lifetime states of these sensors lock the chromophore more firmly in place than their low-lifetime states do. Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of RoTq-On fused to a glutaredoxin (Grx1) enabled robust, straightforward monitoring of cytosolic glutathione redox state in acute mouse brain slices. The motional mechanism described here is probably common and may inform the design of other lifetime-readout sensors; the Grx1-RoTq-On fusion sensor will be useful for studying glutathione redox in physiology.",

          "abstract": "PARK7/DJ-1, a redox-sensitive protein implicated in neurodegeneration, cancer, and inflammation, exhibits increased secretion under stress. We previously demonstrated that, as a leaderless protein, PARK7 relies on an unconventional autophagy pathway for stress-induced secretion. The current study delves deeper into the mechanisms governing PARK7 secretion under oxidative stress triggered by the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Here, we revealed that 6-OHDA-induced autophagic flux is critical for PARK7 secretion. Downregulation of syntaxin 17 (STX17), a SNARE protein crucial for autophagosome-lysosome fusion and cargo degradation, hindered PARK7 secretion. Likewise, impairing lysosomal function with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) or chloroquine (CQ) diminished PARK7 release, highlighting the importance of functional lysosomes, potentially in the form of secretory autolysosomes, in PARK7 release. We also found that 6-OHDA appeared to promote the unfolding of PARK7, allowing its selective recognition by the chaperone HSPA8 via KFERQ-like motifs, leading to PARK7 translocation to the lysosomal membrane through LAMP2 via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Additionally, a dedicated SNARE complex comprising Qabc-SNAREs (STX3/4, VTI1B, and STX8) and R-SNARE SEC22B mediates the fusion of PARK7-containing autolysosomes with the plasma membrane, facilitating the extracellular release of PARK7. Hence, this study uncovers a mechanism where 6-OHDA-induced autophagic flux drives the unconventional secretion of PARK7, involving CMA for PARK7 translocation to lysosomes and specialized SNARE complexes for membrane fusion events.",

          "abstract": "Evidence across a broad range of disciplines has demonstrated how individuals’ social environments can impact their health, lifespan, reproduction, and ultimately their evolutionary fitness. Past research has primarily focused on either traits specific to individuals or wider traits of social groups, linking these with a component of fitness. In this study, we examined how both individual- and group-level social traits in 164 wild mountain gorillas combine to influence multiple pathways impacting fitness over 21 y. First, we highlight key sex differences in the costs and benefits of social bonds, with strong and stable social bonds linked with lower risk of illness in females, but higher risk of illness in males. Second, we demonstrate important trade-offs in the fitness consequences of sociality, with strong and stable bonds in males linked with decreases in injury but increases in illness. Finally, we show the extensive moderating effects of group-level traits on the fitness consequences of individual-level social traits. For example, in small groups, females with strong bonds benefitted from lower rates of illness, but also showed lower birth rates, while in large groups, females with strong bonds experienced higher rates of illness but also higher birth rates. These findings highlight the complexity of selection acting on social traits, where the fitness consequences of individual’s social phenotypes are highly context dependent. We argue that this variability in the fitness benefits of sociality has likely played a fundamental role in maintaining the wide diversity of social phenotypes observed within species.",

          "abstract": "Geological observations informed by climate dynamics imply that the oceans were 99.9% covered by light-blocking ice shelves during two discrete, self-reversing Snowball Earth epochs spanning a combined 60 to 70 Myr of the Cryogenian Period (720 to 635 Ma). The timescale for initial ice advances across the tropical oceans is ~300 y in an ice−atmosphere−ocean general circulation model in Cryogenian paleogeography. Areas of optically thin oceanic ice are usually invoked to account for fossil marine phototrophs, including macroscopic multicellular eukaryotes, before and after each Snowball, but different taxa. Ecosystem relocation is a scenario that does not require thin marine ice. Assume that long before Cryogenian Snowballs, diverse supra- and periglacial biomes were established in polar−alpine regions. When the Snowball onsets occurred, those biomes migrated in step with their ice margins to the equatorial zone of net sublimation. There, they prospered and evolved, their habitat areas expanded, and the cruelty of winter reduced. Nutrients were supplied by dust (loess) derived from cozonal ablative lands where surface winds were strong. When each Snowball finally ended, those biomes were mostly inundated by the meltwater-dominated and rapidly warming lid of a nutrient-rich but depauperate ocean. Some taxa returned to the mountaintops while others restocked the oceans. This ecosystem relocation scenario makes testable predictions. The lineages required for post-Cryogenian biotic radiations should be present in modern polar−alpine biomes. Legacies of polar−alpine ancestry should be found in the genomes of living organisms. Examples of such tests are highlighted herein.",

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease and adenine base editor (ABE) technologies in generating allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, utilizing extensive in vitro and in vivo analyses. Both methods achieved high editing efficiencies across four target genes, critical for mitigating graft-versus-host disease and allograft rejection: TRAC or CD3E , B2M , CIITA , and PVR . Notably, ABE demonstrated higher manufacturing yields and distinct off-target profiles compared to Cas9, with translocations observed exclusively in Cas9-edited products. Functionally, ABE-edited CAR T cells exhibited superior in vitro effector functions under continuous antigen stimulation, including enhanced proliferative capacity and increased surface CAR expression. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ABE editing resulted in reduced activation of p53 and DNA damage response pathways at baseline, along with sustained activation of metabolic pathways during antigen stress. Consistently, Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing data indicated that Cas9-edited, but not ABE-edited, CAR T cells showed enrichment of chromatin accessibility peaks associated with double-strand break repair and DNA damage response pathways. In a preclinical leukemia model, ABE-edited CAR T cells demonstrated improved tumor control and extended overall survival compared to their Cas9-edited counterparts.

Using chronic viral infection, we show that histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) was specifically required for the formation of antigen-specific T EX -int cells at the effector phase of responses. Single-cell transcriptomics validated that Hdac1 deficiency depleted T EX -int cells and revealed that Hdac1 was critical for positive regulation of T EX -int-characteristic genes, including Cx3cr1 , Cxcr6 , and Klf2 . Furthermore, profiling chromatin accessibility landscape in T EX subsets demonstrated that loss of Hdac1 resulted in a prevalent increase in chromatin open state, as evidently observed at the exhaustion program genes, which were linked to induced expression of exhaustion-inducing Tox transcription factor, PD1 and Lag3 coinhibitory receptors in T EX cells. Hdac1 thus has dual regulatory functions: promoting T EX -int cell fate and preventing excessive activation of the exhaustion program to curtail uncontrolled virus replication.",

Depending on the solvent, either rectangular M 2 L 2 cages ( 5′ and 5 ) form in 1,4-dioxane or hexagonal M 3 L 3 cages ( 6 ) in 1,1′,2,2′-tetrachloroethane. The solvent dictates the cage type and enables reversible transformation between cages 5 and 6 .

At least four known stoichiometries have been established, each with distinct structures. These compounds have potential applications as refractory coatings, catalysts, and magnetic materials. We modeled the stability of RE 3 PO 7 [RE 3 (PO 4 )O 3 ] with respect to rare earth sesquioxides (RE 2 O 3 ) and orthophosphates (REPO 4 ) using DFT computations with the GGA-PBE and r2SCAN exchange-correlation functionals. Phase stability predictions were consistent between the two functionals, while r2SCAN calculations of formation enthalpies for REPO 4 showed better agreement with experimental data. RE 3 PO 7 phases for La–Dy were predicted to be stable at 0 K, with a space group change from Cm to C 2 /m starting with Sm. RE 3 PO 7 phases for Y, Ho, and Er were found to be stabilized by lattice vibrational entropies at temperatures above 800 K, 1,000 K, and 1,600 K, respectively. The formation of predicted cerium (III) oxyphosphate, isostructural to Nd 3 (PO) 4 O 3 , was confirmed through laser melting of monazite (CePO 4 ). Ce 3 (PO 4 )O 3 is monoclinic (space group Cm ) with experimentally measured cell parameters a = 12.989(1) Å, b = 13.413(1) Å, c = 12.396(1) Å, β = 108.06(1)°. The existence of a Ce member of RE 7 P 3 O 18 family with unknown structure was experimentally established. This work invites further exploration of RE oxyphosphates as functional materials and indicates the possible formation of Ce oxyphosphate upon monazite melting during impact events and their potential use in geothermometry.",

          "abstract": "Genes and the environment jointly shape individual traits, but the influence of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), arising from the genetic composition of interacting conspecific individuals, is often ignored or underemphasized. Moreover, because of practical challenges in characterizing IGEs, empirical research has fallen behind theoretical advancement. The fire ant Solenopsis invicta offers a uniquely suitable study system due to its distinct colony-level phenotypic variation (monogyne and polygyne social forms) attributed to IGEs of a social-supergene variant ( b allele). A minority of b -carrying workers ( Bb genotype) can trigger colony-level conversion from monogyne (single queen per colony) to polygyne (multiple queens per colony) behavior. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying this process via 400-ant microcolonies. We first showed that assimilated Bb workers reduce aggression by host BB workers toward Bb queens, thus inducing polygyny, at rates observed earlier in experiments that used full-size (&gt;20,000 ants) colonies. We then demonstrated that social conversion is facilitated by cuticular contact between the worker types, and verified the presence of nonvolatile cuticular pheromones that are necessary but not sufficient components underpinning this process. Follow-up experiments suggested that a second, polygyne worker-produced pheromone that is only released once such workers detect a Bb queen is also necessary but again insufficient, for full expression of the conversion phenomenon. Thus, multiple pheromonal components linked to presence of the b supergene allele in colony workers appear to be involved in shaping social environments and thereby inducing, via IGEs, the transformation from monogyne to polygyne fire ant societies.",

However, the nuclear translocation and molecular mechanism of VCP for DDR remain elusive. Here, we define VCP as a KPNB1 interacting protein through a combination of chemical and immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry approaches. Further biochemical studies elucidate that KPNB1 directly transports VCP into the nucleus. We also identify withaferin A (WA) as a small molecule that can retard VCP nuclear localization via covalent binding to CYS 158 of KPNB1. Further studies verify WA as an effective antitumor drug candidate via blocking VCP nuclear localization to impact on the DDR pathway in vivo.

Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the substrate-engaged, MIDN-bound human proteasome in two conformational states. MIDN induces proteasome conformations similarly to ubiquitinated substrates by using its ubiquitin-like domain to bind to the deubiquitinase RPN11 (PSMD14). By simultaneously binding to RPN1 (PSMD2) with its C-terminal α-helix, MIDN positions its substrate-carrying Catch domain above the proteasome ATPase channel through which substrates are translocated before degradation. Our findings suggest that both ubiquitin-like domain and C-terminal α-helix must bind to the proteasome for MIDN to stimulate proteasome activity.",

The radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans is a spherical bacterium protected by a thick and unusual cell envelope. It has been reported to divide using a distinctive mode of septation in which two septa originating from opposite sides of the cell progress with a flat leading edge until meeting and fusing at mid-cell. In the present study, we have combined conventional and superresolution fluorescence microscopy of live bacteria with in situ cryogenic electron tomography of bacterial lamellae to investigate the septation process in D. radiodurans . This work provides important insight into i) the complex architecture and multilayered composition of the cell envelope of this bacterium, ii) the unusual “sliding doors” septation process and iii) the sequence of events and molecular mechanisms underlying septal closure, including the synthesis of a FtsZ-dependent peptidoglycan layer that rigidifies and straightens the growing septa.",

          "abstract": "Heterotrimeric Gα:Gβγ G proteins function as molecular switches downstream of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). They alternate between a heterotrimeric GDP-bound OFF-state and a GTP-bound ON-state in which Gα GTP is separated from the Gβγ dimer. Consequently, pharmacological tools to securely prevent the OFF-ON transition are of utmost importance to investigate their molecular switch function, specific contribution to GPCR signal transduction, and potential as drug targets. FR900359 (FR) and YM-254890 (YM), two natural cyclic peptides and highly specific inhibitors of Gq/11 heterotrimers, are exactly such tools. To date, their efficient and long-lasting inhibition of Gq/11 signaling has been attributed solely to a wedge-like binding to Gα, thereby preventing separation of the GTPase and α-helical domains and thus GDP release. Here, we use X-ray crystallography, biochemical and signaling assays, and BRET-based biosensors to show that FR and YM also function as stabilizers of the Gα:Gβγ subunit interface. Our high-resolution structures reveal a network of residues in Gα and two highly conserved amino acids in Gβ that are targeted by FR and YM to glue the Gβγ complex to the inactive Gα GDP subunit. Unlike all previously developed nucleotide-state specific inhibitors that sequester Gα in its OFF-state but compete with Gβγ, FR and YM actively promote the inhibitory occlusion of Gα GDP by Gβγ. In doing so, they securely lock the entire heterotrimer, not just Gα, in its inactive state. Our results identify FR and YM as molecular glues for Gα and Gβγ that combine simultaneous binding to both subunits with inhibition of G protein signaling.",

          "abstract": "Diverse single-stranded RNA viruses employ different host cellular organelles or membrane systems to compartmentalize their replication intermediates and proviral factors, ensuring robust replication. Replication of Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), an Alphaflexiviridae family, is tightly associated with chloroplasts and dynamic cytosolic viral replication complex (VRC) clusters. BaMV VRC clusters comprise double-stranded viral RNA, BaMV replicase (Rep BaMV ), and mitochondrial outer membrane protein, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). In this study, we demonstrate that host glycolytic enolase (ENO) binds to untranslated regions of BaMV RNA independently of ENO hydrolytic activity. However, the structural integrity of ENO is essential for its direct interaction with Rep BaMV , and its positive regulating role in BaMV replication and the size of BaMV VRC clusters. Additionally, ENO, pyruvate kinase (PYK), and VDAC colocalize within cytosolic BaMV VRC clusters embedded in the convoluted endomembrane reticulum (ER) along with ER-targeted viral movement proteins under BaMV infection. This association suggests that the ENO-PYK-VDAC metabolon, with ENO serving as a scaffold to link chloroplasts and mitochondria, may play a pivotal role in BaMV robust replication.

          "abstract": "Representing the locations of places so that we can use them as landmarks is critical to our ability to navigate through large-scale spaces—a process referred to as “map-based navigation.” While many neuroimaging studies in adults have revealed that this ability involves the retrosplenial complex (RSC)—a scene-selective region in the medial parietal cortex—nothing is known about how this cortical system develops. So, does it develop only late in childhood, as generally assumed from some behavioral studies? Or is it, perhaps counterintuitively, present in the first few years of life? To test this question, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) multivoxel pattern analysis and a virtual town paradigm, we investigated the representation of location information in the RSC of 5-y-olds. We found that i) the RSC in 5-y-olds already represents the locations of particular buildings in the town (e.g., the ice cream store by the mountain versus by the lake), but not their category membership (e.g., ice cream store, regardless of location), and ii) this neural representation is correlated with their performance on a location task. Using multidimensional scaling, we also found that the neural representation of the buildings in RSC reflects the actual layout of the virtual town. Finally, the parahippocampal place area—a scene-selective region implicated in scene categorization, not map-based navigation—did not represent location information, but instead category information, the exact opposite of RSC. Taken together, these findings reveal the early development of navigationally relevant location information in RSC and thus the early origins of map-based navigation.",

Simply changing the strength of interspecies lateral association, we generate two types of gels: one in which the two components demix and another one in which the two species wrap around each other. We show that demixed gels have structure and rheology that are largely unaffected by the strength of attraction between the components. In contrast, architecture and material properties of intertwined gels strongly depend on interspecies “stickiness” and volume exclusion. These results can be used as the basis of a design principle for double networks which are made to emphasize either stability to perturbations or responsiveness to stimuli. Similar ideas could be used to interpret naturally occurring multicomponent gels.",

          "abstract": "In an era of unprecedented biodiversity loss, the need for standardized practices to describe biological variation is becoming increasingly important. As with all scientific endeavors, species delimitation needs to be explicit, testable, and refutable. A fundamental task in species delimitation is distinguishing within-species variation from among-species variation. Many species that are distributed across large geographic areas exhibit levels of genetic variation that are as great or greater than those that exist between well-defined sympatric species. Here, we provide a workflow to distinguish between intra- and interspecific genetic variation and apply the workflow to a taxonomically problematic group of frogs (the Rana pipiens complex, or leopard frogs) that are widely distributed across Mexico and Central America. Our workflow makes use of recent advancements that pair genome-scale datasets with model-based species delimitation methods, while emphasizing the need for positive evidence of reproductive isolation to confirm the validity of geographically contiguous species boundaries. We find that intraspecific geographic variation in widespread leopard frog species has resulted in considerable taxonomic inflation of species. Ten currently recognized species are not supported in our analyses, and we here synonymize them with previously named taxa. Furthermore, we find positive evidence for the presence of three undescribed species. In addition to proposing these taxonomic changes, we provide descriptions of the data or analyses that would be needed to refute and overturn our recommendations. We recommend that all species delimitation studies (especially of geographically variable groups) clarify what new evidence would be sufficient to change the taxonomic recommendations.",

It is usually accepted that the main mechanism of proton transfer is a result of hopping between neighboring water molecules and amino acid side chains. It was recently suggested that the proton transfer can be simultaneously coupled with electron transfer. As life is homochiral, proton transfer in biology is occurring in a chiral environment. In this environment, the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect relating to electron transfer and chirality is expected to occur. The present work establishes that the proton transfer is coupled to a specific electron spin polarization in lysozyme crystals, associating proton transfer to electron movement and polarization. To preserve total angular momentum, this motion may be coupled to chiral phonons that propagate in the crystal. Our work shows that the interaction of the electrons’ spin and phonons is very significant in proton transfer through lysosome crystals. Injecting the opposite electron spin into the lysosome crystal results in a significant change in proton transfer impedance. This study presents the support for the proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism and indicates the importance of spin polarization in the process.",

However, measurements of intracellular neuronal ATP ([ATP] i ), ultimately reporting the balance of ATP synthesis and consumption during SDs, have not yet been conducted. Here, we investigated neuronal ATP homeostasis during SDs using two-photon imaging in acute brain slices from adult mice expressing the ATP sensor ATeam1.03 YEMK in neurons. SDs were induced by application of potassium chloride or by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and detected by recording the local field potential, extracellular potassium, as well as the intrinsic optical signal. We found that, in the presence of oxygen and glucose, SDs were accompanied by a substantial but transient drop in neuronal ATP sensor signals, corresponding to a drop in ATP. OGD, which prior to SDs was accompanied by only a slight reduction in ATP signals, led to a large, terminal drop in ATP signals during SDs. Subsequently, we investigated whether neurons could still regenerate ATP if oxygen and glucose were promptly resupplied following SD detection, and show that ATP depletion was essentially reversible in most cells. Our findings indicate that SDs are accompanied by a substantial increase in ATP consumption beyond production. This, under conditions that mimic reduced blood supply, leads to a breakdown of [ATP] i . Therefore, our findings support therapeutic strategies targeting SDs after cerebral ischemia.",

          "abstract": "Sleep is an essential component of our daily life. A mutation in human salt induced kinase 3 (hSIK3), which is critical for regulating sleep duration and depth in rodents, is associated with natural short sleep (NSS), a condition characterized by reduced daily sleep duration in human subjects. This NSS hSIK3-N783Y mutation results in diminished kinase activity in vitro. In a mouse model, the presence of the NSS hSIK3-N783Y mutation leads to a decrease in sleep time and an increase in electroencephalogram delta power. At the phosphoproteomic level, the SIK3-N783Y mutation induces substantial changes predominantly at synaptic sites. Bioinformatic analysis has identified several sleep-related kinase alterations triggered by the SIK3-N783Y mutation, including changes in protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase. These findings underscore the conserved function of SIK3 as a critical gene in human sleep regulation and provide insights into the kinase regulatory network governing sleep.",

In this study, we analyzed circadian time-dependent changes in cell types within the mouse tongue epithelium. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we observed circadian time-dependent changes in the populations of stem/progenitor cells and the differentiated cells in mice tongues. Notably, we observed time-dependent changes in the type II taste cell population, which were abolished by ablation of taste bud stem cells, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation within the taste cell population. Through experiments with taste bud organoids (TBOs), we found a 24-h cell cycle period, which was disrupted by the knockdown of the core-clock gene Bmal1 . In TBOs, both cell divisions and apoptotic cells exhibited circadian time-dependent phenotypes. Interestingly, the time-dependent changes in cell death disappeared in the stem cell–ablated TBOs, indicating that the diurnal supply of newly born cells is essential for the rhythmic cell death phenotype. Additionally, taste tests conducted at different times of the day revealed time-dependent sensitivity changes originating from type II taste cells in mice. These findings suggest that the time-dependent changes in taste cell population are driven by circadian clock–regulated cell cycle progression and control time-dependent physiological regulation in the mouse tongue.",

          "abstract": "The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is the most notable global biodiversity pattern, but its underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. The evolutionary speed hypothesis (ESH) posits that molecular rates play a crucial role in shaping the LDG, suggesting that higher temperatures accelerate molecular rates, thereby facilitating rapid speciation and accumulation of biodiversity in the tropics. However, whether ESH can explain the LDG across diverse taxonomic groups remains debated, and systematic examinations of its two key predictions using consistent datasets and methodologies across vertebrates are lacking. Here, we tested ESH using molecular rates from mitochondrial (5,424 species) and nuclear (1,512 species) genomes across major vertebrate groups, including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. Our findings revealed distinct latitudinal patterns in the absolute synonymous substitution rate (dS), which were influenced by thermoregulatory strategies. Specifically, the dS increases with ambient temperature and decreases with latitude in ectotherms but shows no correlation in most endotherms. These distinct patterns are likely attributed to different key predictors of dS between thermogroups, with temperature playing a major role only in ectotherms. For mitochondrial genes, absolute nonsynonymous substitution rates (dN) increase with temperature, likely driven by mutation rates in ectotherms and purifying selection in endotherms. However, neither mitochondrial dS nor dN correlates with diversification rates across vertebrates, contradicting the second prediction of ESH. For nuclear rates, the ESH was supported in reptiles and amphibians but not in mammals, birds, or fishes. In conclusion, our results provide limited support for ESH in vertebrates, underscoring the intricate processes that shape the LDG.",

To address these challenges, we developed an innovative analytical approach that combines Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy with a Raman spectral library constructed in silico using density functional theory (DFT)-calculated spectra. This method overcomes several limitations associated with traditional experimental libraries, including spectral background interference, solvent effects, and commercially unavailable or challenging to synthesize compounds. Our methodology employs a physics-informed machine learning pipeline that operates in two stages: the characteristic peak extraction (CaPE) algorithm, which isolates distinctive spectral features, and the characteristic peak similarity (CaPSim) algorithm, which identifies analytes with high robustness to spectral shifts and amplitude variations. Validation of this approach showed strong similarity values (&gt;0.6) between DFT-calculated and experimental Surface-enhanced Raman spectra for multiple PAHs, confirming its accuracy and discriminative capability. This study establishes the viability of DFT-calculated spectra as reliable references for identifying analytes that lack experimental reference spectra, including those formed through environmental modification of PAHs. This advancement addresses a critical gap in environmental monitoring, providing a valuable tool for assessing public health risks associated with these contaminants.",

          "abstract": "A key unresolved question in microbial ecology is how the extraordinary diversity of microbiomes emerges from the interactions among their many functionally distinct populations. This process is driven in part by the cross-feeding networks that help to structure these systems, in which consumers use resources to fuel their metabolism, creating by-products which can be used by others in the community. Understanding the effects of cross-feeding presents a major challenge, as it creates complex interdependencies between populations which can be hard to untangle. We address this problem using the tools of network science to develop a structural microbial community model. Using methods from percolation theory, we identify feasible community states for cross-feeding network structures in which the needs of consumers are met by metabolite production across the community. We identify tipping points at which small changes in structure can cause the catastrophic collapse of cross-feeding networks and abrupt declines in microbial community diversity. Our results are an example of a well-defined tipping point in a complex ecological system and provide insight into the fundamental processes shaping microbiomes and their robustness. We further demonstrate this by considering how network attacks affect community diversity and apply our results to show how the apparent difficulty in culturing the microbial diversity emerges as an inherent property of their cross-feeding networks.",

In contrast to noninteracting systems used as amplifiers, we demonstrate that interactions resulting from random atomic collisions give rise to two distinct amplification phenomena. These phenomena provide essential resources for enhancing quantum sensing capabilities. Our results show that magnetic fields can be amplified by at least two orders of magnitude, enhancing magnetic sensitivity to the femtotesla per root hertz level. Additionally, we report a counterpart phenomenon, deamplification, where the magnetic noise response is suppressed by at least one order of magnitude within certain frequency regimes. In this work alkali-metal and noble-gas spins are weakly coupled. We further explore how the performance of amplification changes with the interaction strength as the two spin gases gradually enter the strong-coupling regime, unveiling hitherto unexplored amplification effects that hold promise for enhancing precision measurements.",

Yet, several lineages have evolved the ability to move their jaws laterally, enabling major innovations, like chewing. While lateral jaw motions are primarily known in tetrapods, here, we show that an ecologically dominant lineage of reef fishes (Zanclidae and Acanthuridae) has evolved the ability to laterally rotate their jaws during feeding. This unique function substantially expands both the kinematic versatility and known diversity of vertebrate jaw mechanisms, adding to the growing list of innovations that followed the origin of jaws. Within Acanthuridae, this increased kinematic versatility may allow for algal detachment with minimal movement of the rest of the body, facilitating rapid biting within the same microtopographic location, and thus, this lineage having the highest bite rates among biting reef fishes. This innovation may have thus helped create one of the most ecologically diverse and speciose herbivorous reef fish lineages. Our results highlight the ecological and evolutionary impact of lateral jaw rotation within vertebrates, and potentially how this novelty led to a significant change in coral reef trophodynamics.",

Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells are a subset of enteroendocrine cells that detect noxious stimuli within the gut lumen, such as chemical irritants and microbial byproducts, and transduce this information to sensory nerve fibers to elicit defensive responses such as nausea and visceral pain. While much has recently been learned about the pharmacological and biophysical characteristics of EC cells, a more broadscale investigation of their properties has been hindered by their relatively low prevalence and sparse anatomical distribution within the gut epithelium. Here, we introduce a method for large-scale parallel analysis of individual EC cell activity within a physiologically relevant epithelial context. Using this approach, we identify somatostatin-28 as a potent inhibitor of both basal and stimulus-evoked serotonin release from EC cells and delineate the signaling pathway that underlies this modulatory response. Our analysis suggests that targeting this inhibitory signaling pathway may offer therapeutic avenues for treating gastrointestinal disorders associated with EC cell function and dysregulated serotonin signaling. Together with the ongoing development of specific biosensors, this platform provides a template for the efficient characterization of other rare sensory cell types and their pharmacological modulators.",

Here, we demonstrate that neutrophils recruited in murine colitis and infection models, idiopathic IBD, and chronic granulomatous disease-associated IBD undergo extensive transcriptional reprogramming, resulting in the emergence of neutrophil populations that feature unique DUOX2 NADPH oxidase expression. Functional studies utilizing mice with myeloid and neutrophil specific DUOX2 inactivation reveal a vital and dichotomous role for this NADPH oxidase in both colitis and intestinal infection. Niche-directed reprogramming promoted a DUOX2-dependent chemokine and cytokine-rich intestinal environment that amplified and prolonged inflammatory responses, suggesting that selectively suppressing DUOX2 may constitute an anti-inflammatory strategy for IBD treatment. Altering spatiotemporal redox signaling by de novo expression of a ROS-generating enzyme represents an important feature for functional neutrophil diversification in disease, with implications for other neutrophil-driven diseases in specialized niches.",

On a planetary scale, paleontological evidence suggests that this transition was associated with major faunal turnovers, sometimes even regarded as a mass extinction crisis. In South America, there is no consensus on the response of the endemic mammals to this transition. Here, using a vetted fossil dataset and cutting-edge Bayesian methods, we analyzed the dynamics of South American mammal (SAM) diversification and their possible drivers across latitude (tropical vs. extratropical), taxonomic groups, and trophic guilds throughout the Eocene−Oligocene ( ca. 56 to 23 Ma). Our results did not evidence any mass extinction among SAM at the EOT. Instead, they experienced a gradual and long-term diversity decline from the middle Eocene to the early Oligocene, followed by a sudden waxing-and-waning diversity associated with a large taxonomic—but not ecological—turnover. Tropical and extratropical lineages have had very distinct macroevolutionary histories. No effective change in the pace at which tropical lineages diversify was found, thus favoring the tropical stability hypothesis proposed by Wallace. Diversity-dependent effects, temperature, and Andean uplift were recovered as probable drivers of SAM diversification across the period. Contrasting evidence casts doubt on the common hypothesis primarily linking Oligocene faunal changes to grassland expansion. Our findings illustrate the uniqueness of the deep-time interplay between endemic SAM and their physical environment in a context of climatic shift, highlighting the need to consider regional idiosyncrasies for understanding the coevolution of life and climate.",

          "abstract": "Cancer cells frequently reprogram one-carbon metabolic pathways to fulfill their vigorous demands of biosynthesis and antioxidant defense for survival and proliferation. Dysfunction of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes is critically involved in this process, but the precise mechanisms by which cancer cells actively trigger one-carbon metabolic alterations remain incompletely elucidated. Here, by using untargeted metabolomic analysis, we identify the oncoprotein SE translocation (SET) as a key regulator of one-carbon metabolism in cancer cells. SET physically interacts with mitochondrial SHMT2 and facilitates SHMT2 enzymatic activity. Loss of SET profoundly suppresses serine-derived one-carbon metabolic flux, whereas reexpression of ectopic SET leads to the opposite effect. Notably, although the presence of SHMT2 is critical for SET-mediated one-carbon metabolic alterations, the depletion of SHMT2 alone is insufficient to antagonize SET-induced tumor growth, probably due to functional compensation by its cytosolic isozyme SHMT1 upon SHMT2 knockdown. Instead, pharmacological targeting of cellular SHMT (including both SHMT1 and SHMT2) activity results in dramatic suppression of SET-induced tumor growth. Moreover, by using a Kras/Lkb1 mutation-driven lung tumor mouse model, we demonstrate that the loss of SET compromises both tumor formation and intratumoral SHMT2 enzymatic activity. Clinically, the overexpression of SET and SHMT2 is observed in lung tumors, both of which correlate with poor prognosis. Our study reveals a SET–SHMT2 axis in regulating serine-derived one-carbon metabolism and uncovers one-carbon metabolic reprogramming as a mechanism for SET-driven tumorigenesis.",

Here, we model directional decision-making in chemotactic amoeboid cells as a stimulus-dependent actin recruitment contest. Pseudopods extending from the cell body compete for a finite actin pool to push the cell in their direction until one pseudopod wins and determines the direction of movement. Our minimal model provides a quantitative understanding of the strategies cells use to reach the physical limit of accurate chemotaxis, aligning with data without explicit gradient sensing or cellular memory for persistence. To generalize our model, we employ reinforcement learning optimization to study the effect of pseudopod suppression, a simple but effective cellular algorithm by which cells can suppress possible directions of movement. Different pseudopod-based chemotaxis strategies emerge naturally depending on the environment and its dynamics. For instance, in static gradients, cells can react faster at the cost of pseudopod accuracy, which is particularly useful in noisy, shallow gradients where it paradoxically increases chemotactic accuracy. In contrast, in dynamics gradients, cells form de novo pseudopods. Overall, our work demonstrates mechanical intelligence for high chemotaxis performance with minimal cellular regulation.",

With the atheroprone flow upregulating METTL3 and m 6 A RNA hypermethylation, we investigate the role of METTL3 in atheroprone flow–induced glycolysis in ECs in vitro and in vivo. Compared to pulsatile shear stress (PS, atheroprotective flow), oscillatory shear stress (OS, atheroprone flow) increases METTL3 expression to enhance the m 6 A modifications of mRNAs encoding HK1, PFKFB3, and GCKR, which are rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis. These augmented m 6 A modifications increase the expressions of HK1 and PFKFB3 while decreasing GCKR, resulting in elevated EC glycolysis, as revealed by seahorse analysis. Moreover, a stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging study demonstrates the elevation of glucose incorporation into de novo synthesized lipids in ECs under atheroprone flow in vitro and in vivo. Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) drug, represses METTL3 expression, thereby mitigating OS-induced glycolysis in ECs. These data suggest mechanisms by which METTL3 links EC mechanotransduction with metabolic reprogramming under atherogenic conditions.",

          "abstract": "While current arousal level assessments in patients with disorders of consciousness discriminate altered states of consciousness, there are significant limitations in characterizing the transition from one state to another or quantifying the frequent arousal level fluctuations observed in a patient. Here, we identified a repeated, temporally discrete, dynamical pattern evident in the recovery of consciousness from anesthesia and brain injury coma models in rodents. We prospectively validated these features we label “Arousal Units” (AU) in neonatal humans recovering from static hypoxic injuries and senior patients emerging from anesthesia indicating their generalizability. The AUs lawfully link changes in spectral power and breathing frequency and reliably associate with motor changes. Distinctive cortical patterns within AUs can be transformed into arousal indices, determining arousal levels. The reliability of these events is demonstrated across intact and brain-injured states and translates to the human brain; extracting these stereotyped dynamics could aid anesthesia monitoring, tracking coma recovery, and identifying cognitive motor dissociation.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to anticipate and adapt to future climate can benefit from historical experiences. We examine agroclimatic conditions over the past 50 y for five major crops around the world. Most regions experienced rapid warming relative to interannual variability, with 45% of summer and 32% of winter crop area warming by more than two SD (σ). Vapor pressure deficit (VPD), a key driver of plant water stress, also increased in most temperate regions but not in the tropics. Precipitation trends, while important in some locations, were generally below 1σ. Historical climate model simulations show that observed changes in crops’ climate would have been well predicted by models run with historical forcings, with two main surprises: i) models substantially overestimate the amount of warming and drying experienced by summer crops in North America, and ii) models underestimate the increase in VPD in most temperate cropping regions. Linking agroclimatic data to crop productivity, we estimate that climate trends have caused current global yields of wheat, maize, and barley to be 10, 4, and 13% lower than they would have otherwise been. These losses likely exceeded the benefits of CO 2 increases over the same period, whereas CO 2 benefits likely exceeded climate-related losses for soybean and rice. Aggregate global yield losses are very similar to what models would have predicted, with the two biases above largely offsetting each other. Climate model biases in reproducing VPD trends may partially explain the ineffectiveness of some adaptations predicted by modeling studies, such as farmer shifts to longer maturing varieties.",

          "abstract": "Bloch wavefunctions in crystals experience localization within the bulk when disorder is introduced, a phenomenon commonly known as Anderson localization. This effect is considered universal, being applicable to all types of waves, quantum or classical. However, the interaction between disorder and topology—a concept that has profoundly transformed many branches of physics—necessitates revisiting the original Anderson localization picture. For instance, in the recently discovered topological Anderson insulator, the introduction of disorder induces topological boundary states that can resist localization due to protection from line-gap topology. While line-gap topology applies to both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems uniquely exhibit point-gap topology, which has no Hermitian counterparts and leads to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate disorder-induced point-gap topology in a non-Hermitian acoustic crystal. This crystal, with non-Hermitian disorder in nearest-neighbor couplings, exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect, where all eigenstates localize at a boundary. Interestingly, the boundary where localization occurs—either the left or right—depends on the strength of the disorder. As the disorder strength increases, the direction of boundary localization can be reversed. Additionally, we observe a “bipolar” skin effect, where boundary localization occurs at both the left and right boundaries when disorder is introduced in next-nearest-neighbor couplings. These findings experimentally reveal a non-Hermitian mechanism of disorder-induced localization that goes beyond the conventional framework of Anderson localization.",

          "abstract": "During meiosis, the correct pairing, synapsis, and recombination of homologous chromosome pairs is critical for fertility of sexual eukaryotes. These processes are challenged in polyploids, which possess additional copies of each chromosome. Polyploidy thus provides a unique context to study how evolution can modify meiotic programs in response to challenges. We previously observed that in newly formed (neo-)polyploids of Arabidopsis arenosa , synapsis defects precede chromosomes associating in aberrant multivalent and univalent configurations. Here, we study synapsis dynamics in genotypes with varying levels of meiotic stability to ask whether efficient synaptic progression is a key component of evolving stable tetraploid meiosis. We develop a method to quantify synapsis dynamics using the progression of foci of the pro-crossover factor HEI10 as a reference. HEI10 initially appears at many small foci before accumulating only at crossover sites. In diploids, this transition begins while significant asynapsis is still present, though it quickly declines as HEI10 accumulates at fewer foci. In neo-tetraploids, suboptimal elongation of synaptic initiation sites and stalled synapsis, perhaps due to defective pairing, occurs before the onset of HEI10 accumulation. In established tetraploids, HEI10 accumulation begins only when synapsis is near complete, suggesting enhanced HEI10/synapsis codynamics (even compared to diploids). Hybrids generated by crossing neo- and established tetraploids exhibit intermediate phenotypes. We find the extent of asynapsis correlates positively with crossover numbers, and the frequency of multivalents and univalents, which can disturb chromosome segregation. Our work supports the hypothesis that improving the efficiency of synapsis is important for evolving polyploid meiotic stability.",

          "abstract": "Developmental time (or time to maturity) strongly correlates with an animal’s maximum lifespan, with late-maturing individuals often living longer. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. This may be because most previously identified longevity genes regulate growth rate rather than developmental time. To address this gap, we genetically manipulated prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), the primary regulator of developmental timing in Drosophila , to explore the genetic link between developmental time and longevity. Loss of PTTH delays developmental timing without altering the growth rate. Intriguingly, PTTH mutants exhibit extended lifespan despite their larger body size. This lifespan extension depends on ecdysone signaling, as feeding 20-hydroxyecdysone to PTTH mutants reverses the effect. Mechanistically, loss of PTTH blunts age-dependent chronic inflammation, specifically in fly hepatocytes (oenocytes). Developmental transcriptomics reveal that NF-κB signaling activates during larva-to-adult transition, with PTTH inducing this signaling via ecdysone. Notably, time-restricted and oenocyte-specific silencing of Relish (an NF-κB homolog) at early 3rd instar larval stages significantly prolongs adult lifespan while delaying pupariation. Our study establishes an aging model that uncouples developmental time from growth rate, highlighting NF-κB signaling as a key developmental program in linking developmental time to adult lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Mtb cell envelope glycans are potent virulence factors that play key roles in mediating infection of host tissues and modulating the host immune response. However, there are few ways to site-selectively modify and label these or any glycans to study their functions in disease. This gap arises because glycans generally lack functional groups amenable to bioconjugation strategies. Methylthioxylofuranose (MTX), a rare monosaccharide in select pathogenic mycobacteria, is an exception. MTX is appended to mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), an antigenic glycolipid in the Mtb cell envelope implicated in downregulating the host immune system during infection. MTX is unique not only in its prevalence but also in its functionality—it contains a thioether not present in other glycans. We envisioned exploiting the MTX thioether to selectively label ManLAM with an oxaziridine probe. Here, we show that MTX-containing glycans can be labeled selectively in the test tube and live cells, highlighting the reactivity and accessibility of this motif. Our approach labels ManLAM efficiently despite the presence of protein methionine residues and can distinguish between different mycobacterial species. Using an oxaziridine equipped with a reporter, we could visualize ManLAM localization in live cells and a macrophage infection model, highlighting the stability of the label and the cell envelope in this environment. These studies will enable investigations of dynamic changes in a critical Mtb cell envelope component during infection. Moreover, the selective reactivity of thioethers can be leveraged to expand the repertoire of glycan bioconjugation strategies.",

          "abstract": "Vetiver ( Vetiveria zizanioides ) is highly attractive to the rice stem borer ( Chilo suppressalis , RSB) and is widely utilized as a trap plant for RSB control in East Asia. However, the underlying mechanism driving this high level of attractiveness remains unclear. In this study, we identified volatiles emitted by vetiver using SPME/GC–MS and found that cedrol constitutes 12.15% of the total volatile profile. Both Y-tube olfactometer and electroantennography assays revealed that cedrol is highly attractive to female RSB moths at a concentration of 200 μg/μL. To investigate the mechanism responsible for the high level of cedrol in vetiver, we sequenced and assembled a chromosome-level genome of vetiver, identifying a vetiver-specific terpene synthase, VzTPS9, which is responsible for the synthesis of cedrol from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Subsequently, we constructed a transgenic rice line by integrating VzTPS9 into the rice genome. Enzyme assays and gene expression analyses demonstrated that the transgenic rice produced higher levels of cedrol, which were positively correlated with VzTPS9 expression levels, and consequently, with increased attractiveness to female RSB moths. These findings suggest that increased expression of VzTPS9 in vetiver leads to elevated cedrol synthesis, contributing to its enhanced attractiveness to RSB. This work uncovers the molecular mechanism behind vetiver’s high attractiveness to RSB and provides valuable insights for developing more effective strategies for utilizing vetiver as a trap plant in RSB control.",

We found that traditional blotting methods of sample preparation were inadequate, and high-pressure freezing plus focused ion beam milling was essential to maintain condensate integrity. To identify densely packed molecules within the condensate, we integrated deep learning–based segmentation with context-aware template matching. Our approaches were developed on chromatin condensates and were also effective on condensed regions of in situ native chromatin. Using these methods, we determined the average structure of nucleosomes to 6.1 and 12 Å resolution in reconstituted and native systems, respectively, found that nucleosomes form heterogeneous interaction networks in both cases, and gained insight into the molecular origins of surface tension in chromatin condensates. Our methods should be applicable to biomolecular condensates containing large and distinctive components in both biochemical reconstitutions and certain cellular systems.",

We determined high-resolution cryo-EM structures of CDADC1 in the absence of substrate and in complex with dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP. The structures show that CDADC1 forms trimers and dimers of trimers in solution. The (d)CTP substrate is selected by a narrow pocket for the cytosine base and multiple lysine and arginine contacts to the triphosphate. Substrate binding promotes the association of trimers into hexamers and the transition of the hexamers from a loose to a tighter arrangement. Genetic experiments in mice show that loss of Cdadc1 is surprisingly well tolerated, even in the absence of the dCMP deaminase Dctd that is considered as the main source of dUMP, the precursor of dTTP.",

This study establishes an inverse correlation between tumor cell contractility and chemosensitivity. In both clinical biopsies and cancer cell lines, high/low actomyosin-mediated contractile force attenuates/enhances the vulnerability to chemotherapy, which depends on intercellular force propagation. Cell–cell interaction force activates the mechanosensitive Notch signaling that upregulates the downstream effector major vault protein, which facilitates the export of chemotherapy drugs from nuclei, leading to the reduction of chemosensitivity. Cellular contractility promotes the tolerance of tumor xenografts to chemotherapy and sustains tumor growth in vivo, which can be reversed by the inhibition of contractile force, Notch signaling, or major vault protein. Further, the actomyosin-Notch signaling is associated with drug resistance and cancer recurrence of patients. These findings unveil a regulatory role of intercellular force in chemosensitivity, which could be harnessed as a promising target for cancer mechanotherapeutics.",

Despite their eco-friendly and biodegradable reputation, the in vivo behaviors of PLA-MPs concerning fermentation, carbon cycle, and adverse effects remain unknown. Here, we showed that gut microbiota from the colon can effectively degrade the PLA-MPs by secreting esterase FrsA, whereas esterase FrsA-producing bacteria were identified to dominate this behavior in male C57BL/6 mice. Using isotope tracing and multiomics techniques, we uncovered that 13 C-labeled PLA-MPs were incorporated into the carbon cycle of gut microbiota as a carbon source. Meanwhile, these degraded PLA-MPs fragments entered the succinate pathway of the tricarboxylic acid cycle within gut epithelial cells. These processes altered the metabolic phenotype of the gut, resulting in the decreased linear short-chain fatty acids that are primary energy sources of the gut epithelium. Furthermore, we found that exposure of PLA-MPs significantly reduced the appetite and body weight of mice. Our findings present an overall process of biodegradable plastics within hosts, with the focus on the entire double carbon cycle of PLA-MPs in the gut, which offers indispensable insights into the potential impact of exposure to PLA-MPs.",

          "abstract": "Infection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) causes the most severe form of viral hepatitis, affecting more than 15 million people worldwide. HDV is a small RNA satellite virus of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that relies on the HBV envelope for viral particle assembly. The only specific HDV component is the ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which consists of viral RNA (vRNA) associated with the small (S) and large (L) delta antigens (HDAg). While the structure of the HDAg N-terminal assembly domain is known, here we address the structure of the remaining S Δ60 protein using NMR. We show that S Δ60 contains two intrinsically disordered regions separated by a helix–loop–helix motif and that this structure is conserved in the full-length protein. Solution NMR analysis revealed that S Δ60 binds to both full-length and truncated vRNA, highlighting the role of the helical regions in submicromolar affinity interactions. The resulting complex contains approximately 120 S Δ60 proteins per RNA. Our results provide a model for the arginine-rich domains in RNP assembly and RNA interactions. In addition, we show that a cluster of acidic residues within the structured region of S Δ60 is critical for HDV replication, possibly mimicking the nucleosome acidic patch involved in the recruitment of chromatin remodelers. Our work thus provides the molecular basis for understanding the role of the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of S-HDAg in HDV infection.",

Planarians, capable of growing and degrowing following allometric scaling rules, serve as an excellent model for these studies. We used scRNA-seq to examine cell-type allometry in asexual planarians of different sizes, revealing that they consist of the same basic cell types but in varying proportions. Notably, the gut basal cells are the most responsive to changes in size, suggesting a role in energy storage. We capture the regulated gene modules of distinct cell types in response to body size.

We estimate that 1.41 million dFAD buoys were released between 2007 and 2021, drifting across at least 134 million square kilometers, or 37% of Earth’s ocean surface. Lost dFADs have stranded in 104 maritime jurisdictions, contributing to coastal pollution and damaging sensitive habitats. Regulatory progress has been made to address data quality, entanglement, and pollution but concerns over unregulated dFAD deployments, unsustainable bycatch, and weak industry accountability persist.

Its misexpression in skeletal muscle causes facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). By leveraging full-length RNA isoform sequencing with short-read RNA sequencing of DUX4-inducible myoblasts, we elucidate an isoform-resolved transcriptome featuring numerous unannotated isoforms from known loci and novel intergenic loci. While DUX4 activates similar programs in early embryos and FSHD muscle, the isoform usage of known DUX4 targets is notably distinct between the two contexts. DUX4 also activates hundreds of previously unannotated intergenic loci dominated by repetitive elements. The transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of these loci in myogenic and embryonic contexts indicate that the usage of DUX4-binding sites at these intergenic loci is influenced by the cellular environment. These findings demonstrate that DUX4 induces context-specific transcriptomic programs, enriching our understanding of DUX4-induced muscle pathology.",

Inspired by the pteropod, a small aquatic organism known for its ability to change direction by adjusting the attack angle of its wings, we developed a biomimetic robotic platform called RoboPteropod. This micro–underwater robot, equipped with flexible flapping wings that mimic the propulsive mechanisms of the pteropod, reaches a float velocity of 1.88 body height per second and a forward velocity of 1.2 body length per second, while maintaining a power consumption of merely 580 milliwatts. The ability to dynamically adjust the attack angle of the wings enables smooth transition among various modes (float, move straight, yaw, and pitch) of underwater locomotion, allowing for agile, three-dimensional maneuvering in complex aquatic environments. RoboPteropod offers meaningful potential for detailed exploration of confined and otherwise inaccessible underwater spaces.",

          "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is a devastating manifestation in most lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). Loss-of-function mutations in CLN1 , encoding palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1), cause CLN1 disease, a devastating neurodegenerative LSD that has no curative treatment. Numerous proteins in the brain require dynamic S-palmitoylation (palmitoylation-depalmitoylation) for trafficking to their destination. Although PPT1 depalmitoylates S-palmitoylated proteins and its deficiency causes CLN1 disease, the underlying pathogenic mechanism has remained elusive. We report that Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a polytopic membrane protein mediating lysosomal cholesterol egress, requires dynamic S-palmitoylation for trafficking to the lysosome. In Cln1 −/− mice, Ppt1 deficiency misroutes NPC1-dysregulating lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis. Along with this defect, increased oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) promotes cholesterol-mediated activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin C1 (mTORC1), which inhibits autophagy contributing to neurodegeneration. Pharmacological inhibition of OSBP suppresses mTORC1 activation, rescues autophagy, and ameliorates neuropathology in Cln1 −/− mice. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of CLN1 /PPT1 in lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis and suggest that suppression of mTORC1 activation may be beneficial for CLN1 disease.",

Structural analyses of CA protein complexed with three potent and broad HEV antibodies uncovered a neutralizing site located on monomeric P domain loops at the apex of the viral spike.

The chemical interactions of dust particles with ozone production processes played crucial roles in explaining approximately 13 to 35% of the observed ozone reduction, alongside the impact of intense meteorological disturbances on transport and formation of ozone. Among these interactions, the uptake of ozone, reactive nitrogen, and hydroperoxyl radical by dust particles could substantially contribute to the ozone suppression.

The patterned pores enable the storage of substantial net charges, resulting in a dense network of oriented space charges. Under mechanical loadings, these charges undergo notably relative displacements and induce variations in local electric field, with an effective piezoelectric coefficient of up to 2.1 × 10 4 picocoulombs per newton. This sandwich-structured film allows for real-time monitoring of biosignals for minimal mechanical inputs. For example, a light finger touch generates charge pulses exceeding 100 V, whereas wrist pulses yield high-fidelity, high-voltage signals.

Constraining the maximum extent of these aseismic ruptures is, thus, important for better delineating the influence zone of injections concerning their seismic hazard. Here, we derive a scaling relation based on rupture physics for the maximum size of aseismic ruptures, accounting for fluid injections with arbitrary flow rate histories. Moreover, on the basis of mounting evidence that the moment release during these operations is often predominantly aseismic, we derive a scaling relation for the maximum magnitude of aseismic slip events. Our theoretical predictions are consistent with observations over a broad spectrum of event sizes, from laboratory to real-world cases, indicating that fault zone storativity, background stress change, and injected fluid volume are key determinants of the maximum size and magnitude of injection-induced slow slip events.",

The design space for multichromatic circuits is limited by the small number of orthogonally addressable optogenetic switches and the types of effectors that can be actuated by them. We developed a library of red light-inducible recombinases and directed patterned myogenesis in a mesenchymal fibroblast-like cell line.

Its dissociation dynamics, driven by three conformers—cis-cis (CC), cis-trans (CT), and trans-trans (TT)—pose substantial experimental and theoretical challenges. Using deep potential molecular dynamics simulations with ab initio accuracy, we explored the dissociation dynamics of H 2 CO 3 in solution on the nanosecond timescale. While the CC conformer is the most abundant, the CT conformer is the dominant proton donor. This enhanced deprotonation ability arises from the CT conformer’s involvement in more hydrogen-bonding ring structures, enabling diverse proton transfer pathways, and its greater electronic asymmetry, which increases hydrophilicity and destabilizes the hydroxyl group. Furthermore, protons dissociated from the CT conformer demonstrate a stronger preference for the homing pathway. Our findings underscore the critical role of the topology and electronic properties of the CT conformer in aqueous H 2 CO 3 dissociation and proton transfer.",

It has long been recognized that sex chromosome–linked drivers present a paradox: Their success in transmission can severely distort populations’ sex ratio and lead to extinction. This paradox is typically solved by the presence of suppressors or fitness costs associated with the driver, limiting the propagation of the driver. Here, we show that Stellate (Ste) in Drosophila melanogaster represents a novel class of X chromosome–linked driver that operates with an inherent mechanism that weakens its drive strength. Ste protein asymmetrically segregates into Y-bearing cells during meiosis I, subsequently causing their death. Unexpectedly, Ste segregates asymmetrically again during meiosis II, sparing half of the Y-bearing spermatids from Ste-induced defects, thereby weakening the drive strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which sex chromosome drivers avoid suicidal success.",

The shortest path is obtained parallelly in nature using simultaneous spike traveling instead of arithmetic calculation, achieving extremely low time and space complexity. A nonlinear weight mapping approach is proposed to counterbalance the neuron intrinsic nonlinearity to guarantee accuracy to support large-scale graphs. The memristor hardware capability is experimentally demonstrated in unsupervised and supervised classification tasks. The estimated energy efficiency of 517.82 giga-traversal edges per second per watt outperforms field programmable gate arrays by three to four orders of magnitude, providing a pathway toward highly energy-efficient graph computing hardware.",

Notably, the shell-based architecture amplifies the effective dynamic stress within the metamaterial compared to truss-based morphologies, leading to the earlier activation of multiscale toughening mechanisms in the alloy. The low SFE of the MEA enables the evolution of a diverse array of defect types, thereby prolonging strain hardening behavior across seven orders of magnitude in strain rate.

The PtNiCoCuRuIr HEA-3DNF exhibits superior methanol oxidation reaction performance (2637 milliamperes per milligram Pt), 15 times higher than commercial Pt black. Noble metals (Pt, Ru, and Ir) lower activation energy for reducing transition metals (Ni, Co, Cu, and Fe). In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy and density function theory calculations reveal phase transformation from a Pt-based face-centered cubic to Ru-based hexagonal close-packed structure, with control over phase composition by adjusting reduction temperatures and Pt-to-Ru ratios. These findings offer insights for developing high-performance and tunable NM-HEA catalysts. ",

Investigating the origins of this exceptional diversity is crucial for predicting how reefs will respond to anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we use a genome-scale dataset to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the wrasses and parrotfishes ( Labridae ), which rank among the most species-rich and ecologically diverse lineages of reef fishes. We show that major labrid clades experienced pulses of evolutionary innovation and accelerated diversification during the Miocene approximately 20 to 15 million years ago that the origin of no single phenotypic trait can explain. These results draw parallels to the evolutionary histories of many clades after mass extinctions and corroborate recent fossil evidence for an Early Miocene extinction event in oceanic vertebrates and changes in coral reef faunal composition. Our data provide genomic evidence for a major Early Miocene reassembly of reef faunas.",

Emerging evidence suggests that impaired megakaryogenesis plays a critical role in the development of DPR. In this study, we report remarkable hypermethylation within CG islands of HSCs and megakaryocyte progenitor cells (MKPs) in patients with DPR. Treatment with the hypomethylating agent decitabine reduced methylated CG levels in MKPs and enhanced megakaryocyte production in mice. In addition, we found that DNMT3A negatively regulated megakaryogenesis in megakaryocyte lineages derived from primary HSCs. Transplantation with HSC-overexpressed DNMT3A impeded platelet engraftment following HSCT in mice. We further demonstrated that DNMT3A was directly bound to and methylated ETS1 and RUNX1 during megakaryogenesis. These findings highlight abnormal DNA methylation in DPR and indicate that hypomethylating agents may improve megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation by targeting DNMT3A-mediated methylation.",

Current treatments, such as hearing aids and implants, aim to mitigate these effects but often fall short in addressing the critical issue of accurately pinpointing sound sources. We report an intelligent hearing system inspired by the human auditory system: asymmetric well-aligned piezoelectric nanofibers combined with neural networks to mimic natural auditory processes. Piezoelectric nanofibers with spirally varying lengths and directions transmit and convert acoustic sound into mechanoelectrical signals, mimicking the complex cochlear dynamics. These signals are then encoded by digital neural networks, enabling accurate sound direction recognition. This intelligent hearing system surpasses human directional hearing, accurately recognizing sound directions horizontally and vertically. The advancement represents a substantial stride toward next-generation artificial hearing, harmonizing transduction and perception with a nature-inspired design. It promises for applications in hearing aids, wearable devices, and implants, offering enhanced auditory experiences for those with hearing impairments.",

A mathematical analysis of all compositions that have survived from antiquity now allows us to reconstruct the exact tuning and intonation. According to this analysis, ancient musicians preferred pure intonation. However, they had a keen sense of its combinatorial limitations on instruments with strings of fixed length, such as lyres, and they recognized the necessity of slight deviations from pure intonation during vocal performance to allow for more tonal complexity. This spirit is paralleled in ancient atomic philosophy, which posited that atoms sometimes swerved to allow for more combinatorial complexity and unexpected effects.",

Plasmodesmata (PD) are plant-specific nanopore structures pivotal for cell-to-cell communication and plant survival. However, how PD form and their structure, regulation, and evolution remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the exogenous supply of abscisic acid (ABA), a well-conserved phytohormone in land plants, reduces primary PD density in the moss Physcomitrium patens . This regulation requires all core components of the ABA signaling pathway. Furthermore, we reveal that ABA-INSENSITIVE 5, a well-conserved transcription factor in the ABA signaling pathway of land plants, plays a pivotal role in PD density regulation, whereas ABA-INSENSITIVE 3 does not. Our findings show that the ABA-induced reduction in primary PD density is mediated by these ABA-responsive factors in P. patens . Considering previous reports on ABA-dependent PD regulation in both moss and angiosperms, we propose that the ABA-mediated control of PD biogenesis and permeability represents a conserved mechanism in land plants, with critical implications for cell-to-cell communication and stress adaptation.",

Here, we report protein cage–spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) that can be used as nanoreactors for quantum dot (QD) synthesis and subsequent intracellular delivery. The resulting QD-SNA structures are monodisperse, colloidally stable, and photoluminescent in aqueous solution. The nanoreactors were prepared using two different proteins (~10 and 12 nanometers in diameter), and CdS, CdSe, and PbSe nanocrystals were synthesized. Moreover, the extent of surface defects and crystallinity depends on the relative concentrations of ionic precursors, which control the growth rate and the number of ionic vacancies. By optimizing conditions, CdS-SNAs that exhibit near-zero reabsorption loss were synthesized. Last, QD-SNAs exhibit enhanced cellular uptake and minimal cytotoxicity when compared to commercial QD-protein conjugates, making them potentially useful in bioimaging and diagnostic applications.",

          "abstract": "Most of the lung’s gas-exchange surface forms during alveologenesis and its disruption causes bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in infants, characterized by alveolar simplification and myofibroblast accumulation. BPD also increases the risk of adult emphysema, marked by alveolar loss. Despite this connection, mechanisms linking these conditions and effective treatments are still lacking. We identify hedgehog-interacting protein ( HHIP ), associated with both BPD and emphysema, as a critical regulator of alveologenesis. During this process, Hhip -expressing cells expanded, accompanied by hedgehog (Hh) signaling inhibition and myofibroblast transition. Stromal-specific Hhip deletion led to hyperactivation of Hh-IGF1 signaling axis, causing persistent SMA + myofibroblasts and epithelial stem/progenitor cell senescence. Hyperactivation of this pathway was also observed in human BPD and hyperoxia-induced BPD models. Early Hhip deficiency resulted in adult emphysema with myofibroblast accumulation. We developed a therapeutic Fc-fused HHIP protein that mitigated BPD in neonatal mice and prevented adult emphysema. These findings establish HHIP as a critical regulator of alveologenesis and a therapeutic target for BPD and emphysema.",

The Eyes absent (EYA) family of proteins, which are crucial for embryonic development, become dysregulated in cancer, where they have been shown to mediate proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our study reveals an unusual mechanism by which EYA3 reduces the presence of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells in the premetastatic niche (PMN) to enhance metastasis, independent of its effects on the primary tumor. We find that EYA3 up-regulates nuclear factor κB signaling to enhance CCL2 expression, which, in contrast to previous findings, suppresses cytotoxic NK cell activation in vitro and their infiltration into the PMN in vivo. These findings uncover an unexpected role for CCL2 in inhibiting NK cell responses at the PMN and suggest that targeting EYA3 could be an effective strategy to reactivate antitumor immune responses to inhibit metastasis.",

          "abstract": "Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as prominent candidates to explore the complex interplay between spin and valley degrees of freedom. Their strong spin-orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry lead to the spin-valley locking effect, in which carriers occupying the K and K ′ valleys of the reciprocal space must have opposite spins. This effect is particularly strong for holes due to a larger spin-orbit gap in the valence band. By reducing the dimensionality of a monolayer of WSe 2 to 1D via electrostatic confinement, we demonstrate that spin-valley locking and strong hole-hole interactions lead to a ferromagnetic state where hole transport is spin-valley polarized, even without an applied magnetic field. A massive Dirac fermion model in the Hartree-Fock approximation reveals that many-body hole-exchange interactions lead to this polarized ground-state. This observation opens the possibility of implementing a robust and stable valley-polarized system, essential in valleytronic applications.",

Here, to recapitulate a multilayer structure of the skin, we developed a hydrodynamically mediated approach to the generation of large arrays of fibroblast spheroids (a dermal core) that were engulfed with an epidermal layer of keratinocytes. These spheroids expressed biomarkers of the epidermis, epidermal-dermal junction, and dermis, and exhibited skin-like barrier properties. Screening of the synergistic effect of vitamins and peptides on protein synthesis by the spheroids and evaluation of skin toxicity with chemical agents showed a correlation with clinical results or existing standards. This approach offers enhanced control over spatial cell distribution in spheroids for advanced in vitro models of multilayer tissues.",

This device leverages a unique exciton relocalization effect in quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with additives, substantially enhancing optical gain and improving stability. When coupled with a waveguide-hybridized surface lattice resonance mode, the enhanced light-matter interaction facilitates single-mode lasing with a notably low threshold of 0.9 millijoules per square centimeter. In addition, the device achieves robust lasing performance with extended operational stability (1.8 × 10 6 excitation pulses).
