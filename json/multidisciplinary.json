          "abstract": "Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) create massive protein sequence variation (up to 1030)1 in ecologically diverse microorganisms. A recent survey identified around 31,000 DGRs from more than 1,500 bacterial and archaeal genera, constituting more than 90 environment types2. DGRs are especially enriched in the human gut microbiome2,3 and nano-sized microorganisms that seem to comprise most microbial life and maintain DGRs despite reduced genomes4,5. DGRs are also implicated in the emergence of multicellularity6,7. Variation occurs during reverse transcription of a protein-encoding RNA template coupled to misincorporation at adenosines. In the prototypical Bordetella bacteriophage DGR, the template must be surrounded by upstream and downstream RNA segments for complementary DNA synthesis to be carried out by a complex of the DGR reverse transcriptase bRT and associated protein Avd. The function of the surrounding RNA was unknown. Here we show through cryogenic electron microscopy that this RNA envelops bRT and lies over the barrel-shaped Avd, forming an intimate ribonucleoprotein. An abundance of essential interactions in the ribonucleoprotein precisely position an RNA homoduplex in the bRT active site for initiation of reverse transcription. Our results explain how the surrounding RNA primes complementary DNA synthesis, promotes processivity, terminates polymerization and strictly limits mutagenesis to specific proteins through mechanisms that are probably conserved in DGRs belonging to distant taxa.",

          "authors": "Jianwei Miao",
          "abstract": "Microscopy and crystallography are two essential experimental methodologies for advancing modern science. They complement one another, with microscopy typically relying on lenses to image the local structures of samples, and crystallography using diffraction to determine the global atomic structure of crystals. Over the past two decades, computational microscopy, encompassing coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) and ptychography, has advanced rapidly, unifying microscopy and crystallography to overcome their limitations. Here, I review the innovative developments in CDI and ptychography, which achieve exceptional imaging capabilities across nine orders of magnitude in length scales, from resolving atomic structures in materials at sub-ångstrom resolution to quantitative phase imaging of centimetre-sized tissues, using the same principle and similar computational algorithms. These methods have been applied to determine the 3D atomic structures of crystal defects and amorphous materials, visualize oxygen vacancies in high-temperature superconductors and capture ultrafast dynamics. They have also been used for nanoscale imaging of magnetic, quantum and energy materials, nanomaterials, integrated circuits and biological specimens. By harnessing fourth-generation synchrotron radiation, X-ray-free electron lasers, high-harmonic generation, electron microscopes, optical microscopes, cutting-edge detectors and deep learning, CDI and ptychography are poised to make even greater contributions to multidisciplinary sciences in the years to come.",

          "abstract": "The oestrogen receptor (ER or ERα), a nuclear hormone receptor that drives most breast cancer1, is commonly activated by phosphorylation at serine 118 within its intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain2,3. Although this modification enables oestrogen-independent ER function, its mechanism has remained unclear despite ongoing clinical trials of kinase inhibitors targeting this region4,5,6. By integration of small-angle X-ray scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with functional studies, we show that serine 118 phosphorylation triggers an unexpected expansion of the disordered domain and disrupts specific hydrophobic clustering between two aromatic-rich regions. Mutations mimicking this disruption rescue ER transcriptional activity, target-gene expression and cell growth impaired by a phosphorylation-deficient S118A mutation. These findings, driven by hydrophobic interactions, extend beyond electrostatic models and provide mechanistic insights into intrinsically disordered proteins7, with implications for other nuclear receptors8. This fundamental sequence–structure–function relationship advances our understanding of intrinsic ER disorder, crucial for developing targeted breast cancer therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Sequencing-based genetic tests have uncovered a vast array of BRCA2 sequence variants1. Owing to limited clinical, familial and epidemiological data, thousands of variants are considered to be variants of uncertain significance2,3,4 (VUS). Here we have utilized CRISPR–Cas9-based saturation genome editing in a humanized mouse embryonic stem cell line to determine the functional effect of VUS. We have categorized nearly all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the region that encodes the carboxylate-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. We have generated function scores for 6,551 SNVs, covering 96.4% of possible SNVs in exons 15–26 spanning BRCA2 residues 2479–3216. These variants include 1,282 SNVs that are categorized as missense VUS in the clinical variant database ClinVar, with 77.2% of these classified as benign and 20.4% classified as pathogenic using our functional score. Our assay provides evidence that 3,384 of the SNVs in the region are benign and 776 are pathogenic. Our classification aligns closely with pathogenicity data from ClinVar, orthogonal functional assays and computational meta predictors. We have integrated our embryonic stem cell-based BRCA2-saturation genome editing dataset with other available evidence and utilized the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines for clinical classification of all possible SNVs. This classification is available as a sequence–function map and serves as a valuable resource for interpreting unidentified variants in the population and for physicians and genetic counsellors to assess BRCA2 VUS in patients.",

          "abstract": "It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimensions 1–5 . In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside two dimensions, has been considered 6 but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons 7–9 . Here we show that non-trivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particle obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles that naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions, in which free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and are notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems and—more speculatively—the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particle.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the origin and differentiation of stem-like CD8+ T cells that are essential for sustained T cell immunity in chronic viral infections and cancer and also play a key role in PD-1 directed immunotherapy1-10. These PD-1+ TCF-1+ TOX+ stem-like CD8+ T cells, also referred to as precursors of exhausted T cells8,9, have a distinct program that allows them to adapt to chronic antigen stimulation. Using the mouse model of chronic LCMV infection we found that virus specific stem-like CD8+ T cells are generated early (day 5) during chronic infection suggesting that this crucial fate commitment occurs irrespective of infection outcome. Indeed, we found that nearly identical populations of stem-like CD8+ T cells were generated early during acute or chronic LCMV infection, and that antigen was essential for maintaining the stem-like phenotype. We next performed reciprocal adoptive transfer experiments to determine the fate of these early stem-like CD8+ T cells after viral clearance versus persistence. Following transfer of day 5 stem-like CD8+ T cells from chronically infected into acutely infected mice, these cells downregulated canonical markers of the chronic stem-like CD8+ T cells and expressed markers (CD127 and CD62L) associated with central memory CD8+ T cells. Reciprocally, when day 5 stem-like cells from acutely infected mice were transferred into chronically infected mice these CD8+ T cells functioned like chronic resource cells and responded effectively to PD-1 therapy. These findings highlight the ability of these early PD-1+ TCF-1+ TOX+ stem-like CD8+ T cells to adapt their differentiation trajectory to either an acute or chronic viral infection. Most importantly, our study shows that the host is prepared a priori to deal with a potential chronic infection.",

          "abstract": "The low reduction potentials required for the reduction of dinitrogen (N2) render metal-based nitrogen-fixation catalysts vulnerable to irreversible damage by dioxygen (O2)1,2,3. Such O2 sensitivity represents a major conundrum for the enzyme nitrogenase, as a large fraction of nitrogen-fixing organisms are either obligate aerobes or closely associated with O2-respiring organisms to support the high energy demand of catalytic N2 reduction4. To counter O2 damage to nitrogenase, diazotrophs use O2 scavengers, exploit compartmentalization or maintain high respiration rates to minimize intracellular O2 concentrations4,5,6,7,8. A last line of damage control is provided by the ‘conformational protection’ mechanism9, in which a [2Fe:2S] ferredoxin-family protein termed FeSII (ref. 10) is activated under O2 stress to form an O2-resistant complex with the nitrogenase component proteins11,12. Despite previous insights, the molecular basis for the conformational O2 protection of nitrogenase and the mechanism of FeSII activation are not understood. Here we report the structural characterization of the Azotobacter vinelandii FeSII–nitrogenase complex by cryo-electron microscopy. Our studies reveal a core complex consisting of two molybdenum–iron proteins (MoFePs), two iron proteins (FePs) and one FeSII homodimer, which polymerize into extended filaments. In this three-protein complex, FeSII mediates an extensive network of interactions with MoFeP and FeP to position their iron–sulphur clusters in catalytically inactive but O2-protected states. The architecture of the FeSII–nitrogenase complex is confirmed by solution studies, which further indicate that the activation of FeSII involves an oxidation-induced conformational change.",

          "abstract": "Neurons in the hippocampus are correlated with different variables, including space, time, sensory cues, rewards and actions, in which the extent of tuning depends on ongoing task demands1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or whether a more generic computation can account for these observations9. Here, to disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice in which space, auditory tones, rewards and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans and modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans towards deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.",

          "abstract": "The concept of non-Hermiticity has expanded the understanding of band topology, leading to the emergence of counter-intuitive phenomena. An example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)1,2,3,4,5,6,7, which involves the concentration of eigenstates at the boundary. However, despite the potential insights that can be gained from high-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum systems in areas such as curved space8,9,10, high-order topological phases11,12 and black holes13,14, the realization of this effect in high dimensions remains unexplored. Here we create a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian topological band for ultracold fermions in spin–orbit-coupled optical lattices with tunable dissipation, which exhibits the NHSE. We first experimentally demonstrate pronounced nonzero spectral winding numbers in the complex energy plane with nonzero dissipation, which establishes the existence of 2D skin effect. Furthermore, we observe the real-space dynamical signature of NHSE in real space by monitoring the centre of mass motion of atoms. Finally, we also demonstrate that a pair of exceptional points are created in the momentum space, connected by an open-ended bulk Fermi arc, in contrast to closed loops found in Hermitian systems. The associated exceptional points emerge and shift with increasing dissipation, leading to the formation of the Fermi arc. Our work sets the stage for further investigation into simulating non-Hermitian physics in high dimensions and paves the way for understanding the interplay of quantum statistics with NHSE.",

Here we report that the antibody central to the conclusions of Chen et al.2 neither sensitively nor specifically detects endogenous DEPDC5, and we determine, using validated antibodies and endogenously tagged cell lines, that the stability of DEPDC5 is insensitive to amino acid availability, proteasome activity and KLHL22 loss of function.

Here we present the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN), a tabular foundation model that outperforms all previous methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training time. In 2.8 s, TabPFN outperforms an ensemble of the strongest baselines tuned for 4 h in a classification setting. As a generative transformer-based foundation model, this model also allows fine-tuning, data generation, density estimation and learning reusable embeddings. TabPFN is a learning algorithm that is itself learned across millions of synthetic datasets, demonstrating the power of this approach for algorithm development. By improving modelling abilities across diverse fields, TabPFN has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and enhance important decision-making in various domains.",

We previously demonstrated that serotonylation 4–10 and dopaminylation 9,11–13 of Gln5 of histone H3 (H3Q5ser and H3Q5dop, respectively) are catalysed by transglutaminase 2 (TG2), and alter both local and global chromatin states. Here we found that TG2 additionally functions as an eraser and exchanger of H3 monoaminylations, including H3Q5 histaminylation (H3Q5his), which displays diurnally rhythmic expression in brain and contributes to circadian gene expression and behaviour. We found that H3Q5his, in contrast to H3Q5ser, inhibits the binding of WDR5, a core member of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes, thereby antagonizing methyltransferase activities on H3K4. Taken together, these data elucidate a mechanism through which a single chromatin regulatory enzyme has the ability to sense chemical microenvironments to affect the epigenetic states of cells, the dynamics of which have critical roles in the regulation of neural rhythmicity.",

However, variants of uncertain significance limit the clinical utility of test results. Thus, there is a need for functional characterization and clinical classification of all BRCA2 variants to facilitate the clinical management of individuals with these variants. Here we analysed all possible single-nucleotide variants from exons 15 to 26 that encode the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain hotspot for pathogenic missense variants. To enable this, we used saturation genome editing CRISPR–Cas9-based knock-in endogenous targeting of human haploid HAP1 cells6. The assay was calibrated relative to nonsense and silent variants and was validated using pathogenic and benign standards from ClinVar and results from a homology-directed repair functional assay7. Variants (6,959 out of 6,960 evaluated) were assigned to seven categories of pathogenicity based on a VarCall Bayesian model8. Single-nucleotide variants that encode loss-of-function missense variants were associated with increased risks of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The functional assay results were integrated into models from ClinGen, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Association for Molecular Pathology9 for clinical classification of BRCA2 variants. Using this approach, 91% were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic or as benign or likely benign. These classified variants can be used to improve clinical management of individuals with a BRCA2 variant.",

The development of these hypofunctional T cells and of their precursors was considered to require stimulatory conditions met only upon persisting exposure to antigen and inflammation. In sharp contrast, we found similar T cell populations in the early phase of acute infections1,2. At that stage early developing TCF1+ precursor population shows an unexpected diversity, which includes precursors of normal memory T cells but also cells with a phenotype, gene-expression, and epigenetic profile that resembles precursors of exhausted T cells found in chronic infections. We demonstrate that high ligand affinity promotes, and PD-1 signaling restricts the development of these precursors. While these exhausted precursors are initially frequently found, they decline without being completely lost in infections the immune system resolves. We therefore concluded that precursor T cells with at least two distinct phenotypes are preemptively generated irrespectively of the outcome of the infection.",

          "abstract": "Polygenic genome editing in human embryos and germ cells is predicted to become feasible in the next three decades. Several recent books and academic papers have outlined the ethical concerns raised by germline genome editing and the opportunities that it may present 1–3 . To date, no attempts have been made to predict the consequences of altering specific variants associated with polygenic diseases. In this Analysis, we show that polygenic genome editing could theoretically yield extreme reductions in disease susceptibility. For example, editing a relatively small number of genomic variants could make a substantial difference to an individual’s risk of developing coronary artery disease, Alzheimer’s disease, major depressive disorder, diabetes and schizophrenia. Similarly, large changes in risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure, could, in theory, be achieved by polygenic editing. Although heritable polygenic editing (HPE) is still speculative, we completed calculations to discuss the underlying ethical issues. Our modelling demonstrates how the putatively positive consequences of gene editing at an individual level may deepen health inequalities. Further, as single or multiple gene variants can increase the risk of some diseases while decreasing that of others, HPE raises ethical challenges related to pleiotropy and genetic diversity. We conclude by arguing for a collectivist perspective on the ethical issues raised by HPE, which accounts for its effects on individuals, their families, communities and society 4 .",

Beyond its canonical role in defence against parasitic helminth infections, type 2 immunity safeguards the host through additional mechanisms, including the suppression of excessive type 1 immune responses, regulation of tissue repair and maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis. However, unlike type 1 immune responses, type 2 immunity is perceived as a potential promoter of tumorigenesis. Emerging evidence challenges this perspective, painting a more nuanced picture in which type 2 immunity might protect against or even actively suppress tumour growth and progression. In this Review, we explore discoveries that highlight the potential of type 2 immunity in reshaping the landscape of cancer immunotherapies.",

          "authors": "Shahar Gvirtzman, David S. Kammer, Mokhtar Adda-Bedia, Jay Fineberg",
          "abstract": "Frictional motion is mediated by rapidly propagating ruptures that detach the ensemble of contacts forming the frictional interface between contacting bodies1,2,3,4,5,6,7. These ruptures are similar to shear cracks. When this process takes place in natural faults, these rapid ruptures are essentially earthquakes8,9. Although fracture mechanics describe the rapid motion of these singular objects, the nucleation process that creates them is not understood10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Here we fully describe the nucleation process by extending fracture mechanics to explicitly incorporate finite interface widths (which are generally ignored20,21). We show, experimentally and theoretically, that slow steady creep ensues at a well-defined stress threshold. Moreover, as slowly creeping patches approach the interface width, a topological transition takes place in which these creeping patches smoothly transition to the rapid fracture that is described by classical fracture mechanics22,23,24,25,26. Apart from its relevance to fracture and material strength, this new picture of rupture nucleation dynamics is directly relevant to earthquake nucleation dynamics; slow, aseismic rupture must always precede rapid seismic rupture (so long as the initial defect in the interface is localized in both spatial dimensions). The theory may provide a new framework for understanding how and when earthquakes nucleate.",

To date, comprehensive global assessments of extinction risk have not included any speciose groups primarily living in freshwaters. Consequently, data from predominantly terrestrial tetrapods 4,5 are used to guide environmental policy 6 and conservation prioritization 7 , whereas recent proposals for target setting in freshwaters use abiotic factors 8–13 . However, there is evidence 14–17 that such data are insufficient to represent the needs of freshwater species and achieve biodiversity goals 18,19 . Here we present the results of a multi-taxon global freshwater fauna assessment for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species covering 23,496 decapod crustaceans, fishes and odonates, finding that one-quarter are threatened with extinction. Prevalent threats include pollution, dams and water extraction, agriculture and invasive species, with overharvesting also driving extinctions. We also examined the degree of surrogacy of both threatened tetrapods and freshwater abiotic factors (water stress and nitrogen) for threatened freshwater species. Threatened tetrapods are good surrogates when prioritizing sites to maximize rarity-weighted richness, but poorer when prioritizing based on the most range-restricted species. However, they are much better surrogates than abiotic factors, which perform worse than random. Thus, although global priority regions identified for tetrapod conservation are broadly reflective of those for freshwater faunas, given differences in key threats and habitats, meeting the needs of tetrapods cannot be assumed sufficient to conserve freshwater species at local scales.",

          "abstract": "Positive effects of plant diversity on productivity have been globally demonstrated and explained by two main effects: complementarity effects and selection effects1,2,3,4. However, plant diversity experiments have shown substantial variation in these effects, with driving factors poorly understood4,5,6. On the basis of a meta-analysis of 452 experiments across the globe, we show that productivity increases on average by 15.2% from monocultures to species mixtures with an average species richness of 2.6; net biodiversity effects are stronger in grassland and forest experiments and weaker in container, cropland and aquatic ecosystems. Of the net biodiversity effects, complementarity effects and selection effects contribute 65.6% and 34.4%, respectively. Complementarity effects increase with phylogenetic diversity, the mixing of nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing species and the functional diversity of leaf nitrogen contents, which indicate the key roles of niche partitioning, biotic feedback and abiotic facilitation in complementarity effects. More positive selection effects occur with higher species biomass inequality in their monocultures. Complementarity effects increase over time, whereas selection effects decrease over time, and they remain consistent across global variations in climates. Our results provide key insights into understanding global variations in plant diversity effects on productivity and underscore the importance of integrating both complementarity and selection effects into strategies for biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration.",

Although volatiles are known to be key components in metallogenesis9, how and where they are distributed in the cratonic lithosphere mantle and their role in the initial enrichment of metals have not been sufficiently explored. Here we compile sulfur and copper contents of global cratonic peridotites, identifying sulfide-rich and copper-rich continental roots at depths of 160–190 km at cratonic margins. Our new high-pressure experiments show that carbonated silicate melts originating from the asthenosphere lose silicate components during reaction with lithospheric peridotite, evolving to carbonatite melts that become concentrated at cratonic margins. Sulfur solubility in melts substantially decreases as the SiO2 content of melts decreases during this process, forcing sulfide precipitation and the formation of sulfide-rich continental roots at the base of the mantle lithosphere. The migration of carbonated melts towards cratonic margins replenishes the continental roots there with sulfur, explaining the co-location of magmatic metal deposits with carbonatites close to cratonic margins. These findings highlight the notable role of carbonated melts in metallogenesis and provide a potential platform for metal ore exploration.",

However, to what extent host responses balance the physiological effects of microbiota-derived metabolites remains unclear9,10. Here, using untargeted metabolomics of mouse tissues, we identified a family of BA–methylcysteamine (BA–MCY) conjugates that are abundant in the intestine and dependent on vanin 1 (VNN1), a pantetheinase highly expressed in intestinal tissues. This host-dependent MCY conjugation inverts BA function in the hepatobiliary system. Whereas microbiota-derived free BAs function as agonists of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and negatively regulate BA production, BA–MCYs act as potent antagonists of FXR and promote expression of BA biosynthesis genes in vivo. Supplementation with stable-isotope-labelled BA–MCY increased BA production in an FXR-dependent manner, and BA–MCY supplementation in a mouse model of hypercholesteraemia decreased lipid accumulation in the liver, consistent with BA–MCYs acting as intestinal FXR antagonists. The levels of BA–MCY were reduced in microbiota-deficient mice and restored by transplantation of human faecal microbiota. Dietary intervention with inulin fibre further increased levels of both free BAs and BA–MCY levels, indicating that BA–MCY production by the host is regulated by levels of microbiota-derived free BAs. We further show that diverse BA–MCYs are also present in human serum. Together, our results indicate that BA–MCY conjugation by the host balances host-dependent and microbiota-dependent metabolic pathways that regulate FXR-dependent physiology.",

In this study, we developed the Multimodal transformer with Unified maSKed modeling (MUSK), a vision–language foundation model designed to leverage large-scale, unlabelled, unpaired image and text data. MUSK was pretrained on 50 million pathology images from 11,577 patients and one billion pathology-related text tokens using unified masked modelling. It was further pretrained on one million pathology image–text pairs to efficiently align the vision and language features. With minimal or no further training, MUSK was tested in a wide range of applications and demonstrated superior performance across 23 patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, including image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, visual question answering, image classification and molecular biomarker prediction. Furthermore, MUSK showed strong performance in outcome prediction, including melanoma relapse prediction, pan-cancer prognosis prediction and immunotherapy response prediction in lung and gastro-oesophageal cancers. MUSK effectively combined complementary information from pathology images and clinical reports and could potentially improve diagnosis and precision in cancer therapy.",

Computational models of transcription lack generalizability to accurately extrapolate to unseen cell types and conditions.

Relying exclusively on chromatin accessibility data and sequence information, GET achieves experimental-level accuracy in predicting gene expression even in previously unseen cell types3. GET also shows remarkable adaptability across new sequencing platforms and assays, enabling regulatory inference across a broad range of cell types and conditions, and uncovers universal and cell-type-specific transcription factor interaction networks. We evaluated its performance in prediction of regulatory activity, inference of regulatory elements and regulators, and identification of physical interactions between transcription factors and found that it outperforms current models4 in predicting lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay readout5,6. In fetal erythroblasts7, we identified distal (greater than 1 Mbp) regulatory regions that were missed by previous models, and, in B cells, we identified a lymphocyte-specific transcription factor–transcription factor interaction that explains the functional significance of a leukaemia risk predisposing germline mutation8,9,10.

Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the effect of more than 500,000 variants on the abundance of more than 500 human protein domains. This dataset reveals that 60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We combine stability measurements with protein language models to annotate functional sites across proteins. Mutational effects on stability are largely conserved in homologous domains, enabling accurate stability prediction across entire protein families using energy models.

          "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations that drive colorectal cancer can be present in healthy intestines for long periods without overt consequence1,2. Mutation of Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc), the most common initiating event in conventional adenomas3, activates Wnt signalling, hence conferring fitness on mutant intestinal stem cells (ISCs)4,5. Apc mutations may occur in ISCs that arose by routine self-renewal or by dedifferentiation of their progeny. Although ISCs of these different origins are fundamentally similar6,7, it is unclear if both generate tumours equally well in uninjured intestines. Also unknown is whether cis-regulatory elements are substantively modulated upon Wnt hyperactivation or as a feature of subsequent tumours. Here, we show in two mouse models that adenomas are not an obligatory outcome of Apc deletion in either ISC source but require proximity of mutant intestinal crypts. Reduced crypt density abrogates, and aggregation of mutant colonic crypts augments, adenoma formation. Moreover, adenoma-resident ISCs open chromatin at thousands of enhancers that are inaccessible in Apc-null ISCs not associated with adenomas. These cis-elements explain adenoma-selective gene activity and persist, with little further expansion of the repertoire, as other oncogenic mutations accumulate. Thus, cooperativity between neighbouring mutant crypts and new accessibility at specific enhancers are key steps early in intestinal tumourigenesis.",

However, Li dendrites formed by the reaction between highly active Li and non-aqueous electrolytes lead to safety concerns and rapid capacity decay4,5,6,7. Developing a reliable solid–electrolyte interphase is critical for realizing high-rate and long-life LMBs, but remains technically challenging4,8. Here we demonstrate that adding excess m-Li2ZrF6 (monoclinic) nanoparticles to a commercial LiPF6-containing carbonate electrolyte of LMBs facilitates the release of abundant ZrF62– ions into the electrolyte driven by the applied voltage, converting to t-Li2ZrF6 (trigonal) and creating a stable solid–electrolyte interphase in situ with high Li-ion conductivity. Computational and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the in situ formation of the t-Li2ZrF6-rich solid–electrolyte interphase markedly enhanced Li-ion transfer and suppressed the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, LMBs assembled with LiFePO4 cathodes (areal loading, 1.8/2.2 mAh cm−2), three-dimensional Li–carbon anodes (50-µm-thick Li) and Li2ZrF6-based electrolyte displayed greatly improved cycling stability with high capacity retention (>80.0%) after 3,000 cycles (1C/2C rate). This achievement represents leading performance and, thus, delivers a reliable Li2ZrF6-based electrolyte for durable LMBs under practical high-rate conditions.",

Consequently, any cell type that encounters pathogens must mount immune responses and communicate with surrounding cells for successful defence. However, the diversity, spatial organization and function of cellular immune states in pathogen-infected plants are poorly understood 1 . Here we infect Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with bacterial pathogens that trigger or supress immune responses and integrate time-resolved single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial transcriptomic data to identify cell states. We describe cell-state-specific gene-regulatory logic that involves transcription factors, putative cis -regulatory elements and target genes associated with disease and immunity. We show that a rare cell population emerges at the nexus of immune-active hotspots, which we designate as primary immune responder (PRIMER) cells. PRIMER cells have non-canonical immune signatures, exemplified by the expression and genome accessibility of a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, GT-3A, which contributes to plant immunity against bacterial pathogens. PRIMER cells are surrounded by another cell state (bystander) that activates genes for long-distance cell-to-cell immune signalling. Together, our findings suggest that interactions between these cell states propagate immune responses across the leaf. Our molecularly defined single-cell spatiotemporal atlas provides functional and regulatory insights into immune cell states in plants.",

However, stereospecific assembly of artificial polyhedra with mechanical properties and guest-binding attributes akin to biological encapsulants remains a formidable challenge. Here we report the stereospecific assembly of dynamic supramolecular snub cubes from 12 helical macrocycles, which are held together by 144 weak C–H hydrogen bonds3. The enantiomerically pure snub cubes, which have external diameters of 5.1 nm, contain 2,712 atoms and chiral cavities with volumes of 6,215 Å3. The stereospecific assembly of left- and right-handed snub cubes was achieved by means of a hierarchical chirality transfer protocol4, which was streamlined by diastereoselective crystallization. In addition to their reversible photochromic behaviour, the snub cubes exhibit photocontrollable elasticity and hardness in their crystalline states. The snub cubes can accommodate numerous small guest molecules simultaneously and encapsulate two different guest molecules separately inside the uniquely distinct compartments in their frameworks. This research expands the scope of artificial supramolecular assemblies to imitate the chiral superstructures, dynamic features and binding properties of spherical biomacromolecules and also establishes a protocol for construction of crystalline materials with photocontrollable mechanical properties.",

Symmetric ZGNRs typically show antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states1,2. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains11, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the one-dimensional limit3,12, but also establishes a long-sought-after carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics1,2,3,9,13. Here we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs (JGNRs) with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb’s theorem and topological classification theory14,15,16, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introducing a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks the structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin-symmetry breaking. Three Z-shaped precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the ‘defective’ edge. Characterization by scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of JGNRs with a ferromagnetic ground-state localized along the pristine zigzag edge.",

They are used as transducers in applications such as nano-positioning and ultrasound imaging. Improving the properties of these devices requires piezoelectric materials capable of delivering a large longitudinal strain on the application of an electric field. A large longitudinal strain of more than 1% is generally anticipated in suitably oriented single crystals of specific compositions of ferroelectric materials1. Polycrystalline piezoceramics typically show a longitudinal strain of approximately 0.2–0.4%. We demonstrate that when the thickness of a polycrystalline piezoceramic is reduced to such an extent that a large fraction of the grains are in the triaxial–biaxal crossover regime, the domain-switching fraction increases considerably. If the positive and the negative surfaces of the piezoceramic respond to electric fields symmetrically, as in the classical PbZrxTixO3, a longitudinal strain of approximately 1% can be achieved in a 0.2 mm disc of the morphotropic phase boundary composition (a 300% increase from a thickness of 0.7 mm). We show that oxygen vacancies in piezoceramics cause asymmetrical switching at the positive and negative surfaces, which causes thin piezoceramics to bend. We expect these findings will encourage further engineering of these mechanisms across different piezoelectric material systems, opening new applications for electromechanical actuation.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease whose prognosis and treatment as defined by the expression of three receptors—oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; encoded by ERBB2)—is insufficient to capture the full spectrum of clinical outcomes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Previously, we demonstrated that transcriptional and genomic profiles define eleven integrative subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes, including four ER+ subtypes with increased risk of relapse decades after diagnosis1,2. Here, to determine whether these subtypes reflect distinct evolutionary histories, interactions with the immune system and pathway dependencies, we established a meta-cohort of 1,828 breast tumours spanning pre-invasive, primary invasive and metastatic disease with whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing. We demonstrate that breast tumours fall along a continuum constrained by three genomic archetypes. The ER+ high-risk integrative subgroup is characterized by complex focal amplifications, similar to HER2+ tumours, including cyclic extrachromosomal DNA amplifications induced by ER through R-loop formation and APOBEC3B-editing, which arise in pre-invasive lesions. By contrast, triple-negative tumours exhibit genome-wide instability and tandem duplications and are enriched for homologous repair deficiency-like signatures, whereas ER+ typical-risk tumours are largely genomically stable. These genomic archetypes, which replicate in an independent cohort of 2,659 primary tumours, are established early during tumorigenesis, sculpt the tumour microenvironment and are conserved in metastatic disease. These complex structural alterations contribute to replication stress and immune evasion, and persist throughout tumour evolution, unveiling potential vulnerabilities.",

Here we collected paired single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data from 38 human neocortical samples encompassing both the prefrontal cortex and the primary visual cortex. These samples span five main developmental stages, ranging from the first trimester to adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a subset of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular communication. This atlas enables us to catalogue cell-type-specific, age-specific and area-specific gene regulatory networks underlying neural differentiation. Moreover, combining single-cell profiling, progenitor purification and lineage-tracing experiments, we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis transition. We identified a tripotential intermediate progenitor subtype—tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs)—that is responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes. Notably, most glioblastoma cells resemble Tri-IPCs at the transcriptomic level, suggesting that cancer cells hijack developmental processes to enhance growth and heterogeneity. Furthermore, by integrating our atlas data with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we created a disease-risk map highlighting enriched risk associated with autism spectrum disorder in second-trimester intratelencephalic neurons.

Over the past decade, several generations of bifunctional ligands developed have enabled C(sp3)–H activation reactions of free carboxylic acids2, free aliphatic amines3, native amides4,5 and alcohols6. However, an effective catalyst for ketones and carboxylic esters remains to be realized. Here we report diverse methyl β-C−H functionalizations, including intermolecular arylation, hydroxylation and intramolecular C(sp3)–H/C(sp2)–H coupling of ketones and carboxylic esters with a monoprotected amino neutral amide (MPANA) ligand. The in situ generation of cationic Pd(II) complexes by the combination MPANA ligand and HBF4 is crucial for achieving the reactivity. The compatibility of these reactions with cyclic ketones and lactams provides a method to access spirocyclic and fused ring systems.

In the present case, the non-ferroelectric layers are AlN and ZnO, whereas the ferroelectric layers are Al1−xBxN, Al1−xScxN and Zn1−xMgxO. The layered structures include nitride–nitride, oxide–oxide and nitride–oxide stacks that feature two-layer (asymmetric) and three-layer (symmetric) configurations1,2,3. Ferroelectric switching in both layers is validated by multimodal characterization methods, including polarization hysteresis, anisotropic chemical etching, second harmonic generation, piezo response force microscopy, electromechanical testing and atomic resolution polarization orientation imaging in real space by scanning transmission electron microscopy. We present a physical switching model in which antipolar nuclei originate in the ferroelectric layer and propagate towards the internal non-ferroelectric interface. The domain wall leading edge produces elastic and electric fields that extend beyond the interface at close proximity, reducing the switching barrier in the non-ferroelectric layer, and allowing complete domain propagation without breakdown. Density functional theory calculations of polymorph energies, reversal barriers and domain wall energies support this model. Proximity ferroelectricity enables polarization reversal in wurtzites without the chemical or structural disorder that accompanies elemental substitution, opening new questions and opportunities regarding interface-based ferroelectricity.",

Modern faunas retain only a fraction of the past forms in this hyperdiverse and long-lived group. Recent analyses 6–8 have consistently recovered a fundamental split into two sister clades, Conchifera (including gastropods, bivalves and cephalopods) and Aculifera 9 , comprising Polyplacophora (‘chitons’) and Aplacophora. Molluscan evolution in toto is characterized by plasticity in body-plan characters 10 , but historically aculiferans have been interpreted as more conservative 10,11 . The few completely preserved aculiferan or aculiferan-like fossils from the early Palaeozoic 12–19 have been largely regarded as transitional forms that inform questions of character polarity between the extant polyplacophoran and aplacophoran body forms 20,21 . The history of early aculiferans, and the morphological and ecological range that they occupied, remain inadequately sampled. Here we describe two new three-dimensionally preserved aculiferan species from the Silurian Herefordshire Lagerstätte 22,23 , which substantially extend the morphological and ecological range of the clade. Phylogenetic analyses indicate positions within a complex nexus of taxa and suggest reversals in the states of fundamental characters such as the presence of valves and the nature of the foot. In contrast to previous hypotheses of morphological conservatism, evolution in early aculiferans generated a profusion of unusual forms comparable to the diversification of other crown-group molluscs.",

Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the protective ternary complex of the catalytic subunit of Mo-nitrogenase, its cognate reductase and the FeSII protein, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The dimeric FeSII protein associates with two copies of each component to assemble a 620 kDa core complex that then polymerizes into large, filamentous structures. This complex is catalytically inactive, but the enzyme components are quickly released and reactivated upon oxygen depletion. The first step in complex formation is the association of FeSII with the more O2-sensitive Fe protein component of nitrogenase during sudden oxidative stress. The action of this small ferredoxin represents a straightforward means of protection from O2 that may be crucial for the maintenance of recombinant nitrogenase in food crops.",

The impact of such rapid evolution is unclear. Here we find that sequence-dependent DNA shape dictates packaging of pericentromeric satellites in female meiosis through a conserved DNA-shape-recognizing chromatin architectural protein, high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1)4,5. Pericentromeric heterochromatin in two closely related mouse species, M. musculus and M. spretus, forms on divergent satellites that differ by both density of narrow DNA minor grooves and HMGA1 recruitment. HMGA1 binds preferentially to M. musculus satellites, and depletion in M. musculus oocytes causes massive stretching of pericentromeric satellites, disruption of kinetochore organization and delays in bipolar spindle assembly. In M. musculus × spretus hybrid oocytes, HMGA1 depletion disproportionately impairs M. musculus pericentromeres and microtubule attachment to their kinetochores. Thus, DNA shape affects both pericentromere packaging and the segregation machinery. We propose that rapid evolution of centromere and pericentromere DNA does not disrupt these essential processes when the satellites adopt DNA shapes recognized by conserved architectural proteins (such as HMGA1). By packaging these satellites, architectural proteins become part of the centromeric and pericentromeric chromatin, suggesting an evolutionary strategy that lowers the cost of megabase-scale satellite expansion.",

We anticipate that, by simplifying the way electrochemical reactions are set up, this user-friendly solution will not only enhance the experience and efficiency of current practitioners but also substantially reduce the barrier for nonspecialists to enter the field of electrosynthesis, thus allowing the broader community of synthetic chemists to explore and benefit from new reactivities and synthetic strategies enabled by electrochemistry8,9,10,11,12.",

          "abstract": "How novel structures emerge during evolution has long fascinated biologists. A dramatic example is how the diminutive bones of the mammalian middle ear arose from ancestral fish jawbones1. In contrast, the evolutionary origin of the outer ear, another mammalian innovation, remains a mystery, in part because it is supported by non-mineralized elastic cartilage rarely recovered in fossils. Whether the outer ear arose de novo or through reuse of ancestral developmental programs is unknown. Here we show that the outer ear shares gene regulatory programs with the gills of fishes and amphibians for both its initial outgrowth and later development of elastic cartilage. Comparative single-nuclei multiomics of the human outer ear and zebrafish gills reveals conserved gene expression and putative enhancers enriched for common transcription factor binding motifs. This is reflected by transgenic activity of human outer ear enhancers in gills, and fish gill enhancers in the outer ear. Further, single-cell multiomics of the cartilaginous book gills of horseshoe crabs reveal a shared DLX-mediated gill program with vertebrates, with a book gill distalless enhancer driving expression in zebrafish gills. We propose that elements of an invertebrate gill program were reutilized in vertebrates to generate first gills and then the outer ear.",

Credit: Yui Mok/PA Images via Getty\n\nIt is said that a lie can fly halfway around the world while the truth is getting its boots on. That trek to challenge online falsehoods and misinformation got a little harder this week, when Facebook’s parent company Meta announced plans to scrap the platform’s fact-checking programme, which was set up in 2016 and pays independent groups to verify selected articles and posts.\n\nThe company said that the move was to counter fact checkers’ political bias and censorship. “Experts, like everyone else, have their own biases and perspectives. This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact-check and how,” Meta’s chief global-affairs officer Joel Kaplan wrote on 7 January.\n\nNature spoke to communication and misinformation researchers about the value of fact-checking, where perceived biases come from and what Meta’s decision could mean.\n\nPositive influence\n\nIn terms of helping to convince people that information is true and trustworthy, “fact-checking does work”, says Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, who acted as an unpaid adviser on Facebook’s fact-checking programme in 2022. “Studies provide very consistent evidence that fact-checking does at least partially reduce misperceptions about false claims.”\n\nFor example, a 2019 meta-analysis of the effectiveness of fact-checking in more than 20,000 people found a “significantly positive overall influence on political beliefs”1.\n\n“Ideally, we’d want people to not form misperceptions in the first place,” adds van der Linden. “But if we have to work with the fact that people are already exposed, then reducing it is almost as good as it as it’s going to get.”\n\nWhat we do — and don’t — know about how misinformation spreads online\n\nFact-checking is less effective when an issue is polarized, says Jay Van Bavel, a psychologist at New York University in New York City. “If you’re fact-checking something around Brexit in the UK or the election in United States, that’s where fact-checks don’t work very well,” he says. “In part that’s because people who are partisans don’t want to believe things that make their party look bad.”\n\nBut even when fact-checks don’t seem to change people’s minds on contentious issues, they can still be helpful, says Alexios Mantzarlis, a former fact checker who directs the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech in New York City.\n\nOn Facebook, articles and posts deemed false by fact checkers are currently flagged with a warning. They are also shown to fewer users by the platform’s suggestion algorithms, Mantzarlis says, and people are more likely to ignore flagged content than to read and share it.\n\nFlagging posts as problematic could also have knock-on effects on other users that are not captured by studies of the effectiveness of fact-checks, says Kate Starbird, a computer scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “Measuring the direct effect of labels on user beliefs and actions is different from measuring the broader effects of having those fact-checks in the information ecosystem,” she adds.\n\nMore misinformation, more red flags\n\nRegarding Meta’s claims of bias among fact-checkers, Van Bavel agrees that misinformation from the political right does get fact-checked and flagged as problematic — on Facebook and other platforms — more often than does misinformation from the left. But he offers a simple explanation.\n\n“It’s largely because the conservative misinformation is the stuff that is being spread more,” he says. “When one party, at least in the United States, is spreading most of the misinformation, it’s going to look like fact-checks are biased because they’re getting called out way more.”",

          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi",
          "abstract": "Particles known as fermions (illustration) can’t share the same state.Credit: Roman Andrade 3Dcienca/Science Photo Library\n\nTheoretical physicists have proposed the existence of a new type of particle that doesn’t fit into the conventional classifications of fermions and bosons. Their ‘paraparticle’, described in Nature on 8 January1, is not the first to be suggested, but the detailed mathematical model characterizing it could lead to experiments in which it is created using a quantum computer. The research also suggests that undiscovered elementary paraparticles might exist in nature.\n\nIn a separate development published late last year in Science2, physicists experimentally demonstrated another kind of particle that is neither a boson nor a fermion — an ‘anyon’ — in a virtual one-dimensional universe for the first time. Anyons had previously been created only in 2D systems.\n\nBecause of their unusual behaviour, both paraparticles and anyons could one day play a part in making quantum computers less error-prone.\n\nParticle properties\n\nAround the time when physicists began to understand the structure of atoms, a century ago, Austrian-born theorist Wolfgang Pauli suggested that no two electrons can occupy the same state — and that if two electrons are pushed close to being in the same state, a repulsive force arises between them. This ‘Pauli exclusion principle’ is crucial to the way electrons orbiting an atomic nucleus arrange themselves in shells, instead of all falling to the lowest possible energy state.\n\nPauli and others soon realized that this empirical rule of exclusion applied not only to electrons but to a broader class of particles, including protons and neutrons, which they called fermions. Conversely, particles that do like to share the same state — which include the photons in a laser beam, for example — became known as bosons. (Pauli and his collaborators also worked out why being a fermion or a boson appeared to relate to a particle’s intrinsic angular momentum, or ‘spin’.)\n\nWelcome anyons! Physicists find best evidence yet for long-sought 2D structures\n\nMathematically, the fundamental property of fermions is that when two of them switch positions, the ‘wavefunction’ that represents their collective quantum state changes sign, meaning that it gets multiplied by –1. For bosons, the wavefunction remains unaltered. Early quantum theorists knew that, in principle, there could be other kinds of particle whose wavefunctions changed in more complicated ways when they swapped positions. In the 1970s, researchers discovered anyons, which can exist only in universes of one or two dimensions.\n\nPhysicists Zhiyuan Wang, now at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany, and Kaden Hazzard at Rice University in Houston, Texas, have now constructed a model for paraparticles that can exist in any number of dimensions — and with properties that are different from those of either fermions or bosons. In particular, these paraparticles obey their own type of Pauli exclusion. “It’s not entirely surprising that it’s possible,” says Kasia Rejzner, a mathematical physicist at the University of York, UK. “But it’s still cool.”\n\nWang says he came up with the exotic swapping rules by chance in 2021, while doing his PhD. “It was the most exciting moment in my life,” he says. Wang adds that it should be possible — although challenging — to realize these paraparticle states on a quantum computer.\n\n1D anyons",

It looks contemporary, or perhaps like the work of a mid-century artist on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\nThis ceramic piece is in a museum, but not in any modern wing. Found as fragments in 2006 at an archaeological site in Poduri, Romania, the vase is the work of an unknown artist from some 6,000 years ago. The restored artefact is on display in a museum in northwestern Romania.\n\nThe potter who created it was a member of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, a pre-Bronze Age society that thrived in what is now Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, where several ‘megasites’ held thousands of homes.\n\nHumanity’s oldest art is flaking away. Can scientists save it?\n\nTo some archaeologists, these giant settlements are among the world’s first cities, whereas others debate whether they qualify as urban centres. In either case, they represent the largest assemblages of people in early Europe and are one of the first experiments in the urban revolution.\n\nResearchers discovered the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture in the late nineteenth century. Yet, because of the location of the sites, the culture is not as well studied as others that are roughly contemporaneous, such as those from Sumer, pre-dynastic Egypt and pre-Minoan Crete. There is now burgeoning interest in the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, which has brought researchers to the field over the past 15 years.\n\nWith the help of improved imaging and dating tools, archaeologists are increasingly able to imagine daily life in these massive communities at the centre of one of the longest-lasting cultures known in human history. Cucuteni–Trypillia has always stood out as something of an anomaly, because its settlements seemed to have been egalitarian societies that were devoid of social hierarchies. That challenged long-held archaeological ideas that large settlements inevitably develop a ruling elite — as was seen in the ancient Mesopotamian city of Uruk, in what is now Iraq.\n\nA vase found in Poduri, Romania, that was made around 6,000 years ago.Credit: Constantin Preoteasa, Cucuteni Culture: Apogee of European Prehistoric Art. Exhibition Catalogue (C. Matasă Publishing House, 2023)\n\nBut some of the latest studies have found hints of social stratification in later Cucuteni–Trypillia settlements — leading to tantalizing suggestions that this stratification could have played a part in the culture’s demise.\n\nThe emerging picture is helping to transform archaeologists’ understanding of why the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture built such unprecedentedly large settlements, and why the inhabitants eventually abandoned them. But since 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shut down many archaeological sites and stalled some studies.\n\n“At the moment, fieldwork for us is not possible. For Ukrainian archaeologists, it is a difficult situation,” says Johannes Müller, an archaeologist at Kiel University in Germany.\n\nNo elites\n\nThe combined name of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture captures the early history of research on these people. Their distinctive pottery was discovered almost simultaneously in two locations in the late nineteenth century: Romania (where the culture was named after a site in Cucuteni) and Ukraine (where the same culture was named Trypillia, also after a community where artefacts were found).\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, archaeologists filled in more details. The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture covered a huge area: at its greatest extent, it stretched east from the Carpathian Mountains to the Black Sea and north to present-day Kyiv on the Dnieper River (see ‘Cryptic culture’). For more than 2,000 years, between about 5050 bc and 2950 bc, the group made pots, hunted and gathered, farmed, raised cattle and lived in settlements where all the houses were the same size. People ate legumes and cereals grown on the rich soils of Ukraine, which were well manured by cattle. Livestock animals were also eaten, although isotope analysis of rare human remains shows that meat made up only roughly 10% of people’s diets1.\n\nSource: Ref. 2\n\nCucuteni–Trypillia settlements were of varying sizes. Many were modest villages, such as the Poduri site in Romania. But some settlements in what is now Ukraine were big — really big. Their true extent was revealed in the 1960s and 1970s, when they were photographed from the air. The largest sites2 included up to 3,000 houses and spanned as much as 320 hectares — about the size of Central Park in New York City.\n\nIn recent decades, aerial photography has been replaced with studies that survey the sites using magnetometers, which can detect buried settlements. Helpfully, the Cucuteni–Trypillia often burnt their houses, perhaps as part of rituals, leaving neat squares of ash that contain magnetic oxides formed by the burning of iron compounds in the clay daub used to finish the walls. Researchers have used magnetometer data to create detailed city plans of many settlements.\n\nSuch maps and the artefacts found in all those identical houses have answered some questions and raised many more.\n\nSocialist utopias?\n\nDespite the organized urban design of Cucuteni–Trypillia megasites, there were no palaces, no grand temples, no signs of centralized administration and no rich or poor houses. There were no special graves for high-ranking people. A bestselling 2021 book by anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow, The Dawn of Everything, brought wider attention to these sites, which the authors describe as “proof that highly egalitarian organization has been possible on an urban scale”.\n\nAt the centre of every Cucuteni–Trypillia megasite is a mysterious void: a large area with no buildings at all. According to Graeber and Wengrow, these could have been used as a place of assembly for debates or instant referendums — an arena for direct democracy. They could equally have been used to pasture cattle. Without any artefacts, it is hard to know.\n\nIt is precisely because there’s no evidence of ruling elites, centralized bureaucracy or special economic structures that some scholars hesitate to call these megasites cities, even though they were undeniably large population centres. Cucuteni–Trypillia villages also have an open central space, just on a smaller scale.\n\nAn artist’s reconstruction of a giant settlement that existed around 3800 bc in Maidanetske, Ukraine.Credit: Susanne Beyer, CAU-Kiel, Institut fur Ur-und Frilhgeschichte\n\nArchaeologist Aleksandr Diachenko at the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv suggests that the megasites grew so large, in part, because they became swollen with climate refugees. He and his team have worked to reconcile older, relative-dating methods based on pottery styles with radiocarbon dates determined using an accelerator mass spectrometer. Diachenko suggests that Cucuteni–Trypillia people from the western forests moved east into larger settlements in the steppe grasslands in response to climate change.\n\n“As the climate became more arid in this area,” says Diachenko, “it became overpopulated and, in order to deal with subsistence issues, these people had to move farther to the east.”\n\n“The megasites actually mark the outcome of these migrations,” he says. Megasites might have been fairly short-lived centres where immigrants landed before spreading out across the steppe.\n\nHints of hierarchy\n\nAt Kiel University, archaeologists have been working on the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture since 2012. Over years of excavations at the Talianki megasite in Ukraine, Kiel archaeologist Mila Shatilo grew familiar with the typical contents of its houses. To Shatilo and other Kiel researchers, the cookie-cutter dwellings are a strong indication that the culture was intentionally egalitarian. “The ornaments of pottery could be different, but you know what to expect from every house; it doesn’t seem that one household was really much richer than another,” says Shatilo.\n\nFirst passages of rolled-up Herculaneum scroll revealed\n\nOne difficulty for archaeologists studying this culture is the general absence of graves, which are usually rich sources of data. No one is entirely sure what these people did with their dead. But the lack of post-mortem hoards for most of their history sheds light on the society’s world view. Instead of being buried with their owners, metal objects might have been melted down and reused, suggest some researchers. By measuring the houses and noting the lack of elite graves, Müller says, “we are detecting that their ritual and spiritual life is not linked to the wish to express social differences”.\n\nHowever, Kiel archaeologists do see subtle signs of possible social hierarchy in what the megasite builders left behind. Data from high-resolution magnetometry surveys have revealed buildings of unusual size, form and position at a 200-hectare megasite in Maidanetske, Ukraine3. Many researchers agree that these ‘megastructures’ — some large, others in prominent locations — were likely to be public buildings. But were they churches, storehouses, senates or feasting halls? Archaeologists have proposed several explanations.\n\nA Cucuteni sculpture from northern Romania shows a seated pregnant figurine alongside other statuettes.Credit: Constantin Preoteasa, Cucuteni Culture: Apogee of European Prehistoric Art. Exhibition Catalogue (C. Matasă Publishing House, 2023)\n\nOne theory is that agglomerations of people from multiple communities banded together at the megasites, either for security or perhaps, as Diachenko argues, as fellow migrants. Communities in different neighbourhood might each have maintained a communal megastructure. Given the artefacts found in them, which include grindstones, storage jars and cattle and pig bones, Shatilo and her colleagues have proposed3 that megastructures were places where people worked together on tasks such as grinding grain and weaving, and where they stored communally owned goods and feasted. Over time, however, there seem to have been fewer of these community-specific centres, as if power was centralizing.\n\nOthers suggest that the megastructures were temples. Raised platforms inside a large building at the Nebelivka megasite in Ukraine have been interpreted as altars. This idea, say researchers, is supported by figurines and animal bones found at this site.\n\nA world of clay\n\nArchaeologist Constantin Preoteasa is the curator of the Cucuteni Museum in Piatra Neamț, Romania, and discovered the vase in Poduri in 2006. “Emotion, pleasure, honour and privilege,” were the feelings he had when he found it. “The first person seeing, touching and admiring such prestigious artefacts after several millennia: I am really lucky, indeed!”\n\nEgypt is building a $1-billion mega-museum. Will it bring Egyptology home?\n\nPreoteasa suggests that the megasites were, by and large, peaceful places. But he thinks that there was probably some hierarchy, based on skills. The potters could have been highly respected and even feared, he says, because of their ability to “transform the raw materials in artefacts using fire”.\n\nCertainly, one can’t help but feel a sense of awe when looking at their pottery. More surprising still is the fact that the gorgeous art pieces on display at the museum were found in everyday homes. They were not reserved for the elite.",

Credit: Nickbeer/Getty\n\nFemale scientists are quitting academic publishing earlier than their male counterparts, even in biological-science disciplines that have roughly equal representation.\n\nA study tracked the scholarly publications of more than 86,000 scientists in 38 countries working in neuroscience, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, immunology, microbiology and agriculture — disciplines known for having high numbers of women. The results show that, 19 years after publishing their first paper, only 26% of female researchers in these fields continue their publishing careers, compared with 36% of men.\n\nToxic workplaces are the main reason women leave academic jobs\n\n“It’s very easy to assume that science is going to change organically towards equality — and what this study shows is that that’s not happening,” says Cassidy Sugimoto, an information scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. It is an “important reminder for us that we need to stay vigilant in working towards equality in science”, she adds.\n\nThe results of the study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, were posted to the bioRxiv preprint server on 16 December1.\n\nGender gaps\n\nAcademic-career researcher Marek Kwiek and computer scientist Lukasz Szymula, both at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Poland, tracked the academic-publishing careers of two groups of biologists: 34,970 who started publishing in 2000, and 51,208 who started publishing in 2010. “We wanted to have a closer look at those areas where women are already well represented,” says Kwiek.\n\nAlmost 46% of the 2000 group and 52% of the 2010 group were women — but despite this balanced representation, men were more likely to remain in their publishing careers. In biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology and neuroscience, men were 40% more likely than women to continue publishing 19 years after publishing their first paper. In immunology, microbiology and agriculture, the gap was smaller, with men being 16–20% more likely than women to still be publishing after 19 years (see ‘Leaving science’). “Gender parity or gender balance does not really guarantee equal chances of survival in science,” says Kwiek.",

          "abstract": "Left to right: Aditya Nandy, Lauren Takahashi and David Kelley.Credit: Aparna P. Sivakumar, Lauren Takahashi, Calico/Richard Morgenstein\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) isn’t here to replace scientists — it’s simply a powerful tool that can be used to enhance their work, according to David Kelley, Lauren Takahashi and Aditya Nandy.\n\nThese rising stars are among the most prolific early-career researchers in the Nature Index in terms of AI-related output. Here, they discuss how they’re harnessing new algorithms and models to advance research in gene regulation, materials development and protein dynamics.\n\nDavid Kelley: gene-regulation decoder\n\nWhen bioinformatics scientist David Kelley transitioned from academia to a role in industry in 2016, he felt as though he was stepping into a less competitive, more collaborative culture. “Everybody is really on the same team here,” he says of his current workplace, Calico Life Sciences, a biotechnology company in San Francisco, California. He also appreciates the focus that his industry role provides — the company’s mission is to understand the biology that controls human ageing and use that knowledge to inform the development of treatments for age-related diseases. This, Kelley says, acts as “a guiding light” for him and his colleagues, helping them to prioritize what they think will be the most impactful work.\n\n“If I were at a university, I think I would be … getting distracted by this question or that question,” says Kelley. “Whereas by being in industry, you do have this strong pull towards: does this really matter? Is this really the most significant thing I could be working on right now?”\n\nKelley is investigating gene regulation as an underlying mechanism in age-related diseases. Gene regulation is the process by which cells control the expression of their genes, determining when, where and how much of certain components, such as proteins or RNA, are produced. One of the big challenges in understanding how genes are controlled is working out how certain DNA sequences, called enhancer regions, interact with genes. Enhancer regions are like switches that can turn a gene on, making it active. However, these switches can be located far from the genes they control — up to one million DNA base pairs away — making it tricky to find and study many of these connections.\n\nIn a paper published in Nature Methods1, Kelley and his co-authors reported the development of a deep-learning model, called Enformer, that could predict the expression of gene variants, including those that have long-distance interactions with enhancers. The model is “really just a few lines of code”, but has become a powerful tool, says Kelley. “It’s quite amazing and profound, the level of artificial intelligence that you can get from just having repetition after repetition of this single kind of mathematical operation that enables very general learning.”\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nOne big concern that Kelley has about his field is the lack of ethnic diversity in genomics data sets. Many gene-regulation studies depend on whole-genome sequencing data from resources such as the UK Biobank, which has 500,000 participants, some 95% of whom are white2. By using such limited data sets, researchers are missing important clues in gene regulation, he says. “You really want to profile all the variation of the world and see all of the ways that these genetic variants can influence phenotypes.”\n\nAnother challenge is the fact that Kelley’s primary AI training set is the entire human genome sequence, which is a finite resource of some three billion base pairs. “If we want large amounts of additional training data, it’s not entirely obvious where to find it,” he says. His team is getting creative by working with data from mice, as well as humans, and training models on both species simultaneously. “This works because the regulatory drivers of our shared cell types are highly conserved,” says Kelley. “Profiling more primates or other mammals could be fruitful.”\n\nLauren Takahashi: catalyst engineer\n\nLauren Takahashi, a chemical engineer and information scientist at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan, took a winding path in the early years of her career. As an undergraduate student at the University of Arizona in Tucson, she studied linguistics; she then moved to the University of Gothenburg in Sweden to complete a master of science degree that involved building a prototype search engine. The program was designed to answer questions such as ‘Where is this?’ or ‘Where can I go for that?’ using maps and locations, rather than just relying on the top results from searches, she says.\n\nDuring her time in Sweden, Takahashi attended a lecture by physicist Andre Geim, who won a share of the 2010 physics Nobel for experiments with graphene — a material comprising a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. The talk inspired Takahashi to apply her understanding of search engines to build a model that researchers could use to search the scientific literature for insight when creating graphene and other 2D materials.\n\nThe project was a hobby at first, but “it just snowballed”, she says. On the basis of this work, a friend invited Takahashi to join a research project at Japan’s National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) in Tsukuba, one of the world’s largest institutions in the field. While at NIMS, she embarked on a PhD in chemical engineering at the University of Tokyo.\n\nAt Hokkaido, Takahashi studies the use of robots and AI to produce high-performance catalysts — substances that speed up chemical reactions. One way in which she and her colleagues are doing this is by scouring the scientific literature for experimental conditions that boost the performance of catalysts. They feed this information into their AI system so that it can design experiments to produce compounds such as ethene — a building block for plastics and other materials — at lower temperatures and with higher yields than current methods3.\n\n“We’re currently working on developing a robot that does the whole thing on its own,” says Takahashi. In the future, robots could work in concert with AI to run experiments; collect and analyse data; predict new conditions, settings and catalyst combinations; and then perform the next experiment, Takahashi and a colleague wrote in a 2023 paper4.\n\nAccommodating self-directed ‘robot scientists’ would be a major adjustment for laboratories, says Takahashi. “It’s harder for the robot to function in an environment that’s developed by people. If we’re going to use AI successfully, we have to consider the needs of the AI and incorporate that whenever we develop the environments we work in.”",

Climate scientists announced the breach today, signalling that the world has failed, at least temporarily, to avoid crossing the threshold set by governments to avert the worst impacts of global warming. For the time being, it’s just one metric and one year, but researchers say that it nonetheless serves as a stark reminder that the world is moving into dangerous territory — perhaps more quickly than previously thought.\n\nEarth shattered heat records in 2023 and 2024: is global warming speeding up?\n\n“It’s both a physical reality and a symbolic shock,” says Gail Whiteman, a social scientist at the University of Exeter, UK, who studies climate risks. “We are reaching the end of what we thought was a safe zone for humanity.”\n\nThe announcement was made jointly by several international organizations that independently track the global temperature. Although each group calculated a slightly different figure, averaged together, the data indicate a consensus that, last year, Earth’s temperature hit 1.55 °C above the average for 1850–1900 — considered to be a ‘pre-industrial’ period before humans began pouring large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Unexpectedly, the 2024 figure also shows a statistically significant increase over that for 2023, when heat records were set. Climate scientists are investigating whether the two-year temperature surge is a blip or whether it marks a change in Earth’s climate system that means global warming is speeding up.\n\nNearly 200 countries signed the Paris climate accord in 2015, agreeing to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. But carbon emissions from fossil fuels and other sources have continued to rise, hitting a record high last year despite the rapid growth of clean-energy sources such as wind and solar power.\n\n“Individual years pushing past the 1.5-degree limit do not mean the long-term goal is shot,” said UN secretary-general António Guterres in a prepared statement. “It means we need to fight even harder to get on track. ... Leaders must act — now.”\n\nHot air\n\nTo filter out noise — normal climate variations — from the temperature data, scientists often report a ten-year average. This allows them to zero in on Earth’s long-term temperature trend, improve models and build better projections going forwards. By this measure, researchers estimate that the world has warmed to 1.3 °C above pre-industrial levels, and it could be several more years before 1.5 °C is well and truly breached. That extra time matters.\n\nIs it too late to keep global warming below 1.5 °C? The challenge in 7 charts\n\n“We are still living in a 1.3 °C world” in terms of air temperature, says Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy, a conservation group based in Arlington, Virginia. Most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases is absorbed by Earth’s oceans, land and ice, she adds. By the time the ten-year average for the air tops 1.5 °C, the planet will have accumulated even more heat, further amplifying violent storms and fires, ecosystem damage and sea-level rise.\n\nScientists stress that there is nothing magical about the 1.5 °C threshold. It is a political target that was included in the Paris agreement in acknowledgement of concerns that an earlier goal of limiting warming to 2 °C might not be strong enough to protect the most vulnerable countries, including island nations at risk of being submerged by rising seas. That does not mean the world is safe below 1.5 °C, nor that everything will suddenly fall apart if it is breached. It’s a spectrum, Hayhoe says, “and every bit of warming matters”.",

          "title": "How quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago",
          "authors": "Kristian Camilleri",
          "abstract": "In July 1925, a 23-year-old German physicist submitted a paper1 to the journal Zeitschrift für Physik entitled ‘On quantum-theoretical reinterpretation of kinematic and mechanical relationships’. The publication of Werner Heisenberg’s article was arguably the moment that ushered in the modern age of quantum mechanics, thus setting in train an astonishing revolution in our basic understanding of physics that has repercussions to this day. The United Nations has proclaimed 2025 to be the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, in no small measure because of the events that began to unfold at breathtaking speed 100 years ago.\n\nHeisenberg’s paper was a bold attempt to find a way out of difficulties that had plagued endeavours to explain atomic spectra — the frequencies and amplitudes of the light emitted and absorbed by atoms. His particular bone of contention was the Bohr–Sommerfeld model of the atom, named after the two physicists, Niels Bohr and Arnold Sommerfeld, who developed it in the 1910s. This model was a centrepiece of what has become known as the old quantum theory, which itself was the product of a realization at the turn of the twentieth century that the precepts of classical physics were not sufficient to explain observations of subatomic phenomena. This gap could, however, be closed by assuming, in an ad hoc way, that energy came in discrete packets: quanta.\n\nQuantum mechanics 100 years on: an unfinished revolution\n\nBy supposing that electrons move in elliptical orbits around an atomic nucleus, subject to certain quantization conditions, the Bohr–Sommerfeld model provided a set of rules for selecting certain ‘allowable’ orbits of a classical system (in the case of the hydrogen atom, an electron orbiting a proton), delivering calculated values in agreement with the observed energy spectrum. The model had successfully explained the spectrum of the hydrogen atom — consisting of just one proton and one electron — and the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of an applied electric field (the Stark effect) or magnetic field (the ordinary Zeeman effect). But it had run into a host of problems in dealing with hydrogen molecules, and with atoms with more than one electron.\n\nThis was a problem that Heisenberg had uncovered when he joined the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Göttingen, Germany, in 1923, as theorist Max Born’s assistant. He and Born had made a series of detailed calculations of the helium atom’s spectrum, using all of the orbits allowed by the Bohr–Sommerfeld model, but their results did not agree with experimental observations. Their early suspicions that the problem lay with the calculation methods soon gave way to a more fundamental misgiving. “It becomes increasingly probable,” Born wrote2, “that not only new assumptions will be needed in the sense of physical hypotheses, but that the entire system of concepts in physics will have to be rebuilt from the ground up.” Writing to Sommerfeld, his old teacher, in December 1923, Heisenberg noted that “none of the model representations really make sense. The orbits are real with respect to neither the frequency nor the energy.”\n\nHeisenberg was not alone in expressing this doubt. His friend and frequent correspondent Wolfgang Pauli also became increasingly convinced that the idea of electrons moving in orbits was untenable, telling Sommerfeld in December 1924, “we are speaking a language inadequate to describe the simplicity and beauty of the quantum world.” Yet it was not clear how to proceed without the orbital models. As late as April 1925, Heisenberg wrote that in “the present state of quantum theory, one must rely on symbolic, model-like pictures that are more or less built on the mechanical behaviour of electrons in classical theory”3.\n\nIt was a couple of months later, when seeking respite from a bout of hay fever on the German island of Heligoland in the North Sea, that Heisenberg set out the kernel of a more drastic approach. Rather than constructing an atomic model based on the idea that electrons move along well-defined orbits in a roughly classical fashion, Heisenberg decided to develop an innovative theory of motion, a ‘quantum mechanics’ in which electrons could no longer be thought of as particles that move along continuous trajectories. On 9 July, he wrote to Pauli that “all my wretched efforts are devoted to killing the concept of orbits completely — which cannot be observed anyway”. This was the decisive break with classical mechanics.\n\nWerner Heisenberg, pictured in 1925.Credit: Corbis via Getty\n\nIn his paper1, which was submitted a few weeks later, he set out “to establish a basis of theoretical quantum mechanics founded exclusively on relationships between quantities that in principle are observable”. Heisenberg formulated an equation of electron motion based on the classical equation of motion for a periodic system. In place of quantities such as position and momentum, it included complex arrays of observable energies and transition amplitudes (the probabilities of atoms undergoing a transition from one quantum state to another).\n\nThis was a strategy born more out of desperation than from any philosophical conviction. As Heisenberg explained in the paper’s introduction, in light of the complexities involved in dealing with atoms with several electrons, “it seems sensible to discard all hope of observing hitherto unobservable quantities such as the position and period of the electron”.\n\nDoes quantum theory imply the entire Universe is preordained?\n\nHowever, it was difficult to see how the elimination of unobservable quantities would guide the further development of the theory. Before the theory could describe phenomena such as collisions and the motion of free particles, it would have to include other quantities in addition to energies and transition amplitudes. Beyond that, it was not even clear which quantities should be regarded as unobservable. The electron position, for example, was re-admitted as being observable in 1927. As Born reflected decades later, the idea of eliminating unobservable quantities had sounded reasonable enough in 1925, but in practice such a “general and vague formulation is quite useless, even misleading”.\n\nPragmatic considerations lay at the heart of Heisenberg’s physics. He often played with all sorts of ideas until he found one that worked — an approach well suited to a period of such conceptual turmoil. Philosophical principles were typically used as a means of overcoming an impasse, or as a last resort, and could be discarded when they were no longer useful. As Born would later note, the real value of philosophical principles for the working physicist can be judged “only according to their relative usefulness in producing results”.\n\nMatrices or waves?\n\nHeisenberg was adamant that only a “more intensive mathematical investigation” would reveal whether the method he had used in his July paper could “be regarded as satisfactory”. This was done by Born and Pascual Jordan in Göttingen in the months that followed. Realizing that the quantities that appeared in Heisenberg’s equations could be represented as matrices (a form of mathematics unfamiliar to most physicists at the time), they recast the theory in these terms. Their innovative ‘matrix mechanics’ was set out in a long paper4, commonly known as the Dreimännerarbeit (the three-man paper) submitted by Born, Heisenberg and Jordan in November 1925.\n\nBut this model came at a price. As the authors explained, the new theory had “the disadvantage of not being directly amenable to a geometrically visualizable interpretation, since the motion of electrons cannot be described in terms of the familiar concepts of space and time”. Whereas Born and Jordan revelled in the abstraction, Heisenberg could not help but wonder in a letter to Pauli in June 1925 “what the equations of motion really mean”. Pauli’s successful calculation5 of the hydrogen atom spectrum using the scheme in December that year was widely regarded as a vindication of the effort. But most physicists found it difficult to come to terms with the abstruse mathematics. It was a welcome relief when an altogether different approach appeared just a few months later, in the first half of 1926.\n\nThis came in the form of a series of groundbreaking papers in the Annalen der Physik published by Erwin Schrödinger6, working at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. The idea that the motions of electrons could not be described in space and time was, as far as Schrödinger was concerned, an abdication of the physicist’s responsibility, and amounted to abandoning all hope of ever understanding the atom’s inner workings. Such an understanding, Schrödinger maintained, was possible. Admitting in a footnote to one of the papers that he was “repelled by” the Göttingen approach to quantum mechanics, he instead formulated a wave equation that enabled him to calculate the energy states of the hydrogen atom. For Schrödinger, this promised a more intuitive understanding of quantum states as a “vibration process in the atom”. Rather than thinking of electrons as particles moving in orbits, he proposed that they could be thought of as waves, with a continuous distribution of electric charge in 3D space.\n\n‘Shut up and calculate’: how Einstein lost the battle to explain quantum reality\n\nHeisenberg was having none of it. After attending a colloquium in Munich, Germany, at which Schrödinger presented his theory, Heisenberg complained to Pauli that the wave theory could not account for a host of quantum phenomena, including the photoelectric effect — the emission of electrons from a metallic surface when it is illuminated — and the Stern–Gerlach effect, in which a beam of atoms was found to deflect in one of two ways when passing through a spatially varying magnetic field. Moreover, describing a many-particle system required a wavefunction in an abstract multidimensional space. The wavefunction was undoubtedly a useful calculational tool, but it didn’t seem to describe anything like a real wave. “Even if a consistent wave theory of matter in the usual three-dimensional space could be developed,” Heisenberg wrote in June 1926, “it would hardly yield an exhaustive description of atomic processes in terms of our familiar space-time concepts”7.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Mark Peterson/Corbis via Getty\n\nJimmy Carter’s work in health, peace and diplomacy crossed decades, continents, boundaries and disciplines. After his US presidency (1977–81), he found a focus for his scientific and diplomatic work by launching the Carter Center in 1982 with his wife Rosalynn Carter. The organization is built on a commitment to human rights and the alleviation of human suffering. Its programmes address the prevention and resolution of conflicts, enhancing freedom and democracy and improving global health. Over decades of work, Carter Center delegations have observed elections in more than 100 countries, promoted peace in multiple nations, championed the control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases and strengthened international standards for human rights. Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work in conflict resolution, human rights and social progress. He has died aged 100.\n\nEven with no drug or vaccine, eradication of Guinea worm is in sight\n\nThe Carters’ work was exemplified by their dedication to the eradication of Guinea-worm disease, a debilitating parasitic disease transmitted by drinking contaminated water. Carter brought not only his compassion and persistence, but his political acumen. In 1995, he brokered what has become known as the South Sudan Guinea-worm ceasefire. Working across both sides of the Second Sudanese Civil War, he was able to get the parties to agree to stop fighting long enough to begin efforts to eradicate the disease in a country that then had three times as many cases as the rest of the world combined. Guinea-worm disease is not yet eradicated, but cases have gone from 3.5 million when the programme started in 1986, to 10 confirmed cases between January and October 2024.\n\nSon of a nurse and a farmer, James Earl Carter Jr, was born in the small farming town of Plains, Georgia. He grew up in the nearby community of Archery and was educated in public school, later attending Georgia Southwestern College in Americus and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. In 1946, he graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and became a submariner. Carter received further training in reactor technology and nuclear physics at Union College in Schenectady, New York, and served as pre-commissioning officer for the US Navy’s second nuclear submarine, the USS Seawolf.\n\nHe left the navy and returned to Plains to take over his family’s peanut farm after the death of his father in 1953. He became active in the civil-rights movement with the Democratic Party and moved into politics, being the governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and serving one term as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He married Rosalynn Smith in 1946. They had 4 children and shared 77 years together, with Rosalynn being a crucial partner in both his political and philanthropic activities until her death in 2023.\n\nEight countries eliminated a neglected tropical disease in 2022\n\nIn 1982, Carter became a professor at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and founded the Carter Center in the same city. The centre identified Guinea-worm disease as a priority and launched an eradication campaign in 1986. Infection with the parasite Dracunculus medinensis results in a blister or sore that can appear anywhere on the body around one year after exposure. From this burning sore emerges an adult worm about one metre long, which must be removed inch by inch over days or weeks. As well as being painful, the inflammatory response can be debilitating and result in deformity and disability. There is no drug to treat or prevent the infection, nor a vaccine or diagnostic test. On top of that, this disease affects some of the hardest to reach, most marginalized populations around the world.",

          "authors": "Brian Owens",
          "abstract": "The University of Toronto in Canada raised its graduate-student stipends last November.Credit: James Wagner/Getty\n\nStipends for biology and physics graduate students at Canadian universities fall well short of a living wage, an analysis reports.\n\n“All of the minimum stipends we found were below the poverty line after tuition, except for the physics department at the University of Toronto,” says Thomas Bailey, a PhD student at the University of Ottawa and an author of the work, which was posted on the bioRxiv preprint server last November and has not yet undergone peer review1. “People who want to study science in Canada have three options: hope for more support from their supervisor, take on big debts or emigrate.”\n\nBailey and his colleagues collected information on the minimum graduate-student stipends, tuition costs and other fees in physics and biology departments across the country. After comparing the stipend — minus tuition and other fees — with the local cost of living, they found that the average minimum stipend for domestic students is around Can$9,500 (US$11,900) below the poverty line, whereas international students fare even worse, falling about Can$16,900 short.\n\nCanadian stipends also lag behind those in other similar countries — the highest Canadian minimum stipend is roughly equivalent to the lowest biology stipend in the United States, and lower than the stipend in the United Kingdom. The authors estimate that Canadian stipends would need to increase by 1.5 times merely to keep pace with the cost of living. (By way of comparison, according to the ‘Big Mac Index’, a whimsical metric of purchasing power, the price of a McDonald’s Big Mac sandwich differs by only about 3% in those three countries.)\n\nMost university departments set a minimum stipend for graduate students, with the money coming from a mix of the supervisor’s grants, departmental funds and salary for teaching assistant posts. Tuition and other fees are deducted from the stipend — on average 34% of the stipend is returned to the university for a local student. (By contrast, tuition is typically waived for graduate students in the United States and United Kingdom.) Students who receive scholarships or other external funding generally have their stipend reduced, although the exact arrangements vary.\n\nFamiliar story\n\nHilary Hennessey, campaigns commissioner for the Canadian Federation of Students’ National Graduate Caucus and a graduate student at Memorial University in Newfoundland, says that the study reflects the federation’s own survey data. More than 70% of graduate students in Canada are living below the poverty line, Hennessey’s survey found, and one-quarter are worried about whether they will have enough money to complete their studies. “High tuition and the cost of living are putting graduate studies out of reach for many,” she says.\n\nSimilarly, a 2021–22 survey of graduate students by the Ottawa Science Policy Network found that roughly 43% of 1,305 respondents reported that they frequently struggled to make ends meet or that their tight finances forced them to make sacrifices to afford necessities, and less than 10% were comfortable with their financial situation2.\n\nUniversities have not been blind to this growing problem, says Ian Wereley, executive director of the Canadian Association for Graduate Studies in Ottawa. “Over the past decade, universities and faculties of graduate studies have realized they need to be more aware of the non-academic struggles of our students,” he says.\n\nThe rising costs of rent and food have led to a huge increase in the number of students using food banks and living in their cars, highlighting the significant need for assistance, he says. The problem is that universities face challenges of their own, with freezes on tuition fees and operating grants, and caps on admissions of international students, whose higher tuition fees have subsidized university operations for years.\n\n“While universities recognize the need and want to take action, they are also faced with restrictions on resources,” says Wereley.\n\nTurning the corner",

          "title": "Why kids need to take more risks: science reveals the benefits of wild, free play",
          "authors": "Julian Nowogrodzki",
          "abstract": "On a warm, sunny beach near Melbourne, Australia, Alethea Jerebine watched her daughters scrambling up a jumble of rocks. “Can they do that?” she worried about her 10-year-old and 13-year-old. The rocks were pocked with crevices and so steep that they gave Jerebine vertigo. Instinctively, she wanted to tell them to stop.\n\nAt the same time, she knew her pangs of anxiety were incongruous with her own research. What her children were doing is a kind of ‘risky play’ — activities ranging from climbing and jumping from heights to simply leaving the watchful eye of an adult. Jerebine is a public-health and psychology researcher at Deakin University in Melbourne, who studies the wide-ranging benefits of risky play. Still, she’s not immune to the pressure that many parents and guardians feel to protect their children from every possible harm.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nOver the past two decades, research has emerged showing that opportunities for risky play are crucial for healthy physical, mental and emotional development. Children need these opportunities to develop spatial awareness, coordination, tolerance of uncertainty and confidence.\n\nDespite this, in many nations risky play is now more restricted than ever, thanks to misconceptions about risk and a general undervaluing of its benefits. Research shows that children know more about their own abilities than adults might think, and some environments designed for risky play point the way forwards. Many researchers think that there’s more to learn about the benefits, but because play is inherently free-form, it has been logistically difficult to study. Now, scientists are using innovative approaches, including virtual reality, to probe the benefits of risky play, and how to promote it.\n\nEven safety advocates support it. “Most people assume I would be against risky play,” says Pamela Fuselli, president of Parachute, an injury-prevention non-profit organization based in Toronto, Canada. “But the benefits are so broad in terms of social, physical, mental development and mental health, I don’t think we can underestimate the value.”\n\nThrilling and exciting\n\nThe origins of risky-play research date back to 1996, when Norway passed a regulation on playground safety that required things such as handrails, rounded corners and equipment that minimizes the risk of injury from falls to be added to play areas. A few years later, psychologist Ellen Sandseter noticed that playground equipment was being removed as a result of the law and replaced with elements that offered little chance for risk-taking. She found this concerning. Her research had shown that adolescents who had fewer opportunities for positive types of thrill-seeking — such as mountain climbing — were more likely to take negative risks, such as shoplifting1. So, Sandseter, who works at Queen Maud University College of Early Childhood Education in Trondheim, Norway, began to study risk-seeking and sensation-seeking in children aged three to five. Unable to find a definition of risky play in the literature at the time, she built one on the basis of hours of observation and interviews with young children about what activities they thought were scary, risky or thrilling.\n\nHer definition of risky play is still widely used: thrilling and exciting play that involves uncertainty and a risk — either real or perceived — of physical injury or getting lost.\n\nRisky play is thought to help build risk-management skills that can transfer to other situations.Credit: Thomas Barwick/Getty\n\nImportantly, risk is not the same as danger. Danger is something a child isn’t equipped to notice or deal with. For example, it’s dangerous, not risky, for four-year-olds to go barefoot around broken glass or to cross a busy street with no practice. Risk changes with age and doesn’t always include things that look risky to adults. For a one-year-old who has never walked before, taking a single step is probably risky enough.\n\nThe goal of promoting risky play isn’t to turn cautious children into thrill-seekers, it’s simply to allow them to take incremental risks at whatever pace they choose, say proponents. “What risky play looks like for one child will be totally different to what it looks like for another,” says child psychologist Helen Dodd at the University of Exeter, UK.\n\nAnd getting chances to take risks is as important for children with naturally cautious personalities as it is for those who are born daredevils. “All children need to be able to stretch their own limits, and all children want that,” says Sandseter.\n\nRisk management\n\nRisky play is associated with greater resilience, self-confidence, problem-solving and social skills such as cooperation, negotiation and empathy, according to studies by Sandseter and others. When a study in Leuven, Belgium, gave four- and six-year-olds just two hours a week of opportunities for risky play over the course of three months, their risk-assessment skills improved compared with those of children in a control group2. In this study, the risky play took place at school, in a gym class and in the classroom.\n\nYoung people’s mental health is finally getting the attention it needs\n\nOutdoor risky play might have extra benefits. It is linked to having low levels of stress and anxiety. Dodd hypothesizes that risky play lowers children’s risk of anxiety by teaching them about physiological arousal, the adrenaline and racing heartbeat that accompanies anxiety and excitement. Over time, her theory posits, when children have a chance to repeatedly experience the cycle of challenge, arousal and coping, this helps them learn to manage anxiety and understand that physiological stress isn’t a disaster and doesn’t last forever.\n\nDodd had set up an observational study3 to test this theory. It began in early April 2020 and captured data during the first month of the COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom. Dodd found that children who spent more time playing adventurously had fewer signs of anxiety and depression (according to parent reports) than those who spent less time in adventurous play. The kids with more opportunities for risk seemed happier. This pattern of risky play as a protective factor against mental-health issues was stronger for children from lower-income households than for those from higher-income households.\n\nAs a whole, the quality of research in the field of risky play is mixed, says child-development researcher Mariana Brussoni at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, but often with good reason. Not many studies are gold-standard randomized controlled trials, but these “are expensive and sometimes inappropriate to the research question”, she says.\n\nNone of this means that parents should tell kids to take more risks, says Dodd, because that doesn’t lead to positive learning. “Play should always be led by the child and what the child wants to do,” she says. The adults’ role is to provide a conducive environment and then get out of the way — or at the most, to cheerlead gently. This makes risky play hard to study experimentally. “It ceases to be play the moment an adult tells a child to do it,” says Dodd.\n\nThe Venny, an adventure playground in Melbourne, Australia, provides opportunities for risky play.Credit: The Venny\n\nIf risky-play advocates have a rallying cry, it is probably this: “Children should be as safe as necessary, not as safe as possible.” But what’s a parent to do with this injunction? A child’s facial expressions and body language can be good markers to observe. A study4 led by Brussoni contains a table that the team used to sort positive risky play from hazardous or dangerous play as they observed children. When kids are in the productive risky-play zone and trying things that are above their current skill level, they might have an expression of determination on their face, seem in control of their body and use trial and error. If that’s the case, Dodd suggests nearby adults to “just hold back that little bit more, count to ten before you say ‘no’. See if they can resolve something for themselves rather than always jumping in.”\n\nThe topography of a playground can also encourage risky play, research shows4. Play on uneven surfaces — such as boulders — or steep slopes was much more likely to involve positive-risk behaviours than play on flat areas in Brussoni’s 2023 analysis4 at a play space with nature elements at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History in California.\n\nVirtual rock-hopping\n\nOne of Brussoni’s hypotheses about risky play is that it can help to build risk-management skills that transfer to other situations, such as crossing a busy street, she says. That’s hard to test. “Ethically speaking, you can’t really throw kids in traffic environments, because they could actually get hurt,” she says. So Brussoni, Sandseter and their colleagues created a virtual setting in which they could convincingly test children’s risk-management skills, without the danger.\n\nFirst, they gave children aged seven to ten eye-tracking virtual-reality headsets and fitted motion sensors on their joints. The kids were able to explore three scenarios: crossing a street, leaping from rock to rock to cross a river and roaming a virtual playground to balance on the equipment.",

Most smiled, those were for the happy days, but some frowned, too.\n\nEvery day Bibi was awake, she made a new star and Mumi always hung it up for her. This made Bibi happy, even on sad days when the rusty old ship was scary and creaked extra loud.\n\nBibi could remember the day for each and every star. Days running in empty greenhouses, her giggles and footsteps bouncing off dusty glass. Days climbing through empty cargo pods, pretending they were metal mountains. Days shouting at the ship’s shaky hull, yelling at the Big Empty outside, but it was always too scared to come in and fight her. And days splashing in the cooling ponds, imagining they were vast oceans like in the crinkly old books. Sometimes she fell in and got wet, but she always kept trying.\n\n“I’m good at not giving up,” Bibi whispered. Mumi always said so, and Mumi knew everything.\n\nSomething below clanged and red lights blinked up through the floor. Bibi peeked down and saw Mumi working with wires and pipes. Mumi’s long body moved smoothly, her hands a blur.\n\n“Mumi?” Bibi called softly.\n\n“Yes, child.” Mumi’s voice click-click-clicked more than usual tonight. She stopped working and tilted her head to listen.\n\n“I can’t sleep,” said Bibi. She twisted a small knot into her covers. “I’m hungry.”\n\nMumi laughed, a sound like tiny kisses. “Surely you’re tired, Bibi Bené. In a few days it’ll be time for a Big Sleep. Tonight is just a little one. Say the words, and sleep will come.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nBibi yawned. “Yes, Mumi.” But she wondered about the Big Sleep. Mumi said she made food during the Big Sleeps. Bibi didn’t know how, but whenever she woke up, there was food.\n\nBibi tried to sleep, but couldn’t. A soft cry came from below. Bibi slipped out of her pod and tiptoed downstairs. The metal floor was cold on her feet.\n\nMumi stood by the blinking lights. A single flower sat in a pot next to her. Mumi said it was the last one. Bibi had never seen Mumi so still before. She looked like a tall flower herself with a dress full of holes. Red light blinked and blipped through the holes, making funny shapes on the walls and wires and pipes.\n\n“Are your stars sad today?” Bibi asked, touching Mumi’s dress. It hummed softly in her fingers.\n\n“Bibi Bené, you’re not asleep,” said Mumi.\n\nBibi giggled. Her fingers found a hole in Mumi’s dress.\n\n“They are …” Mumi’s voice click-click-clicked, “happy stars.”\n\nBibi thought red lights meant something was wrong. She was glad it didn’t.\n\n“This pretty star means you get a surprise. Tonight is a Big Sleep, after all.”\n\nWell, that didn’t sound like fun. Air rustled her hair, tugging it.\n\n“And when you wake up, there will be more surprises.”\n\n“What kind?” Bibi couldn’t imagine.\n\n“Well,” Mumi clicked, “flowers and food and people, too.”\n\nBibi gasped. She spun around with her arms out wide. “People! Like me?”\n\n“Quickly now.”\n\nShe ran back to her pod and jumped in, squeezing her eyes shut so tight the red light leaked through. She had to say the words right away.\n\nNow I lay me down to sleep. I pray the stars my soul to keep. And if I should forget to wake …\n\nBut Bibi couldn’t stop thinking about people. Outside, dust tapped on the ship, louder and louder, and air rustled the paper stars above her pod like crazy.\n\nMumi was by her side very fast, her long arms reaching up to the paper stars to keep them from blowing away. Their shadows moved across Bibi’s face.\n\nBibi felt warmth through the holes in Mumi’s dress.\n\n“Oh!” said Mumi, looking at the red flashing lights through the floor. “We can’t forget the most important part of the day, but you have to hurry.”\n\nBibi got her paper and made a new star. It had the biggest smile ever. One more Big Sleep and when she woke up there would be people.\n\nMumi hung the star higher than all the rest. “It’s time, Bibi Bené.”",

          "abstract": "A green dye marks lipocartilage cells from the ear of a rat.Credit: Plikus lab, Univ. California, Irvine\n\nThe ear and the nose are squishy and stretchy thanks in part to ‘bubble wrap’ cells that provide extra cushioning and structural support to various body parts, a wide-ranging study1 shows.\n\nThese ‘lipocartilage’ cells — which are found in many mammals and have been grown from human stem cells— are fully described for the first time in a study published today in Science. The discovery of a new cell type “doesn’t happen often”, says Markéta Kaucká, an evolutionary-developmental biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plön, Germany, who wasn’t involved with the study. “This finding is really striking.”\n\nLarge but long overlooked\n\nLipocartilage cells have been hiding in plain sight for more than 160 years. In 1857, a German zoologist named Franz von Leydig reported that the cartilage tissue in a rat’s ear contains large cells that are filled with depots of lipids — a description that also applies to fat cells. But classic cartilage cells, called chondrocytes, are smaller than fat cells and lack a lipid depot. They churn out molecules that combine into a stiff latticework called the extracellular matrix, which provides structure and support to the cartilage tissue.\n\nTo understand the form and function of the fat-filled cells in cartilage, Maksim Plikus, a cell biologist at the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues examined them under a microscope and analysed their biochemistry and biomechanics. The team found that these cells have enormous intracellular structures called vacuoles that are filled with lipids. As a result, under the microscope, the cells “look like iridescent pearls”, Plikus says.\n\nCell ‘atlases’ offer unprecedented view of placenta, intestines and kidneys\n\nBut the researchers noticed that these cells don’t secrete the same signalling proteins that fat cells typically do, and that their patterns of gene activation resemble those of chondrocytes rather than those of fat cells. The most striking difference, Plikus says, was that when the researchers fed mice either a reduced-calorie or a high-fat diet, the cells remained about the same size, whereas typical fat cells would have either shrunk or ballooned in response. That suggested that lipocartilage cells don’t have a metabolic function — in contrast to fat cells, which are central to metabolism.\n\nInstead, the large lipid reservoirs inside lipocartilage cells serve to make cartilage tissue less stiff. Chondrocytes, says Plikus, provide structure by creating an extracellular matrix akin to packing foam, which consists of a dense array of small, hard-walled voids. But lipocartilage cells are similar to bubble wrap, which uses large, air-filled pockets for cushioning.\n\n“The idea that you regulate stiffness of tissue by controlling what’s inside the cell rather than through the extracellular matrix is new and interesting,” says Paul Janmey, a biophysicist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. “That’s not typically the case, even in fat tissue.”",

          "abstract": "RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 constantly accrue new mutations.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/SPL\n\nThe holy grail of pandemic preparedness is being able to predict how a virus will evolve just by looking at its genetic sequence. Those days are still a way off, but a growing number of research groups are using artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, influenza and other viruses.\n\nViruses — particularly RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 — constantly evolve by accruing new mutations. Some of these changes are advantageous to the virus, allowing variants to evade host immunity and spread rapidly. By predicting how a virus will evolve, researchers could, in theory, design vaccines and antiviral treatments ahead of time.\n\nSo far, AI tools can predict which single mutations in a virus will be most successful, and which variants will ‘win’ out in the short term. But they are still far from being able to forecast combinations of mutations or variants that will occur a long time in the future.\n\nIt’s “a really exciting and very useful area for research”, says Brian Hie, a computational biologist at Stanford University in California, who was among the first researchers to apply large language models to the study of viral mutations1. But predicting viral evolution is still extremely challenging, he says.\n\nAI tools\n\nIn the past, researchers have conducted laboratory experiments to identify variants with enhanced properties, but these are laborious and time-consuming. Some groups, such as the lab led by Yunlong Cao, an immunologist at Peking University in Beijing, have developed experiments investigating how individual mutations affect a virus’s ability to escape detection by a panel of antibodies2. These experiments can explain a large amount of viral evolution, but not all of it.\n\nThe arrival of AI-based protein-structure prediction tools — such as AlphaFold, created by London-based AI company DeepMind, as well as ESM-23 and ESMFold, both created by Meta (formerly Facebook, headquartered in Menlo Park, California) — has brought new energy to the field, says David Robertson, a virologist at the University of Glasgow, UK.\n\nAI models require vast amounts of data to be able to predict viral evolution. The mass sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has made this possible, says Jumpei Ito, a bioinformatician at the University of Tokyo. Researchers now have close to 17 million sequences they can use to train their models.\n\nOne model, called EVEscape, which was developed by Debora Marks at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and her team, has been used to engineer 83 possible versions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which the virus uses to infect cells. These spike avatars can evade antibodies produced by people who have been vaccinated or infected with currently circulating variants4, and could be used to test the effectiveness of future COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIto’s group is focusing on a broader characteristic of viral fitness — the ability of variants to spread rapidly in a population, and eventually dominate. The researchers used ESM-2 to create a model called CoVFit, which can predict the relative fitness of SARS-CoV-2 variants. CoVFit is trained on 13,643 SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein variants, and also uses experimental data from Cao’s group about how individual mutations affect the virus’s ability to evade antibodies. Ito’s team created a restricted model trained using variant data up to August 2022, and found that it successfully predicted the improved fitness of certain variants after that cut-off — including XBB5, a novel variant that took hold later that year.\n\nBy March 2024, the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant worldwide was one named JN.1.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nNASA has again put off deciding how to accomplish one of its highest-profile missions in decades: bringing rocks back from Mars.\n\nAfter years of ballooning cost estimates, the agency promised last April that it would develop a cheaper method for Mars sample return. But during a mission update on 7 January, it kicked the can down the road, saying it would continue to explore two options: one using well-tested NASA technology and the other relying on systems being developed by private aerospace companies.\n\nThe hunt for life on Mars: A visual guide to NASA’s latest mission\n\nThe final decision isn’t expected until next year. The earliest the NASA spacecraft could launch would be 2031, with the samples coming to Earth no earlier than 2035. Costs for both options range from around US$6 billion to $7 billion — less than earlier estimates of up to $11 billion, but still a major challenge for the cash-strapped agency.\n\n“I’m disappointed we don’t have an entirely clear path forward yet,” says Victoria Hamilton, a planetary geologist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who chairs a group that provides NASA with community input on its Mars exploration plans. She notes that Mars sample return has been a top priority for US planetary science for decades and that the community is keen for it to get under way.\n\nChallenging delivery\n\nNo nation has yet delivered Mars samples to Earth, although China is working on plans to do so as early as 2031. Studying Martian rocks in person would allow scientists to conduct analyses much more sophisticated than those that rovers can do on the red planet. Keeping both design options for now “will help us achieve delivering this science for everybody”, said Nicola Fox, NASA’s associate administrator for science, during the media briefing.\n\nNASA’s goal is to bring back 30 of the tubes of Martian rock, dust and air that the agency’s Perseverance rover has collected over the past few years from a variety of geological environments in Jezero Crater, where it landed. The rover has travelled across an ancient river delta and last year left the crater, entering a realm of ancient Martian rocks that have never before been explored.\n\nNASA admits plan to bring Mars rocks to Earth won’t work — and seeks fresh ideas\n\nNASA put its Mars sample-return plans on hold last year while it solicited fresh ideas from businesses and the public about how to do it for less than $11 billion. On the basis of the feedback, NASA administrator Bill Nelson chose the two-option approach.",

So he located all the relevant papers on a bacterial species that his laboratory studies — an organism that causes tooth decay called Streptococcus sobrinus — but discovered that he’d already read all of them, a few dozen in total.\n\nMany microbiologists will be in a similar position — or worse. In a study posted on the preprint server bioRxiv last week1, Jensen found that just ten bacterial species account for half of all publications, whereas nearly three-quarters of all named bacteria don’t have a single paper devoted to them.\n\n“We’ve learnt a lot about a small number of species,” Jensen says. But “for a lot of bacteria, there’s nothing for a language model, for an AI to read”. The microbes important for human — and Earth’s — health are especially understudied, researchers say.\n\nModel microbe\n\nLike other life scientists, microbiologists study model organisms, in the hope that insights gleaned from well-behaved lab darlings such as Escherichia coli will be relevant to other organisms.\n\nIn many cases they are: the foundations of molecular biology are built of experiments in E. coli. But as scientists expand the catalogue of microbial life with every skin swab, poo or soil sample they sequence, the chance to uncover new and unusual insights grows.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nTo quantify microbiology’s bias towards a small number of model organisms, Jensen consulted a database of 43,409 unique bacterial species and counted the number of papers indexed by PubMed — a US government-run biomedical literature repository — that mentions each species in the title or abstract.\n\nUnsurprisingly, E. coli came out on top, with more than 312,000 publications, 21% of the total. The rest of the top ten consisted mainly of human pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori, a stomach microbe that can cause ulcers and even cancer (see ‘Most studied bacteria’).\n\nBut 74% of bacterial species were not mentioned in the title or abstract of any indexed paper (see ‘Ignored microbes’). And the gap between known and studied bacteria has also grown wider in the past 25 years, owing in part to microbiome studies that sequence microbes en masse.\n\nUnderstudied organisms\n\nNicola Segata, a microbiome scientist at the University of Trento in Italy, is dismayed by the study’s conclusions — but not surprised. With one or two exceptions, microbes abundant in healthy human microbiomes don’t crack the list of the 50 best studied bacteria. And many organisms important to human health that Segata and others have found haven’t even been named, let alone studied. “These species still have a long way before they will be studied at the level they deserve,” he adds.\n\nMicrobes found in diverse ecosystems, such as in oceans and soil, are also conspicuously understudied, notes Brett Baker, a microbial ecologist at the University of Texas at Austin. “None of the dominant organisms in nature are on this list,” he says. “That’s a problem.”\n\nSource: Ref. 1",

          "abstract": "Get with the programme: a scene from TV comedy Silicon Valley, which helped Richard Kuo to navigate the start-up landscape. Credit: 3 Arts Entertainment/Alamy\n\nRichard Kuo was a genomics PhD student in 2021 when he landed a £300,000 (US$380,000) grant to commercialize a new field of biology using a technique known as long-read RNA sequencing. The grant was from Innovate UK, a public agency that supports organizations delivering original products and services.\n\nSince then, Wobble Genomics, Kuo’s spin-off from the University of Edinburgh, UK, has grown from 2 to 16 employees, and in March 2024 raised £8.5 million. This money, combined with encouraging results in the laboratory, enabled the company to move on from ‘stealth mode’.\n\nKuo, now Wobble’s chief executive, describes how he became an entrepreneur, how the company name came about and what the move from stealth mode means for the business in the longer term.\n\nMy career path from chemist to spin-off co-founder to chief technology officer\n\nIn common with other science entrepreneurs profiled in Nature’s careers section, Kuo addresses concerns about the impact of the collapse of the health-technology company Theranos in 2018. Theranos’s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, was convicted of defrauding investors in 2022, and  its high-profile demise has reportedly made the funding climate more challenging for spin-off companies.\n\nHow did your career journey as a science entrepreneur come about?\n\nThe final-year project of my bachelor’s degree course in bio-engineering and biomedical engineering involved a competition to create a biomedical device.\n\nMy team won with a gadget to help blind people navigate interior areas.\n\nI wanted to commercialize it and approached my university (Columbia, in New York). It didn’t go anywhere, but that’s when I became interested in building a biotech company.\n\nIn 2011, I moved to the University of Edinburgh, UK, for a master’s degree in bioinformatics, after which I worked as a bioinformatician at the university’s Roslin Institute, in its National Avian Research Facility.\n\nMy principal investigator, Dave Burt, approached me about doing a PhD in a completely new technology, which we now call long-read RNA sequencing. I started part-time in 2014.\n\nAt the time, there was a massive transition from conventional biology to informatics-based biology, providing answers to fundamental biological questions that we’ve had for a long time, with lots of applications in the medical field.\n\nRichard Kuo’s company, Wobble Genomics, focuses on the early detection of diseases such as breast cancer.Credit: Scott Barron Photography\nHow did you establish Wobble Genomics?\n\nIn 2018, I approached the technology-transfer office at the University of Edinburgh, which guided me through the set-up process, and provided support, training and advice on subjects such as intellectual-property ownership.\n\nTwo years later, the tech-transfer team helped me to get into the ICURe programme, run by Innovate UK to help scientists in the start-up world. I was one of five to win a £300,000 grant.\n\nAs a result, the company got attention from investors, and we were able to start the business properly, including renting a lab.\n\nHow did you decide on the company name?\n\nI decided on Wobble Genomics in 2019. In genetics, there’s a weird thing that scientists noticed, that for every three nucleotides, the third base in that triplet could pair in a more flexible way, or with a ‘wobble’. Francis Crick came up with the Wobble hypothesis in 1966.\n\nHow a struggling biotech company became a university ‘spin-in’\n\nOther potential names had included Kaizen Genomics, to reflect the Japanese principle of continuous improvement, and Status Genomics, to indicate how our technology could provide health-status information.\n\nI’d also thought about using transcriptomics instead of genomics, but it was long, and I was not sure how many people would understand the difference.\n\nI wanted something more memorable — something a little bit silly-sounding would probably stick in people’s heads better. Plus, I had this test for myself: if your company name could be used as the name of an evil organization in a sci-fi film, it’s probably not a great name. I thought, with Wobble Genomics, that probably wouldn’t happen. I registered the name in 2021.\n\nWhat does your technology do?\n\nIt detects diseases such as cancer by looking at signals in the blood called full-length RNA and how they help cells to communicate with each other. Other diagnostic technologies use short-read RNA, but that is like seeing only individual words — full-length RNA allows you to see whole sentences. It is a much stronger signal. Our current focus is on breast cancer as a proof of concept, and we chose that because it is one of the hardest cancers to detect from blood — there are a lot of technical challenges. Lots of people have tried and failed.\n\nAnother reason is the physical and mental toll that the disease takes on people. People with breast cancer must make some drastic decisions about their own body to be as sure as possible that they are having their cancer treated properly. I thought this heartbreaking situation could be solved by earlier detection.\n\nIn October, Wobble came out of ‘stealth mode’. Tell us about that.\n\nGrowing up in California, I had friends creating start-up companies in Silicon Valley and became familiar with the concept.\n\nTechnology companies operate in stealth mode initially to protect themselves from scrutiny – from legal challenges and negative attention from competitors. If you come out into the open with your proof of concept and results too soon, it can draw the attention of larger companies. These can compete with more resources, copy your idea or add it to their own technology, challenge the intellectual property or even acquire your company prematurely. Usually, you come out of stealth mode when you have enough protection to address challenges, and have things to share.\n\nMy path to heading a biotech company\n\nI don’t know if you ever know for sure when is the right time to move out of stealth mode, but for Wobble we had found that our clinical study results were demonstrating exciting potential. Plus, our patent applications were reaching a more mature stage, with some patents granted and others close to being granted.\n\nWe knew that we wanted to share our news to reach more people with our ideas, and to make it easier to find researchers and other companies with which to collaborate and explore the technology. We also wanted people to be able to come to us with questions that would help us to understand what people were wanting and how we could help.\n\nComing out of stealth also made it easier to recruit. It had been difficult getting attention from potential employees when we couldn’t tell them much about what we were doing, so we’d had to ask for non-disclosure agreements during the interview process.\n\nSo how did you emerge from stealth?\n\nWe have been running a prospective clinical study for people with and without breast cancer using our liquid biopsy test. The trial is being led by Mike Dixon, a breast cancer specialist and surgeon at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. The initial results — an estimated accuracy of 80% sensitivity at 95% specificity — encouraged us to open up to the world. This level of accuracy has not been seen before using blood- and sequencing-based methodology.\n\nMedia outlets had approached us previously and we’d had to ask them to wait until we came out of stealth mode. So, in preparation, we’d engaged a public-relations firm and developed a press release ahead of our debut at the Early Detection of Cancer Conference in San Francisco, California, in October last year. There, we presented a poster on the study, which was covered by several news outlets.\n\nHow has the Theranos saga affected how you work?",

However, our understanding of the genetic structure of SES remains incomplete. Here, we conducted a large-scale exome study of SES markers (household income, occupational status, educational attainment, and social deprivation) in 350,770 individuals. For rare coding variants, we identified 56 significant associations by gene-based collapsing tests, unveiling 7 additional SES-associated genes ( NRN1 , CCDC36 , RHOB , EP400 , NCAM1, TPTEP2-CSNK1E , and LINC02881 ). Exome-wide single common variant analysis revealed nine lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with household income and 34 lead SNPs associated with EduYears, replicating previous GWAS findings. The gene–environment correlations had a substantial impact on the genetic associations with SES, as indicated by the significantly increased P values in several associations after controlling for geographic regions. Furthermore, we observed the pleiotropic effects of SES-associated genetic factors on a wide range of health outcomes, such as cognitive function, psychosocial status, and diabetes. This study highlights the contribution of coding variants to SES and their associations with health phenotypes.",

          "abstract": "Many climate policies adopt improving equity as a key objective. A key challenge is that policies often conceive of equity in terms of individuals but introduce strategies that focus on spatially coarse administrative areas. For example, the Justice40 Initiative in the United States requires 518 diverse federal programs to prioritize funds for “disadvantaged” census tracts. This strategy is largely untested and contrasts with the federal government’s definition of equity as the “consistent and systematic fair, just and impartial treatment of all individuals (Executive Office of the President, Federal Register, 2021).” How well does the Justice40 approach improve equity in climate adaptation outcomes across individuals ? We analyze this question using a case study of a municipality that faces repetitive flooding and struggles to effectively manage these risks due to limited resources and public investment. We find that the way the Federal Emergency Management Agency implements the Justice40 Initiative can be an obstacle to promoting equity in household flood-risk outcomes. For example, in this case study, ensuring the majority of benefits accrue in “Justice40 Communities” does not reduce risk for the most burdened households, does not reduce risk-burden inequality, and produces net costs. In contrast, we design simple funding rules based on household risk burden that cost-effectively target the most burdened households, reduce risk-burden inequality, and accrue large net benefits. Our findings suggest that “disadvantaged community” indicators defined at coarse spatial scales face the risk of poorly capturing many climate risks and can be ineffective for meeting equity promises about climate-related investments.",

          "abstract": "Despite the broad catalytic relevance of metal–support interfaces, controlling their chemical nature, the interfacial contact perimeter (exposed to reactants), and consequently, their contributions to overall catalytic reactivity, remains challenging, as the nanoparticle and support characteristics are interdependent when catalysts are prepared by impregnation. Here, we decoupled both characteristics by using a raspberry-colloid-templating strategy that yields partially embedded PdAu nanoparticles within well-defined SiO 2 or TiO 2 supports, thereby increasing the metal–support interfacial contact compared to nonembedded catalysts that we prepared by attaching the same nanoparticles onto support surfaces. Between nonembedded PdAu/SiO 2 and PdAu/TiO 2 , we identified a support effect resulting in a 1.4-fold higher activity of PdAu/TiO 2 than PdAu/SiO 2 for benzaldehyde hydrogenation. Notably, partial nanoparticle embedding in the TiO 2 raspberry-colloid-templated support increased the metal–support interfacial perimeter and consequently, the number of Au/TiO 2 interfacial sites by 5.4-fold, which further enhanced the activity of PdAu/TiO 2 by an additional 4.1-fold. Theoretical calculations and in situ surface-sensitive desorption analyses reveal facile benzaldehyde binding at the Au/TiO 2 interface and at Pd ensembles on the nanoparticle surface, explaining the connection between the number of Au/TiO 2 interfacial sites (via the metal–support interfacial perimeter) and catalytic activity. Our results demonstrate partial nanoparticle embedding as a synthetic strategy to produce thermocatalytically stable catalysts and increase the number of catalytically active Au/TiO 2 interfacial sites to augment catalytic contributions arising from metal–support interfaces.",

The LEMIS provides the most comprehensive publicly accessible wildlife trade database of non-the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) listed species. In total, 21,097 species and over 2.85 billion individuals were traded over the past 22 y (2000-2022). When LEMIS data are combined with CITES records, the United States imported over 29,445 wild species, including over 50% of all globally described species in some taxonomic groups. For most taxa, around half of the individuals are declared as sourced from the wild. Although the LEMIS provides the only means to assess trade volumes for many taxa, without any associated data on most wild populations, it is impossible to assess the impact on biodiversity, sustainability of trade, or any potential risk of pest or pathogen spread.

In this work, we develop a molecular-transport model that depicts the genomic exploration of DNA methyltransferase within a multiscale DNA environment, incorporating biologically relevant factors like methylation rate and CpG density to predict how patterns are established. Our model predicts DNA methylation-state correlation distributions arising from the transport and kinetic properties that are crucial for the establishment of unique methylation profiles. We model the methylation correlation distributions of nine cancerous human cell types to determine how these properties affect the epigenetic profile. Our theory is capable of recapitulating experimental methylation patterns, suggesting the importance of DNA methyltransferase transport in epigenetic regulation. Through this work, we propose a mechanistic description for the establishment of methylation profiles, capturing the key behavioral characteristics of methyltransferase that lead to aberrant methylation.",

          "abstract": "Chemotaxis enables marine bacteria to increase encounters with phytoplankton cells by reducing their search times, provided that bacteria detect noisy chemical gradients around phytoplankton. Gradient detection depends on bacterial phenotypes and phytoplankton size: large phytoplankton produce spatially extended but shallow gradients, whereas small phytoplankton produce steeper but spatially more confined gradients. To date, it has remained unclear how phytoplankton size and bacterial swimming speed affect bacteria’s gradient detection ability and search times for phytoplankton. Here, we compute an upper bound on the increase in bacterial encounter rate with phytoplankton due to chemotaxis over random motility alone. We find that chemotaxis can substantially decrease search times for small phytoplankton, but this advantage is highly sensitive to variations in bacterial phenotypes or phytoplankton leakage rates. By contrast, chemotaxis toward large phytoplankton cells reduces the search time more modestly, but this benefit is more robust to variations in search or environmental parameters. Applying our findings to marine phytoplankton communities, we find that, in productive waters, chemotaxis toward phytoplankton smaller than 2 μm provides little to no benefit, but can decrease average search times for large phytoplankton (∼20 μm) from 2 wk to 2 d, an advantage that is robust to variations and favors bacteria with higher swimming speeds. By contrast, in oligotrophic waters, chemotaxis can reduce search times for picophytoplankton (∼1 μm) up to 10-fold, from a week to half a day, but only for bacteria with low swimming speeds and long sensory timescales. This asymmetry may promote the coexistence of diverse search phenotypes in marine bacterial populations.",

          "abstract": "Sialic acids derived from colonic mucin glycans are crucial nutrients for enteric bacterial pathogens like Salmonella . The uptake and utilization of sialic acid in Salmonella depend on coordinated regulons, each activated by specific metabolites at the transcriptional level. However, the mechanisms enabling crosstalk among these regulatory circuits to synchronize gene expression remain poorly understood. Here, we identify ManS, a small noncoding RNA derived from the 3’ UTR of STM1128 mRNA transcribed from a Salmonella enterica –specific genetic locus, as an important posttranscriptional regulator coordinating sialic acid metabolism regulons. ManS is primarily processed by RNase III and, along with its parental transcripts, is specifically activated by N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), the initial degradation product of sialic acid. We found that the imperfect stem-loop structure at the 5’ end of ManS allows RNase III to cleave in a noncanonical manner, generating two functional types of ManS with the assistance of RNase E and other RNases: short isoforms with a single seed region that regulate the uptake of N-acetylglucosamine, an essential intermediate in sialic acid metabolism; and long isoforms with an additional seed region that regulate multiple genes involved in central and secondary metabolism. This sophisticated regulation by ManS significantly impacts ManNAc metabolism and S. enterica ’s competitive behavior during infection. Our findings highlight the role of sRNA in coordinating transcriptional circuits and advance our understanding of RNase III-mediated processing of 3’ UTR-derived sRNAs, underscoring the important role of ManNAc in Salmonella adaptation within host environments.",

Antigen proofreading is mediated by transient interactions formed between the nascent peptide binding groove with the P2/P3 peptide anchors, where conserved MHC-I residues stabilize incoming peptides through backbone-focused contacts.

          "abstract": "From RNA interference to chromatin silencing, diverse genome defense pathways silence selfish genetic elements to safeguard genome integrity. Despite their diversity, different defense pathways share a modular organization, where numerous specificity factors identify diverse targets and common effectors silence them. In the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, target RNAs are first identified by complementary base pairing with piRNAs and then silenced by PIWI-clade nucleases. Such a binary architecture allows the defense systems to be readily adaptable, where new targets can be captured via innovation of specificity factors. Thus, our current understanding of genome defense against lineage-specific selfish genes has been largely limited to specificity factor innovations, while it remains poorly understood whether other types of innovations are required. Here, we describe a new type of innovation, which escalates the genome defense capacity to control a recently expanded selfish gene in Drosophila melanogaster . Through a targeted RNAi screen for repressors of Stellate —a recently evolved meiotic driver—we identified a defense factor, Trailblazer. Trailblazer is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of two PIWI-clade nucleases, Aub and AGO3, to match Stellate in abundance. Recent innovation in the DNA-binding domain of Trailblazer enabled it to elevate Aub and AGO3 expression, thereby escalating the silencing capacity of piRNA pathway to tame expanded Stellate and safeguard fertility. As copy-number expansion is a recurrent feature of diverse selfish genes across the tree of life, we envision that augmenting the defense capacity to quantitatively match selfish genes is a repeatedly employed defense strategy in evolution.",

          "abstract": "How newly formed memories are preserved while brain plasticity is ongoing has been a source of debate. One idea is that synapses which experienced recent plasticity become resistant to further plasticity, a type of metaplasticity often referred to as saturation. Here, we probe the local dendritic mechanisms that limit plasticity at recently potentiated synapses. We show that recently potentiated individual synapses exhibit a synapse-specific refractory period for further potentiation. We further found that the refractory period is associated with reduced postsynaptic CaMKII signaling; however, stronger synaptic activation fully restored CaMKII signaling but only partially restored the ability for further plasticity. Importantly, the refractory period is released after one hour, a timing that coincides with the enrichment of several postsynaptic proteins to preplasticity levels. Notably, increasing the level of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein, PSD95, but not of PSD93, overcomes the refractory period. Our results support a model in which potentiation at a single synapse is sufficient to initiate a synapse-specific refractory period that persists until key postsynaptic proteins regain their steady-state synaptic levels.",

The dynamics of this remote and difficult to observe region are poorly understood, particularly at turbulent length scales. Existing observational estimates of turbulence frequency and strength vary widely. Furthermore, the sources of turbulence and the relationship between turbulence and the mean flow are largely unknown. We assembled a 21-y database of high vertical resolution (10 m) radiosonde data from four equatorial sites in two ocean basins to study tropical stratospheric turbulence frequency, variability, and sources. Turbulent layers thicker than 200 m are identified using subcritical Richardson number as a proxy for turbulence. We show that the turbulent fraction of the tropical stratosphere is strongly modulated by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Turbulence is enhanced during the QBO phase shifts, and the atmosphere is most turbulent right before the QBO phase switches from negative to positive, where turbulent instabilities typically occur within specific phases of Kelvin waves. Turbulence is less common when the QBO phase is well established, and the atmosphere is least turbulent during the negative phase of the QBO. The turbulent fraction of the equatorial lower stratosphere varies over a factor of ten depending on QBO phase. This relationship provides a robust observational constraint on the multiscale dynamics within this region, which is useful for evaluating atmospheric models, studying wave-mean flow interactions in the context of the QBO, and informing the operation of stratospheric aircraft and the injection of aerosol for geoengineering.",

          "abstract": "Female mosquitoes require a vertebrate blood meal to activate reproduction, transmitting numerous devastating human diseases. Vitellogenesis is a central event of female reproduction that involves the massive production of vitellogenin (Vg) in the fat body and the maturation of ovaries. This process is controlled by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E); however, its molecular regulatory basis remains not completely understood. We found that the expression of Aedes aegypti muscle aponeurosis fibromatosis B ( AaMafB ), coding for a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, was significantly up-regulated after a blood meal. The 20E-bound ecdysone receptor–ultraspiracle heterodimer directly targeted the ecdysone response element in the promoter of AaMafB , activating its transcription. Coimmunoprecipitation assays illustrated the interaction between Aa MafB and Cap “n” collar C ( Aa CncC), another bZIP transcription factor. RNA interference–mediated depletion of Aa MafB or Aa CncC led to impaired ovarian growth, decreased expression of AaVg and Halloween genes, and reduced 20E levels. The Aa MafB– Aa CncC heterodimer directly activated the transcription of AaVg and AaShade by targeting the antioxidant response element in their promoters. Together, our results indicate that AaMafB functions as an early 20E response gene, the product of which heterodimerizes with Aa CncC to maintain high 20E levels and facilitates activation of AaVg in mosquitoes after a blood meal.",

However, the sluggish ion transport and environmental concerns of high fluorination degree drive the need to develop less fluorinated structures. Here, we depart from the traditional ether backbone and introduce bis(2-fluoroethoxy)methane (F2DEM), featuring monofluorination of the acetal backbone. High coulombic efficiency and stable long-term cycling in Li||Cu half cells can be achieved with F2DEM even under fast Li metal plating conditions. The performance of F2DEM is further compared with diethoxymethane (DEM) and 2-[2-(2,2-difluoroethoxy)ethoxy]-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (F5DEE). A significantly lower overpotential is observed with F2DEM, which improves energy efficiency and enables its application in high-rate conditions. Comparative studies of F2DEM with DEM and F5DEE in anode-free lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4 ) LFP pouch cells and high-loading LFP coin cells further show improved capacity retention of F2DEM electrolyte, demonstrating its practical applicability. More importantly, we also extensively investigate the underlying mechanism for the superior performance of F2DEM through various techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, cryogenic electron microscopy, focused ion beam, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and titration gas chromatography. Overall, F2DEM facilitates improved Li deposition morphology with reduced amount of dead Li. This enables F2DEM to show superior performance, especially under higher charging and slower discharging rate conditions.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the role of metabolic processes during inner ear development is essential for identifying targets for hair cell (HC) regeneration, as metabolic choices play a crucial role in cell proliferation and differentiation. Among the metabolic processes, growing evidence shows that glucose metabolism is closely related to organ development. However, the role of glucose metabolism in mammalian inner ear development and HC regeneration remains unclear. In this study, we found that glycolytic metabolism is highly active during mouse and human cochlear prosensory epithelium expansion. Using mouse cochlear organoids, we revealed that glycolytic activity in cochlear nonsensory epithelial cells was predominantly dominated by pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Deletion of PKM2 induced a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, impairing cochlear organoid formation. Furthermore, conditional loss of PKM2 in cochlear progenitors hindered sensory epithelium morphogenesis, as demonstrated in PKM2 knockout mice. Mechanistically, pyruvate is generated by PKM2 catalysis and then converted into lactate, which then lactylates histone H3, regulating the transcription of key genes for cochlear development. Specifically, accumulated lactate causes histone H3 lactylation at lysine 9 (H3K9la), upregulating the expression of Sox family transcription factors through epigenetic modification. Moreover, overexpression of PKM2 in supporting cells (SCs) triggered metabolism reprogramming and enhanced HC generation in cultured mouse and human cochlear explants. Our findings uncover a molecular mechanism of sensory epithelium formation driven by glycolysis-lactate flow and suggest unique approaches for mammalian HC regeneration.",

While the internal pallidum serves as the primary target, recently, stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been investigated. However, optimal targeting within this structure and its surroundings have not been studied in depth. Indeed, historical targets that have been used for surgical treatment of dystonia are directly adjacent to the STN. Further, multiple types of dystonia exist, and outcomes are variable, suggesting that not all types would profit maximally from the same target. Therefore, a thorough investigation of neural substrates underlying stimulation effects on dystonia signs and symptoms is warranted. Here, we analyze a multicenter cohort of isolated dystonia patients with subthalamic implantations ( N = 58) and relate their stimulation sites to improvements of appendicular and cervical symptoms as well as blepharospasm. Stimulation of the ventral oral posterior nucleus of thalamus and surrounding regions were associated with improvements in cervical dystonia, while stimulation of the dorsolateral STN was associated with improvements in limb dystonia and blepharospasm. This dissociation was matched by structural connectivity analysis, where the cerebellothalamic, corticospinal, and pallidosubthalamic tracts were associated with improvements of cervical dystonia, while hyperdirect and subthalamopallidal pathways with alleviation of limb dystonia and blepharospasm. On the level of functional networks, improvements of limb dystonia were associated with connectivity to the corresponding somatotopic regions in the primary motor cortex, while alleviation of cervical dystonia to the cingulo-opercular network. These findings shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia and may guide DBS targeting and programming in the future.",

Understanding these complex mesoscopic systems requires probing the microscopic trajectories associated with irreversible processes, the role of fluctuations and entropy growth, and the timescales on which nonequilibrium responses are ultimately maintained. Approaches that illuminate these processes in model systems may enable a more general understanding of other heterogeneous nonequilibrium phenomena, and potentially define ultimate speed and energy cost limits for information processing technologies. Here, we apply ultrafast single-shot X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to resolve the nonequilibrium, heterogeneous, and irreversible mesoscale dynamics during a light-induced phase transition in a (PbTiO 3 ) 16 /(SrTiO 3 ) 16 superlattice. Such ferroelectric superlattice systems are a useful platform to study phase transitions and topological dynamics due to their high degree of tunability. This provides an approach for capturing the nucleation of the light-induced phase, the formation of transient mesoscale defects at the boundaries of the nuclei, and the eventual annihilation of these defects, even in systems with complex polarization topologies. We identify a nonequilibrium correlation response spanning &gt;10 orders of magnitude in timescales, with multistep behavior similar to the plateaus observed in supercooled liquids and glasses. We further show how the observed time-dependent long-time correlations can be understood in terms of stochastic and non-Markovian dynamics of domain walls, encoded in waiting-time distributions with power-law tails.

Activation of BK channels is subunit specific, as paxilline but not iberiotoxin blocked mGluR-LTD. Also, 12(S)HPETE does not change the electrophysiological properties of the BK channel when the BKα subunit is expressed alone but increases the channel open probability when the BKα is coexpressed with the β4-subunit.

          "abstract": "To achieve replicative immortality, cancer cells must activate telomere maintenance mechanisms. In 10 to 15% of cancers, this is enabled by recombination-based alternative lengthening of telomeres pathways (ALT). ALT cells display several hallmarks including heterogeneous telomere length, extrachromosomal telomeric repeats, and ALT-associated PML bodies. ALT cells also have high telomeric replication stress (RS) enhanced by fork-stalling structures (R-loops and G4s) and altered chromatin states. In ALT cells, telomeric RS promotes telomere elongation but above a certain threshold becomes detrimental to cell survival. Manipulating RS at telomeres has thus been proposed as a therapeutic strategy against ALT cancers. Through analysis of genome-wide CRISPR fitness screens, we identified ALT-specific vulnerabilities and describe here our characterization of the roles of SUB1, a ssDNA-binding protein, in telomere stability. SUB1 depletion increases RS at ALT telomeres, profoundly impairing ALT cell growth without impacting telomerase-positive cells. During RS, SUB1 is recruited to stalled forks and ALT telomeres via its ssDNA-binding domain. This recruitment is potentiated by RPA depletion, suggesting that these factors may compete for ssDNA. The viability of ALT cells and their resilience toward RS also requires ssDNA binding by SUB1. SUB1 depletion accelerates cell death induced by FANCM depletion, triggering unsustainable levels of telomeric damage in ALT cells. Finally, combining SUB1 depletion with RS-inducing drugs rapidly induces replication catastrophe in ALT cells. Altogether, our work identifies SUB1 as an ALT susceptibility with roles in the mitigation of RS at ALT telomeres and suggests advanced therapeutic strategies for a host of still poorly managed cancers.",

          "abstract": "Sleep spindles are cortical electrical oscillations considered critical for memory consolidation and sleep stability. The timing and pattern of sleep spindles are likely to be important in driving synaptic plasticity during sleep as well as preventing disruption of sleep by sensory and internal stimuli. However, the relative importance of factors such as sleep depth, cortical up/down-state, and temporal clustering in governing sleep spindle dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze sleep data from 1,025 participants, statistically modeling the simultaneous influences of multiple factors on moment-to-moment spindle production using a point process-generalized linear model framework. Results reveal fingerprint-like timing patterns, characterized by a refractory period followed by a period of increased spindle activity, which are highly individualized yet consistent night-to-night, with increased variability with age. Strikingly, short-term (&lt;15 s) temporal patterns of past spindle history are the main determinant of spindle timing, accounting for over 70% of the statistical deviance—surpassing the contribution of factors such as cortical up/down-state (slow oscillation phase), sleep depth, and long-term history (15 to 90 s, including ~50 s infraslow activity). Short-term history has a statistically significant influence in over 98% of the population, suggesting it is a near-universal feature of spindle activity. Short-term history and slow oscillation phase exert independent effects on spindle timing. Our results establish a robust statistical framework to examine abnormalities in sleep spindle timing observed in neurological disorders and aging, as well as the relationship between individualized sleep spindle timing, cognition, and sleep stability.",

Notably, anti-CTLA-4 preserves more T cell factor-1 (TCF-1)+ T cells during priming, while anti-PD-1 leads to more thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box (TOX)+ T cells.

Exophers are large, micron-scale vesicles that are ejected from the cell and contain cellular components such as mitochondria. EGL-1 facilitates exopher production potentially through regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Moreover, an endogenous, low level of EGL-1 expression appears to benefit dendritic health.

          "abstract": "The strength−ductility trade-off exists ubiquitously, especially in brittle intermetallic-containing multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs), where the intermetallic phases often induce premature failure leading to severe ductility reduction. Hierarchical heterogeneities represent a promising microstructural solution to achieve simultaneous strength−ductility enhancement. However, it remains fundamentally challenging to tailor hierarchical heterostructures using conventional methods, which often rely on costly and time-consuming processing. Here, we report a multiscale microstructural inheritance and refinement strategy to process “structural hierarchy precursors” in as-cast heterogeneous Al 0.7 CoCrFeNi MPEAs, which lead directly to a hierarchical hetero-lamellar structure (HLS) after simple rolling and annealing. Interestingly, it takes only 10 min of annealing time, two orders of magnitude less than that required to render the state-of-the-art properties during conventional processing of Al 0.7 CoCrFeNi, for us to achieve record-high strength−ductility combinations via the hierarchical HLS design that sequentially stimulates multiple unusual deformation and reinforcement mechanisms. In particular, the HLS-enabled high hetero-deformation-induced (HDI) internal stress triggers profuse &lt;111&gt;-type dislocations on over five independent slip systems in the supposedly brittle intermetallic phase and activates extensive stacking faults (SFs) and nanotwinning in the adjoining soft phase with a rather high SF energy. These unexpected, dynamically reinforcing hetero-deformation mechanisms across multiple length scales facilitate high sustained HDI strain hardening, along with a salient microcrack-mediated extrinsic ductilization effect, suggesting that the proposed microstructural inheritance and refinement strategy provides an efficient, fast, and low-cost approach to overcome the strength−ductility trade-off in a broad range of structural materials.",

Drawing inspiration from Nature, neuromorphic perception systems hold tremendous potential for efficient multisensory signal processing in the physical world; however, the development of an efficient artificial neuron with a widely calibratable spiking range and reduced footprint remains challenging. Here, we report an efficient organic electrochemical neuron (OECN) with reduced footprint (&lt;37 mm 2 ) based on high-performance vertical OECT (vOECT) complementary circuitry enabled by an advanced n-type polymer for balanced p-/n-type vOECT performance. The OECN exhibits outstanding neuronal characteristics, capable of producing spikes with a widely calibratable state-of-the art firing frequency range of 0.130 to 147.1 Hz. Leveraging this capability, we develop a neuromorphic perception system that integrates mechanical sensors with the OECN and integrates them with an artificial synapse for tactile perception. The system successfully encodes tactile stimulations into frequency-dependent spikes, which are further converted into postsynaptic responses.

Bacteria can evolve de novo resistance against T6SS attacks, but resistance is far from universal in natural communities, suggesting key features of T6SS weaponry may act to limit its evolution. Here, we combine ecoevolutionary modeling and experimental evolution to examine how toxin type and multiplicity in Acinetobacter baylyi attackers shape resistance evolution in susceptible Escherichia coli competitors. In both our models and experiments, we find that combinations of multiple distinct toxins limit resistance evolution by creating genetic bottlenecks, driving resistant lineages extinct before they can reach high frequency. We also show that, paradoxically, single-toxin attackers can drive the evolution of cross-resistance, protecting bacteria against unfamiliar toxin combinations, even though such evolutionary pathways were inaccessible against multitoxin attackers. Our findings indicate that, comparable to antimicrobial and anticancer combination therapies, multitoxin T6SS arsenals function to limit resistance evolution in competing microbes. This helps us to understand why T6SSs remain widespread and effective weapons in microbial communities, and why many T6SS-armed bacteria encode functionally diverse anticompetitor toxins.",

          "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that intratumor bacteria exist as an active and specific tumor component in many tumor types beyond digestive and respiratory tumors. However, the biological impact and responsible molecules of such local bacteria–tumor direct interaction on cancer therapeutic response remain poorly understood. Trastuzumab is among the most commonly used drugs targeting the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (ErbB2) in breast cancer, but its resistance is inevitable, severely limiting its clinical effectiveness. Here, we demonstrate that the quorum-sensing signaling molecule N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl) homoserine lactone (3oc), a chemical compound released by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ), one tumor-resident bacteria with a relative high abundance in breast cancer, promotes breast cancer cell resistance to trastuzumab. Mechanically, 3oc directly leads to spontaneous dimerization of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) type II serine/threonine kinase receptor on the cell membrane in a ligand-independent manner. The 3oc-induced TGF-β signaling subsequently triggers ErbB2 phosphorylation and its downstream target activation, overcoming the inhibition effect of trastuzumab on ErbB2. With specific real-time qPCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging, and liquid chromatography ionization tandem mass spectrometry analyses of clinical samples, we confirmed that P. aeruginosa and its signaling molecule 3oc exist in breast cancer tissues and there is a clinical correlation between P. aeruginosa colonization and trastuzumab resistance. This work expands the biological functions of intratumor bacteria in cancer treatment responsiveness and provides a unique perspective for overcoming trastuzumab resistance.",

          "abstract": "Ataxia–telangiectasia (A-T) is a pleiotropic genome instability syndrome resulting from the loss of the homeostatic protein kinase ATM. The complex phenotype of A-T includes progressive cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, gonadal atrophy, interstitial lung disease, cancer predisposition, endocrine abnormalities, chromosomal instability, radiosensitivity, and segmental premature aging. Cultured skin fibroblasts from A-T patients exhibit premature senescence, highlighting the association between genome instability, cellular senescence, and aging. We found that lung fibroblasts derived from ATM-deficient mice provide a versatile experimental system to explore the mechanisms driving the premature senescence of primary fibroblasts lacking ATM. Atm −/− fibroblasts failed to proliferate under ambient oxygen conditions (21%). Although they initially proliferated under physiological oxygen levels (3%), they rapidly entered senescence. In contrast, wild-type (WT) lung fibroblasts did not senesce under 3% oxygen and eventually underwent immortalization and neoplastic transformation. However, rapid senescence could be induced in WT cells either by Atm gene ablation or persistent chemical inhibition of ATM kinase activity, with senescence induced by ATM inhibition being reversible upon inhibitor removal. Moreover, the concomitant loss of ATM and p53 led to senescence evasion, vigorous growth, rampant genome instability, and subsequent immortalization and transformation. Our findings reveal that the rapid senescence of Atm −/− lung fibroblasts is driven by the collaborative action of the cGAS–STING, p38 MAPK, and p53 pathways in response to persistent DNA damage, ultimately leading to the induction of interferon-α1 and downstream interferon-stimulated genes. We propose that accelerated cellular senescence may exacerbate specific A-T symptoms, particularly contributing to the progressive, life-threatening interstitial lung disease often observed in A-T patients during adulthood.",

We found pervasive evidence of heritable genetic variation in mosquito heat tolerance, and phenotypic trade-offs in tolerance to prolonged versus acute heat exposure. Further, we found genomic variation associated with prolonged heat tolerance was clustered in several regions of the genome, suggesting the presence of larger structural variants such as chromosomal inversions.

The initiating sources of DNA damage which lead to inaccurate repair of the repeat tract to cause expansions are not fully understood. Expansion-prone CAG/CTG repeats are actively transcribed and prone to forming stable R-loops with hairpin structures forming on the displaced single-stranded DNA (S-loops). We previously determined that damage by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytosine deaminase, Fcy1, was required for both fragility and instability of CAG/CTG tracts engaged in R-loops. To determine whether this mechanism is more universal, we expressed human cytidine deaminases APOBEC3A (A3A), APOBEC3B (A3B), or activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in our yeast system. We show that mutagenic activity of Apolipoprotein B messenger RNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptides causes CAG/CTG fragility and instability, with A3A having the greatest effect followed by A3B and least from AID. A3A-induced repeat fragility was exacerbated by enrichment of R-loops at the repeat site. A3A and A3B-induced instability was dependent on the MutLγ nuclease and to a lesser extent, base excision repair factors. Deaminase activity assays on hairpin substrates containing CTG and GTC triplet sequences revealed that A3A prefers cytidines within the hairpin loop, and bulges in the hairpin stem alter preferred locations. Analysis of RNA expression levels in human cortex samples revealed that A3A is expressed in brain tissue that exhibits CAG/CTG repeat expansions and its expression is elevated in Huntington’s disease (HD) patient samples. These results implicate cytidine deamination by A3A as a potential source of repeat expansions in HD and other CAG/CTG repeat expansion disorders.",

However, the effects of increasing pesticide diversity on soil microbial functions remain unclear, particularly under varying nitrogen (N) fertilizer management practices. In this study, we investigated the stochasticity of soil microbes and multitrophic networks through amplicon sequencing, assessed soil community functions related to carbon (C), N, phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) cycling, and characterized the dominant bacterial life history strategies via metagenomics along a gradient of increasing pesticide diversity under two N addition levels. Our findings show that higher pesticide diversity enriches the abundance of bacterial specialists and opportunists capable of degrading or resisting pesticides, reducing the proportion of bacterial generalists in the absence of N addition. These shifts can complicate multitrophic microbial networks. Under increased pesticide diversity, selective pressure may drive bacteria to streamline their average genome size to conserve energy while enhancing C, N, P, and S metabolic capacities, thus accelerating soil nutrient loss. In comparison, N addition was found to reduce bacterial niche differentiation at higher pesticide diversity, mitigating the impacts of network complexity and functional traits associated with pesticide diversity, ultimately alleviating soil nutrient loss. Our results reveal the contrasting impacts of pesticide diversity on microbial functions under different N input scenarios and emphasize that strategic N fertilizer management can mitigate the ecological effects of pesticide use in agricultural systems.",

This essential protein is a Na + pump responsible for the maintenance of Na + homeostasis. Pf ATP4 belongs to the type two-dimensional (2D) subfamily of P-type ATPases, for which no structures have been determined. To gain better insight into the structure/function relationship of this validated drug target, we generated a homology model of Pf ATP4 based on sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase, a P2A-type ATPase, and refined the model using molecular dynamics in its explicit membrane environment. This model predicted several residues in Pf ATP4 critical for its function, as well as those that impart resistance to various Pf ATP4 inhibitors. To validate our model, we developed a genetic system involving merodiploid states of Pf ATP4 in which the endogenous gene was conditionally expressed, and the second allele was mutated to assess its effect on the parasite. Our model predicted residues involved in Na + coordination as well as the phosphorylation cycle of Pf ATP4. Phenotypic characterization of these mutants involved assessment of parasite growth, localization of mutated Pf ATP4, response to treatment with known Pf ATP4 inhibitors, and evaluation of the downstream consequences of Na + influx. Our results were consistent with modeled predictions of the essentiality of the critical residues. Additionally, our approach confirmed the phenotypic consequences of resistance-associated mutations as well as a potential structural basis for the fitness cost associated with some mutations. Taken together, our approach provides a means to explore the structure/function relationship of essential genes in haploid organisms.",

By characterizing a multipeaked fitness landscape of a SARS-CoV-2 antibody mutant library, we show that heterogeneous ruggedness arises from sparse epistatic hotspots, whose mutation impacts the fitness effect of numerous sequence sites. Surprisingly, mutating an epistatic hotspot may enhance, rather than reduce, the accessibility of the fittest genotype, while increasing the overall ruggedness. Further, migratory constraints in real space alleviate mutational constraints in sequence space, which not only diversify direct paths taken but may also turn a road-blocking fitness peak into a stepping stone leading toward the global optimum. Our results suggest that a hierarchy of epistatic hotspots may organize the fitness landscape in such a way that path-orienting ruggedness confers global smoothness.",

Using a Langmuir analysis of measurements at multiple concentrations, we extract the Gibbs free energy of adsorption, finding it larger than typical thermal energies. Molecular simulations clarify the role of polarizability in tuning the thermodynamics of adsorption, and establish the preferential parallel alignment of guanidinium at the air–water interface. As a polyatomic cation, guanidinium represents one of the few examples of a positively charged species to exhibit a propensity for the air-water interface.

          "authors": "Daniel J. M. Crouch",
          "abstract": "A P value is conventionally interpreted either as a) the probability by chance of obtaining more extreme results than those observed or b) a tool for declaring significance at a prespecified level. Both approaches carry difficulties: b) does not allow users to make inferences based on the data in hand, and is not rigorously followed by researchers in practice, while (a) is not meaningful as an error rate. Although P values retain an important role, these shortcomings are likely to have contributed significantly to the scientific reproducibility crisis. We introduce the concept of defining long-run frequentist error rates given the observed data, allowing researchers to make accurate and intuitive inferences about the probability of making an error after proposing that the null hypothesis is false. As one approach, we define the false evidence rate (FER) as the probability, under the null hypothesis, of observing a hypothetical future P value providing evidence toward the alternative hypothesis suggested by the observed P value, which we define as a false positive. FERs are much more conservative than their corresponding P values, consistent with studies demonstrating that the latter do not effectively control error rates across the scientific literature. To obtain an FER below 5%, one needs to obtain a P value below approximately 5 × 10 − 5 , while a P value of 5% corresponds to an FER of about 25%.",

Yet, we know surprisingly little about this process, especially for endangered species, such as nonhuman great apes. Chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, are particularly notable because they inhabit diverse habitats, from rainforest to woodland-savannah. Whether genetic adaptation facilitates such habitat diversity remains unknown, despite it having wide implications for evolutionary biology and conservation. By using newly sequenced exomes from 828 wild chimpanzees (388 postfiltering), we found evidence of fine-scale genetic adaptation to habitat, with signatures of positive selection in forest chimpanzees in the same genes underlying adaptation to malaria in humans. This work demonstrates the power of noninvasive samples to reveal genetic adaptations in endangered populations and highlights the importance of adaptive genetic diversity for chimpanzees.",

          "abstract": "Accurately modeling the deformation of temperate glacier ice, which is at its pressure-melting temperature and contains liquid water at grain boundaries, is essential for predicting ice sheet discharge to the ocean and associated sea-level rise. Central to such modeling is Glen’s flow law, in which strain rate depends on stress raised to a power of n = 3 to 4. In sharp contrast to this nonlinearity, we found by conducting large-scale, shear-deformation experiments that temperate ice is linear-viscous ( n ≈ 1.0) over common ranges of liquid water content and stress expected near glacier beds and in ice-stream margins. This linearity is likely caused by diffusive pressure melting and refreezing at grain boundaries and could help to stabilize modeled responses of ice sheets to shrinkage-induced stress increases.",

In this study, we investigated the adaptation of two species of woodrats ( Neotoma lepida and N. bryanti ) to creosote bush ( Larrea tridentata ), a toxic shrub that expanded across the southwestern United States after the Last Glacial Maximum. We found that creosote-adapted woodrats have elevated gene dosage across multiple biotransformation enzyme families. These duplication events occurred independently across species and substantially increase expression of biotransformation genes, especially within the glucuronidation pathway. We propose that increased gene dosage resulting from duplication is an important mechanism by which animals initially adapt to novel environmental pressures.",

This is especially so in Australia, which lost 90% of its large species by 40,000 years ago, more than half of them kangaroos. Determining causation has been obstructed by a poor understanding of their ecology. Using dental microwear texture analysis, we show that most members of Australia’s richest Pleistocene kangaroo assemblage had diets that were much more generalized than their craniodental anatomy implies. Mixed feeding across most kangaroos pinpoints dietary breadth as a key behavioral adaptation to climate-driven fluctuations in vegetation structure, dispelling the likelihood that late Pleistocene climatic variation was a primary driver of their disappearance.",

Combining TDI-DNA-PAINT and LLS microscopy on immunological B cells revealed the oligomeric states and interaction of endogenous CD20 with the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab.

Inhibiting conjugated BA synthesis in hepatocytes through deletion of the BA-conjugating enzyme bile acid–CoA:amino acid N -acyltransferase (BAAT) enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses, reduced tumor growth, and sensitized tumors to anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti–PD-1) immunotherapy. Furthermore, different BAs regulated CD8 + T cells differently; primary BAs induced oxidative stress, whereas the secondary BA lithocholic acid inhibited T cell function through endoplasmic reticulum stress, which was countered by ursodeoxycholic acid.

Despite resembling adipocytes, lipochondrocytes were molecularly distinct and produced lipids exclusively through de novo lipogenesis. Consequently, lipochondrocytes grew uniform lipid droplets that resisted systemic lipid surges and did not enlarge upon obesity. Lipochondrocytes also lacked lipid mobilization factors, which enabled exceptional vacuole stability and protected cartilage from shrinking upon starvation. Lipid droplets modulated lipocartilage biomechanics by decreasing the tissue’s stiffness, strength, and resilience. Lipochondrocytes were found in multiple mammals, including humans, but not in nonmammalian tetrapods. Thus, analogous to bubble wrap, superstable lipid vacuoles confer skeletal tissue with cartilage-like properties without “packing foam–like” extracellular matrix.",

Neurons often encoded the same hand and mouth actions differently in RCs and FMCs. Furthermore, in FMCs, we identified cells that selectively encoded actions untestable during RCs and others that displayed mixed selectivity for multiple actions, which is compatible with an organization based on cortical motor synergies at different levels of complexity. Cross-context decoding demonstrated that neural activity in FMCs is richer and more generalizable than in RCs, which suggests that neuroethological approaches are better suited to unveil the neural bases of behavior.",

We found that fully replacing conventional building materials with CO 2 -storing alternatives in new infrastructure could store as much as 16.6 ± 2.8 billion tonnes of CO 2 each year—roughly 50% of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions in 2021. The total storage potential is far more sensitive to the scale of materials used than the quantity of carbon stored per unit mass of materials. Moreover, the carbon storage reservoir of building materials will grow in proportion to demand for such materials, which could reduce demand for more costly or environmentally risky geological, terrestrial, or ocean storage.",

          "abstract": "From the biblical lex talionis to the medieval wergild system and modern workers’ compensation laws, laws about bodily damage may originate from cognitive mechanisms that capitalize on an enduring regularity: Different body parts vary in their incremental contributions to human functionality. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a preregistered study with materials based on five legal codes from highly diverse cultures and historical eras: the Law of Æthelberht (Kent, approximately 600 CE), the Guta lag (Gotland, approximately 1220 CE), and workers’ compensation laws from the United States, the Republic of Korea, and the United Arab Emirates; and 614 laypeople from the United States and India. The data indicate ordinal agreement in the values attached to body parts by ancient and modern lawmakers, as well as by laypeople in the United States and India. The observed agreement across time, space, and levels of legal expertise suggests that laws about bodily damage originate from shared intuitions about the value of body parts.",

The mechanisms of resilience that foster remission and mitigate the adverse effects of stress remain unknown. We analyzed the evolution of hippocampal morphology between 2016/2017 and 2018/2019, as well as the memory control mechanisms crucial for trauma resilience. Participants were individuals exposed to the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks ( N = 100), including chronic ( N = 34) and remitted ( N = 19) PTSD, and nonexposed ( N = 72). We found that normalization of inhibitory control processes, which regulate the resurgence of intrusive memories in the hippocampus, not only predicted PTSD remission but also preceded a reduction in traumatic memories. Improvement in control mechanisms was associated with the interruption of stress-induced atrophy in a hippocampal region that includes the dentate gyrus. Human resilience to trauma is characterized by the plasticity of memory control circuits, which interacts with hippocampal neuroplasticity.",

While cropland expansion is often used to counter adverse climate effects despite ecological trade-offs, the benefits for diets and nutrition remain unclear. This study quantitatively examines relationships between climate anomalies, forest loss from cropland expansion, and dietary outcomes in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country. Combining high-resolution data on forest cover and climate variables within random forest and panel regression models, we find that 25 to 31% of annual forest loss is linked to climate variability. Using georeferenced household survey data, we then find that changes in forest cover have a significant positive association with changes in child diet diversity—a key proxy of nutritional adequacy—while cropland expansion does not, suggesting that such forest conversions may be an ineffective climate adaptation strategy for improving nutrition. Our findings highlight the potential of nutrition-sensitive climate adaptation to enhance yields, promote nutritious cropping choices, and protect remaining forests.",

          "abstract": "The proteasome degrades most superfluous and damaged proteins, and its decline is associated with many diseases. As the proteolytic unit, the 20 S proteasome is assembled from 28 subunits assisted by chaperones PAC1/2/3/4 and POMP; then, it undergoes the maturation process, in which the proteolytic sites are activated and the assembly chaperones are cleared. However, mechanisms governing the maturation remain elusive. Here, we captured endogenous maturation intermediates of human 20 S proteasome, which are low abundance and highly dynamic, and determined their structures by cryo–electron microscopy. Through structure-based functional studies, we identified the key switches that remodel and activate the proteolytic sites. Our results also revealed that the POMP degradation is tightly controlled by a dual-checking mechanism, while the α5 subunit senses POMP degradation to induce PAC1/2 release, achieving the full maturation. These findings elucidate mechanisms directing and safeguarding the proteasome maturation and set basis for building proteasomes to counteract the decline of protein degradation in aging and disease.",

However, whether UPR factors facilitate cell-cell communication between cancer cells and immune cells to drive cancer progression remains unclear. We found that adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate response element–binding protein 3–like protein 2 (CREB3L2), a noncanonical UPR factor, is overexpressed and activated in triple-negative breast cancer, where its cleavage releases a C-terminal fragment that activates the Hedgehog pathway in neighboring CD8+ T cells. The enhanced Hedgehog pathway represses CD8+ T cell activation and inhibits its cytotoxic effects. Consequently, overexpression of CREB3L2 not only promotes tumor growth but also causes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway impedes the growth of CREB3L2-overexpressed tumors and sensitizes them to ICB therapy. In summary, we identified a previously unidentified mechanism by which the UPR pathway dictates cross-talk between cancer cells and immune cells, providing important anticancer therapeutic opportunities.",

Using a Tet-On 3G genetic approach, we achieved precise temporal control over protein translation in the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex ( IL ) during fear extinction. In addition, our results reveal that the disruption of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (Cpeb1) leads to notable alterations in cell type–specific translational programs, thereby affecting fear extinction. Specifically, Cpeb1 deficiency in neurons activates the translation of heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3, which enhances microRNA networks, whereas in microglia, it suppresses the translation of chemokine receptor 1 ( Cx3cr1 ), resulting in an aged-like microglial phenotype. These coordinated alterations impair spine formation and plasticity. Our study highlights the critical role of cell type–specific protein translation in fear extinction and provides an insight into therapeutic targets for disorders with extinction deficits.",

The fossil record offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct the early character evolution of the nervous system via the exceptional preservation of extinct representatives. We focus on their nervous system as it appears in early and mid-Cambrian fossils. We show that some of the oldest known representatives of the group either preserved in carbonaceous compression (early and mid-Cambrian Burgess-type preservation) or secondarily phosphatized in three dimensions (e.g., basal Cambrian Kuanchuanpu Formation, ca. 535 million years) had an unpaired ventral nerve cord (VNC) that ran along the trunk in an eccentric position as in modern priapulids and nematodes. A phylogenetic analysis integrating these fossil data suggests that ancestral scalidophorans had an unpaired VNC and that paired nervous systems probably evolved independently in Kinorhyncha and Loricifera, and, more importantly, in panarthropods in possible relation with the rise of paired appendages and bilaterally coordinated motricity.",

How somatic and germ cells interact to develop and maintain fertility is not well understood. Here, using grafting experiments and transgenic reporter animals, we find that a specific part of the gonad—the germinal zone—acts as a sexual organizer to induce and maintain de novo germ cells and somatic gonads in the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus . Germ cells express a member of the transforming growth factor–β family, Gonadless ( Gls ), that induces gonad morphogenesis. Loss of Gls resulted in animals lacking gonads but having nonproliferative germ cells. We propose that primary germ cells drive gonad development though Gls secretion. The germinal zone in the newly formed gonad provides positive feedback to induce secondary germ cells by activating Tfap2 in resident pluripotent stem cells. The contribution of germ cell signaling to the patterning of somatic gonadal tissue may be a general animal feature.",

          "abstract": "Hydrides in metal complexes or nanoclusters are typically viewed as electron-withdrawing. Several recent reports have demonstrated the emergence of “electron-donating” hydrides in tailoring the structure, electronic structure, and reactivity of metal nanoclusters. However, the number of such hydrides included in each cluster kernel is limited to one or two. There is even no structure model, neither theoretical nor experimental, for encapsulating a third electron-donating hydride into one cluster entity. Here, we present a structurally precise superatomic nanocluster, PtH 3 Cu 23 (iso-propyl-PhS) 18 (PPh 3 ) 4 (PtH 3 Cu 23 ), which contains three interstitial electron-donating hydrides. The molecular structure of PtH 3 Cu 23 describes the encapsulation of a PtCu 12 core that contains three interstitial hydrides in a distorted anticuboctahedral architecture, in an outer sphere consisting of copper atoms and thiolate and phosphine ligands. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the three hydrides in PtH 3 Cu 23 contribute their valence electrons to the cluster superatomic electron count of eight. In this regard, the cluster represents a rare Pt-included copper-hydride superatom with eight free electrons.",

However, despite the merit, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the bandgap variation as a function of Sn/Pb ratio, mainly because the films are easy to segregate in terms of both composition and phase. Here, we report a fully stoichiometric synthesis of monocrystalline FAPb 1− x Sn x I 3 nanocrystals as well as their atomic-scale imaging. On the basis of the systematic measurements of the monocrystalline materials, strain and Coulomb interaction–induced atomic ordering was revealed to be responsible for the unusual discontinuous bandgap jumping near x = 0.5 from the expected bowing effect. As a result, both FAPb 0.6 Sn 0.4 I 3 and FAPb 0.4 Sn 0.6 I 3 have the lowest bandgaps of around 1.27 electron volts, while that of FAPb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 is 1.33 electron volts. Correspondingly, their based light-emitting diodes can emit infrared lights with the wavelengths reaching 930 nanometers.",

With single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of murine embryonic knee joint primordia, we discovered that heightened expression of glycolysis genes characterized developing interzone cells when compared to flanking chondrocytes. Conditional deletion of the glucose transporters Glut1 and/or Glut3 , in either the incipient pre-skeletal mesenchyme with Prx1Cre or in chondrocytes with Col2Cre , disrupted interzone formation dose-dependently. In contrast, deletion of Glut1 / 3 in established interzone cells with Gdf5Cre did not have similar severe disruption of joint development. scRNA-seq revealed that Glut1/3 deletion by Prx1Cre impeded Tgfβ signaling in the developing interzone cells. Direct elimination of Tgfβ signaling with Prx1Cre partially phenocopied the deletion of Glut1/3 in impairing interzone formation. Tgfβ stimulated glycolysis in chondrocytes via activation of mTOR and Hif1α in vitro. The data support that the essential conversion of chondrocytes to interzone cells requires a transient elevation of glycolysis partly dependent on Tgfβ signaling.",

Here, we reveal that infection of Arabidopsis flowers by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A, a bacterial pathogen causing rice blight disease, suppresses ovule initiation and reduces seed number without causing visible disease symptoms. TleB, secreted by the type VI secretion system (T6SS), interacts with plant E3 ligase PUB14 and disrupts the function of the PUB14-BZR1 module, leading to decreased ovule initiation and seed yield. On the other site, PUB14 concurrently promotes TleB’s degradation. Our findings indicate that bacterial infections in nonhost plants directly repress offspring production. The regulatory mechanism by effectors PUB14-BZR1 is widely present, suggesting that plants may balance reproduction and defense and produce fewer offspring to conserve resources, thus enabling them to remain in a standby mode prepared for enhanced resistance.",

By upward transport in tropical regions, mercury enters into the stratosphere, but the contribution of the stratosphere to global mercury dispersion and deposition remains unknown. We find that between 5 and 50% (passing through the 400-kelvin isentropic surface and tropopause, respectively) of the mercury mass deposited on Earth’s surface is chemically processed in the lower stratosphere. Our results show the stratosphere as a unique chemical environment where elemental mercury is efficiently converted to long-lived oxidized species. Subsequent downward transport contributes substantially to the oxidized mercury burden in the troposphere. The results show that the stratosphere facilitates the global dispersion of large amounts of mercury from polluted source regions to Earth’s remote environments. We find that stratospheric transport is as important as tropospheric transport in interhemispheric mercury dispersion.

          "abstract": "Achieving highly tailored control over both the spatial and temporal evolution of light’s orbital angular momentum (OAM) on ultrafast timescales remains a critical challenge in photonics. Here, we introduce a method to modulate the OAM of light on a femtosecond scale by engineering a space-time coupling in ultrashort pulses. By linking azimuthal position with time, we implement an azimuthally varying Fourier transformation to dynamically alter light’s spatial distribution in a fixed transverse plane. Our experiments demonstrate self-torqued wave packets that exhibit spiraling motions and rapid temporal OAM changes down to a few femtoseconds. We further extend this concept to generate angularly self-accelerating wave packets that adjust their OAM by redistributing their energy density across their spectral bandwidth, without external forces. The ability to tune the spatial-temporal properties of light on demand opens the possibility for exploring ultrafast light dynamics at fundamental timescales, with far-reaching implications for ultrafast spectroscopy, nano- and microstructure manipulation, condensed matter physics, and other related areas.",

Our nonvolatile spintronic reservoir effectively transforms the history dependence of reservoir states to the path dependence of domains. We configure devices triggered by different pulse widths as neurons, creating a reservoir featured by strong nonlinearity and rich interconnections. Using a small reservoir of merely 14 physical nodes, we achieved a high recognition rate of 0.903 in written digit recognition and a low error rate of 0.076 in Mackey-Glass time series prediction on a proof-of-concept printed circuit board.

Scanning tunneling electron microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy show the structural anisotropy of ACPS. Electrical transport measurements show that its tunable in-plane conductance anisotropy is related to the ion-electron co-modulations, where Ag ion migration is anisotropic along a axis and b axis. Electrical transport measurements show the semiconducting properties of ACPS, as also supported by photoluminescence results. Moreover, the transfer curves of ACPS showcase large V g -related hysteresis, which is directionally controlled by anisotropic Ag ion migration.

However, scarce studies have investigated polaron formation in low-dimensional materials with phonon polarity and electronic structure transitions. In this work, we studied polarons of tellurene, composed of chiral Te chains. The frequency and linewidth of the A 1 phonon, which becomes increasingly polar for thinner tellurene, change abruptly for thickness below 10 nanometers, where field-effect mobility drops rapidly. These phonon and transport signatures, combined with phonon polarity and band structure, suggest a crossover from large polarons in bulk tellurium to small polarons in few-layer tellurene. Effective field theory considering phonon renormalization in the small-polaron regime semiquantitatively reproduces the phonon hardening and broadening effects. This polaron crossover stems from the quasi–one-dimensional nature of tellurene, where modulation of interchain distance reduces dielectric screening and promotes electron-phonon coupling. Our work provides valuable insights into the influence of polarons on phononic, electronic, and structural properties in low-dimensional materials.",

Our findings suggest that NAC is responsible for relocalizing ribosomes to the mitochondria and regulating ISC metabolism. Upon NAC inhibition, intestinal cells show decreased import of mitochondrial proteins, which are needed for oxidative phosphorylation, and, consequently, enable the cell to maintain a stem cell identity. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of NACα is sufficient to drive mitochondrial respiration and promote ISC identity.

          "abstract": "Solution-processed semiconductor lasers are next-generation light sources for large-scale, bio-compatible and integrated photonics. However, overcoming their performance-cost trade-off to rival III-V laser functionalities is a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature continuous-wave perovskite polariton lasers exhibiting remarkably low thresholds of ~0.4 W cm −2 , enabled by a variable single-crystal perovskite microcavity. The threshold outperforms state-of-the-art III-V lasers by ~30 times under optical pumping, and is exceptional among solution-processed lasers. The ultralow-threshold lasing arises from steady-state exciton-polariton condensation, a macroscopic quantum phenomenon akin to Bose-Einstein condensation. The steady-state condensation is attained by fine-tuning the cavity photon-exciton energy separation near the degeneracy point for strong light-matter interactions. These mechanisms enabled the initial demonstration of an indirectly injected perovskite laser chip powered by a gallium nitride light-emitting diode. Our findings create exciting avenues toward on-chip integration of solution-processed lasers, opening opportunities for lasing with ultralow energy consumption and unprecedented performance.",

To address this, we developed an affinity-based microfluidic device for specific capture of intact severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Our approach used an engineered angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to capture intact virus from plasma and other complex biofluids. Our device leverages a staggered herringbone pattern, nanoparticle surface coating, and processing conditions to achieve detection of as few as 3 viral copies per milliliter. We further validated our microfluidic assay on 103 plasma, 36 saliva, and 29 stool samples collected from unique patients with COVID-19, showing SARS-CoV-2 detection in 72% of plasma samples. Longitudinal monitoring in the plasma revealed our device’s capacity for ultrasensitive detection of active viral infections over time.

These RTDs serve as “Weyl points” for real topological phases. Despite theoretical interest, experimental observations of RTDs have been lacking, and studies mainly focus on individual RTDs. Here, we experimentally demonstrate physical systems with multiple RTDs in crystals, analyzing the distribution of Euler charges and their global connectivity. Through Euler curvature fields, we reveal that type I RTDs have quantized point Euler charges, while type II RTDs show continuously distributed Euler charges along nodal lines. We discover a correspondence between the Euler number of RTDs and the abelian/non-abelian topological charges of nodal lines, extending the Poincaré-Hopf index theorem to Bloch fiber bundles and ensuring nodal line connectivity. In addition, we propose a “no-go” theorem for RTD systems, mandating the balance of positive and negative Euler charges within the Brillouin zone.",

Herein, we demonstrate coordinated up-regulation of functionally coupled proteins by miRNA. We focused on CD98hc, the heavy chain of the amino acid transporter LAT-1, and α-2,3-sialyltransferases ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2, which are critical for CD98hc stability in melanoma. Profiling miRNA regulation using our high-throughput miRFluR assay, we identified miRNA that up-regulated the expression of both CD98hc and either ST3GAL1 or ST3GAL2.

We demonstrate a versatile approach for lattice-guided growth of dense, aligned MoS 2 NR arrays via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on anisotropic sapphire substrates, without tailored surface steps. This method enables the synthesis of NRs with widths below 10 nanometers and longitudinal axis parallel to the zigzag direction, being also extensible to the growth of WS 2 NRs and MoS 2 -WS 2 heteronanoribbons. Growth is influenced by both substrate and CVD temperature, indicating the role of anisotropic precursor diffusion and substrate interaction.

We demonstrate that spin current driven by thermal gradients sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. Spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space induces the superconducting spin Seebeck effect, where a spin current is generated along thermal gradients without a thermoelectric charge current. Notably, the nonvanishing superconducting spin Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity because it reflects the spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. At the same time, the spin chirality of the condensate induces the spin Nernst effect, where a spin current is generated perpendicular to thermal gradients in nonunitary superconductors. These spin caloritronic phenomena offer a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors.",

We show that packing domains are not topologically associated domains. Instead, packing domains exist across a structure-function life cycle that couples heterochromatin and transcription in situ, explaining how heterochromatin enzyme inhibition can produce a paradoxical decrease in transcription by destabilizing domain cores. Applied to development and aging, we show the pairing of heterochromatin and transcription at myogenic genes that could be disrupted by nuclear swelling.

Our results show that transitions naturally lead to substantial resurfacing and melt-generated outgassing from lithosphere-breaking events and overturns, with 3 to 10 bars of atmosphere generated per overturn over ~60–million year timescales and ~10 to 100 bars outgassed over billion-year time frames.

Subsequent interaction between SUMO and SUMO-interacting motif drives Fu/Ulk3 self-assembly to form biomolecular condensates that recruit Ci-Sufu and Gli-Sufu in the cytoplasm and primary cilium, respectively. Within the condensates, Fu/Ulk3 undergoes a conformational change to expose Ci/Gli for Fu/Ulk3-mediated phosphorylation and activation, leading to gradual accumulation of nuclear Ci A /Gli A transcriptional complexes in proportion to ligand dose and exposure time. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal control of Hh signal transduction, reveal previously unexplored regulatory mechanism and function for biomolecular condensation, and establish a paradigm for kinase-mediated signal transduction whereby a kinase allosterically activates its substrate through ligand-induced and condensation-driven conformational change.",

Despite being a target for drugs including general anesthetics and benzodiazepines, experimental structures have yet to capture an open state of classical synaptic α1β2γ2 GABA A receptors. Here, we use a goal-oriented adaptive sampling strategy in molecular dynamics simulations followed by Markov state modeling to capture an energetically stable putative open state of the receptor. The model conducts chloride ions with comparable conductance as in electrophysiology measurements. Relative to experimental structures, our open model is relatively expanded at both the cytoplasmic (−2′) and central (9′) gates, coordinated with distinctive rearrangements at the transmembrane αβ subunit interface. Consistent with previous experiments, targeted substitutions disrupting interactions at this interface slowed the open-to-desensitized transition rate. This work demonstrates the capacity of advanced simulation techniques to investigate a computationally and experimentally plausible functionally critical of a complex membrane protein yet to be resolved by experimental methods.",

Using this ratio, the Ni isotopic composition of EC 002 implies that metal segregation in the source of the EC 002 parental melts took place 0.82 − 0.60 + 0.61 million years (Myr) after solar system formation, and similar very early metal-silicate differentiation ages are obtained for 4-Vesta ( 0.95 − 0.76 + 0.95 Myr) and the angrite parent body ( 2.27 − 1.29 + 1.98 Myr). Such an early age dictates a specific accretion and differentiation history for the EC 002 parent body, with metal segregation occurring at relatively low temperatures (1000° to 1200°C), followed by a high-temperature silicate melting event.",

Sensory cortex represents these temporal cues through two codes: the temporal sequences of neuronal activity and the spatial patterns of neuronal firing rate. However, it is unknown which of these coexisting codes causally drives sensory decisions. To separate their contributions, we generated in the mouse auditory cortex optogenetically driven activity patterns differing exclusively along their temporal or spatial dimensions. Mice could rapidly learn to behaviorally discriminate spatial but not temporal patterns. Moreover, large-scale neuronal recordings across the auditory system revealed that the auditory cortex is the first region in which spatial patterns efficiently represent temporal cues on the timescale of several hundred milliseconds. This feature is shared by the deep layers of neural networks categorizing time-varying sounds. Therefore, the emergence of a spatial code for temporal sensory cues is a necessary condition to efficiently associate temporally structured stimuli with decisions.",

We identify P. sojae IRK1 (isoflavone-insensitive receptor kinase 1) as a receptor for genistein, with PsIRK2 functioning as a coreceptor that enhances the binding affinity of PsIRK1 to genistein and regulates chemotaxis by phosphorylating G protein α subunit. Last, we identify an antagonist, esculetin, which disrupts the PsIRK1-genistein interaction, thereby preventing P. sojae infection by repelling zoospores. Our findings reveal the mechanism by which P. sojae senses host genistein and demonstrate a strategy for disease prevention by targeting the chemoreceptor.",

We observed that CD28.ζ-CART engaged in brief highly lethal CARIS and mastered serial killing, whereas 4-1BB.ζ-CART formed lengthy CARIS and relied on robust expansion and cooperative killing. We analyzed CARIS membrane lipid rafts (mLRs) and found that, upon tumor engagement, CD28.ζ-CAR molecules rapidly but transiently translocated into mLRs, mobilizing the microtubular organizing center and lytic granules to the CARIS. This enabled fast CART recovery and sensitivity to low target site density. In contrast, gradual accumulation of 4-1BB.ζ-CAR and LFA-1 molecules at mLRs built mechanically tonic CARIS mediating chronic Fas ligand–based killing.

By integrating clinical, metabolomic, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we identified associations between decreased sphingolipid biosynthesis and future T2D, in part through the rs267738 allele of the CERS2 gene in Hispanic women shortly after a GDM pregnancy. To understand the impact of the CERS2 gene and risk allele on glucose regulation, we examined whole-body Cers2 knockout and rs267738 knock-in mice. Both models exhibited glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion in vivo. Islets isolated from these models also demonstrated reduced β cell function, as shown by decreased insulin secretion ex vivo.

Time-series observations of dissolved CO 2 and radon ( 222 Rn, a natural groundwater tracer) across 40 coastal systems from 14 countries revealed large SGD-derived CO 2 fluxes. The mean groundwater partial pressure of CO 2 was 35 times higher than surface seawater. The mean SGD-derived CO 2 flux was 148 ± 226 millimoles per square meter per day (mmol m −2 day −1 ), resulting in a mean water-air CO 2 flux of 80 ± 133 mmol m −2 day −1 . Tidal rather than diel cycles drove CO 2 enrichment in most ecosystems. Tidally driven SGD was the primary CO 2 source in mangroves, salt marshes, tidal flats, estuaries, and canals.

However, the voltage sensitivity of most FRET-opsin GEVIs has been reported to decrease or vanish under two-photon (2P) excitation. Here, we investigated the photophysics of the FRET-opsin GEVIs Voltron1 and Voltron2. We found that the previously reported negative-going voltage sensitivities of both GEVIs came from photocycle intermediates, not from the opsin ground states. The voltage sensitivities of both GEVIs were nonlinear functions of illumination intensity; for Voltron1, the sensitivity reversed the sign under low-intensity illumination. Using photocycle-optimized 2P illumination protocols, we demonstrate 2P voltage imaging with Voltron2 in the barrel cortex of a live mouse.

Here, we identified nonredundant roles for two voltage-gated sodium channels (Na V s), Na V 1.1 and Na V 1.6, in mammalian proprioception. Deletion of Na V 1.6 in somatosensory neurons (Na V 1.6 cKO mice) causes severe motor deficits accompanied by loss of proprioceptive transmission, which contrasts with our previous findings using similar mouse models to target Na V 1.1 (Na V 1.1 cKO ). In Na V 1.6 cKO animals, we observed impairments in proprioceptor end-organ structure and a marked reduction in skeletal muscle myofiber size that were absent in Na V 1.1 cKO mice.

In animals, complex sensory-motor systems are primarily built around specialized cells of muscles and neurons, though the evolutionary origins of these and their integration remain unclear. Here, to investigate sensory-behavior coupling in the closest relatives of animals, we established a line of the choanoflagellate, Salpingoeca rosetta, which stably expresses the calcium indicator RGECO1. Using this, we identify a previously unknown cellular behavior associated with electrical signaling, in which ciliary arrest is coupled with apical-basal contraction of the cell. This behavior and the associated calcium transients are synchronized in the multicellular state and result in coordinated ciliary arrest and colony-wide contraction, suggesting that information is spread among the cells. Our work reveals fundamental insights into how choanoflagellates sense and respond to their environment and enhances our understanding of the integration of cellular and organism-wide behavior in the closest protistan relatives of animals.",

We establish that lactyllysine is enriched in intrinsically disordered regions, regulating viral protein condensates and immune signaling transduction. Dynamic lactylation of immune factors suppresses immunity, a feature we show to be shared for HCMV and herpes simplex virus 1 infections, through regulation of RNA binding protein 14 and interferon-γ–inducible protein 16 (IFI16). K90 lactylation of the viral DNA sensor IFI16 inhibits recruitment of the DNA damage response kinase DNA-PK, preventing IFI16-driven virus gene repression and cytokine induction.

Conditional deletion of SFRs on T and/or B cells led to an increased ILC2 abundance. Mechanistically, as ILC precursors differentiate into ILC2s, SFRs, primarily SLAMF3 and SLAMF5, are inhibitory, which impair IL-7–induced PI3K activation and enhance apoptosis via SHP-1.
