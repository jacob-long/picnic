          "abstract": "Distinct ligands for the same G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activate intracellular signaling partners to varying extents, but the molecular mechanisms driving these differences remain elusive. Hypothesizing that such differences in signaling efficacy may be captured structurally in intermediate states under non-equilibrium conditions, we implemented a time-resolved (TR) cryo-EM approach to visualize the GTP-induced activation of the Gαiβγ heterotrimer by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) bound to three ligands displaying partial, full, or super-agonism on the receptor1. We resolved ensembles of conformational states along the G-protein activation pathway, including a previously unobserved intermediate state that enabled us to visualize receptor dynamics as a function of bound ligand. The results demonstrate ligand-dependent differences in state occupancy and conformational stability, with higher ligand efficacy correlating with increased dynamics of the receptor’s transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6. Furthermore, we identify key mechanistic differences in the GTP-induced activation of Gi compared to Gs that likely underlie their distinct activation kinetics. Corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single-molecule fluorescence assays, these findings provide a dynamic structural landscape of GPCR-G-protein interactions for ligands of different efficacy and suggest partial agonists may produce a ‘kinetic trap’ during G-protein activation.",

          "abstract": "The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is a conserved ribosome-bound factor with essential yet incompletely understood roles in protein biogenesis1. Here, we show that NAC is a multifaceted regulator that coordinates translation elongation, cotranslational folding, and organelle targeting through distinct interactions with nascent polypeptides both inside and outside the ribosome exit tunnel. Using NAC-selective ribosome profiling in C. elegans, we identify thousands of sequence-specific NAC binding events across the nascent proteome, revealing broad cotranslational engagement with hydrophobic and helical motifs in cytosolic, nuclear, ER, and mitochondrial proteins. Unexpectedly, we discover an intra-tunnel sensing mode, where NAC engages ribosomes with extremely short nascent polypeptides inside the exit tunnel in a sequence-specific manner. Moreover, initial NAC interactions induce an early elongation slowdown that tunes ribosome flux and prevent ribosome collisions, linking NAC’s chaperone activity to kinetic control of translation. We propose NAC action protects aggregation-prone intermediates by shielding amphipathic helices, thus promoting cytonuclear folding. NAC also supports mitochondrial membrane protein biogenesis and ER targeting by early recognition of signal sequences and transmembrane domain. Our findings establish NAC as an early-acting, multifaceted orchestrator of cotranslational proteostasis, with distinct mechanisms of action on nascent chains depending on their sequence features and subcellular destinations.",

          "title": "‘A serious problem’: peer reviews created using AI can avoid detection",
          "authors": "Dalmeet Singh Chawla",
          "abstract": "The difficulty of detecting AI-tool use in peer review is proving problematic.Credit: BrianAJackson/iStock via Getty\n\nIt’s almost impossible to know whether a peer-review report has been generated by artificial intelligence, according to a study that put AI-detecting tools to the test.\n\nA research team based in China used the Claude 2.0 large language model (LLM), created by Anthropic, an AI company in San Francisco, California, to generate peer-review reports and other types of documentation for 20 published cancer-biology papers from the journal eLife1. The journal’s publisher makes papers freely available online as ‘reviewed preprints’, and publishes them alongside their referee reports and the original unedited manuscripts.\n\nThe authors fed the original versions into Claude and prompted it to generate referee reports. The team then compared the AI-generated reports with the genuine ones published by eLife.\n\nThe AI-written reviews “looked professional, but had no specific, deep feedback”, says Lingxuan Zhu, an oncologist at the Southern Medical University in Lianyungang, China, and a co-author of the study. “This made us realize that there was a serious problem.”\n\nThe study found that Claude could write plausible citation requests (suggesting papers that authors could add to their reference lists) and convincing rejection recommendations (made when reviewers think a journal should reject a submitted paper). The latter capability raises the risk of journals rejecting good papers, says Zhu. “An editor cannot be an expert in everything. If they receive a very persuasive AI-written negative review, it could easily influence their decision.”\n\nThe study also found that the majority of the AI reports fooled the detection tools: ZeroGPT erroneously classified 60% as written by a human, and GPTzero concluded this for more than 80%.\n\nDiffering opinions\n\nA growing challenge for journals is the fact that LLMs could be used in many ways to produce a referee report. What is deemed an ‘acceptable’ use of AI also differs depending on whom you ask. In a survey of some 5,000 researchers conducted by Nature earlier this year, 66% of respondents said it wasn’t appropriate to use generative AI to create reviewer reports from scratch. But 57% said it was acceptable to use it to help with peer review by getting it to answer questions about papers.\n\nAnd although AI-detection tools are improving, they struggle to determine how much of a document has been generated using AI. An analysis published last year of referee reports that were submitted to four computer-science conferences estimated that 17% had been substantially modified by chatbots2. It’s not clear, however, whether the referees used AI to improve the reports or to write them entirely.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\nJeroen Verharen, a neuroscientist at the firm iota Biosciences in Alameda, California, says he is surprised that the AI detectors used by Zhu and his team weren’t better at spotting the AI-written referee reports.\n\nBut he adds that AI-written reports and associated materials are unlikely to become a widespread problem. If reviewers don’t want to review, he says, “they would just say no”.\n\nConversely, Mikołaj Piniewski, a hydrologist at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences, argues that it is a growing issue. He says he has already received referee reports that he suspects were written by AI.\n\n“LLMs are increasingly being used by peer reviewers, although this is rarely disclosed,” he says. “When I spoke to my colleagues in the field of hydrology, it became clear that each of us had encountered at least one such case as an author in the past two years. At least one of the review reports we received looked very suspicious, and the AI-detection tools we used flagged it as potentially generated by LLMs.”\n\nPiniewski adds that he is sure some journal editors are accepting AI-generated referee reports, unwittingly or otherwise. He suggests that a global shortage of peer reviewers could be causing some editors to be more lenient than they should be. “I’m afraid it is largely driven by convenience,” he says.",

          "title": "AI and quantum science take centre stage under Trump — but with little new proposed funding",
          "authors": "Jenna Ahart",
          "abstract": "A quantum computer. The administration of US President Donald Trump has announced sizable spending prorammes for quantum information science and artificial intelligence.Credit: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nFor much of US science, 2025 was a year of cancelled grants and budget anxiety — but a few fortunate fields came out ahead. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, artificial intelligence and quantum-information science have sat at the top of his administration’s scientific priorities. And they don’t seem to be leaving any time soon.\n\nTrump has ordered his advisers to ensure that the nation is “the unrivaled world leader” in AI and quantum information. The subjects are listed first and second on the administration’s list of research and development priorities. And on 11 December, Trump signed an executive order preventing US states from regulating AI, with the goal of speeding up the technology’s development.\n\nBut some researchers question the effectiveness of the administration’s programmes to promote quantum science and AI. And some argue that the administration’s strategies might be hampered by some of its other policy changes.\n\nHere Nature examines three ways in which the administration aims to move quantum science and AI forwards.\n\nFunding opportunities\n\nTrump’s budget proposal for the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2026 largely spared quantum science and AI, with a 3% increase in AI funding and a 0.4% increase in spending on quantum science — in contrast to cancelled research grants and proposals for steep cuts in many other areas. And throughout 2025, both the NSF and the Department of Energy (DoE) have announced new investments in AI and quantum science, including $100 million for AI projects at five US universities.\n\nWill AI ever win its own Nobel? Some predict a prize-worthy science discovery soon\n\nSteven Rolston, a quantum physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park and chair of the university’s physics department, says that the disparity between fields is visible there: faculty members in fields such as particle astrophysics face deep uncertainty about how much funding they’ll receive and how often they’ll have to reapply for awards. For quantum research, however, the biggest change is that the grant cycle has slowed down because of a US government shutdown and agency staffing changes. “I sort of have survivor’s guilt here,” Rolston says.\n\nBut quantum science and AI have not been immune to grant cuts. According to data from the non-profit website Grant Witness, the NSF has cancelled 101 grants that mention ’artificial intelligence’ in their abstracts, and 68 grants that mention ‘quantum’ in their abstracts.\n\nAnd although AI and quantum science escaped massive cuts, the administration’s funding increases for these areas “are negligible in scope”, says David Schatsky, an AI-policy researcher at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “The 2026 budget doesn’t reflect — in dollar terms — an increase in focus or commitment to AI and quantum.” The NSF declined Nature’s request for comment, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) did not respond.\n\nJoining forces\n\nTo pursue its priorities, the administration is also promoting both new and existing public–private partnerships, most prominently through an initiative, called the Genesis Mission, that was announced in November. The project, headed by the DoE, will make scientific data sets from the 17 US national laboratories available to private companies and academic researchers, who will use those data to build AI models to accelerate scientific research. Among the companies that have signed up to collaborate with federal researchers are Microsoft, IBM and OpenAI.\n\nIf the AI bubble bursts, what will it mean for research?\n\nThe administration has promoted public–private partnerships in quantum science as well. Under the National Quantum Initiative, which began during the first Trump administration, quantum-information research centres at five national labs partner with private quantum companies to create prototypes and test new technology. The DoE made an extra $625-million investment in the programme this year, and an executive order outlining the administration’s overarching approach to quantum science is expected soon, says Constanza Vidal Bustamante, a quantum-technology policy researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington DC.",

          "abstract": "In Stranger Things, the supernatural villain Vecna rules a nightmarish parallel world called the Upside Down. Credit: Netflix/Everett/Shutterstock\n\nThroughout its five seasons, the Netflix show Stranger Things follows a ragtag group of teenagers and their parents as monsters from another universe — unleashed by the secret work of a government laboratory — wreak havoc on a quaint, fictional town in Indiana.\n\nDon’t worry, Demogorgons, Shadow Monsters and psychokinetically gifted 12-year-olds are strictly fictional creations. But the ‘parallel universe’ concept at the core of the show — which is set to conclude its nearly decade-long run at the end of this year — comes from a real scientific theory. And it’s been hotly debated by physicists over the past 75 or so years.\n\n‘Many worlds’ interpretation\n\nAlthough the series is as much in the realm of fantasy as science fiction, Stranger Things nods to many concepts of basic physics. Principles of electromagnetism explain haywire compasses, as well as magnets that spontaneously fall off a refrigerator. And in the third season, the characters save the world by using Planck’s constant during their quest to close a gate to the other universe, called the Upside Down (although the show uses the 2014 value for Planck’s constant, which wouldn’t have been standard in the 1980s setting).\n\nPhysicists disagree wildly on what quantum mechanics says about reality, Nature survey shows\n\nPerhaps the most prominent physics phenomenon mentioned in the programme, however, is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. After deducing that their friend might be stuck in the Upside Down, three pre-teen-boy protagonists ask their science teacher how they could travel there. He responds, “You guys have been thinking about Hugh Everett’s many-worlds interpretation, haven’t you?”\n\nIn the 1950s, the US physicist Hugh Everett really did propose such an explanation for modern physics, and his theory has been collecting devotees ever since. Everett’s work makes sense of a concept that has long baffled quantum physicists: the measurement problem. The question is how a quantum system can seem to be in two states at once — an electron that is simultaneously in two different locations, for example — until the moment the system is observed or measured, when all at once it’s in only one of those states.\n\nThe most popular explanation for this conundrum, called the Copenhagen interpretation, says that the unobserved electron exists in a hazy quantum state of both options, described only by probabilities, until suddenly, on measurement, it ends up in one. Everett poses an almost fantastical alternative: the electron really exists in both states at once, and after the measurement, an observer sees only one state because the universe branches in two, with each outcome existing in a different world. The countless quantum states of all the world’s particles create an infinite number of universes: hence, many worlds.\n\nControversial theory\n\nFor many physicists, this idea is a bit far-fetched, particularly because if these many worlds can’t interact, then there’s no way to prove or falsify the theory, says Jorge Pullin, a theoretical physicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.\n\nBut for others — including Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who has worked as a science adviser for science-fiction films — the many-worlds interpretation is the most elegant explanation out there. “There are a lot of people who think this is the simplest version of quantum mechanics, and it fits all the data,” he says. Of the many explanations of quantum theory, many worlds is currently the third most popular among quantum physicists, a Nature survey found earlier this year.\n\nThe sci-fi films that physicists love to watch — from Interstellar to Spider-Man",

          "abstract": "Human–machine partnerships are increasingly used to address grand societal challenges, yet knowledge of the comparative strengths of humans and machines to innovate is nascent. Here we compare the ability of humans (N = 9,198) and large language models (LLMs, N = 215,542 observations) to generate novel ideas in an established creativity task. We present three key results. First, human creativity on average is slightly higher than that of LLMs. Second, creativity differences are pronounced at the extremes of the distribution, with humans exhibiting greater variability and higher levels of creativity in the right-hand tail of the distribution. Third, attempts to increase the creativity of LLMs through instructing LLMs to take on genius personas or different demographic roles lifted performance up to a threshold beyond which the output became opposite real-life patterns, whereas strategic prompt-engineering efforts yielded mixed to negative results. We discuss the implications of our findings for human–machine collaboration and problem solving.",

It has recently been suggested that serial dependence can improve perceptual decision-making by mitigating uncertainty and reducing variability in perceptual estimates—leading to a superiority effect. However, this claim remains largely untested. Here we present a large-scale analysis, compiling the most extensive dataset of serial dependence studies from the past decade. Contrary to the proposed superiority effect, our findings indicate that serial dependence deteriorates rather than improves perceptual decision-making.

At test, we measured ‘in-context’ learning (generalize the rule to novel queries) and ‘in-weights’ learning (recall past experiences from memory). Manipulating the diversity and redundancy of examples in the training distribution, we found that humans and transformer networks respond in very similar ways. In both types of learner, redundancy and diversity trade off in driving in-weights and in-context learning, respectively, whereas a composite distribution with a balanced mix of redundancy and diversity allows the two strategies to be used in tandem. However, we also found that while humans benefit from dynamic training schedules that emphasize diverse examples early, transformers do not. So, while the same data-distributional properties promote learning in humans and transformer networks, only people benefit from curricula.",

          "abstract": "Organisms in nature and humans in socioeconomic systems alike face tradeoffs between selfish consumption of resources and investment in the welfare of their offspring. Previous work across the disciplines of biology and economics has sought to elucidate this process, develop a theoretical framework to solve for the optimal life history strategy, and deduce implications of these microscopic interactions for the distribution of resources at the macroscopic level. Such theory, however, has failed to account for heterogeneous conditions that various individuals and groupings of kin enjoy, like growth rate advantages for those with greater resource abundance. Furthermore, such emergent trends at the macroeconomic scale lack reconciliation with observations of power law distributions of wealth and income in vivo. We modify and extend an analytical framework here to allow for heterogeneity, and consider the long-term consequences for resource distributions with Pareto initial values. We find that power law phenomena are robust to such processes and, due to sensitivity to the form of the utility curve, higher-order uncertainty may not affect the optimal tradeoff. This stresses the impact of mechanistic choices when translating sociological findings to ecological and economic theory, and suggests future work must consider how social norms and other microscopic complexity can explain emergent patterns or disrupt trends of inequality at the macrolevel.",

          "abstract": "Brassinosteroids (BRs) are key hormones that promote plant growth and development. While reversible phosphorylation of the BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) is critical for BR signaling, much remains to be learned about the dephosphorylation mechanisms of BRI1. Here, we demonstrate that the D-clade type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2C-Ds) negatively regulate BR signaling by dephosphorylating key residues in the kinase activation loop of BRI1. The phosphatase activity of PP2C-D2 and D5 is activated through homo- or heterodimerization, a process antagonized by BR-induced BRI1 phosphorylation or SMALL AUXIN UP RNA15 (SAUR15) binding. BL treatment, BRI1-mediated phosphorylation, or SAUR15 binding disrupts dimerization, returning PPC2C-Ds to a monomeric, inactive state. These data not only reveal another phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade regulating BR signaling but also decode unrecognized regulatory mechanisms of PP2C-Ds in plants.",

          "abstract": "Climate change and biodiversity loss threaten terrestrial productivity. Mitigating productivity loss from interactions between these global change drivers requires a mechanistic understanding of the forces generating productivity benefits from species richness (i.e., overyielding). Progress has been limited by two challenges: i) individual mechanisms can be highly context-dependent, yet multiple mechanisms can produce similar responses to functional diversity loss or altered climate, and ii) most experiments test short-term weather events rather than sustained changes in precipitation. We address these limitations using direct tests of multiple mechanisms within a sustained, full factorial manipulation of plant richness, composition, and precipitation within experimental grasslands. Precipitation consistently increased overyielding, as yield declined in monocultures and increased in polycultures, consistent with greater specialist pathogen accumulation in mesic conditions. Resource partitioning and specialist pathogen dilution—estimated from physiochemical trait dissimilarity and soil pathogen dissimilarity—were positive predictors of overyielding, relationships that strengthened over time. Moreover, overyielding was best explained by the joint influence of resource acquisition traits and pathogen dissimilarities, indicating that multiple mechanisms generated productivity responses to richness. These two mechanisms can explain the robust findings across systems that productivity increases with plant biodiversity. Our findings predict that biodiversity loss will be most damaging in wetter climates, where pathogen dilution amplifies the benefits of diversity.",

          "abstract": "Despite great success in certain cancers, immunotherapy made little progress in treating immune cold tumors, largely attributed to an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment with elusive mechanisms. Here, we report in prostate cancer cells a positive feedback loop driven by phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) that could be targeted to render effective cytotherapy by natural killer (NK) cells. In the loop, PSAT1 increases Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) phosphorylation by microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2, promoting its nuclear translocation to upregulate PSAT1 transcription. Meanwhile, YBX1 also promotes human leukocyte antigens E (HLA-E) transcription to inactivate NK cells. Consequently, the PSAT1 loop serves as a buff sustaining YBX1/HLA-E expression, suppressing NK killing of prostate cancer cells. Targeting loop molecules, such as PAST1, effectively potentiates tumor suppression by NK cells both in-vitro and in-vivo. Thus, our study uncovered a heretofore unrecognized nonautonomous mechanism for PSAT1, as well as a molecular buff for YBX1, to drive tumor growth by evading NK immunity, providing a promising target for NK cytotherapy of immune cold tumors.",

          "authors": "Justin B. Nichol, Logan A. Skori, Muhammad Jamshed, Neil Hickerson, Mendel Perkins, Marcus A. Samuel",
          "abstract": "The spring-loaded spontaneous seed dispersal mechanism known as dehiscence, has been a critical plant feature for the successful colonization of land by angiosperms. Although advantageous for seed dispersal, spontaneous dehiscence is largely an unfavorable agronomic trait which historically was selected against during selective breeding of crops to increase seed retention. In canola ( Brassica napus ), a major global oil seed crop, spontaneous or harsh weather-induced fruit shattering at maturity could lead to yield losses from 3 to 50%. Here, we show an extraembryonic role for the ABA-responsive transcription factor, ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE-3 (ABI3) in controlling seed dispersal through mediating lignification of the endocarp b (en b ) layer and the lignified layer (LL) of the valves. The resistance created by these lignified layers is critical for valve opening at maturity as the tensile forces generated during silique drying converge on these fortified cell layers to trigger shatter. We further show that ABI3 functions independent of the patterning genes and functions through transcriptional regulation of NAC-domain transcription factors, NST1 and NST3 , to mediate lignin biosynthesis. Our results show that both excessive and complete absence of lignification could prevent the tensile drying forces from breaking open the pod, leading to fruit indehiscence. As a proof-of-concept, we show that BnABI3 overexpression in canola results in highly lignified, robust siliques that are shatter tolerant. Besides uncovering an extraembryonic role for ABI3, this study has identified spatial distribution and abundance of lignin in the silique valve tissue as the key determinants for silique dehiscence.",

          "abstract": "Anelloviridae is a family of single-stranded DNA viruses that are thought to be nonpathogenic and commensal. Despite their ubiquitous presence in human populations, little is known about the anellovirus mechanism of replication in host cells. We identified the protein coded by ORF2/3 as necessary and sufficient to initiate replication from the minimal origin of replication for viruses of both the Beta- and Alphatorquevirus genera. Supporting this observation, we identified components of the polymerase alpha and BTR (Bloom’s syndrome helicase (BLM), topoisomerase IIIα, RMI1, and RMI2) complexes as interacting with the viral replication initiation protein (Rip) during DNA replication, suggesting a recombination-dependent mechanism of replication that uses host cell machinery to mediate dissolution of replication intermediates. Furthermore, we mapped a 92-bp minimal origin of replication sequence for the Betatorquevirus genus composed of an adenine and thymine (AT)-rich stretch and a portion of the guanine and cytosine (GC)-rich region. Altogether, this study provides insight into the mechanism by which anelloviruses manipulate host cell machinery to facilitate viral genome replication and represents a significant step forward in understanding the complex processes underlying anellovirus replication and persistent infection of these important commensal viruses.",

          "abstract": "Multidrug efflux pumps are dynamic molecular machines that drive antibiotic resistance by harnessing ion gradients to export chemically diverse substrates. Despite their clinical importance, the molecular principles underlying multidrug promiscuity and energy efficiency remain poorly understood. Using multiparametric deep mutational scanning across eight substrates and two energy conditions, we deconvolute the contributions of substrate recognition, energetic coupling, and protein stability, providing an integrated, high-resolution view of multidrug transport. We find that substrate specificity arises from a distributed network of residues extending beyond the binding site, with mutations that reshape binding, coupling, conformational flexibility, and membrane interactions. Further, we apply a pH-based selection scheme to measure the effect of mutation on pH-dependent transport efficiency. By integrating these data, we reveal a fundamental relationship between efficiency and promiscuity: Highly efficient variants exhibit broad substrate profiles, while inefficient variants are narrower. These findings establish a direct link between energy coupling and polyspecificity, uncovering the biochemical logic underlying multidrug transport.",

          "abstract": "Channelrhodopsins are light-gated ion channels that are used in modern neurosciences for the precise control of cellular ion fluxes by light. With a peak absorption at 585 nm, Chrimson is the most red-shifted cation-conducting ChR. It is frequently employed in multicolor experiments alongside blue light–sensitive optogenetic tools and is so far the only light-gated ion channel successfully applied in human vision restoration. However, its photoresponses to different wavelengths have not been thoroughly characterized. In this study, we identify multiple interconvertible dark states of Chrimson with distinct absorption and photokinetic properties. Combining electrophysiology and spectroscopy with optogenetic experiments in neurons, we unveil that this dark state heterogeneity is based on distinct protonation dynamics of the counterion complex and alternative retinal isomerization. In neurons, prolonged red illumination reduces Chrimson’s red light sensitivity, which is reflected by a blue shift of the action spectrum. Blue light pulses reverse this shift and increase the excitability in subsequent red-light flashes. This understanding of wavelength-dependent photoreactions in Chrimson will improve the design of multicolor optogenetic experiments and inform strategies for optimizing Chrimson for therapeutic applications.",

Here, we establish a bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiota and biological scaffold-mediated tissue repair. Utilizing a conventionalized germ-free mouse, we demonstrate that scaffold implantation induces compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiome, particularly affecting amino acid biosynthesis. Additionally, in a model of antibiotic-induced microbiota depletion, we show that dysbiosis disrupts key immune regulators of type 2 immunity, including reductions in eosinophils, proregenerative macrophages, and interleukin-4 (IL-4)-producing CD4 + T cells. At 6 wk post–scaffold implantation, we observed a significant decrease in myocytes with centrally located nuclei alongside an upregulation in profibrotic gene expression with antibiotic treatment.

Fishermen are increasingly recognized as marine apex predators, and there are extensive satellite-based geolocation data on fishing vessel activities. Despite this potential, the utility of fishermen as ecosystem sentinels remains unexamined. Using one million vessel positions from 600 U.S. vessels, we assess the effectiveness of fishermen as sentinels for the ecological impacts of Northeast Pacific marine heatwaves on tuna distribution and availability. Fishermen were skillful predictors of extreme northward shifts for albacore and bluefin tunas, and extreme inshore shifts for albacore. Fishermen signaled low albacore availability over a year in advance of a formal fisheries disaster declaration request. Notably, fishermen also indicated true negatives during marine heatwaves: periods of anomalous warming but stable tuna distribution and availability. This information could aid management of transboundary shifts during marine heatwaves of albacore from U.S. to Canadian waters and bluefin from Mexican to U.S. waters. Advanced warning of fisheries disasters could expedite the delivery of relief funds for struggling communities. The number of Earth-orbiting satellites is exponentially rising, generating a wealth of geospatial information on fishing vessels. This rich and growing resource can signal otherwise unobserved ecological impacts, aiding rapid management responses to climate extremes.",

          "abstract": "The ability to synthesize essential molecules is sometimes lost in evolution. A classic example is ascorbate (vitamin C), which is synthesized in most animals by L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO), an enzyme lost multiple independent times in animal evolution. This event is thought to be evolutionarily neutral; however, GULO- deficient animals including humans need to obtain ascorbate from their diet and are prone to ascorbate deficiency and scurvy. We therefore hypothesized that this disadvantage of GULO loss is offset by physiological benefits. Here, we show that ascorbate deficiency benefits mice infected with schistosome parasites, which cause schistosomiasis, a debilitating parasitic disease that afflicts 250 million people. Schistosoma mansoni worms required host ascorbate to produce eggs in vivo. Consequently, ascorbate-deficient mice were protected from schistosomiasis pathologies and transmission. Intermittent ascorbate deficiency protected Gulo -deficient mice from both scurvy and schistosomiasis mortality. The effects of ascorbate on schistosome reproduction were mediated by ascorbate-dependent histone demethylation which promoted vitellocyte development in female schistosomes. We propose that vitamin deficiencies are not always detrimental but can protect animals from pathogens which need to obtain vitamins from their host.",

          "abstract": "The β-barrel assembly machine (BAM) is an essential protein complex that folds and inserts outer membrane β-barrel proteins (OMPs) into the bacterial outer membrane. The BAM complex contains the essential BamA OMP with five soluble polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains, which scaffold the essential BamD lipoprotein and the nonessential lipoproteins BamB/C/E. The importance of each BAM component has been investigated primarily using cell-based phenotypic assays, and structural data have revealed insights into the role of the BamA β-barrel in OMP folding. However, in vitro quantitative analysis for the function of each BAM component has been challenging. We describe the development of a fluorescent reporter of OMP folding, bOmpA-A488, which we use to obtain single-turnover kinetic parameters for wild-type BAM complex in vitro. We observe a k fold of 0.78 ± 0.15 min −1 and approximate substrate affinity of 3.1 ± 1.1 µM consistent with estimates of in vivo requirements. Furthermore, we find that while BamA alone is inactive in Escherichia coli lipid liposomes, BamAB and BamAD subcomplexes have activities similar to that of the holoBAM complex. This suggests that OMP folding and insertion is catalyzed by BamA while the accessory lipoproteins maintain BamA in a catalytically competent conformation. We also find that, contrary to prevailing models, POTRA domain deletions that include POTRA3, which is essential in cells, do not drastically impact activity. This indicates that the first three POTRA domains do not play a major role in binding or folding OMPs under single-turnover conditions, suggesting a different role in cells.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is distributed across multiple cortical areas, suggesting that behaviors relying on WM arise from interactions between these regions. In a recent study, we found that during delayed comparison tasks, the first stimulus is not represented veridically in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but instead is encoded in a systematically warped manner–biased toward the mean of the stimulus distribution. This neural distortion, which emerges already during the stimulus presentation and persists throughout the delay period, closely mirrors a contraction bias observed in behavior. Furthermore, the behavioral responses could be explained by a Bayesian observer model, in which the observer integrates prior expectations with noisy sensory inputs. These results suggest that the geometry of PFC neural trajectories embodies Bayesian estimates that underlie biased decisions. Here, we investigate whether the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2)–a lower-level sensory area also implicated in tactile WM–exhibits a similar encoding structure. Our analyses reveal that although WM-related signals in S2 are less robust than in PFC, the neural state space in S2 shares key geometric features with that of PFC, including a similarly warped representation of stimulus values. These findings suggest that perceptual biases may originate early in the cortical processing stream and are not exclusively shaped by higher-order associative areas. More broadly, our results support a distributed organization of representational warping, in which even sensory areas contribute to the formation of bias-prone representations that guide behavior.",

The discrete, discontinuous, and three-phase nature of raindrop erosion—at the boundary of fluid and granular mechanics—makes this problem particularly challenging, compared to better-studied sediment transport by river and wind currents. Past research has emphasized particle entrainment by raindrop splash at impact. Here, we report lab and field observations, that uncover a surprisingly rich and efficient postimpact phase. Raindrops impacting a dry, sloping, granular bed spontaneously form “sandballs;” drops of dense suspensions that can grow in mass to a jammed state by sediment entrainment, as they roll downhill like snowballs and magnify soil erosion. Careful control of drop conditions reveals two stable sandball morphologies: peanut-like shapes linked to hydrodynamic instabilities and toroidal forms that undergo mechanical locking from extreme sediment loading, which have potential implications for related problems in bioengineering, pharmaceuticals, and snow physics.",

          "abstract": "Continuous biomarker monitoring and on-demand therapy are essential for chronic disease management, with diabetes being a key example. Although continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pumps are moving toward a closed-loop system, it remains difficult to predict how device design influences system performance. Traditional optimization methods are inefficient and empirical: Data-driven algorithms lack interpretability, trial-and-error design is time-consuming, and first-principle models are difficult to integrate at the system level. To address these challenges, we introduce a physics-based framework which integrates microneedle (MN) designs for sensing and therapy with a physiological model of glycemic control. The framework builds compact relationships showing how material, chemical, and geometrical features affect key metrics such as response time, extraction flux, and insulin delivery rate. Specifically, we develop a theory for three sensing MN types (hollow, porous/swellable, and nanostructured MNs) and one therapeutic patch (electro-termo-mechanical device) to create a predictive model for glycemic regulation. By linking device design to system behavior across time and spatial scales, we examine the framework in three cases: How disease progression, MN design, and MN sensitivity affect plasma glucose levels and time-in-range metrics. This work establishes the foundation for a physics-based digital twin for diabetes management, complementing ML, experiments, and numerical models. More broadly, it streamlines patch design, minimizing glycemic events and trial-and-error in next-generation CGM technology.",

          "abstract": "Urolithin A is an anti-aging and anti-inflammatory gut bacterial metabolite derived from ellagic acid (EA), a polyphenol abundant in berries and nuts. The conversion of EA to urolithin A involves multiple chemically challenging phenol dehydroxylation steps that produce urolithins with varying bioactivities. Despite their biological and chemical significance, the bacterial enzymes responsible for urolithin production remain largely unidentified. Here, we use differential gene expression analysis, anaerobic protein production, and enzyme assays to identify members of two distinct molybdenum enzyme families (the DMSO reductase family and the xanthine oxidase family) capable of regioselective dehydroxylation and urolithin generation. These two enzyme families have distinct substrate requirements, suggesting they employ different catalytic mechanisms for phenol dehydroxylation. Multiomics analysis of a human cohort uncovers decreased levels of urolithin A and genes encoding urolithin A-producing enzymes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), implying reduced health effects of EA consumption in this setting. Together, this study elucidates the molecular basis of urolithin production, expands the known enzymatic repertoire of the human gut microbiome, and suggests a potential link between gut bacterial urolithin production and reduced host inflammation.",

In this study, we present high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy structures of human SSTR5 in complex with two selective small-molecule antagonists, antagonist 1 and S5A1, revealing the receptor’s inactive conformation. Both antagonists induce a unique remodeling of extracellular loop 2, which adopts a capping architecture that sterically occludes the orthosteric site, thus preventing agonist access and stabilizing receptor inactivation. Structural analyses and functional experiments elucidate how distinct molecular moieties of the antagonists differentially contribute to inhibitory efficacy, and subtype selectivity. Furthermore, we delineate rational avenues for molecular optimization to enhance therapeutic index and mitigate off-target liabilities.

          "abstract": "The epidemiological dynamics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is characterized by poorly understood complex multiannual cycles. The origins of these cycles have long been debated, and multiple explanations of varying complexity have been suggested. Using Bayesian methods, we fit a dynamical model to half a century of M. pneumoniae surveillance data from Denmark (1958 to 1995, 2010 to 2025) and uncover a parsimonious explanation for the persistent cycles, based on the theory of quasicycles. The period of the multiannual cycle (approx. 5 y in Denmark) is explained by susceptible replenishment due, primarily, to loss of immunity. While an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, unable to reproduce the persistent cycles. We find that environmental stochasticity (e.g., varying contact rates) stabilizes the multiannual cycles and so does demographic noise, at least in smaller or incompletely mixing populations. The temporary disappearance of cycles during 1979 to 1985 is explained as a consequence of stochastic mode-hopping. The circulation of M. pneumoniae was recently disrupted by COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), providing a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations for long-term prediction. More generally, our findings provide further evidence for the role of stochasticity as a driver of complex cycles across endemic and recurring pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Dormant bacterial spores germinate to become vegetative cells upon germinant exposure. Despite many germinants being energy sources, bioenergetic processes have been overlooked as germination can proceed, albeit slowly, without exogenous energy sources. Here, we apply remission spectroscopy to noninvasively measure energization of the electron transport chain (ETC) in germinating spores. In Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis , energization of cytoplasmic metabolism and the ETC occurs early in germination, before or alongside water ingress and bulk CaDPA efflux. The aa 3 -type oxidases (Qox, Cta) accumulate nonradical ferryl intermediates of their catalytic cycle, slowed by a high membrane potential. The Yth isoform of the bd oxidase, present in spores, allows rapid electron transfer to O 2 when the aa 3 -type oxidases are hindered, establishing a role for this enzyme. Deletion of Yth slows the initiation of “absorbance”/attenuance loss, directly linking bioenergetic processes to germination. We propose a powered germination model, where the Ger-mediated signaling cascade and bioenergetic processes occur in parallel and are mutually influenced by each other. This model explains why germination on energy-rich molecules (e.g., glucose) is often much faster than on energy-poor ones (e.g., KBr).",

          "abstract": "Aducanumab, a human IgG1 antibody with plaque-clearing effects and modest clinical benefit, binds selectively to aggregated Aβ via the N-terminal region. Yet, the molecular details of how the antibody engages Aβ 1-42 fibrils remain unresolved. Using magic-angle spinning NMR, we show that binding of aducanumab preserves the overall architecture of the Aβ 1-42 fibril core while inducing significant structural and dynamic perturbations in the N-terminal region. Antibody binding markedly reduces flexibility in this domain, with the appearance of side-chain resonances from residues D1, E3, and histidine (likely H6) in dipolar-based experiments. These side chains—previously observed in scalar-coupling spectra of the unbound state—indicate rigidification of residues that were dynamic. The interaction extends to S8 and Y10, indicating broader fibril engagement than the minimal epitope (residues 3 to 7) defined in fragment-based studies. Perturbations in the C-terminal segment (G37–A42) are consistent with its spatial proximity to the antibody-bound N termini of neighboring monomers. Cryo-TEM images reveal fibrils bundling in the presence of aducanumab, consistent with lateral association via antibody cross-linking, supporting a model where surface coating and steric hindrance suppress secondary nucleation. This mode of action restricts monomer access to catalytic sites on the fibril surface, resulting in partial inhibition (~threefold reduction) of secondary nucleation. The effect depends on high avidity and relatively high stoichiometry but is ultimately limited by antibody size relative to N-terminal spacing along the fibril. These findings provide atomic-level insights into aducanumab’s binding mode and supply a structural framework for understanding antibody-mediated fibril recognition and for guiding next-generation therapies targeting Aβ aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease.",

          "abstract": "Rabies, caused by the neurotropic lyssavirus rabies virus (RABV), is nearly 100% fatal after symptom onset. A fundamental challenge for rabies therapy is that the blood–brain barrier (BBB) prevents peripherally administered neutralizing antibodies from entering the central nervous system (CNS) to clear the infection. In this study, we initially generated four human–mouse chimeric antibodies with preserved neutralizing potency against RABV to increase its translational potential. To achieve brain antibody delivery, we conjugated a lead chimeric antibody (7A3-H) to different cell-penetrating peptides with potential BBB-penetrating capacity (RVG, TGN, THR, and SynB1). In vivo fluorescence imaging revealed that SynB1 conjugation significantly outperformed conjugation with the other peptides in terms of BBB penetration for brain antibody delivery. Furthermore, a triple-antibody cocktail (targeting epitopes II/III/IV of RABV-G) conjugated to SynB1 resulted in 80% survival in mice infected with lethal challenge virus standard (CVS) or dog-originated rabies virus (DRV) strains when it was administered at 5 dpi (when CNS invasion and symptoms were evident). In contrast, the unconjugated cocktail provided only 20% (CVS) or 0% (DRV) survival. Together, these data demonstrated that SynB1-mediated BBB penetration dramatically improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti-RABV antibodies, enabling post-symptom rescue of rabies. This antibody–peptide conjugation strategy provides a proof of concept for advancing rabies therapy, specifically by leveraging peptide-mediated enhancement of BBB penetration.",

Facial movements are controlled, according to the dominant neuropsychological schema, by two separate circuits, one originating in medial frontal cortex controlling emotional expressions, and a second one originating in lateral motor and premotor areas controlling voluntary facial movements. Despite this functional dichotomy, cortical anatomy suggests that medial and lateral areas are directly connected and may thus operate as a single network. Here, we test these contrasting hypotheses through structural and functional MRI (fMRI) guided electrical stimulation and simultaneous multichannel recordings from key facial motor areas in the macaque monkey brain. These areas include medial facial motor area M3 (located in the anterior cingulate cortex); two lateral face-related motor areas: M1 (primary motor) and PMv (ventrolateral premotor); and S1 (primary somatosensory cortex). Cortical responses evoked by intracortical stimulation revealed that medial and lateral areas can exert significant functional impact on each other. Simultaneous recordings of local field potentials in all facial motor areas further confirm that during facial expressions, medial and lateral facial motor areas significantly interact, primarily in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, whereas during voluntary chewing, coupling occurs at lower frequencies. These functional interactions varied across facial movement types. Thus, at the cortical level, the control of facial movements is not mediated through independent (medial/lateral) functional streams, but results from an interacting sensorimotor network.",

The receptors colocalize widely at inhibitory synapses in the spinal cord and in the brainstem due to their interaction with an overlapping binding site of the synaptic scaffold protein gephyrin, pointing to a direct competition between the different receptor types. We have put this hypothesis to the test using single-molecule approaches to measure receptor–gephyrin interactions in cells and in vitro. We explored the effects of receptor competition at inhibitory synapses in living neurons by measuring the change in the accumulation and effective stabilization energy of glycine receptors in the presence of interfering GABA receptor complexes through single-molecule tracking and diffusion analysis. Second, using molecular tweezers, we quantified the thermodynamic properties of receptor–gephyrin binding, demonstrating direct and reversible competition through the addition of interacting peptides in solution. The relatively low affinity of GABA receptor subunits for gephyrin compared to the glycine receptor raises interesting questions about the role of this competition in synaptic plasticity. We hypothesize that GABA and glycine receptor competition constitutes a molecular system designed to reconcile synapse stability and plasticity at mixed inhibitory synapses.",

It is also used to separate red blood cells (RBCs) by age, as they lose water and become denser over their lifespan. When the density gradient is prepared with Percoll, discrete bands of RBCs are systematically observed along the gradient, despite the continuous density distribution of RBCs. Early studies suggested that cell aggregation might influence spatial distribution, but it remains debated whether a continuous density population can form discrete bands. We developed a continuity equation incorporating cell aggregation to describe the macroscopic evolution of RBC volume fraction in a density gradient, considering a continuous RBC density distribution. Numerical solutions demonstrate that the competition between net buoyancy and aggregation is sufficient to create band patterns. Our model reproduces the temporal evolution observed in experiments, but also predicts several types of bifurcation-like behaviors for the steady-state patterns in constant gradients, depending on RBC volume fraction and aggregation energy. This demonstrates that the competition between RBC aggregation and net buoyancy is a mechanism driving pattern formation.",

However, the vast search space often hinders existing algorithms to yield complex analytical expressions. We present SR-LLM, an SR framework integrating retrieval-augmented generation mechanisms based on large language models (LLM) to achieve incremental learning. Specifically, our framework is capable of leveraging accumulated prior knowledge and past exploration results from external knowledge bases to retrieve the most relevant information for current regression tasks. It first composes prior information into small symbolic groups with the assistance of the LLMs and then utilizes deep reinforcement learning to combine these groups to formulate complex yet explainable analytic expressions that are more easily understood by humans. The capability for efficient knowledge utilization enables our framework to integrate all previous human experiences and exploration results, effectively learning by standing on the shoulders of giants. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we not only test the framework on popular symbolic regression benchmarks but also extend its application to a domain where the explicit optimal model remains controversial: how to analytically describe human car-following behavior based on observed vehicle trajectories? Experiments confirm that our method outperforms on standard benchmarks, successfully rediscovers famous traditional car-following models and discovers new models from empirical trajectory data, achieving both fitting effectiveness and interpretability.",

Originated and domesticated in different continents and environments, cereal crops vary significantly in their salt tolerance. The High-Affinity K + Transporter1;5s (HKT1;5s) predominately regulate Na + accumulation and salt tolerance in salt-sensitive cereal crops by mediating shoot-to-root Na + exclusion. However, HvHKT1;5 paradoxically promotes root-to-shoot Na + translocation in salt-tolerant barley. Therefore, unravelling the regulatory mechanisms of HvHKT1;5 is critical to understanding the molecular basis of salt tolerance in barley. Here, we demonstrated that a microRNA164d-HvNAC92-HvHKT1;5 module improves salt tolerance via reduced shoot Na + accumulation and increased K + retention in barley, whereas miR164d suppresses HvNAC92 transcription factor to directly downregulate HvHKT1;5 expression. Under salinity condition, the MIR164d -OE, Hvnac92 , and Hvhkt1;5 lines showed significantly reduced root-to-shoot Na + translocation and shoot Na + content compared with the wild-type.

We show that disorder strongly affects the evolution into the conducting phases described in our previous work. The delocalization of charge 2 / 3 anyons leads to a chiral superconductor through a direct second-order transition for a smooth random potential with long-wavelength modulations. The longitudinal resistance has a universal peak at the associated quantum critical point. Close to the transition, we show that the superconducting ground state is an “Anomalous Vortex Glass” stabilized in the absence of an external magnetic field. For short-wavelength disorder, this transition generically splits into three distinct ones with intermediate insulating topological phases. If instead, the charge 1 / 3 anyon delocalizes, then at low doping the resulting phase is a Reentrant Integer Quantum Hall state with ρ xy = h / e 2 . At higher doping this undergoes a second transition to a Fermi liquid metal. We show that this framework provides a plausible explanation for the complex phase diagram recently observed in twisted MoTe 2 near ν = 2 / 3 and discuss future experiments that can test our theory in more detail.",

          "abstract": "Neuromodulatory systems play an essential role in regulating brain states and functions. The canonical view is that the release of monoamines including norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) is high during wakefulness and attenuated during sleep, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas the cholinergic system is active during both wakefulness and REM sleep and quiescent during non–REM (NREM) sleep. Recent studies have revealed a slow and rhythmic release pattern of neuromodulators during NREM sleep that drives infraslow oscillation (ISO) (0.02 to 0.03 Hz) in the brain. A key question is whether/how the release of different neuromodulators during sleep is coordinated. In this study, we combined 2-site fiber photometry with electroencephalogram/electromyography recording to monitor the release of NE, 5-HT, and acetylcholine in the cortex and hippocampus during sleep and wake cycles. We found that the ISO of these neuromodulators is synchronized during NREM sleep. The synchrony between neuromodulatory systems increases in the oscillatory cycles leading to arousal. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of either the 5-HT or NE system eliminates the oscillation of other neuromodulators during NREM sleep. Optogenetic activation of 5-HT or NE neurons during NREM sleep induces the release of other neuromodulators in the absence of sleep-to-wake transitions.

          "abstract": "α-Synuclein is an intrinsically disordered neuronal protein that forms an amphipathic helix when it peripherally binds to lipid membranes. This membrane interaction is integral to the protein’s function but is also associated with its dysfunction. Numerous membrane parameters have been identified to promote α-synuclein binding such as high negative charge and low lipid-packing density, which corresponds to greater lipid-packing defects—increased spacing between lipids conferred through curvature, unsaturation, or small headgroups. Despite α-synuclein’s established preference for negatively charged membranes with packing defects, the specific effects that each parameter has on this interaction remains underexplored. With increasing links between α-synuclein-associated diseases and changes in lipid composition, it has become more important to delineate how changes in membrane parameters affect α-synuclein membrane-interactions. Here, we demonstrate using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy that while net negative charge does increase the density of α-synuclein bound to a membrane, lipid-packing defects alone are sufficient for α-synuclein to insert. Not only do our results establish a lipid-packing defect requirement for α-synuclein, but they also reveal a packing defect-dependent shift in the ensemble of binding modes of the protein favoring the insertion of the end of its binding domain—a binding mode which has previously been linked to disease mutants of the protein. Overall, this work establishes the significance of lipid-packing defects in contrast to net negative charge for α-synuclein–membrane binding and proposes a lipid-compositionally dependent shift in α-synuclein’s ensemble of bound conformations, which may be relevant for the protein’s function and dysfunction.",

While some geological records and ice-sheet models suggest WAIS retreat during past warm periods, reliable data constraining the extent of retreat are lacking. Detrital Nd, Sr, and Pb isotope data of sediments recently drilled at International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site U1532 on the Amundsen Sea continental rise manifest repeated alternations in sediment provenance during glacial–interglacial cycles of the Pliocene (5.33 to 2.58 Mya), a time warmer than present. The variations reflect large fluctuations in WAIS extent on the Antarctic continent. A unique high Pb/low ε Nd signature of sediments found at the onset of glacial intervals (3.88, 3.6, and 3.33 Ma) is attributed to the supply of detritus sourced from plutonic rocks located in the West Antarctic interior. Its isotopic signature at Site U1532 indicates major inland retreat of the WAIS during the preceding interglacials. During peak interglacials, the ice margin had retreated inland, and icebergs rafted and deposited inland-sourced detritus over 500 km across the Amundsen Sea shelf. Subsequent readvance of grounded ice then “bulldozed” these inland-derived fine-grained sediments from the shelf down to the continental slope and rise, resulting in a high Pb/low ε Nd peak in the rise sediments. Our continuous Pliocene records provide conclusive evidence for at least five major inland retreat events of the WAIS, highlighting the significant vulnerability of the WAIS to ongoing warming.",

The viral T antigen promoter requires the activity of the cellular coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 for its expression. Inhibition of CBP/p300 with two distinct small-molecule inhibitors suppresses T antigen expression, leading to cell cycle arrest and upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 . This shift promotes neuronal differentiation, associated with neurite outgrowth in MCC cells. RNA sequencing revealed downregulation of genes involved in E2F, Myc, mTORC1 oncogenic signaling, as well as markers of the Merkel cell lineage including Sox2 and Atoh1. Notably, a rare MCC case exhibiting a mixed cellular composition, with loss of T antigen expression and neuroblastic phenotype, showed a transcriptomic profile resembling that of MCC cells treated with CBP/p300 inhibitors. This suggests that similar differentiation processes may contribute to tumor heterogeneity in patients.

          "abstract": "The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) is a primary output for basal ganglia signaling. It plays an important role in the control of movement, integrating inputs from upstream structures in the basal ganglia, before sending organized projections to a range of targets in the midbrain, brainstem, and thalamus. Here, we present a detailed in silico model of the mouse SNr, including its major afferent inputs. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of SNr neurons are characterized in acute brain slices via whole cell patch-clamp recordings and morphological reconstruction. Using reconstructed morphologies, multicompartmental models of single neurons are instantiated within the NEURON simulation environment and populated with relevant modeled ion channels. Model parameters are optimized via an evolutionary algorithm, such that simulated neurons faithfully reproduce recorded electrophysiological behavior. Using the simulation infrastructure software Snudda , single neuron models are incorporated into a circuit-level model, where the sparse connectivity within the SNr is recreated. We simulate the mouse SNr at scale, featuring realistic volumes and neuronal density. The unique synaptic properties and activity patterns of different afferent sources are captured in silico. Born out of ex vivo data, our model reproduces in vivo firing patterns. Our simulations suggest that paradoxical activity increases in response to experimental inhibition can be explained by lateral connectivity. In addition, our model predicts the functional implications of characteristic short-term synaptic plasticity in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. The model can be extended to include additional inputs and be connected with existing models of upstream basal ganglia nuclei to further explore circuit dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of cardiac failure among individuals under 35. Many genetic mutations that cause HCM seem to enhance ventricular systolic function, suggesting that these HCM mutations are hypercontractile. Among the most common causes of HCM are mutations in the gene MYH7, which encodes for β-cardiac myosin, the principal human ventricular myosin. Previous work has demonstrated that, for purified myosins, some MYH7 mutations are gain-of-function while others cause reduced function, so how they lead to enhanced contractility is not clear. Here, we have characterized the mechanics and kinetics of the severe HCM-causing mutation M493I. Motility assays demonstrate a 70% reduction of actin filament gliding velocities on M493I-coated surfaces relative to wild type (WT). This mutation slows ADP release from actomyosin•ADP fivefold without affecting phosphate release or ATP binding. Yet it enhances steady-state ATPase V max twofold. Through single-molecule mechanical studies, we find that M493I myosin has a normal working stroke of 5 nm but a significantly prolonged actin attachment duration. Under isometric feedback, M493I myosins produce high, sustained force, with an actin detachment rate that is less sensitive to force than that of WT myosin. We also report direct measurement of the equilibrium state of the super-relaxed to disordered relaxed regulatory transition and show its disruption in M493I, with a concomitant enhancement to actin attachment kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that enhanced myosin binding from inhibition of myosin’s off state, combined with slow ADP release and enhanced force production, underlie the enhanced function and etiology of this HCM mutation.",

While the influence of boundary-dependent environmental geometry on spatial representations has been extensively studied in 2D spaces, less is known about the role of boundaries for volumetric spatial memory. Research in humans and other animals has demonstrated distinct processing of the vertical and horizontal spatial dimensions, likely related to species-specific modes of locomotion. Here, we investigate whether different locomotion modes, flying and walking, affect the use of vertical boundaries, leading to possibly distinct volumetric representations. In a Virtual Reality experiment, human participants memorized objects within a symmetric 3D enclosure, and then were asked to replace them in either the familiar or geometrically deformed environments. We found that the flying group exhibited lower vertical than horizontal spatial memory precision, whereas the walking group showed the opposite pattern, an effect related to using their body axis as a vertical “ruler”. Within deformed environments, object replacements in the flying group followed the predictions from a 3D-extended boundary-vector-cell-like computational model of spatial mapping that treated all boundaries equally, whereas those in the walking condition favored a modified model that prioritized the ground boundary. Our findings suggest that gravity-related movement constraints promote different utilization of geometric and body-related cues, resulting in flexible representations of volumetric space.",

          "abstract": "Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) is a method whereby randomly oriented chiral molecules are irradiated by circularly polarized light (CPL), photoionizing electrons, which are measured in a momentum-resolved manner. This scheme permits chiral light–matter interactions within the electric-dipole approximation (avoiding weak magnetic-dipole interactions), yielding huge chiral signals in the form of a forward–backward asymmetry in photoemission. Recently, more intricate realizations of PECD have been explored where the CPL is replaced with elaborate polarization-tailored light (e.g., bichromatic, noncollinear, etc.), some of which do not even require circularly polarized components, but still lead to massive chiral signals. However, the connection between generalized symmetries and asymmetries of the laser drive and selection rules in PECD have not yet been derived. Here, we formulate this connection analytically from group theory, also predicting two previously unknown selection rules for PECD from fields with dynamical inversion and improper-rotational symmetries. We further propose bichromatic bielliptical fields for breaking symmetries in typical spectra, yielding potentially more information for ultrafast-resolved measurements. We numerically demonstrate all of our results with state-of-the-art ab-initio simulations in the archetypal chiral molecule, Bromochlorofluoromethane, providing predictions for experiments. Our work presents a roadmap for analyzing PECD from tailored light and resolves a long-standing issue in the field. It should motivate theoretical and experimental investigations in novel PECD set-ups.",

Accurate prognostication is important, because withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy based on perceived poor prognosis is the leading cause of death after TBI. Synchronized activity between brain regions, measurable with resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), may underlie neurological recovery. However, which functional connections are critical for recovery, and whether functional connectivity measured shortly after brain injury predicts long-term recovery, is unknown. Here, we analyzed data from three prospective cohorts of patients with moderate or severe TBI (N = 116 patients; 134 controls) who underwent rs-fMRI shortly after injury. The strongest predictor of 6-mo functional outcomes in the Training Cohort (mean cross validation AUC 0.94) and independent Testing Cohort (AUC 0.78; P = 0.001) was functional connectivity between three pairs of brain regions from functionally distinct networks, two of which were anticorrelated. Results were robust to controlling for sedation ( P = 0.02) and level of consciousness at time of MRI ( P = 0.02). Finally, preserved anticorrelations improved the leave-one-out outcome prediction accuracy of an established prognostic score (AUC 0.90 vs. 0.80; P = 0.02). Preserved functional anticorrelations in acutely traumatized brains identify patients with the neurological substrate required for recovery. This biomarker can inform prognostic decisions in patients at high risk for death from withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy.",

SpARC-map uses only routine microbiology techniques, with no reliance on specialized instrumentation, dedicated reagents, or reconstituting protein complexes in vitro. SpARC-map can be tuned to detect PPIs over a broad range of affinities, multiplexed to probe multiple PPIs in parallel, and its nonspecific background can be precisely measured, enabling the sensitive detection of weak PPIs. Using SpARC-map, we recover known PPI interfaces in the p21–PCNA, p53–MDM2, and MYC–MAX complexes. We also use SpARC-map to probe the purinosome, the weakly bound complex of six purine biosynthetic enzymes, where no PPI interfaces are known. There, we identify interfaces that satisfy structural requirements for substrate channeling, as well as protein surfaces that participate in multiple distinct interactions, which we validate using site-specific photocrosslinking in live human cells.

The female Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes , has two organs with distinct symbiotic communities: the accessory nidamental gland (ANG) and the light organ (LO). The ANG hosts a bacterial consortium, whereas the LO has a binary relationship with Vibrio fischeri , housed in extracellular crypt spaces as part of the central core (CC). To understand how the host maintains distinct symbiotic communities, we used transcriptomics to identify immune-related genes that are uniquely and similarly expressed in the ANG and LO-CC compared to organs without a known microbiota. Genes such as peptidoglycan recognition proteins EsPGRP2 and EsPGRP3, cathepsin-Z, alkaline phosphatase, and acidic phospholipase exhibited significant upregulation in the symbiotic organs compared to other tissues like gills, skin, mantle, optic lobe, ovaries, and brain. Moreover, EsPGRP2 displayed distinct localization patterns within the ANG, inversely correlating with bacterial presence, whereas the protein was colocalized with V. fischeri in the LO-CC. Notably, 10 different galaxins (EsGal) were uniquely highly expressed in both the ANG and LO-CC, with EsGal1 messenger RNA predominantly localized to the LO-CC epithelium, while EsGal2 and EsGal3 were primarily found in the epithelia of ANG tubules. Furthermore, antimicrobial assays using partial peptides derived from EsGal1 and EsGal2 showed varying and distinct patterns of inhibitory activity for these peptides. In summary, our findings identify similar immune gene families expressed across functionally distinct symbiotic organs in E. scolopes , suggesting that common immunomodulatory factors may maintain distinct symbiotic niches in the host.",

The peak TC frequency occurred in the 1650–1680 with a greater amplitude of variabilities in the south and east coasts of China and TC behaviors changed seasonally. The peak TC period corresponded to the Maunder Minimum which was characterized by lower land surface temperature, whereas the temperature reconstructed from marine proxies showed an anomalously warmer sea surface temperature over the western Pacific. Changing thermal contrast between land and sea likely created a more dynamic summer monsoon circulation resulting in active TC activity.

Here, we combine isotope-edited solution NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)–enhanced solid-state NMR, molecular dynamics simulations, and AlphaFold3 modeling to define the molecular role of arginine and tyrosine in Latrodectus hesperus dragline silk. Phosphate triggers LLPS while preserving intrinsic disorder, with arginine exhibiting the largest chemical shift perturbations. Simulations reveal that phosphate displaces hydration water to promote Arg–Tyr cation–π interactions and weaken Arg–poly(Ala) contacts. Solid-state NMR directly detects Arg–Tyr contacts in spun fibers, demonstrating that arginine is partially incorporated into β-sheet interfaces while tyrosine frequently adopts β-turn conformations. AlphaFold3 models corroborate these interfacial geometries and reproduce experimental chemical shifts, supporting persistent Arg–Tyr interactions at structured–unstructured boundaries. Together, these results identify Arg–Tyr contacts as critical “sticker” interactions that mediate condensation, nucleate local order, and stabilize fiber architecture. More broadly, this work establishes a mechanistic link between residue-specific chemistry, LLPS, and hierarchical assembly in a structural protein. These insights highlight how weak multivalent interactions bridge disordered and ordered states, providing a general framework for condensate-driven assembly in biology and guiding biomimetic material design.",

The cytoskeleton is known to play a critical role in gravitropism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis kinesins KCH3 and KCH7 (KCH3/7) are expressed and functionally active in the root stele. The kch3 kch7 ( kch37 ) double mutant exhibits delayed gravitropic responses, while stele-specific expression of either KCH3 or KCH7 rescues this defect. Both the calponin homology (CH) and motor domains of KCH3/7 are essential for mediating gravitropism. In vitro and in vivo assays reveal that KCH3/7 promotes actin filament (F-actin) bundling and its turnover in the root stele. Mutation of KCH3/7 results in altered PIN protein abundance and polarity in the root stele, leading to impaired acropetal auxin transport within the stele and reduced auxin accumulation in the root tip’s columella cells. This ultimately causes defective auxin redistribution during gravistimulation. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics in the root stele for maintaining the auxin gradient in the root tip and for gravistimulation-induced auxin asymmetry.",

Despite their clinical significance, the molecular mechanisms underlying VLU remain poorly defined. In this study, we constructed a comprehensive single-cell transcriptional atlas of VLUs, unveiling a widespread immunosuppressive microenvironment within the lesions. Specifically, stromal cells exhibited attenuated inflammatory responses coupled with enhanced fibrotic activity. Keratinocytes and endothelial cells demonstrated increased proliferative and angiogenic activity, respectively, yet both cell types showed markedly reduced antigen-presenting capacity. Immune cell compartments displayed profound dysfunction characterized by marked reductions and impaired functionality of dendritic cells, polarization of macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, and enrichment of T cell exhaustion signatures. Notably, cell–cell communication analysis revealed diminished crosstalk between immune and structural cell populations. Mechanistically, we identified NAMPT-mediated signaling as a critical regulator of myeloid-stromal crosstalk. Targeted depletion of NAMPT in macrophages disrupted fibroblast-mediated inflammatory responses and impaired wound healing, whereas exogenous NAMPT administration reactivated immune responses and promoted tissue repair in chronic wounds. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive molecular framework for understanding immune–stromal dysfunction in VLUs and position NAMPT as a central immune regulator and promising therapeutic target for chronic wound treatment.",

Unfortunately, existing roadmaps often drastically underestimate the true extent of road networks and future predictions of road-related impacts rely on incomplete and outdated data, undermining development planning and conservation decision-making. Here, we develop a multivariate “road expansion risk” index to identify areas prone to road building and therefore vulnerable to road-related environmental impacts. Using a massive road dataset—137 million 1-ha raster cells drawn from three different sources arrayed across the Amazon and Congo basins and insular Asia-Pacific region—we predict road-prone locations via a statistical model that integrates a range of biophysical, socioeconomic, and administrative data. This highly integrative, large-scale approach allowed us to identify areas likely to experience future road building and regions that may contain unmapped roads. Importantly, our road expansion risk index is a strong predictor of forest loss and degradation and can hence identify future road building and deforestation hotspots, even for the many tropical forest locales with grossly deficient road data.",

          "abstract": "The interaction between the immune system and the somatosensory system plays a fundamental role in the regulation of diverse biological processes. Chronic itch is a common yet hard-to-treat symptom of many inflammatory skin conditions. One hallmark of chronic itch is the hyperinnervation of the skin by sensory fibers, yet what drives this aberrant nerve growth or how it contributes to disease progression remains unclear. Here, we identify IL-17A and immunity to skin microbiota as key triggers of sensory neuron plasticity and pruritus. In a murine model of psoriatic itch, we show that exposure to Staphylococcus aureus prior to experimental psoriasis results in heightened skin inflammation, increased itch, and marked hyperinnervation of CGRPα + sensory neurons. Accordingly, single-nuclei RNA sequencing of dorsal root ganglia reveals that microbiota-driven inflammation induces a regenerative transcriptional program in sensory neurons, including upregulation of axonal growth, injury response, and IL-17RA signaling pathways. Mechanistically, we show that IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling within TRPV1 + sensory neurons drives hyperinnervation and pruritus, establishing a causal link between IL-17A and microbiota-driven immune responses in sensory circuit remodeling. Further, we identify sensory hyperinnervation as a key driver of chronic itch and inflammation. Collectively, we reveal that aberrant IL-17A signaling in sensory neurons, triggered by dysregulated microbiota immunity, promotes neuronal remodeling that amplifies itch and inflammation. These findings provide a framework for targeting microbiota–neuroimmune interactions as a therapeutic strategy for pruritus.",

However, precise control of gap junctions remains elusive. Herein, we present CarGAP, a single-component chemo-optogenetic tool that utilizes the C-terminal adenosylcobalamin (AdoB 12 ) binding domain of a photoreceptor protein (i.e., CarH C ) to achieve reversible control over both vertebrate and invertebrate gap junctions with spatiotemporal precision. The vertebrate CarGAP (i.e., Cx-CarGAP), created by genetically fusing connexins with CarH C in mammalian cells, can efficiently block the gap junction channels through AdoB 12 -induced protein oligomerization and subsequently reinstate them via green light–induced protein disassembly. We further introduced the CarGAP system (i.e., Inx-CarGAP) to the Drosophila ovary, enabling reversible control over the heterotypic gap junctions formed by innexin2 (Inx2) and innexin4 (Inx4, also known as zero population growth, Zpg), thereby uncovering the roles of gap junctions in stem cell–niche interactions.

          "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), caused by biallelic mutations in the ATM gene, leads to multiple disease phenotypes, including cerebellar neurodegeneration, radiosensitivity, cancer predisposition, immunodeficiency, insulin resistance, and pulmonary inflammation. ATM plays a central role in regulating cellular responses to DNA breakage [M. B. Kastan, J. Bartek, Nature 432 , 316–323 (2004)], but several cellular and physiologic abnormalities associated with ATM dysfunction suggest the possibility of noncanonical roles for ATM as well. Herein, we identified the HSP90 paralogue, GRP94, as an ATM interactor/substrate and found that ATM influences N- glycosylation of GRP94 and its subsequent activation/translocation to the plasma membrane, where it serves as a scaffold protein and stabilizer for several membrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR and IGF1-R. In selected cell types, ATM loss/inhibition resulted in increased cell surface expression of RTKs and overactivation of RTK pathways, alterations that were rescued by specific inhibition of cell surface GRP94. This ATM/GRP94 pathway also regulated the activation of microglial cells, manifest as increased cytokine production and phagocytosis activity associated with ATM loss/inhibition and reversal of that activation with GRP94 inhibition. These results identified GRP94 as an ATM interactor and apparent substrate and demonstrated specific critical regulatory roles for ATM outside of DNA damage signaling. These insights provide potential explanations for several of the phenotypes associated with ATM dysfunction and potential opportunities for novel approaches to blunt clinical symptoms in A-T, and also suggest that other neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders might benefit from selective inhibition of cell surface GRP94.",

          "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria build a multilayered cell envelope in which the peptidoglycan layer is sandwiched between an inner membrane of glycerophospholipids and an asymmetric outer membrane composed of glycerophospholipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Acinetobacter baumannii , however, synthesize lipooligosaccharide (LOS), an LPS variant lacking O-antigen. Although LPS/LOS is typically essential, A. baumannii can survive without LOS, offering the opportunity to examine how the Gram-negative envelope remains stable in the absence of this major glycolipid. We previously found that the peptidoglycan biogenesis protein NlpD, an activator of peptidoglycan degradation by cell division amidases, is critical for fitness during LOS deficiency. Here, we show that NlpD is required under these conditions because a second putative amidase activator, WthA (cell wall turnover hub protein A), no longer functions in LOS-deficient cells. Mutants lacking WthA exhibited severe cell-division defects and were synthetically sick with loss of NlpD. Acinetobacter lack canonical periplasmic amidases, raising the question of which enzymes partner with NlpD and WthA. Previous work showed that overexpression of an Acinetobacter β-lactamase increased denuded peptidoglycan, a product of amidase activity. Guided by this finding, we examined the chromosomally encoded β-lactamase Oxa51 and found that its coexpression with WthA or NlpD enhanced release of amidase products, suggesting that Oxa51 participates in peptidoglycan degradation and that WthA is an amidase activator. Further, WthA influenced peptidoglycan endopeptidases and lytic transglycosylases through a network of protein interactions. Altogether, these findings identify WthA as a missing regulator in Acinetobacter peptidoglycan biogenesis and a hub that coordinates peptidoglycan turnover and cell division.",

Along with competition for resources, cooperative interactions shape biodiversity and contribute to the robustness of complex ecosystems. We present a stochastic neutral theory of cooperator species. Our model shares with the classic neutral theory of biodiversity the assumption that all species are equivalent, but crucially differs in requiring cooperation between species for replication. With low migration, our model displays a bimodal species-abundance distribution, with a high-abundance mode associated with a core of cooperating species. This core is responsible for maintaining a diverse pool of long-lived species, which are present even at very small migration rates. We derive analytical expressions of the steady-state species abundance distribution, as well as scaling laws for diversity, number of species, and residence times. With high migration, our model recovers the results of classic neutral theory. We briefly discuss implications of our analysis for research on the microbiome, synthetic biology, and the origin of life.",

          "abstract": "With approximately 4% of the world’s population using cannabis, there is a need to better understand its physiological effects. Cannabis consumption acutely promotes food intake (“the munchies”) via delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-mediated activation of cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1R); however, these appetitive effects have not been well characterized. We examined effects of cannabis vapor inhalation on energy and macronutrient intake patterns in human participants and then validated these findings in a translational rat model through which we explored behavioral and physiological mechanisms subserving this response. Vaporized cannabis acutely and robustly increased energy intake. In humans, this occurred in the first 30 min of snack and beverage access, irrespective of dose or gender. In rats, these effects were observed in the first 60 min of food access, irrespective of macronutrient content, satiation, or sex, and were a result of cannabis vapor reducing latency to eat and increasing feeding bout number. Also, cannabis vapor did not change the proportion of macronutrients consumed by human participants and abolished preexisting macronutrient-specific food preferences in rats. Our rat data indicate that cannabis vapor may override homeostatic appetite regulation by increasing motivation to eat and reducing food reward devaluation to promote energy intake. Finally, cannabis vapor did not alter circulating appetite-associated hormones, and these feeding effects were mediated by central, but not peripheral, CB1Rs. This study complements and builds upon previous literature to characterize the appetitive effects of vaporized cannabis and uses a translational approach to examine cannabis-driven energy and macronutrient intake patterns in humans and rodents.",

          "abstract": "The Mesoproterozoic eon [1.8 to 0.8 billion years ago (Ga)] is a crucial but enigmatic period in Earth’s history. Many facets of this interval remain unresolved, especially how atmospheric evolution influenced and responded to changes in climate and biology. For example, low atmospheric O 2 concentrations are thought to have inhibited the emergence of animals until the Neoproterozoic. Yet, some p O 2 estimates indicate that the critical threshold for animal respiration was exceeded several hundred million years prior. Likewise, low p CO 2 estimates imply glacial climates should prevail. However, this prediction is inconsistent with an apparent billion-year hiatus in glaciation. We test these hypotheses with direct constraints on the Mesoproterozoic atmosphere from analyses of primary fluid inclusions in 1.4 Ga surficial halite, which reveal an atmospheric p O 2 of 7.84 ± 3.05 mbar and a p CO 2 of 2.76 ± 1.66 mbar. We couple these measurements with average inclusion homogenization temperatures of 31.2 ± 7.8 °C. Our results point to an Earth system state characterized by a moderate climate with sufficient O 2 for early animal respiration. These observations reflect a coevolution of life, climate, and the atmosphere, where a largely unrecognized episode of oxygenation and CO 2 drawdown was driven by the breakup of the supercontinent Nuna and the complexification of algal eukaryotes.",

Different maturation states (mature and immature forms) of flavivirus particles have been observed to be released from infected cells and are infectious. To understand how an ultrapotent human antibody (HMAb) A9E can neutralize these Zika particles, we determined the cryoEM structures of the A9E Fab fragment complexed with mature (mZIKV) and immature (immZIKV) ZIKV to 2.8Å and 7.5Å, respectively. A9E binds to an epitope spanning Domain I (EDI), EDIII, and their linker in an E protein protomer in both immZIKV and mZIKV particles. A9E generally inhibited prior to or during virus attachment to cells, via virus aggregation, distortion of virus particles and inhibition of receptor binding. ImmZIKV is particularly sensitive to structural distortion by Fab A9E. The primary mode of infection used by ImmZIKV is via antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE)—the formation of virus complex with nonneutralizing or subneutralizing concentrations of antibodies, that leads to enhanced infection of Fcγ positive myeloid cells. IgG A9E, by itself displays poor ADE activity. When IgG LALA mutant or Fab A9E is added to other enhancing antibody (DV62.5):virus complexes, they can strongly reduce the overall ADE activity. This is likely due to their ability to distort virus particle structure, suggesting that HMAb A9E could be a potential prophylactic and therapeutic candidate against all maturation states of ZIKV.",

MB exhibited a specific pattern of behavioral lapses, as well as decreased fast oscillatory activity and complexity over posterior electrodes compared to MW. Functional connectivity analyses revealed decreased long-range interareal connectivity during MB, compared to both ON and MW states. Event-related potentials with source reconstruction and temporal decoding techniques indicated a significant disruption in visual processing during MB, starting from 200 ms post stimulus and echoing into the late-stage of visual processing, suggesting a disruption of conscious access to sensory information during MB. Electroencephalogram-derived markers allowed the prediction of mental states at the trial level, offering a finer view of conscious dynamics than subjective reports alone. Overall, these findings challenge the notion of the wakeful conscious mind as inherently content-oriented, suggesting that MB reflects genuine gaps in the stream of conscious thoughts, arising from disruptions in the generation or accessibility of thought content.",

Our biochemical assays reveal that substrate binding induces ATPase activity in ABCD3, suggesting a substrate-dependent conformational change. Structural comparison of the apo and substrate-bound states demonstrates that the substrate interaction brings nucleotide-binding domains closer together, providing a mechanistic basis of substrate-induced ATPase activity. These findings offer critical insights into the transport mechanism of ABCD3 and lay a structural foundation for understanding its role in peroxisomal metabolite import and related diseases.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR) involves several excision pathways, including those mediated by exonuclease 1 (Exo1) and by the flap endonuclease Rad27 (human FEN1) coupled with DNA polymerase δ. Simultaneous inactivation of both excision mechanisms causes an MMR defect that is at most 5 to 13% of that caused by complete inactivation of MMR. Here, we reconstituted nicked-strand-specific MMR with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Msh2-Msh6 or Msh2-Msh3, DNA polymerase ε, RFC, PCNA, RPA, and Mlh1-Pms1 (human Mlh1-Pms2) under conditions lacking Exo1, Rad27, or strand-displacement synthesis by DNA polymerase δ. These reactions required the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease activity, its activation by RFC and PCNA, and its recruitment by Msh2-Msh6 or Msh2-Msh3. MMR was mediated by nicked-strand-specific excision by Mlh1-Pms1 through formation of single-strand DNA gaps having a broad range of sizes. This reaction is consistent with genetic data demonstrating redundancy between the Exo1, Rad27, and Mlh1-Pms1 excision pathways in MMR.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility relies on the continuous accumulation and integration of sensory evidence to guide adaptive behavior. In natural environments, behaviorally relevant information unfolds sequentially over time and is constantly evaluated against prior knowledge, task rules, and current demands. Integration of these inputs poses a computational challenge: How is temporally unfolding, predictive information integrated into a stable representation, while preserving the discriminability and flexibility to map individual stimuli to competing context-specific actions? Using large-scale human intracranial electroencephalography, we assessed how neural population activity integrates behaviorally relevant information across multiple sensory events that sequentially unfold over time and jointly determine the current context. The results uncover that the population geometry supports the emergence of conjunctive coding subspaces that integrate prior information with current sensory evidence and jointly define the temporal context that mediates behavioral benefits. Evidence accumulation diversifies the population responses distributed across the cortex, increasing the representational space that embeds context-dependent stimulus-action mappings. Hence, context-dependent sensory coding might constitute the neural basis underlying adaptive human behavior. In sum, these results demonstrate how neural population activity balances integrating predictive information with preserving stimulus discriminability to enable flexibility, while minimizing interference.",

The actin homolog MreB plays a pivotal role in maintaining the shape of many rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli by directing cell-wall synthesis according to local curvature cues. However, the basis of MreB’s curvature-dependent localization has remained elusive. Here, we develop a biophysical model for the energetics of a filament binding to a surface that integrates the complex interplay between filament twist and bending and the two-dimensional surface geometry. Our model predicts that the spatial localization of a filament like MreB with substantial intrinsic twist is governed by both the mean and Gaussian curvatures of the cell envelope, which strongly covary in rod-shaped cells. Using molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the mechanical properties of MreB filaments, we show that their thermodynamic preference for regions with lower mean and Gaussian curvatures matches experimental observations for physiologically relevant filament lengths of ~50 nm. We find that the experimentally measured statistical curvature preference is maintained in the absence of filament motion and after a cycle of depolymerization, repolymerization, and membrane rebinding, indicating that equilibrium energetics can explain MreB localization. These findings provide critical insights into the physical principles underlying cytoskeletal filament localization and suggest design principles for synthetic shape-sensing nanomaterials.",

          "abstract": "Brain capillaries are sensors of neural activity. When a brain region is active, capillary endothelial cells (ECs) sense neuron-derived mediators and elicit a local increase in blood flow (functional hyperemia) to support the rise in metabolic needs. This hyperemic response involves a rapid electrical component and a slower chemical component that involves Gαq PCR (G q PCR) activation by agonists released from neurons. The intravascular forces associated with hyperemia engage mechanosensitive Piezo1-mediated signaling that serves a mechano-feedback control function to facilitate the return of elevated blood flow to basal levels. Whether G q PCR activity influences Piezo1 mechanosensitive signaling has not been explored, despite the potential significant implications of such crosstalk. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology and freshly isolated brain capillary ECs, we demonstrate that prostanoid or muscarinic G q PCR activation facilitates Piezo1 activity. Pharmacological studies revealed the involvement of Gαq and phospholipase C stimulation, as well as downstream phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) hydrolysis in Piezo1 activation, but not signaling triggered by metabolites of PIP 2 hydrolysis. Exogenous application of nanomolar-to-micromolar PIP 2 suppressed Piezo1 open probability. Brain capillary ECs from mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral small vessel disease, or Piezo1 gain-of-function mutation exhibited higher Piezo1 activity, that was corrected by exogenous ex vivo PIP 2 application. We finally tested in vivo the hypothesis that systemic PIP 2 administration restores functional hyperemia in EC-specific Piezo1 gain-of-function mutant mice suffering impaired blood flow. Our findings provide insights into Piezo1 channel regulation and how it affects neurovascular coupling and cerebral blood flow.",

High humidity exacerbates heat strain, but its long-term effects on health remain poorly understood. We compare the effect of prenatal exposure to extreme humid heat versus heat alone on child growth in South Asia, where high rates of child stunting meet rapidly accelerating hot-humid extremes. After adjusting for sociodemographic, seasonal, and spatial confounders, we use within-community variation in children’s ages to isolate the impact of prenatal exposures. We find that hot-humid exposures are much more detrimental to health than hot temperatures alone, with the potential to increase stunting in South Asia by over 3 million children by 2050. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for humidity when estimating and localizing climate change impacts.",

We used mass spectrometry to interrogate vaccinia virus infection to reveal that up to 90% of epitopes were presented as fast as their source proteins were translated, but that protein amounts failed to correlate with epitope levels. Unexpectedly, epitope levels on infected cells also failed to correlate with immunogenicity.

We report that gate voltage applied to the conducting laminar MXene membrane can modulate the permeation rate of ions and neutral solutes, as well as its effective size rejection. In operando wide-angle x-ray scattering measurements reveal that these changes are not driven by electrically induced variations in the d spacing of the MXene layers. Instead, experimental data and continuum electrokinetic modeling reveal that ion transport through the MXene channels is primarily affected by Donnan equilibrium at the membrane-solution interface. We also report a strong increase in the permeation rates through the membrane under a low-frequency ac voltage gating regime that we attribute to diffusioosmotic flow oscillations induced in the membrane. Overall, MXene “transistor” membranes provide a previously unidentified approach to dynamic control of molecular separations.",

Here, we found vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), critical for vesicular ATP storage/release, is highly expressed in T H 1 cells and selectively restricts their differentiation and effector functions. Mechanistically, VNUT facilitates lysosomal ATP import and its extracellular release upon T cell receptor engagement. This eATP then activates the purinergic receptor P2X7R and downstream SRC kinase, triggering a signaling cascade involving heightened Ca 2+ influx and hyperphosphorylation of JNK and FOXO3a, which ultimately impairs Eomes-directed IFN-γ production in T H 1 cells. Genetic/pharmacological of VNUT inhibition significantly potentiates T H 1 effector functions against Listeria infection and transplanted tumors.

Up to a fivefold increase in signal-to-noise ratio in the indirect dimension allows detection of previously hidden long-range correlations, including intermolecular contacts.

          "abstract": "Very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) govern plant adaptation and development in a chain length–dependent manner. The elongation of VLCFAs is mediated by 3-ketoacyl–coenzyme A synthase (KCS) and ECERIFERUM2 (CER2) family protein cofactors, but the structural basis and mechanistic principles underlying chain-length determination remain elusive. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of citrus KCS6-CER2 and KCS6–CER2-like1 complexes, unveiling a kinked elongation tunnel whose hydrophobicity and volume determine VLCFA chain length. KCS6 functions as a catalytic module elongating VLCFAs up to chain length of 28 carbons (C28). CER2 family proteins further extend the tunnel formed by the KCS6 subunit, thus elongating VLCFAs to chain lengths longer than C28. These findings provide a plant-specific structural framework for VLCFA chain-length modulation and lay a foundation for engineering VLCFA biosynthesis for the improvement of crop resilience and VLCFA industrial value.",

          "abstract": "Abscisic acid (ABA)–induced stomatal closure limits water loss from plants under drought stress. To investigate the signaling pathways involved in ABA-induced stomatal closure, we performed a phosphoproteomic analysis of ABA-treated Arabidopsis guard cell protoplasts (GCPs). We found that ABA-responsive phosphorylation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN 4 KINASE 1 (MAP4K1) was significantly down-regulated in SnRK2-disrupted mutants. Subsequent biochemical assays showed that Ser 479 of MAP4K1 is directly phosphorylated by SRK2E/OST1, a central ABA kinase. Mutational analyses of MAP4K1 and MAP4K2 revealed that both kinases positively regulate ABA-induced stomatal closure and that Ser 479 of MAP4K1 is required for this phenotype. In map4k1map4k2 double mutants, stomatal closure was induced by applying exogenous Ca 2+ but not H 2 O 2 . Electrophysiological experiments showed that MAP4K1/2 is required for ABA-dependent activation of Ca 2+ -permeable channels in GCPs. Together, our results indicate that SnRK2 and MAP4K function as a signaling module to regulate the Ca 2+ -mediated pathway in ABA-induced stomatal closure.",

Aging Top3b -KO mice also display splenomegaly and systemic immune alterations including neutrophilia and lymphopenia consistent with chronic inflammation. At the molecular level, Top3b deficiency causes genome-wide R-loop accumulation in splenocytes as measured by CUT&amp;Tag sequencing. Increased R-loops are associated with genomic breaks and activation of immune signaling pathways including innate and adaptive immune cell signaling, IL-4 signaling, FAK signaling, and cGAS-STING. In addition, knocking-out Top3b promotes the rapid development of syngeneic EL4 T cell lymphomas. In conclusion, our work implies that Top3b protects from lymphoma, tumorigenesis, and immune dysregulations.",

While individual cancer cells can remodel ECM to create microchannel-like paths of least resistance, this cell-centric view overlooks the coordinated dynamics of multicellular communication. Here, we reveal that cancer cells collaboratively reprogram ECM to construct interconnected microchannel networks functioning as “superhighways” for barrier-free metastasis. Combining live-cell imaging, atomic force microscopy, and optical tweezers, we decode that the indispensable step in microchannel network construction is organized cross-convergence of adjacent channels. The convergence is precisely directed by mechanical bridges composed of aligned collagen bundles between adjacent channels, which transmit orientation cues to induce multicellular force coordination. Integrating single-cell sequencing and off-lattice agent-based model, we identify mechanically responsive leader cells enriched for integrin-RhoA/YAP signaling and matrix metalloproteinase 14, which sense bridge cues and initiate cross-convergence. Collectively, our findings unveil a self-organized metastatic network and its mechanobiological mechanisms, offering a previously unidentified framework and potential therapeutic insights for cancer metastasis.",

          "abstract": "Plant reproductive development involves a series of transitions, with the shoot apical meristem (SAM) transitioning into the inflorescence meristem (IM) and then the floral meristem (FM). In rice ( Oryza sativa ), the florigens Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 play central roles in these transitions. The plant hormones auxin and cytokinin shape the morphologies associated with each transition, but little is known about the factors that integrate florigen function with phytohormone signaling during these transitions. Here, we show that in rice, Hd3a activates the transcription of FT-LIKE1 ( OsFTL1 ), which encodes a mobile FT-like protein that promotes the transition from the IM to the FM, whereas cytokinin signaling suppresses its transcription. We performed single-cell resolution three-dimensional imaging to elucidate the spatiotemporal distribution of Hd3a, cytokinin, and auxin signaling during the SAM-to-IM and IM-to-FM transitions, finding that Hd3a accumulation and cytokinin signaling occupy opposite domains in the IM. Hd3a accumulated at the center of the meristem and activated the OsFTL1 promoter, while OsFTL1 was present throughout the IM, suggesting that a “florigen relay” consisting of Hd3a from the leaves moves to the SAM and induces OsFTL1 expression within the SAM. We propose an antagonistic mechanism mediated by Hd3a and cytokinin that modulates the abundance of OsFTL1 and thus regulates reproductive development in rice.",

Moreover, achieving stereoselective transformations of light olefins remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a visible-light–mediated photoredox-catalyzed chemo-divergent and regioselective radical difluoromethylation/polyfluoroarylsulfonylation and difluoromethylation/polyfluoroarylation of structurally diverse alkenes through switchable sulfur dioxide reintegration. The method demonstrates broad applicability across styrenes, unactivated alkenes, and gaseous ethylene/propylene substrates. The photocatalyst functions as a switch, and Sodium difluoromethanesulfinate (CF 2 HSO 2 Na) acts as a bifunctional reagent, enabling controllable divergence radical conversion via radical-polar crossover pathways. Notably, chiral alcohol–derived polyfluoroarenes efficiently induce stereoselectivity control in the coupling of alkyl radicals with sulfur dioxide via dynamic kinetic resolution. Density functional theory calculations indicate noncovalent interaction between alkyl/aryl groups and polyfluorocarbons plays critical roles for the ultralong-distance (&gt;9 atoms) stereochemical induction. The key to achieving chemo-divergent and stereocontrolled transformations lies in the precise sorting of a dynamic intermediate pool containing alkyl radicals, sulfonyl radicals, and anions.",

Path analysis indicates that traits have strong, direct effects on ISD. Flow and land use effects on the exponent are largely indirectly mediated by their influences on species traits. ISD exponents increase (abundances of larger-bodied individuals increase, relative to smaller-bodied) when environments favor higher trophic levels, warmer thermal tolerances, and periodic life histories. Alternatively, ISD exponents decrease in systems that favor opportunistic life histories. Our flexible modeling framework that includes direct and indirect effects of traits, flow regimes, and land use on ISD could be expanded to incorporate additional variables that interact with flow (e.g., temperature and physical habitat) to assess of effects of multiple stressors on aquatic ecosystem functioning.",

Furthermore, fire’s impacts are highly diverse, spanning threats to human and ecological values and beneficial ecosystem and cultural services. Here, we discuss the art and science of projecting climate change impacts on landscape fire. This not only includes how fire, its drivers, and its impacts are modeled, but critically it also includes how projections of the climate system are developed.

The superior sieving ability of sub–4 angstrom interlayer nanochannels enables vertically aligned COF membranes to efficiently intercept salt ions, electrically neutral small molecules, and hazardous chemicals, outperforming conventional COF membranes. The implemented strategy can be extended to other building blocks and framework topologies, opening up avenues for fine-tuning the pore structure of 2D COF membranes.",

Across regions, in situ diversification was consistently elevated during heightened phases of tectonic activity.

Here, we characterized human SFL structurally and biochemically. The 2.0-angstrom resolution crystal structure of SFL reveals a boat-like module comprising an N-terminal helical bundle and three zinc fingers at the C terminus. A hyperphosphorylation loop (HPL) buried between the helical bundle and the zinc finger 1 harbors four phosphorylated residues (p-S249, p-T250 p-T253, and p-S256), which are important to protein folding. SFL forms monomers in solution and binds the HIV-1 −1 PRF sequence with nanomolar affinity ( K D  = 5.7 nanomolar). Disruption of HPL phosphorylation decreased the RNA binding affinity and undermined the SFL-mediated −1 PRF inhibition of various viruses. Proximity-dependent biotinylation identified three cellular Ser/Thr kinases—EEF2K, NEK9, and PBK—that phosphorylate SFL in cells. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying −1 PRF regulation by SFL and provide insights into the role of SFL in virus inhibition.",

We investigate how cuticle investment, a major nutritional cost, shaped the evolution of ant societies and diversification. Using a computer vision approach on three-dimensional x-ray microtomography scans of 880 specimens from 507 species, we show that larger colonies were facilitated by reducing exoskeleton investment rather than miniaturizing workers. Reduced cuticle investment was associated with accelerated diversification rates in ants, whereas other candidates—colony size and worker size—did not correlate with diversification. Diet and climate had measurable but secondary effects on cuticle investment. Our results support a hypothesis whereby evolving cheaper but more numerous units through reduced investment in structural tissues was a strategic trend in the evolution and diversification of complex insect societies.",

MERVL elements are transiently up-regulated in mouse totipotent two-cell (2C) embryos during major zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and 2C-like cells in vitro. One of the most powerful activators of MERVL is the pioneer transcription factor, Dux. However, apparent differences lie in the requirement for Dux versus MERVL activation in embryos. Moreover, sustained Dux activation causes cell toxicity, which may or may not be linked to MERVL. Using a CRISPR activation system, we unpick the relative role of Dux and MERVL in ZGA, totipotent-like characteristics, and cell toxicity. We find that MERVL activation drives a portion of the Dux-dependent transcriptome, sufficient for expanded fate potential, but not other totipotency features.

          "abstract": "Signal transduction by the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is modulated by its ligands as well as by the various compounds on the plasma membrane (PM), including cholesterol. Here, using single-molecule coimmunoimmobilization, we found that cholesterol in the inner leaflet of PM plays an essential role in ligand-dependent EGFR activation. This was done by direct and quantitative examination of the interaction between EGFR and cholesterol on the PM of a living cell. Structural analysis using molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy further revealed that cholesterol in the inner leaflet is critically important for the transition of the dimeric transmembrane domain (TMD) of the receptor to the active conformation. We also identified the specific pattern of residues Ile 640 -Gly 641 -Leu 642 of EGFR TMD regulating inner leaflet cholesterol binding and ligand-activated EGFR by screening via site-directed mutagenesis. Our results indicate that cholesterol in the inner leaflet of PM is a key checkpoint of EGFR activation triggered by EGF.",

Necroptosis, a regulated necrotic cell death pathway controlled by receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), has emerged as a potential driver of inflammation and fibrosis in chronic liver disorders. We investigated the role of necroptosis in PSC and whether RIPK1 inhibition could modify disease course and progression. Spatial profiling of human PSC biopsies revealed that necroptosis primarily affects cholangiocytes, while apoptosis was more frequent in hepatocytes and nonbiliary cells. In vitro, necroptosis inhibition protected cholangiocytes, and RIPK1 deletion conferred resistance to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. In a murine model of PSC, pharmacological RIPK1 inhibition reduced cholestatic injury, hepatic inflammation, and biliary fibrosis. Multiomic analyses comprehensively demonstrated reprogramming toward wild-type–like profiles following treatment. These findings identify necroptosis as a critical effector in PSC and highlight RIPK1 inhibition as a promising disease-modifying approach, opening the door to targeted necroptosis-based therapies for this otherwise untreatable disease.",

The induction of auxin signaling by immune receptors for antiviral immunity is poorly understood despite its notable role in plant defense against viral pathogens. Here, we report that plant NLR Sw-5b initiates and amplifies auxin signaling through auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAAs)–ARF19 and YUC8–transport inhibitor response1/auxin-signaling F-box (TIR1/AFB) modules to promote callose-mediated antiviral defense. Upon recognizing viral effector, Sw-5b associates with and relieves repressors Aux/IAAs on transcription factor ARF19. ARF19 then activates callose synthase gene GSL5/8 to deposit callose at plasmodesmata, inhibiting viral cell-to-cell spread. Meanwhile, ARF19 activates auxin biosynthesis gene YUC8 to boost auxin production; this further amplifies callose deposition signaling via TIR1/AFB receptors and Aux/IAAs-ARF19–glucan synthase-like (GSL) module, thereby restricting the virus in localized cell death.

However, their practical applicability remains, in this context, constrained by the opacity of the learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of neurally driven dynamical systems are now scarce and restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce event transition tensors as a new tool containing high-order differential information that provides a rigorous mathematical description of NeuralODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterizing uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analyzing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method allows for the interpretability of NeuralODEs and their analytical verification by expressing their behavior through previously unknown explicit mathematical structures. The neural dynamics are thereby fully encapsulated within a set of compact, computationally efficient tensors, which retain all the necessary information for rigorous system analysis and certification. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.",

A proposed facilitator of apoptotic cell clearance is the fragmentation of these cells into apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) through cell-autonomous processes involving caspases and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Although this fragmentation process is considered a hallmark of apoptosis, its progression in tissue environments remains underexplored. Here, we examine the in vivo apoptotic dynamics of mouse thymocytes and pluripotent cells from zebrafish embryos. We show that the in vivo biogenesis of ApoBDs is independent of known cell-intrinsic regulators. Instead, fragmentation depends on actin-rich protrusions from neighboring resident phagocytes, which mechanically compress apoptotic cells to break them into smaller particles. Four-dimensional in vivo tracking of apoptotic cells reveals that both phagocyte-mediated fragmentation and phagocytosis are size sensitive, indicating that apoptotic size reduction mediated by phagocytes enhances their own clearance abilities. This non–cell-autonomous fragmentation ensures rapid apoptotic cell clearance, crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis in physiological settings.",

The aim of this study was to develop iPSC-derived “minimal injectable unit” chondrogenic micropellets (MIUChons) for delivery via intra-articular injections for OA therapy. To create transplantable allogeneic cartilage tissue, we optimized good manufacturing practice or clinical-grade production of iPSC-derived injectable chondrogenic spheroids and tested them in OA animal models. MIUChons were delivered to damaged cartilage through a single injection. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that MIUChon treatment effectively reduced cartilage degeneration and deterioration.

The proposed, yet unproven, mechanism underlying digoxin’s positive inotropic effect is as follows: By inhibiting the Na + -K + ATPase (NKA), digoxin partially dissipates the transmembrane Na + gradient, which is used by the Na + -Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX1) to extrude Ca 2+ from myocytes, thus causing accumulation of cytosolic Ca 2+ and therefore increased cardiac contractility. Here, we demonstrate that digoxin critically relies on a specific allosteric regulation of NCX1, known as Na + -dependent inactivation, to exert its positive inotropic effect, establishing the precise mechanism of action of this historic drug. These findings identify a distinct molecular target for the development of positive inotropes that avoid the undesirable effects associated with the blockade of NKA. As the structural information for the region involved with NCX1 Na + -dependent inhibition is well resolved, we provide the mechanistic foundation for drug development.",

Furthermore, heat stress induces the sequestration of TOR and its core complex components, RAPTOR1B and LST8, into SGs. TOR activity is rapidly suppressed by heat stress, independently of SG formation. In contrast, TOR reactivation following heat stress relief is dependent on the rate of SG disassembly, implicating SG recovery dynamics as a key regulator of TOR reactivation.

In contrast to magnetic or electrospinning techniques that are limited to specific material types, the GRADE approach supports composition-independent fluid manipulation of a diverse group of biomaterials and cross-linking methods, thus providing greater versatility and translational potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate stiffness-dependent mechanosensation in stem cells cultured on customized gradient substrates, which validates the platform’s usability. The experimental results show that GRADE has the ability to uncover mechanobiological responses in physiologically relevant contexts. All these results establish GRADE as a powerful and versatile platform for gradient biomaterial fabrication. It shows broad potential to advance both fundamental research and translational biomedical applications.",

          "abstract": "Synaptic adhesion molecules play a crucial role in shaping neural circuits and behavior, yet their contribution to nociceptive processing remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the synaptic organizer Neurexin regulates mechanical nociception in Drosophila larvae. Using genetic, behavioral, and circuit-level analyses, we demonstrate that loss of neurexin induces mechanical nociceptive sensitization, which depends on a specific cluster of central cholinergic neurons in the subesophageal zone. These neurons drive sensitization through a C4da-Goro circuit, where Neurexin modulates presynaptic GABA B receptor signaling to control nociceptive excitability. Our findings establish Neurexin as a key of nociceptive sensitization and uncover a synaptic mechanism for tuning nociceptive thresholds, with implications for understanding chronic pain and sensory circuit dysfunctions in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

We develop an integrated digital light processing and direct ink writing 3D printing technology to fabricate soft robots with embedded and conformal 3D electronics in an automated manner.

Here we report, both in theory and experiment, the concept of moiré plasmonic skyrmion clusters, where multiskyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster. By leveraging twistronics engineering of plasmonic nanostructures, we demonstrate both periodic and quasi-periodic optical skyrmions, revealing a large degree of topological control. In a misaligned composite nanostructure, the rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved, which is explained by a lattice model. This topological change of moiré plasmonic skyrmion clusters can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between composite nanostructures.",

We recreate vision evolution by coevolving eyes and behaviors in embodied agents and use this to illuminate principles shaping vision across different levels of the Marr’s hierarchy. This leads to three key findings: First, we provide computational evidence that task-specific selection drives bifurcation in eye evolution. Second, we reveal how optical innovations naturally emerge to resolve fundamental trade-offs between light collection and spatial precision. Third, we uncover scaling laws between visual acuity and neural processing that provide insights into long-standing hypothesis behind eye and brain size.

Here, we performed noncoding RNA profiling of human breast cancer–induced secondary lymphedema. We identified the long intergenic non–protein coding RNA, P53-induced transcript ( LINC-PINT ), as essential for the lymphedema development. LINC-PINT is the most expressed lncRNA in human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) under stress condition. Knocking down LINC-PINT in LECs promotes the expression of inflammation-related genes. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq revealed that LINC-PINT induces the transcription of genes involved in lymphangiogenesis and immune cell adhesion by increasing chromatin accessibility. Notably, LINC-PINT deficiency impairs LEC proliferation, migration, and sprouting. Conditional deletion of Lnc-Pint in mouse lymphatic endothelium (Lnc-Pint lecko ) leads to a reduction in dermal lymphatic network density. Lnc-Pint lecko mice exhibit decreased lymphedema, reduced dermal backflow, fibrosis, and inflammation. Our findings unveil a crucial molecular role of LINC-PINT in lymphatic function and hold substantial clinical implications for lncRNA as biomarker of lymphedema.",

Here, we present a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the T4 bacteriophage topoisomerase II with a transport-segment DNA bound directly to its central domain. The structure reveals conformational rearrangements in the central domain that accommodate the transport-segment DNA, suggesting an alternative sequence of events in which the enzyme sliding along the loosely bound religated gate segment may precede transport-segment passage through the coiled-coil gate.

Here, ex vivo profiling of metabolic dependence and capacity in peri-implant tissues revealed persistent glycolytic reliance by macrophages up to 6 weeks postimplantation. Expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) increased temporally and with proximity to the implant interface in glycolytically dependent cells, paired with increased capacity for biosynthetic pathways. Glycolytic dependence was notable in multinucleated macrophages, hallmark to the phagocytic behavior of implant pathology.

Estimated genomic changes in effective population size mirrored known whaling history and shifts in technology. In the Southern Ocean, a comparison of genomes from historical and contemporary populations indicated that the contemporary genomes have less diversity and an elevated realized mutation load for moderately deleterious mutations, likely due to the effects of whaling. Our results demonstrate that the relatively recent, brief, and marked depletion of humpback whale populations by whaling likely had subtle but discernible, negative, and lasting effects on the whales’ genomes. Thus, even as some humpback whale populations are now recovering to pre-exploitation numbers, they likely do so with a diminished adaptive capacity in the face of future conditions and threats.",

For all these applications, the TFTs must have a large on/off current ratio and a high transit frequency. A major challenge is to simultaneously maximize the on/off ratio and the transit frequency, because a high transit frequency requires a small channel length, which often leads to short-channel effects, including a large off-state drain current. Here, we lift this fundamental compromise and demonstrate organic TFTs that exhibit a complete absence of detrimental short-channel effects for channel lengths down to 300 nm, making it possible to simultaneously achieve the largest on/off current ratio (10 10 ) and the highest transit frequency (40 MHz) reported to date for flexible organic TFTs, despite the fact that these TFTs operate at very low voltages (≤3 V). These organic TFTs therefore meet the fundamental static and dynamic performance requirements for flexible, high-frequency, low-voltage, low-power electronic systems.",

Plasmonic structures can provide strong light confinement but suffer from ohmic losses. Recent advances in dielectric nanostructures enable strong light localization without metallic losses. However, previous studies primarily focused on minimizing the optical mode volume without adequately addressing light-matter interactions. Here, we demonstrate a nanolaser that colocalizes photons and excited carriers within a dielectric nanobridge. This extreme dielectric confinement of both light and matter yields a subdiffraction-limited mode volume and a subwavelength carrier volume without lateral quantum confinement. We observe a strong correlation between the mode field and carrier distribution, where enhanced mode localization produces stronger carrier confinement. By suppressing carrier surface recombination, this platform not only enables continuous-wave lasing at room temperature but also achieves a substantially reduced lasing threshold. We quantify the intensified interaction with an interaction volume, generalizing mode volume to a broad class of active media.",

Here, we present a regiospecific topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition for synthesizing crystalline covalent helical polymers via a single–crystal–to–single–crystal transformation. Building on our prior glycine-proline–based systems, we investigated the effect of subtle modification: introducing a hydroxyl group to the proline unit. This minor change induced a helicity reversal (left- to right-handed) and a substantial reduction in pitch (8.9 to 4.9 Å). Single-crystal x-ray diffraction revealed that this profound reordering is driven by intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (C─H⋯O and O─H⋯N), acting as supramolecular bridges between helices, enabling denser packing. Consequently, the glycine-hydroxyproline–based polymer exhibited markedly enhanced mechanics, with a Young’s modulus of 18.57 ± 2.01 GPa and hardness of 1.09 ± 0.13 GPa, surpassing natural collagen.

The role of aquatic factors (e.g., air bubbles) in the generation of MNPs is poorly understood. Here we show microbubbles that spontaneously form on seven typical plastics across a wide temperature range (25° to 95°C) and in various water types (deionized, tap, river, and marine water) can erode plastic surfaces and drive MNP release. Nucleation, expansion, and movement of microbubbles generate shear stresses capable of dislodging polymer protrusions at surface defect sites. This sweeping action, combined with the unbalanced surface tension forces at the three-phase contact line, generates O-shaped ring structures composed of accumulated polymers, which ultimately fragment leading to the release of MNPs into the aquatic environment.
