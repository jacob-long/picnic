          "authors": "Tom Bearpark, Ashwin Rode, Archana Patankar",
          "abstract": "Rainfall and flooding frequently disrupt the lives of urban residents worldwide, posing substantial public health risks1,2. Rapid urbanization is exposing larger and more vulnerable populations to flooding3, while climate change intensifies rainfall patterns4,5 and rising sea levels impair drainage systems6,7,8,9,10,11. Despite the growing recognition and urgency of these hazards, the health impacts of rainfall remain poorly understood, and those of sea-level rise are entirely unquantified. Here we estimate the mortality consequences of rainfall in one of the world’s largest cities—Mumbai, India. We integrate high-resolution data on rainfall, tides and mortality to analyse how unmanaged rainfall, and its interaction with tidal dynamics, contribute to urban health risks. We find that rainfall causes more than 8% of Mumbai’s deaths during the monsoon season, and that more than 80% of this burden is borne by slum residents. Children face the biggest increase in mortality risk from rainfall, and women face a greater risk than men. We also demonstrate that mortality risk from rainfall increases sharply during high tides and use this relationship to evaluate how rising sea levels could amplify rainfall-induced mortality in the absence of adaptation. Our findings reveal that the mortality impacts of rainfall are an order of magnitude larger than is documented by official statistics12,13, highlighting the urgent need for investment in improved drainage, sanitation and waste-management infrastructure.",

          "abstract": "Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their ultra-high power conversion efficiency (PCE)1-3. However, the mechanical stress generated during repeated environmental stress cycles remains a critical challenge for flexible perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, leading to interfacial delamination and device degradation. In this work, we propose a dual-buffer-layer strategy with a stress-release mechanism to synergistically mitigate ion bombardment during subsequent sputtering deposition and enhance interfacial adhesion while preserving efficient charge extraction. The loose SnOx buffer layer, engineered by adjusting the purging time of atomic layer deposition, can dissipate strain energy, whereas the compact SnOx layer can ensure robust electrical contact. Based on this dual-buffer-layer, the flexible tandem solar cell, constructed on a 60-micron thick ultra-thin silicon bottom cell, achieves a certified PCE of 33.4% on 1-cm2 area, and an certified PCE of 29.8% on wafer-sized area of 260-cm2 with a power-per-weight of up to 1.77 W/g. The modified tandem solar cells demonstrate good durability, retaining over 97% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after 43000 bending cycles under a maximum curvature radius of around 40 mm in air, and around 97% after thermal cycling testing (−40 °C to 85 °C) for 250 cycles.",

          "abstract": "The number of spatial omics technologies being developed is increasing1. However, a missing tool is one that can locate proteins in tissues in an untargeted manner at high spatial resolution and coverage. Here we present in situ imaging proteomics via expansion (iPEX), which integrates isotropic tissue magnification2 with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging. iPEX provides scalable spatial resolution down to the micrometre scale and substantially increases the sensitivity of protein identification by 10–100-fold. Using the retina as a model, iPEX enabled the construction of spatial proteomic maps with high precision, the visualization of single-cell layers and extrasomatic structures and the identification of colocalized proteins. iPEX was readily applied to diverse tissues, including brain, intestine, liver and organoids, detecting 600–1,500 proteins at 1–5-µm effective pixel size. The application of iPEX to depict spatial proteomic maps in brains of mice with 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease revealed an early-onset mitochondrial aberrancy. Notably, in young mice, the peroxisomal acetyl-CoA acyltransferase ACAA1A—of which the N392S mutant is a monogenic risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease3—was downregulated. ACAA1 depletion blocked the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid, in multiple cellular contexts. These lipidome alterations were restored in cells overexpressing wild-type ACAA1 but not ACAA1(N392S), which suggests that the dysregulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has an early role in neurodegeneration. Together, these results demonstrate that iPEX facilitates untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution for diverse applications.",

          "abstract": "Acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) sits at the nexus of nutrient metabolism and shuttles between the canonical and non-canonical tricarboxylic acid cycle1,2, which is dynamically regulated by nutritional status, such as fasting3. Here we find that mitophagy is triggered after a reduction in cytosolic AcCoA levels through short-term fasting and through inhibition of ATP-citrate lyase (encoded by ACLY), mitochondrial citrate/malate antiporter (encoded by SLC25A1) or acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (encoded by ACSS2), and the mitophagy can be counteracted by acetate supplementation. Notably, NOD-like receptor (NLR) family member X1 (NLRX1) mediates this effect. Disrupting NLRX1 abolishes cytosolic AcCoA reduction-induced mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, the mitochondria outer-membrane-localized NLRX1 directly binds to cytosolic AcCoA within a conserved pocket on its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Moreover, AcCoA binds to the LRR domain and enhances its interaction with the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain, which helps to maintain NLRX1 in an autoinhibited state and prevents the association between NLRX1 and light chain 3 (LC3). Furthermore, we find that the AcCoA–NLRX1 axis underlies the KRAS-inhibitor-induced mitophagy response and promotes drug resistance, providing a metabolic mechanism of KRAS inhibitor resistance. Thus, cytosolic AcCoA is a signalling metabolite that connects metabolism to mitophagy through its receptor NLRX1.",

          "authors": "Emily C. Geyman, David A. Paige, Michael P. Lamb",
          "abstract": "It has long been proposed1, and then observed2,3, that faster rates of soil production occur beneath thinner soils. It remains uncertain, however, whether soil thickness is the driving variable regulating production from the top-down2,3,4,5,6, or whether soil thickness is simply responding to changes in bedrock weathering controlled from the bottom-up7,8. Answering this question is difficult because the feedbacks between soil production and soil erosion, the processes that jointly govern soil thickness2,9,10, respond to perturbations on timescales of thousands to millions of years11,12, timescales that are too long for scientists to observe directly. Here we leverage a space-for-time substitution at a transient mountain range along the San Andreas Fault13,14,15, where the remarkable tectonic setting allows for independent quantification of uplift, soil production and erosion. We show that, following a pulse of tectonic uplift, the conversion of rock to soil accelerates before the overlying soils thin, but at the same time that topographic stresses increase7 and the rock weakens16. This observation challenges the long-standing assumption that soil production rates are controlled predominantly by soil thickness1,2, and instead lends evidence for a bottom-up, rock strength control on soil production.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional moiré materials are formed by artificially stacking atomically thin monolayers. Correlated and topological quantum phases can be engineered by precise choice of stacking geometry1,2,3. These designer electronic properties depend crucially on interlayer coupling and atomic registry4,5. An open question is how the atomic registry responds on ultrafast timescales to optical excitation and whether the moiré geometry can be dynamically reconfigured to tune emergent phenomena in real time. Here we show that femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist–untwist motion of the moiré superlattice in 2° and 57° twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers, resolved directly by ultrafast electron diffraction. On above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moiré superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, deviating markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating. Kinetic diffraction analysis, supported by simulations of the sample dynamics, indicates a peak-to-trough local twist angle modulation of 0.6°, correlated with a sub-THz frequency moiré phonon. This motion is driven by ultrafast charge transfer that transiently increases interlayer attraction. Our results could lead to ultrafast control of moiré periodic lattice distortions and, by extension, the local moiré potential that shapes excitons, polarons and correlation-driven behaviours.",

          "abstract": "Flexible solar cells have a transformative potential for niche applications, yet face fundamental challenges in simultaneously achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE), extreme mechanical resilience and operational stability1–4. Herein, we demonstrate a certified 33.6%-efficient flexible perovskite/crystalline silicon (c-Si) tandem solar cell with a record open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.015 V, rivaling its rigid counterpart. The flexible tandem retains 91% of its initial PCE after 5,000 cycles under a bending radius (Rb) of 17.6 mm, and demonstrates exceptional operational and damp-heat (DH) stability, featuring a T80 lifetime exceeding 2,000 hours under continuous illumination and retaining 90% of its initial PCE after 1,000 hours DH test. This advancement is enabled by implementation of the reactive-plasma-deposited (RPD) cerium and hydrogen co-doped indium oxide (ICO:H) recombination layer (RL) that promotes self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) coverage and interfacial charge transfer, and in-situ annealed zinc-doped indium oxide (IZO) front transparent electrode with significantly enhanced optoelectronic and mechanical properties.",

The molecular mechanisms that prevent regeneration of neurons in the CNS remain largely unknown1,2. Here, to address the intracellular response to injury, we developed an in situ cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy platform to mimic axonal damage and present the structural mechanism underlying thalamic axon regeneration induced by the drug epothilone B. We observed that stabilized microtubules extend beyond the injury site, generating membrane tension and driving membrane expansion. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals the in situ structure of microtubules at 3.19 Å resolution, which engage epothilone B within the microtubule lattice at the regenerating front. During repair, tubulin clusters are delivered and incorporated into polymerizing microtubules at the regenerating site. These microtubule shoots serve as scaffolds for various types of vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the supply of materials necessary for axon repair until membrane tension normalizes. We demonstrate the unexpected ability of neuronal cells to adjust to strain induced by epothilone B, which creates homeostatic imbalances and activates axons to regeneration mode.",

          "abstract": "Rare coding variants shape inter-individual differences in human phenotypes1. However, the contribution of rare non-coding variants to those differences remains poorly characterized. Here we analyse whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from 347,630 individuals with European ancestry in the UK Biobank2,3 to quantify the relative contribution of 40 million single-nucleotide and short indel variants (with a minor allele frequency (MAF) larger than 0.01%) to the heritability of 34 complex traits and diseases. On average across phenotypes, we find that WGS captures approximately 88% of the pedigree-based narrow sense heritability: that is, 20% from rare variants (MAF < 1%) and 68% from common variants (MAF ≥ 1%). We show that coding and non-coding genetic variants account for 21% and 79% of the rare-variant WGS-based heritability, respectively. We identified 15 traits with no significant difference between WGS-based and pedigree-based heritability estimates, suggesting their heritability is fully accounted for by WGS data. Finally, we performed genome-wide association analyses of all 34 phenotypes and, overall, identified 11,243 common-variant associations and 886 rare-variant associations. Altogether, our study provides high-precision estimates of rare-variant heritability, explains the heritability of many phenotypes and demonstrates for lipid traits that more than 25% of rare-variant heritability can be mapped to specific loci using fewer than 500,000 fully sequenced genomes.",

          "abstract": "Quantum error correction (QEC) [1,2] is essential for the realization of large-scale quantum computers [3,4]. However, due to the complexity of operating on the encoded ‘logical’ qubits [5,6], understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and combining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we utilize reconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement the key elements of a universal, fault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working mechanisms. We first employ surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors [6,7], demonstrating 2.14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by leveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding [8,9]. We then investigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery [10–12], and extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with 3D [[15,1,3]] codes [13,14], enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with polylogarithmic overhead [5,15]. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use [16], increasing experimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations [17–20] with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments reveal key principles for efficient architecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic & entropy removal, judiciously using physical entanglement in logic gates & magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations for universality & physical qubit reset. These results establish foundations for scalable, universal error-corrected processing and its practical implementation with neutral atom systems.",

Here, we designed mutations that improve the expression, thermostability, and immunogenicity of the prefusion MARV glycoprotein (GP) ectodomain trimer, which is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines in development3–8. We discovered a fully human, pan-marburgvirus monoclonal antibody, MARV16, that broadly neutralizes all MARV isolates as well as Ravn virus and Dehong virus with 40 to 100-fold increased potency relative to previously described antibodies9. Moreover, MARV16 provides therapeutic protection in guinea pigs challenged with MARV. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of MARV16-bound MARV GP showing that MARV16 recognizes a prefusion-specific epitope spanning GP1 and GP2, blocking receptor binding and preventing conformational changes required for viral entry. We further reveal the architecture of the MARV GP glycan cap, which shields the receptor binding site (RBS), underscoring architectural similarities with distantly related filovirus GPs. MARV16 and previously identified RBS-directed antibodies9–11 can bind MARV GP simultaneously. These antibody cocktails require multiple mutations to escape neutralization by both antibodies, paving the way for MARV therapeutics resilient to viral evolution.

          "abstract": "Chirality is central to life, and controlling the formation of one of a pair of mirror-image molecules (enantiomers) is a central tenet of synthetic chemistry. Although controlling stereogenic carbon1,2,3, silicon4,5, phosphorus6,7 and sulfur8,9 centres is commonplace, nitrogen centres in amines are not typically stable. Limited achievements in the enantioselective construction of nitrogen chirality have primarily been established in quaternary ammonium salts10,11,12 and bridged bicyclic amines13,14,15,16,17, which have a restricted pyramidal configuration. The asymmetric synthesis of non-bridged pyramidal nitrogen-chirogenic compounds suffers from a super-stoichiometric chiral source and exhibits poor stereoselectivity18,19,20,21,22,23,24. Here we present a catalytic enantioselective strategy for construction of acyclic nitrogen stereocentres via a chiral Brønsted acid-catalysed chlorination reaction. We designed a stereospecific intramolecular reaction to overcome the structural and configurational instabilities of nitrogen-chlorinated hydroxylamines. The resulting 2-alkoxy-1,2-oxazolidines showed good enantiopurities, and density functional theory calculations confirmed successful enantiocontrol of nitrogen chirality during the chlorination process. Furthermore, this strategy has been applied successfully to synthesize the enantioselective N-chloroaziridines with a configurationally stable nitrogen stereogenic centre. Control experiments provide evidence for an SN2 pathway for the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution event.",

          "abstract": "Despite the adoption of the Paris Agreement ten years ago, fossil CO2 emissions continue to rise, pushing atmospheric CO2 levels to 423 ppm in 2024 and driving human-induced warming to 1.36°C, within years of breaching the 1.5°C limit 1,2. Accurate reporting of anthropogenic and natural CO2 sources and sinks is a prerequisite to tracking the effectiveness of climate policy and detecting carbon sink responses to climate change. Yet notable mismatches between reported emissions and sinks have so far prevented confident interpretation of their trends and drivers 1. Here, we present and integrate recent advances in observations and process understanding to address some long-standing issues in the global carbon budget estimates. We show that the magnitude of the natural land sink is substantially smaller than previously estimated, while net emissions from anthropogenic land-use change are revised upwards 1. The ocean sink is 15% larger than the land sink, consistent with new evidence from oceanic and atmospheric observations 3,4. Climate change reduces the efficiency of the sinks, particularly on land, contributing 8.3 ± 1.4 ppm to the atmospheric CO2 increase since 1960. The combined effects of climate change and deforestation turn Southeast Asian and large parts of South American tropical forests from CO2 sinks to sources. This underscores the need to halt deforestation and limit warming to prevent further loss of carbon stored on land. Improved confidence in assessments of CO2 sources and sinks is fundamental for effective climate policy.",

Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during the formation of a weakly interacting Bose–Einstein condensate 3–18 . We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas 19,20 that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the interatomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, at which the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck’s constant and the particle mass, or, equivalently, by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium 21–34 , are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.",

          "abstract": "Gene flow between biological species is a common and often adaptive evolutionary phenomenon throughout the tree of life1,2,3,4. Given the pervasive nature of genetic exchange, a daunting challenge is how best to infer the correct relationships between species from the complex collection of histories arrayed across genomes5. The local rate of meiotic recombination influences the distribution of signatures of, and barriers to, gene flow during the early stages of speciation6. Still, a broader understanding of this relationship and its application to accurately discerning phylogeny is lacking due to a scarcity of recombination maps. Here we applied deep learning methods to genome alignments from 22 divergent placental mammal species to infer the evolution of the recombination landscape. We identified a large and evolutionarily conserved X-linked recombination desert constituting 30% of the chromosome. Recombination-aware phylogenomic analyses from 94 species revealed that the X-linked recombination desert is an ancient and recurrent barrier to gene flow and retains the species history when introgression dominates genome-wide ancestry. The functional basis for this supergene is manifold, enriched with genes that influence sex chromosome silencing and reproduction traits. Because the locus underpins reproductive isolation across ordinal lineages, it may represent a reliable marker for resolving challenging relationships across the mammalian phylogeny.",

In recent years, rapid progress has been made in rare disease diagnostics due to advances in next-generation sequencing, development of new computational and functional genomics approaches to prioritize genes and variants and increased global sharing of clinical and genetic data. However, more than half of individuals suspected to have a rare disease lack a genetic diagnosis. The Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases (GREGoR) Consortium was initiated to study thousands of challenging rare disease cases and families and apply, standardize and evaluate emerging genomics technologies and analytics to accelerate their adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, all data generated, currently representing over 7,500 individuals from over 3,000 families, are rapidly made available to researchers worldwide through the Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) to catalyse global efforts to develop approaches for genetic diagnoses in rare diseases. Most of these families have undergone previous clinical genetic testing but remained unsolved, with most being exome-negative. Here we describe the collaborative research framework, datasets and discoveries comprising GREGoR that will provide foundational resources and substrates for the future of rare disease genomics.",

          "abstract": "Crohn’s disease often presents with fistulae, abnormal tunnels that connect the intestine to the skin or other organs. Despite their profound effect on morbidity, the molecular basis of fistula formation remains unclear, largely owing to the challenge of capturing intact fistula tracts and their inherent heterogeneity 1–3 . Here we construct a subcellular-resolution spatial atlas of 68 intestinal fistulae spanning diverse anatomical locations. We describe fistula-associated epithelial, immune and stromal cell states, revealing abnormal zonation of growth factors and morphogens linked to establishment of tunnelling anatomy. We identify fistula-associated stromal (FAS) fibroblasts, which are assembled in concentric layers: a proliferative, lumen-adjacent zone beneath neutrophil and macrophage-rich granulation tissue, an active lesion core of FAS cells and a quiescent, pro-fibrotic outer zone. We examine the architecture of the extracellular matrix in the fistula tract and demonstrate that FAS populations associate with distinct collagen structures, exhibiting properties ranging from proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix remodelling to dense collagen deposition and fibrosis. We define niches supporting epithelialization of fistula tunnels and a FAS-like population that is detected at the base of ulcers in non-penetrating Crohn’s disease. Our study demonstrates that common molecular pathways and cellular niches underpin fistulae across intestinal locations, revealing the cellular protagonists of fistula establishment and persistence. This resource will inform the development of model systems and interventions to mitigate aberrant fibroblast activity while preserving their regenerative properties in Crohn’s disease.",

          "abstract": "Organ shortage remains a major challenge in transplantation, and gene-edited pig organs offer a promising solution1–3. Despite gene-editing, the immune reactions following xenotransplantation can still cause transplant failure4. To understand the immunological response of a pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation, we conducted large-scale multi-omics profiling of the xenograft and the host’s blood over a 61-day procedure in a brain-dead human (decedent) recipient. Blood plasmablasts, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells increased between postoperative day (POD)10 and 28, concordant with expansion of IgG/IgA B-cell clonotypes, and subsequent biopsy-confirmed antibody-mediated rejection (AbMR) at POD33. Human T-cell frequencies increased from POD21 and peaked between POD33-49 in the blood and xenograft, coinciding with T-cell receptor diversification, expansion of a restricted TRBV2/J1 clonotype and histological evidence of a combined AbMR and cell-mediated rejection at POD49. At POD33, the most abundant human immune population in the graft was CXCL9+ macrophages, aligning with IFN-γ-driven inflammation and a Type I immune response. In addition, we see evidence of interactions between activated pig-resident macrophages and infiltrating human immune cells. Xenograft tissue showed pro-fibrotic tubular and interstitial injury, marked by S100A65, SPP16 (Osteopontin), and COLEC117, at POD21–POD33. Proteomics profiling revealed human and pig complement activation, with decreased human component after AbMR therapy with complement inhibition. Collectively, these data delineate the molecular orchestration of human immune responses to a porcine kidney, revealing potential immunomodulatory targets for improving xenograft survival.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) in echocardiography has the potential to streamline manual tasks and improve reproducibility and precision2. However, most echocardiography AI models are single-view, single-task systems that do not synthesize complementary information from multiple views captured during a full exam3,4, and thus lead to limited performance and scope of applications. To address this problem, we introduce EchoPrime, a multi-view, view-informed, video-based vision-language foundation model trained on over 12 million video-report pairs. EchoPrime uses contrastive learning to train a unified embedding model for all standard views in a comprehensive echocardiogram study with representation of both rare and common diseases and diagnoses. EchoPrime then utilizes view-classification and a view-informed anatomic attention module to weight video-specific embeddings that accurately map the relationship between echocardiographic views and anatomical structures. With retrieval-augmented interpretation, EchoPrime integrates information from all echocardiogram videos in a comprehensive study and performs holistic clinical interpretation. In datasets from five international independent healthcare systems, EchoPrime achieves state-of-the art performance on 23 diverse benchmarks of cardiac form and function, surpassing the performance of both task-specific approaches and prior foundation models. Following rigorous clinical evaluation, EchoPrime can assist physicians in the automated preliminary assessment of comprehensive echocardiography.",

Here an analysis of 1,818 haemagglutinin sequences from wild birds, domestic birds and mammals reveals that the North American panzootic was driven by around nine introductions into the Atlantic and Pacific flyways, followed by rapid dissemination through wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, while non-canonical species acted as dead-end hosts. In contrast to the epizootic of 2015 (refs. 1,2 ), outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by around 46–113 independent introductions from wild birds that persisted for up to 6 months. Backyard birds were infected around 9 days earlier on average than commercial poultry, suggesting potential as early-warning signals for transmission upticks. We pinpoint wild birds as critical drivers of the epizootic, implying that enhanced surveillance in wild birds and strategies that reduce transmission at the wild–agriculture interface will be key for future tracking and outbreak prevention.",

However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do 3,4 , raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. We need to determine what is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-aligned behaviour. Here we highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions (for example, ref. 5 ), model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgements, then transfer human-aligned structure from its representations to refine the representations of pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models via fine-tuning. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a dataset of human judgements spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognitive judgements and more practically useful, paving the way towards more robust, interpretable and human-aligned artificial intelligence systems.",

Here we compare 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and their outgroups to reconstruct the protein-coding content of the ancestral genomes linked to 11 animal terrestrialization events, and to produce a timescale of terrestrialization. We uncover distinct patterns of gene gain and loss underlying each transition to land, but similar biological functions emerged recurrently pointing to specific adaptations as key to life on land. We show that semi-terrestrial species evolved convergent functional patterns, in contrast with fully terrestrial lineages that followed different paths to land. Our timeline supports three temporal windows of land colonization by animals during the last 487 million years, each associated with specific ecological contexts. Although each lineage exhibits distinct adaptations, there is strong evidence of convergent genome evolution across the animal kingdom suggesting that, in large part, adaptation to life on land is predictable, linking genes to ecosystems.",

CMEs play an important role in planetary atmospheric erosion, especially for planets that are close to their host star3,4,5. However, this conclusion remains controversial as there has not been an unambiguous detection of a CME from a star outside our Sun. Previous stellar CME studies have only inferred the presence of a CME through the detection of other types of stellar eruptive event6,7,8,9. A signature of a fast CME is a type II radio burst10,11, which is emitted from the shock wave produced as the CME travels through the stellar corona into interplanetary space. Here we report an analogue to a type II burst from the early M dwarf StKM 1-1262. The burst exhibits identical frequency, time and polarization properties to fundamental plasma emission from a solar type II burst. We demonstrate that the rate of these events with similar radio luminosity from M dwarfs is \\(0.8{4}_{-0.69}^{+1.94}\\times 1{0}^{-3}\\) per day per star. Our detection implies that we are no longer restricted to extrapolating the solar CME kinematics and rates to other stars, allowing us to establish observational limits on the impact of CMEs on exoplanets.",

Common genetic variants associated with the disorder have been identified 12,13 , but the role of rare variants in ADHD is mostly unknown. Here, by analysing rare coding variants in exome-sequencing data from 8,895 individuals with ADHD and 53,780 control individuals, we identify three genes ( MAP1A , ANO8 and ANK2 ; P &lt; 3.07 × 10 −6 ; odds ratios 5.55–15.13) that are implicated in ADHD. The protein–protein interaction networks of these three genes were enriched for rare-variant risk genes of other neurodevelopmental disorders, and for genes involved in cytoskeleton organization, synapse function and RNA processing. Top associated rare-variant risk genes showed increased expression across pre- and postnatal brain developmental stages and in several neuronal cell types, including GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-producing) and dopaminergic neurons. Deleterious variants were associated with lower socioeconomic status and lower levels of education in individuals with ADHD, and a decrease of 2.25 intelligence quotient (IQ) points per rare deleterious variant in a sample of adults with ADHD ( n = 962). Individuals with ADHD and intellectual disability showed an increased load of rare variants overall, whereas other psychiatric comorbidities had an increased load only for specific gene sets associated with those comorbidities. This suggests that psychiatric comorbidity in ADHD is driven mainly by rare variants in specific genes, rather than by a general increased load across constrained genes.",

          "abstract": "Necroptosis is a form of lytic cell death that is overactivated during infections and in inflammatory pathologies 1 . NINJ1 was recently found to be a mediator of plasma membrane rupture (PMR) during pyroptosis, toxin-induced necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis 2,3 , but the mediator of PMR during necroptotic cell death remained unknown. Here, using a CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide knockout approach, we identify SIGLEC12 as a key mediator of necroptosis downstream of MLKL at the PMR step. Cells with knockdown or knockout of SIGLEC12 are defective in necroptosis-induced PMR and demonstrate ballooning morphology. During necroptosis, SIGLEC12 undergoes dephosphorylation, interacts with MLKL, forms cytosolic puncta and assembles into fibrils. Notably, SIGLEC12 is cleaved by TMPRSS4 during necroptosis to produce a 20-kDa fragment highly homologous to NINJ1, and this cleavage event is required and sufficient to induce PMR during necroptosis. A SIGLEC12 variant associated with cancer (Ser458Phe) and a variant found in the general human population (Arg528Trp) attenuate SIGLEC12 cleavage by TMPRSS4. Knockout of Siglec12 in mouse cells does not affect PMR, suggesting a species-specific role. Our identification of SIGLEC12 as a mediator of PMR expands our understanding of how programmed necrosis is executed and offers new approaches for targeting this proinflammatory form of cell death in human diseases.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems capable of complex reasoning in vast domains, a task epitomized by mathematics with its boundless concepts and demand for rigorous proof. Recent AI systems, often reliant on human data, typically lack the formal verification necessary to guarantee correctness. By contrast, formal languages such as Lean1 offer an interactive environment that grounds reasoning, and reinforcement learning (RL) provides a mechanism for learning in such environments. We present AlphaProof, an AlphaZero-inspired2 agent that learns to find formal proofs through RL by training on millions of auto-formalized problems. For the most difficult problems, it uses Test-Time RL, a method of generating and learning from millions of related problem variants at inference time to enable deep, problem-specific adaptation. AlphaProof substantially improves state-of-the-art results on historical mathematics competition problems. At the 2024 IMO competition, our AI system, with AlphaProof as its core reasoning engine, solved three out of the five non-geometry problems, including the competition’s most difficult problem. Combined with AlphaGeometry 23, this performance, achieved with multi-day computation, resulted in reaching a score equivalent to that of a silver medallist, marking the first time an AI system achieved any medal-level performance. Our work demonstrates that learning at scale from grounded experience produces agents with complex mathematical reasoning strategies, paving the way for a reliable AI tool in complex mathematical problem-solving.",

Hemodynamic and electrolyte stability and dialysis independence were achieved. Post-operative day (POD) 10 biopsies revealed glomerular IgM and IgA deposition, activation of early complement components and mesangiolysis with stable renal function without proteinuria, a phenotype not seen in allotransplantation. On POD 33, an abrupt increase in serum creatinine was associated with antibody-mediated rejection and increased donor-specific IgG. Plasma exchange, C3/C3b inhibition and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG), completely reversed xenograft rejection. Pre-existing donor-reactive T cell clones expanded progressively in the circulation post-transplant, acquired an effector transcriptional profile and were detected in the POD 33 rejecting xenograft prior to rATG treatment. This study provides the first long-term physiologic, immunologic, and infectious disease monitoring of a pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant and indicates that pre-existing xenoreactive T cells and induced antibodies to unknown epitope(s) present a major challenge, despite significant immunosuppression. It also demonstrates that a minimally gene-edited pig kidney can support long-term life-sustaining physiologic functions in a human.",

          "abstract": "Tandem light-emitting diodes (LEDs), achieved by vertically stacking multiple units in series to combine the luminance of individual light-emitting elements, are effective for improving efficiency and lifespan compared to single-unit devices1–3. In particular, tandem perovskite LEDs benefit from the small Stokes shifts of perovskites4, which in principle can enable significant photon recycling between individual perovskite layers and enhance light extraction from trapped modes. However, a tandem structure that effectively merges the luminance of each perovskite units still remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate efficient and stable tandem LEDs by combining two solution-processed perovskite light-emitting units. This tandem structure effectively combines the original luminance of each light-emitting units; we argue that the emissions are also significantly enhanced through photon recycling between the individual light-emitting units. Consequently, we achieve tandem perovskite LEDs with a low turn-on voltage of 3.2 V, a high peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5% (even 20% higher than the sum of peak EQEs of single-unit devices), an average peak EQE of 40.9%, and a half-lifetime of 64 h at an initial radiance of 70 W Sr−1 m−2. These findings represent a significant advancement in achieving high-performance and multicolor LEDs through the stacking of perovskite LEDs.",

          "abstract": "Marine picocyanobacteria are abundant photosynthetic organisms of global importance. They coexist in the ocean with cyanophages—viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage’s benefit1,2,3,4,5. One such gene is nblA, which is present in multiple cyanophage families2,6,7,8. Under nutrient deprivation cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome9,10,11, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light-harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks11, serving as a survival mechanism12. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation6,8,13. However, the benefit of the virus-encoded NblA for cyanophages and the broader impact on the host are unclear. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for marine cyanophages14, we reveal that viral NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins, and reduces host photosynthetic light-harvesting efficiency. Metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and comprise 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of NblA to the cyanophage, while it exerts a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis. These findings suggest that cyanophage NblA has an adverse global impact on light harvesting by oceanic picocyanobacteria.",

          "abstract": "Florigen, encoded by FT genes, is synthesized in leaves and transported to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to induce flower development 1–3 . At the SAM, 14-3-3 proteins are proposed to act as receptors for FT protein and to mediate the indirect interaction between FT and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor FD to form the florigen activation complex (FAC) that activates transcription of flowering genes 4–6 . Here we demonstrate a different mechanism of FAC assembly, diverse functions for the 14-3-3 proteins within the complex, and an unexpected spatiotemporal distribution of the FAC. We show that FT is not recruited by 14-3-3 alone, but that it interacts with the DNA–FD–14-3-3 complex through two interfaces, one of which binds DNA via the unstructured C terminus of FT. We also find that interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the C terminus of phosphorylated FD reduces liquid phase condensation of the intrinsically disordered FD protein, allowing it to bind DNA, and that the 14-3-3 proteins strengthen DNA binding of FD by promoting dimerization, which ultimately results in the recruitment of FT. Unexpectedly, we also find that after FT movement to the shoot apex, FT and FD are co-transcribed in young floral primordia, forming a boundary with the suppressed bract and allowing formation of the FAC during the first stages of floral development. Our studies propose a new mechanism by which the florigen FT transcriptional complex is formed, and indicate distinct functions for the complex during SAM and floral primordium development.",

          "abstract": "The synthesis of enantiopure materials is vital for pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries owing to the inherently chiral nature of biological systems and the fact that two enantiomers can have markedly different biochemical properties1. In particular, enantioselective preparation of atropisomers is of great interest owing to their privileged status as chiral ligands and pharmacophores2,3,4. Although chromatographic- or crystallization-based methods are commonly used to separate atropisomers, we urgently need more efficient and economical approaches to access enantioenriched atropisomers5,6. The use of stereoconvergent methods to access molecules with point chirality is well established but we have not tapped the potential of stereoconvergent catalytic methods to arrive at enantioenriched atropisomers. Here we report deracemization activity of a P450 enzyme and explore its ability to deliver a stereoconvergent route towards enantioenriched atropisomers. Using a curated set of P450 variants, we found that a wide variety of symmetric and non-symmetrically substituted 2,2′-binaphthol (BINOL) building blocks can be deracemized to high enantiomeric purity. This deracemization activity is mechanistically distinct from the activity of previously reported P450 enzymes, which operate through enantioselective bond formation to afford enantioenriched atropisomers. By contrast, the deracemization process reported here is proposed to proceed through bond rotation. As engineered variants have complementary selectivity profiles and substrate scope, this biocatalytic platform should be readily tunable for any desired substitution pattern. We anticipate that these results will inspire new stereoconvergent approaches to synthesizing conformationally stable atropisomers.",

Baskow/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service via Getty\n\nScientists feel that the pressure to publish is rising, but that the time and resources they have to do the necessary research are falling, according to a survey of 3,200 researchers.\n\nThe results come from Elsevier’s 2025 Researcher of the Future report, which between August and September surveyed people from 113 countries, to assess how they view the evolving research landscape.\n\nAbout 68% of respondents said the pressure to publish their research is greater than it was two to three years ago, and only 45% agreed that they have sufficient time for research (see ‘Researchers are feeling the pressure’). Another concern is uncertainty over funding — just 33% of respondents expect funding in their field to grow in the next 2–3 years. And that proportion fell to just 11% in North America, reflecting unprecedented cuts to US research funding this year.\n\n“As a researcher based in Brazil, I strongly relate to the survey’s findings, particularly the growing pressure to publish despite limited time and resources,” says Claudia Suemoto, a gerontologist at the University of São Paulo Medical School. “The demand for productivity has indeed increased in recent years, yet opportunities for funding and access to qualified personnel remain constrained in Brazil and other low- and middle-income countries.”\n\nSource: Elsevier\n\nSuemoto says this imbalance of high demands and restricted resources often forces researchers to do more with less, which could affect the quality and innovation of research. Comments researchers made as part of the survey indicate that the lack of time is down to factors including growing administrative and teaching demands and trying to identity and acquire funding.\n\nAs a result, some researchers are surprised that the proportion of people who have enough time to do their work is so high. “I am amazed that 45% of scientists feel they have enough time for research. I do not know anyone who feels that way,” says Anastasia Borschevsky, an engineer at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.\n\nWhich researchers want to relocate?\n\nThe survey also reveals that nearly 30% of the respondents are considering moving to a different country in the next two years for the sake of their career.\n\n“Scientists are used to moving country because of the dynamics of the job market,” says Jacco van Loon, an astronomer at Keele University in the United Kingdom, but he says politics now has a strong influence, too.\n\nSome 40% of researchers in the United States are likely to consider relocating (up 16 percentage points from a similar survey by Elsevier in 2022), but just 13% of those in China are thinking about it, down 22 percentage points from 2022.\n\n75% of US scientists who answered Nature poll consider leaving\n\n“China has made it much more attractive for Chinese scientists to stay, whilst the government in the US has been unprecedently hostile towards scientists, especially on topics where the government has a diverging opinion and with regard to diversity and inclusion,” says van Loon. “So, I am not surprised by the statistics around desire to move country.”\n\nThe relatively high proportion of respondents in the United States considering a move reflects data from a Nature poll in March, which showed that 75% of 1,600 US scientists were considering a move overseas after the election of President Donald Trump, with many saying they were looking for jobs in Europe and Canada.",

          "abstract": "Studying age-related diseases gives researchers a better understanding of the risk factors that affect people in later life. By focusing on heart disease, Alzheimer’s and obesity — conditions that have major quality-of-life implications for ageing populations — these three early career researchers are bringing fresh perspectives to a fast-moving field.\n\nTHOMAS KARIKARI: Targeting tau\nThomas Karikari wants to develop more accessible blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease.Credit: Tom Altany/University of Pittsburgh\n\nTwo key hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease are tangles of tau proteins that form inside neurons and amyloid plaques that build up between the neurons. Brain scans and spinal taps are useful for detecting these abnormalities, but Thomas Karikari wants to give patients a less invasive option: a simple blood test.\n\n“We need to find the best ways of understanding and identifying individuals who may be at risk,” says Karikari, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. A blood test, he says, “can provide a snapshot of what’s happening in the brain, even up to 20 years before symptoms manifest”.\n\nEarly in Karikari’s career, the general consensus around blood-based tests was one of incredulity, he says. “Everyone just went: ‘No, no, no, we don’t talk about it because they’re too difficult to do’.” So, as a postdoctoral student at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, he set himself the challenge of designing a blood test that can detect a form of tau called p-tau181, which exists in high levels in the brains of people who have Alzheimer’s and accumulates as the disease progresses.\n\nNature Index 2025 Ageing\n\nAfter screening dozens of antibodies, Karikari and his collaborators had a lightbulb moment: the part of the tau protein that is commonly detected in blood is the left end section — not the middle part that spinal-fluid tests usually target. This insight helped them to design antibodies that could bind to the left portion of the tau protein in a blood sample. The discovery was like “cracking the code”, says Karikari, and the team went on to develop a blood test1 that detects p-tau181 with an accuracy of more than 82%.\n\nSince then, Karikari has developed numerous other blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease, including two that can detect p-tau217, another blood biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease2.\n\nAlzheimer’s blood tests have limitations, which has curbed their widespread use. For one thing, labs use different methods to measure the same protein, which means the results aren’t always consistent. And the fact that tau doesn’t just appear in the brain, but is also common in the liver, kidney, heart and other organs of a healthy person means “we might run into some false positivity” when it’s detected in the blood, says Karikari. One of the blood tests that his team has developed specifically targets brain-derived tau3.\n\nA key driver of Karikari’s work is making tests accessible enough to be used in places such as his home village of Manfo in Ghana. Blood tests are often difficult to use in remote and low-resource settings because the samples need refrigeration, and the analysis equipment requires trained staff to operate.\n\nKarikari’s lab has developed a pared-back method for detecting amyloid plaques that requires smaller blood samples than other tests4. His lab has also developed “remote-friendly tools”, such as a collection tube that can store blood at room temperature for up to 96 hours5. “I will feel most accomplished when all that we are doing gets to reach my village,” says Karikari. — Sandy Ong\n\nLAURA GRAY: Fighting fat\nLaura Gray believes body mass index is often not the best way to determine obesity.Credit: FilmFolk/Vivensa Foundation\n\nLaura Gray wants researchers and clinicians to stop using body mass index (BMI) exclusively to measure obesity rates, especially in older people. Beyond 60 years old, the average BMI — calculated as weight divided by height squared — across the population decreases, she says, which doesn’t accurately reflect what’s really going on with obesity rates.\n\n“It looks like they’re losing weight, but actually, it’s because they’ve often lost muscle instead of fat,” says Gray, an econometrician at the University of Sheffield, UK, who incorporates economics and statistics to map how trends in ageing and obesity interact across populations.\n\nBMI does not distinguish between muscle mass, fat mass and other factors such as bone density and water retention, which can lead to confusing results. For example, at their peak, American footballer Tom Brady would have been classified as overweight, and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as nearly overweight, due to their high muscle mass skewing their BMI.\n\nBMI is also an unreliable measure to use with children, says Gray, because of the way it fluctuates during growth spurts.\n\nWhen Gray and her colleagues tracked the BMIs and health conditions of people over 50 in England between 1998 and 2015, they found that declining BMIs were linked to higher rates of diabetes, asthma, arthritis and heart problems6. “We associate a decrease in BMI with positive health outcomes, but in older people, it might be the opposite,” she says.\n\nAs one of the most widely used metrics in public health, BMI would be difficult to replace entirely, says Gray. “It’s so ingrained in everything.” Instead, she recommends looking at BMI trends over time — rather than at single snapshots — to assess a person’s health risks.\n\nGray likes to use other metrics alongside the BMI, such as waist-to-height ratio, which directly reflects harmful belly fat at any age. When she and UK-based econometrician, Magdalena Breton, used both BMI and waist-to-height ratio to analyse the health data of more than 120,000 people in England, they found that waist-to-height ratio was better at showing how obesity risk increases with age, especially in older adults. The study7 is under peer review.\n\nOne trend that Gray is watching closely is the use of popular weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic. She suspects they will start to make a dent in obesity rates at a global population level, but worries that inequities will grow between people who can and can’t afford them. “There are just so many [obesity drugs] coming out, and they are so effective,” she says. “It’s come from a situation where there was just no treatment. It’s a massive switch.”\n\nObesity is a fascinating condition because of how tied it is to social changes over time, says Gray. “It’s really interesting how it affects so many people now, and 50 or 60 years ago, it wasn’t so much of a problem.” — Felicity Nelson",

          "authors": "Carsten Lund Pedersen",
          "abstract": "How’s this for an academic dream team? Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Richard Feynman. The three physicists and I often get together over coffee to chat about career decisions, difficulties and dilemmas. Of course, not the real Einstein, Bohr and Feynman — the last of the trio to die was Feynman, in 1988 — but rather, simulations of the three that I have assembled, using artificial intelligence (AI), to serve as my personal advisory board.\n\nAI is seemingly everywhere these days. It’s in productivity apps, web browsers and technical support lines. AI users increasingly report developing friendships, and even romantic relationships, with AI companions. I used the technology to develop an advisory board that can provide customized input into my career decisions and reflections. The resulting advice has been surprisingly useful — not to mention entertaining.\n\nMy board has provided advice on how to progress to my next career stage, how to contextualize my past and future work and how I might structure my next semester for maximum impact on my career. It also provided guidance when I received a job offer at a different university, helping me to see that accepting it might not be the best decision.\n\nAlthough some people in corporate settings have proposed using AI to build a personal board of directors, I think the term ‘advisory board’ is more fitting, because the AI panellists are only advisers — they should not make decisions for you, and they cannot own the consequences of their decisions.\n\nThe make-up of my advisory board often changes, and has included an eclectic mix. Besides Bohr, Feynman and Einstein, I’ve also tapped microbiologist Alexander Fleming, poet Piet Hein and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. Sometimes I include experts from my specific disciplines of AI and marketing; other times, I ‘invite’ artist Pablo Picasso or architect Bjarke Ingels for a completely different perspective. But whatever the board’s composition, I typically retain a core group of three seminal scientists.\n\nThe make-up of the board influences not just what I might be told, but also the mood in the room. Picasso might push for an intuitive representation or metaphor, whereas Bohr tends to insist on complementarity and paradoxes. Different ‘personalities’ might dominate depending on the question — but, unlike with human discussions, you can often prompt your way out of any issues. You can, for example, prompt the AI to synthesize the board’s answers into a single coherent piece of advice, or to fuel ‘constructive conflict’ between members. As a result, I sometimes find myself acting more as a moderator than a passive recipient of information.\n\nBuild-a-board workshop\n\nSo, how do you build your own AI-generated board?\n\nFirst, choose your favourite chatbot, such as ChatGPT (provided by OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic) or LeChat (Mistral AI). Choosing one that has some memory of your previous conversations can be helpful. My profile remembers that I’m an associate professor, as well as the specific challenges I face and my interests. As a result, I don’t have to start every conversation from scratch.\n\nNext, prompt the AI to act like an academic advisory board. Here’s a prompt I might use to initiate an AI brainstorming session:\n\n“Assemble an imaginary advisory board consisting of [INSERT PEOPLE HERE]. Have them discuss my current academic situation and give me contrasting, thought-provoking advice. End with a short synthesis that integrates their perspectives into one actionable insight.”\n\nOf course, this is only a starting point. The real value lies in continuing the conversation.\n\nCarsten Lund Pedersen.Credit: Carsten Lund Pedersen\n\nYou could also try presenting the board with a dilemma you’re facing and asking for input.\n\nFinally, experiment and tinker with the make-up of your board. Try including different personalities, such as talk-show host Oprah Winfrey or author Stephen King. The sheer diversity can often reveal surprising perspectives on the challenges you face. For instance, in response to the generic prompt above, ‘Nelson Mandela’ reminded me that institutions often follow people of integrity, so I should focus on lifting other people up and ask whose lives will be improved if I succeed in my academic career.\n\nDanger on board\n\nThere are, of course, pitfalls to consider when creating your own advisory board.\n\nFirst, never outsource your decision-making. Use the technology to ‘open up the problem’ to perspectives that differ from your own, and, through this, to aid your own decision-making on a career-related matter. Because an AI can never take responsibility for its decisions (and might not have all the relevant information), you must always make the final decision yourself.",

          "abstract": "The smouldering rubble after the World Trade Center collapsed on 11 September 2001. Credit: Porter Gifford/Corbis/Getty\n\nAfter interviewing health-care workers who had responded to the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 in New York City, Erin Smith, a disaster-response researcher at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Australia, noticed her behaviour changing. “I started having nightmares where it was me buried in the rubble and I would wake up gasping for breath,” says Smith. She became anxious about being in crowded spaces and had intrusive thoughts about the stories she had heard during her research.\n\nIt was only when she saw a psychiatrist that she realized these changes were signs of vicarious trauma — which can be experienced by individuals who are exposed to other people’s trauma through work, including conducting research.\n\nVicarious trauma is increasingly being recognized as an occupational risk for researchers, particularly among those whose work involves distressing material. Repeated exposure to traumatic material increases the risk of vicarious trauma, as does a lack of mental-health support and having a history of trauma. Graduate students and early-career researchers are particularly vulnerable, says Smith, because they often lack the support network at work or during their studies of senior academics.\n\nThere is evidence on how to reduce its effects. For instance, a study1 published last month found that having a designated person looking after researchers’ well-being and policies mandating breaks or time off were effective strategies.\n\nIn that vein, Smith is among those calling for workplaces to introduce policies that provide more emotional support and increase resilience for researchers. “Despite its significance, vicarious trauma in academia remains under-addressed,” she says.\n\nSetting boundaries\n\nAfter receiving a graphic image of a severed foot from one of his sources in Myanmar, Ronan Lee, a genocide researcher at Loughborough University London who studies the ongoing Rohingya massacre in Rakhine State, Myanmar, started looking for literature about the best practices for managing vicarious trauma. He’s learnt that having a routine and setting boundaries between work and everyday life are crucial for managing his risk of traumatization. He says he will do work involving potentially traumatic material for a set period of time, with breaks doing activities that are calming or bring him joy. “I’m notorious for looking at pictures of alpacas on Instagram,” he adds. Lee says setting boundaries around his work is particularly important because technology has made it harder for researchers to disconnect. “I get graphic images sent to me daily,” he adds.\n\nMillan AbiNader, a gender-based violence researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia also sets physical boundaries between work and the spaces where she can disconnect. She says her team does not do trauma-related work — such as interviewing people who have experienced abuse or reading homicide case files — from their bedrooms or living spaces at home. When she was a student and did not have a separate space at home, she would work in coffee shops or libraries instead. AbiNader says she experienced vicarious trauma from her previous work as a victim-services advocate for people experiencing sexual violence, family violence or trafficking.\n\nIn a 2023 study2, AbiNader and her colleagues found that ‘compartmentalizing’ work that involved traumatic material and processing it later helped to reduce its negative effects, as did having a computer designated for trauma-related work, and restricting such work to the same time each day.\n\nAbiNader says speaking with teammates about traumatic material and other types of social support can prevent trauma and promote resilience. Formal support, such as check-ins during team meetings, and informal bonding with colleagues outside work can also be beneficial. It’s normal for exposure to traumatic material to have an emotional impact, says AbiNader. “If you’re affected, it means your brain’s working, and it doesn’t mean that something’s wrong.”\n\nThere are also ways in which universities, research institutes and other workplaces can help researchers to reduce their risk of developing vicarious trauma, says Smith. “This includes offering training on emotional safety and trauma awareness, integrating researcher well-being into ethics review processes and providing access to supervision, peer support and mental-health resources,” she adds.",

          "abstract": "Kelley’s great-grandmama used to say there ain’t nothing a stack of hotcakes can’t fix. Slathered in butter and dripping with syrup, hotcakes are a hug for the human soul, a comfort so simple that it makes everything else simple, too.\n\nKelley found this adage proved true on more than one occasion during his tenure living aboard inter-planetary transport. He had been among the first to live full-time on the vast civilian ships, the first to create an on-board breakfast diner, the first to turn a sterile, lifeless barge into a thriving community that folks could call home. And all them firsts came over the top of a fluffy stack of hotcakes.\n\nSo, when the emergency alarms blared just as Kelley was opening up the diner for the day, he hesitated only a moment before firing up the griddle.\n\nThe all-ship loudspeaker crackled to life as Kelley tossed an apron over his shoulders and began rummaging in the cupboards.\n\nMain drive disabled. Concerning, but that’s what the back-up drives were for, Kelley reasoned. But maybe he should … Kelley dispelled that thought before it could form, shaking his head and grabbing the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Best not to do nothing before breakfast anyhow.\n\nCaught in a gravity well. Whelp, that explained the slight, swaying pull beneath his feet. Unfortunate, Kelley thought, whisking the batter hard, destroying any hidden lumps in record time. He slapped a pad of butter on the griddle, testing its heat. It bubbled and melted and was gone. Perfect.\n\nLimited escape pods … report to … immediately ... Kelley could no longer hear the announcer over the sudden thumps and thuds and metallics clangs, but he thought he could make a good guess what it said, what with the people now streaming into the halls, shouting and swearing. He thought some of them came into the diner, yelled something at him, and he called a general greeting over his shoulder, voice cracking almost as much as the loudspeaker.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“Food’ll be up in a jiffy!”\n\nThe all-ship message was playing on repeat now, and Kelley thought he should listen to it, he really should, but instead found himself leaning closer to the griddle. Hotcakes required a person’s full attention, no distractions allowed, big or small. Inattention, even for a second, led to burnt batter and disappointed customers. So, Kelley kept his eyes down and his ears tuned to the slight sizzle of the cakes. He’d just have to listen to the message later, that’s all.\n\nThe hotcakes were ready to flip just as the main power went out, everything flickering from bright fluorescent to dim, auxiliary blue in the space of a second. It was dark, but Kelley could still tell each cake was a perfect golden brown. Only a couple more minutes, Kelley thought. Then everything would be finished.\n\nHe turned to grab a plate and found a woman stumbling into the diner, staring listlessly at nothing. She seemed dazed, and when she sat down in the nearest booth, it was more as if her body had given up on standing than a deliberate act.\n\nCoffee, and lots of it, Kelley thought, turning on the machine.\n\n“They’re all gone,” the woman whispered.\n\n“Hm?” Kelley asked, pouring out a large cup.\n\n“The pods, they’re … gone.” She looked up at Kelley, eyes shining. “I — missed the last pod. And they all … they’re all …”\n\nShe inhaled sharply, breath hitching as she let it back out.\n\nKelley hastily scooped the hotcakes from the griddle, depositing them all onto a plate. Grabbing the coffee, he breezed around the counter to the booth, setting down plate and cup with an attention-grabbing thump.\n\n“Now, now. No point tryin’ to solve problems before breakfast. Eat up.”\n\nSuddenly, the ship lurched violently, spilling the coffee and almost sending the hotcakes flying. The lights went out completely, gravity dropping and coming back several times. Shrieks from beyond the halls could be heard. The all-ship loudspeaker bluntly told the populace to take shelter where they were.\n\n“We’re going to die!” the woman moaned. “I don’t want to die! I don’t — Mom! Mom!”\n\n“Hush now,” Kelley said gently. He took her shaking hand, placed a fork in it, and guided it down, helping her cut the stack of hotcakes.\n\n“I’m scared!” the woman cried.",

The website will make exceptions only for papers that have been previously accepted by a peer-reviewed venue, such as a journal or conference.\n\nThese types of article were never officially on arXiv’s list of ‘accepted content types’, but they had previously been allowed at moderator discretion, said a blogpost announcing the move on 31 October.

          "title": "Is ageing a disease? The debate that could reshape medicine",
          "authors": "Rachel Nuwer",
          "abstract": "Credit: Simon Prades\n\nThe study of ageing has shifted from a niche pursuit to a major area of research. Over the past two decades, scientists have flooded the field, determined to unlock the secret to a longer, healthier life. “Various people have started to think we could intervene in the ageing process and extend lifespan. [The field] has really exploded because of that view,” says Alan Cohen, a biologist at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nBut even as interest grows, scientists have yet to reach consensus on fundamental concepts in biological ageing, Cohen says. There is no widespread agreement on what ageing is or when it begins, or what the goal should be in investigating it. “There are people like me who think we can’t intervene — and even if we could, we shouldn’t — to people at the far end of the extreme who say we should make humans immortal and every moment we delay is equivalent to murder,” Cohen says. “Serious scientists are at every point along that spectrum.”\n\nNature Index 2025 Ageing\n\nA key contention is whether ageing should be considered a disease. As Richard Faragher, a biogerontologist at the University of Brighton, UK, puts it, if a disease is defined as something abnormal, then ageing does not count. But if a disease is defined as something that is preventable, treatable and able to be slowed down, then ageing is a disease.\n\nScientists, doctors and philosophers have pondered this question for centuries, but as more countries confront the realities of an ageing population, the debate has taken on new urgency, and it has the potential to influence everything from the direction of research to how older people are treated in society. “This is the early phase of an incredibly rapidly growing field,” says John Beard, an epidemiologist at Columbia University. “I think people are open to thinking about it in new ways, if a new way makes sense.”\n\nIs ageing a disease?\n\nThe concept of what is and isn’t a disease has changed over time. For example, before the 1960s, developing high blood pressure in older age was not considered a problem, says Faragher. “Now, we know that your blood pressure going through the roof is not benign.” Crucially, he adds, labelling high blood pressure, or hypertension, as a disease brought both funding and research attention to find treatments for it. “Things only start to get studied when they become problems.”\n\nSome people like to think of ageing as “a kind of optimal, almost benign decline” with certain diseases overlaid, says Faragher. But he and some other researchers argue that this oversimplifies things, that ageing and disease aren’t necessarily separate, and that treating them as such can hold back progress on understanding and managing the process. Ageing “is inseparable from pathology”, says Faragher. He points to senescent cells — damaged cells that behave in harmful ways and accumulate with age — which not only contribute to conditions such as heart disease, osteoporosis and cognitive impairment, but are also linked to hallmarks of ageing such as grey hair and wrinkles. In animal studies1, deleting these cells leads to “dramatic increases” in health and lifespan, Faragher says, which suggests that this aspect of ageing “is both treatable and reversible”.\n\nJames Pacala, an academic geriatrician at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, says that for some researchers, the ideal scenario in ageing science is to find “some common cellular and molecular denominator that leads to all of the declines we see with ageing”. Cohen says it’s unlikely, however, that a single cause could explain ageing, because millions of factors probably contribute to the body gradually losing its ability to stay organized and function properly. Faragher agrees that there probably isn’t one single mechanism of ageing, but that there is a small set of key mechanisms — such as a build-up of senescent cells — that act together as a loose network and cause many age-related diseases as well as ageing itself.\n\nIf ageing were to be categorized as a disease, it would probably cause the biggest ripples not in laboratories, but in the regulatory and funding support that those labs receive, says Ming Guo, director of the Aging Center at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. “It would be a paradigm shift,” she says.\n\nThis would be especially true in places such as the United States, where federal science agencies and drug-approval bodies tend to focus on diseases that produce clear, measurable results, such as improvements in symptoms. Declaring ageing a disease “would unleash a lot of research funding, facilitate drug development and ultimately lead to faster approval of the geroprotective therapies”, Guo says.\n\nFaragher agrees that the ‘disease’ label would expedite solutions. “I think the question is more along the lines of ‘Do you want to do something about these problems or not?’” he says. “If ageing is a disease, then you’ve decided it’s worth doing something about it.”\n\nThe case against\n\nSome scientists argue that the way ageing is discussed in research has major ethical implications. ‘Old age’ nearly became an official disease in 2022, when the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) — a global catalogue of known human diseases — sought to give it a diagnostic code in its latest revision2. Some doctors and scientists pushed back, however, which ultimately led the World Health Organization (WHO), the ICD’s publisher, to withdraw the listing. “The WHO retracted it based on the science — and on the unintended ethical, moral and social consequences,” says Kiran Rabheru, a geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Ottawa in Canada.\n\nFor one thing, calling ageing a disease could negatively change people’s view of their agency over the process, says Sundeep Khosla, an endocrinologist who studies ageing at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “From a patient’s perspective, it leads to a mindset of ‘Well, I need a drug to cure the disease’,” he says. “It perhaps shifts focus away from what should remain the major intervention: lifestyle.”\n\nAgeism is another concern. If ageing is classified as a disease, then anyone over 60 or 65 (or whatever cut-off was chosen) would be considered ‘diseased people’, Guo says. Half of the world’s population is already ageist, according to a 2021 WHO report on the issue of ageism3 (see ‘Ageism attitudes’) so categorizing older people as diseased would only add to that stigma, Rabheru says.\n\nSome researchers argue that it doesn’t make sense, biologically, to call ageing a disease. Because although ageing increases the risk of most chronic diseases, “you either have a disease or you don’t — and who doesn’t have ageing?” says Beard.\n\nThe tendency to think of ageing as a disease reflects what Beard describes as an “outdated way of thinking” — one that focuses too narrowly on individual problems and their specific biological causes. For example, the fact that the immune system naturally weakens with age doesn’t just impact the heart, as previously thought, but seems to increase arthritis4 and dementia5 risk, too. “We now understand from geoscience that age-related biological change simultaneously increases the risk of almost all chronic conditions,” says Beard.\n\nFuture outcomes\n\nFor some, the debate over whether ageing should be classified as a disease is growing tiresome. “At major international meetings, after people have a second beer, this topic comes up over and over and over again,” says Richard Miller, a biogerontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “I walk away from those discussions.”\n\nThere seems to be a strong cultural element to the debate, says Cohen, and points out that it’s mostly being carried out by researchers in North America and Europe. Joe Poh Sheng Yeong, director of immunopathology at Singapore General Hospital, agrees, noting that in Asia, many governments and societies are more focused on dealing with the real-world pressures of ageing populations rather than getting caught up in the semantics.\n\nBeard adds that the push to label ageing as a disease is likely to be strongest in countries where research funding is tied to disease-based categories, and where health-care systems pay doctors and hospitals for each test, procedure or treatment they perform. This creates more incentive to classify ageing as a medical problem, because it opens up more opportunities for billable services.\n\nKey dates in ageing research\n\n1903: The term ‘gerontology’ coined to describe the study of ageing\n\n1961: Cellular senescence discovered\n\n1974: US National Institute of Aging established\n\n1995: Senescent cells detected in human ageing skin\n\n2007: Geroscience introduced as an interdisciplinary science\n\n2013: Metformin found to expand lifespan of mice\n\n2013: Concept of epigenetic ‘clock’ linking DNA methylation to biological age proposed\n\n2016: Human metformin trial launched\n\n2021: The WHO releases global report on ageism\n\n2022: The WHO introduces ‘age-related’ code in International Classification of Diseases after withdrawing ‘old age’\n\n2025: Map of DNA methylation changes shows that some tissues age faster than others",

          "abstract": "NASA and other science-oriented federal agencies were closed for more than six weeks as lawmakers wrangled.Credit: Anda Chu/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News/Getty\n\nThe historic shutdown of the US government, which shuttered science agencies, halted grant operations and left tens of thousands of federal scientists without paychecks, ended on 12 November after lasting a record-breaking 43 days. A deal approved by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump funds most government agencies through to 30 January. Science advocates expressed hope that Congress will use the intervening time to finalize research budgets for the 2026 fiscal year — which could help to ward off massive cuts proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe shutdown began on 1 October due in part to a Congressional dispute over federal spending on health care. Most work ground to a halt, including activities related to the issuing of federal research grants. That work will now restart. Under the terms of the deal, federal scientists will be paid what they would have earned during the furlough, and those who were laid off will be rehired — at least for now.\n\nThe prospective ramp-up of activities after such a long hiatus has been welcomed by science-advocacy groups. Any interruption in science activities slows research and innovation that bolsters the US economy, national security and public health, says Joanne Carney, chief government-relations officer for the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC. “We’re in a global competition, and we cannot wait any longer.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nHere Nature looks at what comes next for science as the US government reopens for business.\n\nHow quickly will science agencies get back to work — especially on grant activity?\n\nDuring the shutdown, scientists whose activities were considered essential, such as the ‘hurricane hunters’ who collect data by flying into storms, kept working, though without pay. Other research activities also continued. NASA’s Mars rovers, for example, continued to operate through the shutdown, funded in advance by contracts run by non-federal workers who were not affected by the lapse in Congressional funding.\n\nBut activities deemed non-essential, such as review of research grant proposals, stopped. Now that the government has reopened, programme officers will reschedule such reviews.\n\nTrump moves to slash NSF: why are the proposed budget cuts so big?\n\nAt the US National Science Foundation (NSF), for example, more than 300 grant-review meetings will need to be rescheduled. Each grant-review panel consists of about six to ten researchers, so rescheduling all of the panels before the end of the year would be ‘miraculous’, says an NSF programme officer who requested anonymity out of concerns about retaliation for speaking without authorization. The delay in reviewing will almost certainly lead to a delay in getting grants out the door, they say. (After requesting comment from the NSF on 12 November, Nature received an automated response that the agency is not answering emails during the shutdown.)\n\nFederal workers “will do what it takes to keep things on track,” says Eleanor Dehoney, who heads policy and advocacy for Research!America, a science advocacy group in Arlington, Virginia. “The staff at science agencies, the rank and file, are complete workhorses.”\n\nWhat’s the funding outlook for science agencies in the 2026 fiscal year?\n\nIn the budget proposal it released in May for the 2026 fiscal year, which began 1 October, the Trump administration called for unprecedented cuts to US science agencies, including a 40% cut for the NIH. The budget for the NSF, one of the country’s main providers of grants for basic science, would be slashed by more than 50%, and NASA’s science budget would be cut nearly in half.\n\nBut draft legislation moving through Congress in the months before the shutdown rejected the president’s most drastic cuts. For example, lawmakers in the US House of Representatives proposed an 18% cut for NASA science, and lawmakers in the Senate called for no cut at all. The Senate sought an overall increase of more than 10% for research unrelated to defence, according to AAAS.\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\n\nThis week’s deal to end the shutdown finalized 2026 funding for the US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA). The agreement slashed support for climate programmes at the agriculture department but cut the FDA budget only 1% below the 2025 level. “Hopefully this is a good sign for science agencies”, Dehoney says.",

          "authors": "Jan Witkowski",
          "abstract": "Credit: J. Conrad Williams, Jr/Newsday via Getty\n\nJames D. Watson was one of the most influential — and controversial — scientists of the twentieth century. He helped to uncover the structure of the DNA double helix, wrote a textbook that transformed science education, and led institutions that shaped modern biology. Although his later years were marred by contentious remarks about race, his scientific legacy remains immense.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, in 1928, Watson grew up during the Great Depression and identified with the ideals of the New Deal Democrats, who thought that government power should be used to create a fairer, healthier society. A gifted student, he entered the University of Chicago at 15 and graduated in zoology four years later. Although keen on birdwatching and ornithology, reading What Is Life? by physicist Erwin Schrödinger convinced him that genes were the key to understanding life. So he pursued a PhD in genetics with Salvador Luria at Indiana University Bloomington, studying viruses that infect bacteria, and became fixated on finding the structure of DNA.\n\nDNA pioneer James Watson has died ― colleagues wrestle with his legacy\n\nAt 23, Watson joined the Medical Research Council’s molecular biology research group at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, UK. He shared an office with Francis Crick and there was an immediate synergy between them. They decided to build molecular models of DNA by combining X-ray crystallographic data with what was known of DNA’s chemistry.\n\nThe crystallographic data came from Rosalind Franklin, Ray Gosling and Maurice Wilkins at King’s College London. Before moving to Birkbeck College in London in 1953, Franklin had given her data — including Photograph 51, the X-ray diffraction image of DNA taken by her PhD student Gosling — to Wilkins, who then showed it to Watson. The image confirmed that the DNA molecule was helical. Working with cardboard cut-outs of the bases, Watson had the crucial insight that the molecule’s building blocks fitted together in specific pairs. This discovery, published in 1953, revealed how genetic information is copied and passed on — one of the most important insights in modern science. Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the work.\n\nWatson’s account of the discovery, The Double Helix (1968), broke all the conventions of the typically staid scientific autobiography. Written in the voice of the brash 25-year-old he was in 1953, and reflecting the attitudes of the time, it provoked accusations that his portrayal of people, especially Rosalind Franklin, was cruel. Despite this, the book became one of the most successful accounts of research, conveying the visceral thrill of scientific discovery.\n\nWhat Rosalind Franklin truly contributed to the discovery of DNA’s structure\n\nFollowing a fellowship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Watson moved in 1956 to the Department of Biology at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. There, his laboratory made major discoveries in protein synthesis, including sharing in the discovery of messenger RNA. His textbook Molecular Biology of the Gene (1965), which was based on his Harvard lectures, was revolutionary, changing the style of science texts and attracting generations of students to molecular biology. He considered this and his other writings to be among his greatest achievements.\n\nWatson first visited the Biological Laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, in 1948 and returned almost every year. He became a trustee and, in 1968, was asked to become director of what is now the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). In the same year, he married Elizabeth Lewis, a graduate of Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, whose own contributions to the lab cannot be overestimated. In his 26-year tenure, Watson transformed the CSHL into one of the world’s leading institutes, known for its education programmes as much as for its research. Watson’s great success as director came from identifying important problems, recruiting remarkably talented scientists and providing them with an environment in which to flourish.",

          "abstract": "Roughly 1.3 million international students and recent graduates enrolled in work training are in the United States for the 2025–26 academic year.Credit: Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe/Getty\n\nInternational students in the United States have defied predictions of a huge downturn in their population. Data for the current academic year show that the number of international students — including PhD candidates and newly minted PhDs — has remained essentially flat, year-on-year.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has shaken up the landscape of higher education, revoking student visas, cutting funds to institutions and implementing travel bans for selected countries. As a result, many higher-education researchers had expected significant numbers of overseas students to turn away from US academia.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nIn July, NAFSA: Association of International Educators, a non-profit organization in Washington DC, predicted that the number of overseas students in the United States would decline by 15% between the previous academic year and this one. And in October, The New York Times reported a 20% drop in the number of students arriving in the United States in August 2025 compared with August 2024, a finding based on data from the US Department of Commerce.\n\nBut data released by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for September and October show almost no change in the population of international students and recent graduates in the United States between this year and last — and specialists say these data are more reliable than others.\n\n“It doesn’t appear to be as catastrophic as had been originally feared,” says Chris Glass, a higher-education researcher at Boston College in Massachusetts.\n\nData points\n\nThe DHS statistics, which are part of a database called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), track international students enrolled in educational institutes and recent graduates gaining work experience in a programme called optional practical training (OPT). OPT is one of the largest foreign-talent pipelines to the United States, feeding thousands of people into Amazon, Google and other leading companies. It is key for people pursuing PhDs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) topics: between 2010 and 2022, 76% of recent graduates took part in it.\n\nAccording to the SEVIS data, roughly 1.3 million international students and OPT participants are in the United States for the 2025–26 academic year — about the same as the number for the 2024–25 academic year. The total number of doctoral students also remained nearly the same year-on-year (see ‘Surprising stability’).\n\nSource: SEVIS, NAFSA: Association of International Educators\n\nThe SEVIS data do not distinguish between recent graduates involved in OPT and students still enrolled in educational institutes. Glass says that, given recent trends, the number of OPT participants might have grown by about 15% between 2024 and 2025. If so, that would mean a “modest single-digit enrolment decline”, leading the total number of students and graduates to remain flat.\n\nWhat, then, might explain the 20% decline in student arrivals in August recorded by the commerce department? The August arrival data “aren’t all that great of a proxy” for the international-student population, says Violet Buxton-Walsh, an immigration researcher at the Institute for Progress, a non-profit think tank in Washington DC. Many international students could have heeded advice to stay in the United States between the end of the 2024–25 school year and the start of the 2025–26 year. If they did, they would not have been included in the August arrivals data, Buxton-Walsh says. Others might have arrived in September, rather than August, because of visa delays.\n\nThe relatively steady numbers might seem puzzling, given the headlines about the Trump administration’s anti-immigration actions. But “international students are incredibly resilient”, says Melissa Whatley, a higher-education researcher at the William & Mary School of Education in Williamsburg, Virginia. “They’re going to attend institutions and earn degrees under circumstances that we think might deter them.”\n\nDeterrence policy",

To pass the time, Jin looked out of the window.\n\nThe first thing that caught his eye was not anything outside the window, but his own reflection. The white hair, weathered by time, framed his face like a reminder etched in silver. It spoke, wordlessly, of his age — and the fear of death that had brought him here.\n\nSuspended above his head, the halo-like scanning ring evoked an old memory: the first time he got a perm as a teenager. Jin remembered the feeling of the heat coils, the nervous shuffling in the salon chair, the ring-shaped machine resting awkwardly on his scalp.\n\nHis best friend had walked with him out of the salon, grinning and teasing: “Look at us! Curly-haired punks now!”\n\nBut the laughter didn’t last. The war came, sudden and brutal. Both were conscripted, yet only one returned.\n\nThat faithful friend died still a boy.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nAs he lay dying, bloodied and fading, the boy grasped Jin’s hand with all his strength, murmuring, “Live well.

His mother quickly scooped him up, singing a lullaby that seemed to carry magic in its melody. The boy’s cries softened into giggles.

And then he wondered: had his father, behind the lens, looked at them with the same warmth as the man outside the window?\n\nHis mother had passed before uploading technology existed. For years after her death, his father clung to the old house, clung to the memories. Every time Jin visited, he would find him sitting by the window, turning the pages of dusty photo albums as if searching for something time had misplaced.\n\nBy the time his father’s own end approached, uploading had become seamless.

The organ survived for 61 days in the recipient, a 57-year-old brain-dead man in the United States, the longest a genetically modified pig organ has survived in a brain-dead person.\n\nIn two papers1,2 published in Nature today, researchers describe the main factors that cause the human immune system to reject transplanted organs. Researchers say the findings will improve outcomes for living people who receive organs from other people, or from animals.\n\n“In my mind, this is the first evidence of how to reverse rejection,” says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a clinician researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, who led the first pig-heart transplant into a living person in 2022.\n\nIn the past three years, around a dozen living people have received organs from genetically modified pigs, including hearts, kidneys, livers and a thymus. But most of these organs were eventually removed after losing function or no longer providing enough benefit to justify the immunosuppression treatment required. Other recipients died shortly after the transplant.\n\nAlong with the pig kidney, the male recipient also received the pig’s thymus, a small gland that taught the man’s immune system to recognize the pig’s cells as part of the body. The thymus probably played a big role in helping the pig organ survive for longer, says co-author of the studies, Robert Montgomery, a surgeon and researcher at the New York University Langone Transplant Institute in New York City. In past experiments with non-human primates, he says, the modified kidney survived better when transplanted with the thymus than without it.\n\nAvoiding rejection\n\nThe latest pig-organ transplant was performed on 14 July 2023 at New York University Langone in New York City. The kidney and thymus were taken from a pig supplied by Revivicor, a subsidiary of biotechnology firm United Therapeutics, based in Virginia. The pigs had a single genetic modification, removing gene GGAT1, to stop the production of a sugar called alpha-gal on cells. Alpha-gal has been found to cause organ rejection in transplant surgeries in non-human primates.\n\nImmediately after the transplant, the kidney appeared healthy and produced urine. But 33 days after the procedure, the kidney’s function suddenly declined, and a biopsy showed that the organ was being rejected and damaged by antibodies. The team replaced the person’s plasma and gave them steroids and a drug called pegcetacoplan, which stopped pig cells being tagged for destruction by the immune system. But on day 49, another biopsy showed a different type of rejection, in which inflammatory cells had infiltrated the kidney’s surface. This was treated with an immunosuppressant that destroys T cells and stopped the organ from being rejected. Kidney function was also fully restored. The research team chose to end the experiment at 61 days.\n\nImmune system investigation",

          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "A ‘black box’ warning has appeared on hormone replacement therapies in the United States for more than 20 years.Credit: Getty\n\nOn Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration announced its intention to eliminate safety warnings for hormone replacement therapy creams, pills and patches used to treat the symptoms of menopause. The move, which the FDA called “a historic action to restore gold-standard science to women’s health”, is drawing both praise and concern from scientists and advocates.\n\nMany argue that the warnings, which have appeared on the products for more than 20 years, have contributed to chronic underuse of menopausal hormone therapy among women who were likely to benefit. Yet some now worry that removing the labels entirely, or making overly broad claims about hormones, health and longevity, might swing the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. “I’m afraid comprehensive discussion about the risks and benefits may not occur in absence of that warning,” says Stephanie Faubion, the director of Mayo Clinic’s Center for Women’s Health in Jacksonville, Florida, and medical director of The Menopause Society a non-profit organization based in Pepper Pike, Ohio, that provides tools and resources to health-care professionals. “We need to end up somewhere in the middle.”\n\nHormone crash\n\nHormone therapy was widely prescribed for decades to ease common menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats and poor sleep. But prescriptions plunged worldwide in 2002 after an initial report from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) — a long-term US study — suggested that postmenopausal participants who were taking oestrogen and progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone) had slightly increased risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke1. The findings — widely misinterpreted and overgeneralized — sparked fear among women and clinicians.\n\nIn January 2003, the FDA announced that oestrogen-containing menopausal hormone therapy products would require a ‘black box’ safety warning, the agency’s strongest. Regulatory agencies around the world followed the FDA’s lead by changing labels and issuing advisories. Use of these products remained low even though later research hinted at reduced risks of heart disease and death among hormone-therapy users, and lower rates of breast cancer among those taking oestrogen-only therapy.\n\nHow menopause reshapes the brain\n\nA 2024 review reiterated that the hormone formulations, doses and delivery routes used in the WHI trials differed from those typically used today2. Transdermal patches don’t show the same links to blood clots found with oral hormones, for example. And using lower doses and hormones that are identical to those found in the body might further limit risks. Researchers have also noted that most participants included in the initial, concerning WHI analysis were a decade or more beyond menopause, a stage when the sudden return of oestrogen might pose health problems.\n\nBefore the WHI results were reported, about one-quarter of women over the age of 40 used systemic hormone therapy. Now, that figure is about 1.7%, according to data from the Mayo Clinic, says Faubion. “I don’t know what percentage should be getting the therapy, but I’d venture to say it is probably more than 1.7%,” she says. “On the other hand, I don’t think we should go back to thinking this is the be-all-end-all longevity drug.”\n\nThe balance of risks and benefits depends on a person’s age, years elapsed since menopause, whether the individual has a uterus, existing medical conditions and the therapy’s formulation, route of delivery and dose. “Hormone therapy is not for everyone,” says JoAnn Manson, a women’s health researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston and a former president of The Menopause Society. Generally, she says, women under the age of 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause who are experiencing symptoms might be good candidates.",

          "authors": "Mwila Mulubwa, Leon Mutesa, Kelly Chibale",
          "abstract": "After more than a decade of planning, the launch of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) is being celebrated in Mombasa, Kenya, this week at the Seventh Biennial Scientific Conference on Medical Products Regulation in Africa. The agency’s establishment marks a pivotal moment in Africa’s public health, at a time when the need for biomedical research conducted in Africa, focused on African health problems, has never been greater.\n\nAfrica holds higher levels of human genetic diversity than anywhere else on Earth, but this diversity has not been adequately studied. And many globally approved treatments and vaccines for diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are less effective, and can even be harmful in some people of African ancestry1,2.\n\nFailure is not an option for Africa’s newly launched medicines agency\n\nThis year, cuts of billions of US dollars in international funding for biomedical research and health services in Africa have left millions of people without access to life-saving treatments or, in the case of researchers and health-care workers, unemployed. This demonstrates the immense vulnerability that comes with relying on funding from external donors.\n\nWhat’s more, Africa’s phenomenal population growth and pace of urbanization is bringing fresh challenges — as well as opportunities — around health and disease. In Africa’s cities today, the inhabitants of increasingly affluent neighbourhoods are demanding high-quality medicines and health care. But in low-income areas, high population density, inadequate housing and poor sanitation are facilitating the spread of respiratory and diarrhoeal infections3. And everywhere, inadequate diets, air pollution, smoking and physical inactivity are driving increased rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer4. By 2100, Africa is expected to host 13 of the world’s 20 largest cities5, and such inequalities are likely to worsen.\n\nIn the context of all these challenges, the AMA is more than just another regulatory body. It represents a test of whether Africa can claim its rightful place in shaping the science that will help to determine the health of its growing population.\n\nIf the AMA ensures that preclinical models for drug testing reflect African biology, that African genomes are woven into drug discovery from the start, and that clinical trials conducted on the continent are rigorous, it will improve the health of billions of people of African ancestry. By helping to generate a more complete picture of human genetic diversity and the links between genetic variation, disease and treatments, it will also redefine standards around drug development and clinical trials globally.\n\nDrug discovery for Africa\n\nMultiple studies spanning three decades have shown that individuals from different regions and ethnic backgrounds respond to medicines differently6. But although Africa holds around 18% of the world’s population and accounts for 25% of the global disease burden7, the continent’s genetic diversity is rarely considered in preclinical or clinical research8.\n\nAfrica: tackle HIV and COVID-19 together\n\nAfrican biomedical data sets are hugely under-represented. Only 4% of the data in the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB), a public database that provides information on the links between genes, drugs and diseases, come from individuals of African ancestry, for instance.\n\nLikewise, to test drugs, researchers globally are increasingly relying on in vitro models developed from human cells or tissues. These include 3D cell cultures called organoids that mimic the structure and function of specific organs or tissues, and liver microsomes, which are collections of subcellular fragments derived from liver cells. But most of these tools have been derived from samples obtained from individuals of European ancestry9.\n\nAnd when it comes to clinical trials, under 3% of them are conducted in Africa (see ‘Poorly represented’). A study published last year found that, between 2015 and 2023, out of tens of thousands of phase I trials (which assess the safety, side effects and optimal dosing regimen of treatments) conducted around the world, only 17 were conducted in Kenya, only 12 in Nigeria and only 3 in Ethiopia10, despite these countries being among the leaders in clinical research in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSource: WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform\n\nThe result of all of this is the development of treatments that are ineffective or even detrimental for certain African populations. A compound called efavirenz, for example, was the key ingredient of first-line antiretroviral treatment in Africa and around the world until 201811. But Zimbabwean people with HIV who harbour certain genetic polymorphisms in CYP2B6, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing efavirenz, experience numbness in their feet and other symptoms of neurotoxicity when taking the drug12.\n\nWhat’s more, diseases that disproportionately affect African populations, such as sickle-cell disease — which affects roughly 1 in 100 people living in West Africa, compared with 1 in 15,000 people living in Western Europe13 — have tended to be neglected.\n\nBoth sickle-cell disease and Parkinson’s disease contribute to about the same number of deaths globally each year, but whereas nearly 50,000 studies on Parkinson’s disease have been published in the past five years (according to a PubMed search), only around 7,800 studies on sickle-cell disease were published in the same period. (Deaths from Parkinson’s disease occur mainly in Asia, Europe and North America.)\n\nCould Africa be the future for genomics research?\n\nTo ensure that African genomic diversity — and African needs — are better embedded into all stages of drug discovery and development, the AMA must ensure that African pharmacogenomic data (genetic information that signals how individuals will respond to medications) are integrated into drug discovery. It must mandate or incentivize the use of in vitro models derived from cells or tissues obtained from individuals of African ancestry9,14. And it must incentivize drug developers to focus on interventions for diseases that disproportionately affect African populations.\n\nTo do this, the AMA should require that applicants for regulatory approval demonstrate how they have considered genetic variability relevant to African populations in preclinical and clinical trials. Variants in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene family can affect the metabolism of drugs and toxins, for instance; variants in transporter proteins can influence how drugs are absorbed by, distributed in and eliminated from the body; and some variants of some genes, such as APOL1, increase people’s risk of developing a disease. (The APOL1 variants G1 and G2 are more common in individuals of African ancestry and a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease.)\n\nThe AMA should require that investigators use models derived from cells or tissues from individuals of African ancestry in all toxicity, efficacy, drug-metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies (which examine what the body does to drugs over time) submitted to it for approval. Or, to incentivize those applying for regulatory approval to take their treatment to the next phase of testing, the agency should offer expedited review pathways or reduced application fees when preclinical studies use ‘Africa-relevant’ tools.\n\nAn educator gives a talk on reproductive health in Harare, Zimbabwe.Credit: Jekesai Njikizana/AFP via Getty\n\nIn collaboration with African research institutions and global consortia, such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public–private partnership involving the European Union and European life-science industries, the AMA should promote the creation of continent-wide pharmacogenomic databases.\n\nThrough partnering with African academic institutions, such as the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development Centre at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, and global funders, such as the Gates Foundation, the agency can help to drive the development of biobanks across Africa — facilities that collect, store and manage human biological samples. This would give more researchers across the continent access to Africa-relevant preclinical tools.\n\nUltimately, pharmaceutical companies, both in Africa and worldwide, could use these data and resources, in conjunction with artificial intelligence and other computational tools, to make predictions about how certain compounds will affect a given population. In fact, to encourage multinational drug developers to use such data sets and biorepositories, the AMA could help to ensure that open-access African data sets are interoperable with other platforms used in drug development, such as PharmGKB.\n\nHarmonizing regulation\n\nAlongside these steps to make biomedical research and drug discovery more relevant to African populations, the AMA needs to make it much easier for drug developers to conduct clinical trials on the continent.\n\nCurrently, drug developers wanting to work in Africa are hampered by insufficient or inadequate laboratories and infrastructure, a shortage of trained scientists who can run clinical trials, a lack of experts in research ethics and regulation, and variability in countries’ laws and standards around the handling of biological samples.\n\nThe AMA can help to increase the number of phase I trials being conducted in Africa by fostering partnerships between Africa-based research institutions, such as the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi, and international funders. It could also work with some of Africa’s continent-wide organizations, such as the International Vaccine Institute’s Africa Regional Office, which was established last year in Kigali, Rwanda, to boost research and development (R&D) of vaccines on the continent.\n\nTo ensure that efforts in different countries are coordinated, the agency must help to develop a central database for clinical trials conducted in Africa, perhaps building on the work of the Clinical Trials Community Africa Network. This group of African research-ethics bodies, research institutions and pharmaceutical companies is coordinating a network of clinical trial sites and laboratories to harmonize clinical trials conducted in Africa.\n\nAfrica’s rapid population growth is posing fresh health challenges.Credit: Olasunkanmi Ariyo/Getty\n\nAs a central, umbrella organization, the AMA should coordinate the reviews of applications for clinical trials and thereby facilitate the design of large-scale, multicountry phase II studies, which assess the efficacy and safety of treatments. Such studies, when conducted independently in any one country, often lack the sample sizes needed to reveal clinically meaningful differences in how genetic subpopulations differ in their response to a treatment.\n\nBy harmonizing the regulatory environment across the continent, the AMA can help to facilitate phase III clinical trials (which aim to provide evidence of therapeutic efficacy and safety in thousands of patients in multiple countries), phase IV studies (evaluations of treatments in real-world settings), and the monitoring of fake medicines, too.\n\nFive traps to avoid\n\nTo promote a healthy ecosystem for biomedical research and drug and vaccine development in Africa, the AMA must beware some of the pitfalls that have hampered efforts of other continent-wide health initiatives, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in its early years.",

Both types of molecule are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and levels of both fell by roughly 50% in people who were treated with the highest dose of the therapy1.\n\nCRISPR genome-editing grows up: advanced therapies head for the clinic\n\nSo far, only 15 people have received the treatment. But, if all goes well in future studies, investigators hope that gene editing might one day liberate many thousands of people from daily regimens of cholesterol-lowering medication.\n\n“What a revolution to be able to do that,” says Luke Laffin, a specialist in preventative cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and a lead investigator on the trial. “Conceptually, it’s a great idea: we can move from chronic therapy to something that’s one-and-done.”\n\nThat revolution will take years: considerably more safety testing would be needed to make the concept a reality, he adds. And there are questions about how much such a treatment would cost, and whether consumers would be willing to embrace it. But the trial results — published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 8 November — are the latest to show promise in harnessing gene-editing techniques to tackle some of the most common diseases.\n\nDecade-long dream\n\n“The dream scenario for me is getting these gene-editing therapies broadly applied,” says Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “These things are coming.”\n\nA little over a decade ago, Musunuru wondered if CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing, then a new technology, could be harnessed to prevent or treat the world’s leading killer: cardiovascular disease. He pitched the idea to a few venture capitalists. “No one was interested at all,” he says. Instead, they wanted to focus on rare genetic disorders.\n\nHope for diabetes: CRISPR-edited cells pump out insulin in a person – and evade immune detection\n\nNow, Musunuru says he knows of about a dozen companies that intend to use gene editing to tackle high cholesterol. Other cardiovascular projects include treatments for a rarer condition called transthyretin amyloidosis, which can lead to heart failure. Biotechnology company CRISPR Therapeutics in Zug, Switzerland — the sponsor of the current cholesterol trial — has begun work on a gene-editing therapy to treat high blood pressure. “It’s fertile ground,” says Musunuru, who is himself a co-founder of a company that’s pursuing similar treatments.\n\nBut shifting from rare diseases to more common ones will require big safety studies that are capable of detecting unusual side effects, and CRISPR-based therapies have been used in only a few hundred people so far.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Keystone Press/Alamy\n\nHamilton (Ham) Smith co-discovered type II restriction enzymes, molecular scissors that cut DNA at precise sequence sites, which proved to be an essential tool for the emerging field of molecular biology. For this work he shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Werner Arber and Daniel Nathans. Smith began a second career in 1993, when he agreed to collaborate with me on sequencing the genome of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. On its publication in 1995, it was the first complete genome of any organism.\n\nThat fortunate collaboration led to the first draft human genome sequence in 2001, and then to the first cell made from a synthetic genome in 2010. Smith was a scientist’s scientist, working in the laboratory almost every day and quietly being an inspiration, friend and a collaborator to all his colleagues.\n\nA wealth of discovery built on the Human Genome Project — by the numbers\n\nBorn in New York City, Smith grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, where his father was a college professor. Smith discovered biology while studying mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and went on to receive his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1956. Following his military service in the US Navy, and a medical residency at Henry Ford hospital in Detroit, Michigan, in 1962, Smith received a fellowship from the US National Institutes of Health to work with Myron Levine — a pioneer in infectious-disease research — at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Studying the bacteriophage P22, a virus that infects the bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium, he mastered DNA isolation techniques that became an essential component of all his main contributions to science.\n\nIn 1967, Smith joined the microbiology department at Johns Hopkins. Beginning work on H. influenzae, he discovered a restriction enzyme by studying changes in DNA viscosity. He used several clever techniques to prove that the enzyme recognized a unique DNA sequence, long before the advent of DNA sequencing, and published two key papers in the Journal of Molecular Biology in 1970 (H. O. Smith and K. W. Wilcox J. Mol. Biol. 51, 379–391 (1970); T. J. Kelly Jr and H. O. Smith J. Mol. Biol. 51, 393–409; 1970). His parents were driving to the grocery shop on 12 October 1978 when the news came over their car radio that Hamilton Smith at Johns Hopkins had won the Nobel prize. His mother told him that she looked at his father and said, “Do you suppose there is another Hamilton Smith at Hopkins?”\n\nIn 1993, Smith and I met at a conference in Bilbao, Spain. I had founded the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) in Rockville, Maryland, the year before and Smith agreed to join the science advisory board. At his suggestion, we decided to collaborate on sequencing the genome of H. influenzae using my idea of whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The method is dependent on achieving a perfect statistical Poisson distribution of the DNA fragments that cover the genome in a genomic sequencing library, and Smith developed techniques to achieve this. We sequenced 25,000 fragments and mathematically assembled them into the complete circular genome. After this, Smith joined TIGR and its successor firm, the J. Craig Venter Institute, where he stayed for the remaining 25 years of his career. We went on to collaborate on dozens of other genomes, including the Neisseria meningitidis genome that led to the development of the first meningococcal B vaccine that has saved thousands of lives.",

          "title": "How much protein do you really need? What the science says",
          "authors": "Mariana Lenharo",
          "abstract": "Snack bars, yogurts, ice cream, even bottled water: it seems like food makers have worked out ways to slip extra protein into just about anything as they seek to capitalize on a growing consumer trend.\n\nToday, protein-fortified foods and protein supplements form a market worth tens of billions of US dollars, with fitness influencers, as well as some researchers and physicians, promoting high-protein diets as the secret to strength and longevity. Protein is undeniably essential, but how much people really need is still a topic of debate.\n\nWhat humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet\n\nOn the one hand, most official guidelines recommend a minimum of close to one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, or the equivalent of about 250 grams of cooked chicken (which contains around 68 g of protein) for an adult weighing 70 kilograms. On the other hand, a growing narrative in wellness circles encourages people to eat more than double that amount. Many scientists fall somewhere in the middle and take issue with some of the advice circulating online.\n\n“It’s really frustrating because there isn’t evidence to support the claims that they’re making,” says Katherine Black, an exercise nutritionist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, referring to the super-high protein recommendations often shared on social media. What research does show is that protein needs can vary from person to person and can change throughout a lifetime. And people should think carefully about what they eat to meet those needs. “On social media, it’s like everyone’s worried about protein, putting protein powder into everything,” she says.\n\nHealth authorities can help to guide people’s dietary choices on the basis of the latest research. The next Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a document that advises on what to eat for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, is due to come out by the end of this year. But its recommendations, which have tended to be broadly influential, might be changing.\n\nCalculating protein needs\n\nResearchers have been trying to estimate how much protein people need for more than a century. In 1840, chemist Justus von Liebig estimated that the average adult required 120 grams of protein a day, on the basis of a group of German workers’ diets. Later, scientists started to use nitrogen to calculate protein requirements. Protein is the only major dietary component that contains nitrogen. So, by measuring how much of it people consume and the amount they excrete, researchers could estimate how much the body uses.\n\nSince the 1940s, this nitrogen-balance method has been used to determine the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), a set of nutrient recommendations developed by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\n\nAre ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says\n\nThe latest such recommendation for protein, from 2005, establishes the RDA for both men and women at 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, which it states should be enough to meet the needs of 97–98% of healthy people. European and global-health authorities recommend similar or slightly higher levels.\n\nAlthough scientists recognize that RDAs are a useful reference point, many say that people could benefit from a higher amount. “The RDA is not a target; it’s simply the minimum that appears to prevent any detectable deficiency,” says Donald Layman, a researcher focusing on protein requirements at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. Evidence suggests1 that the optimal range is between 1.2 and 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, he says.\n\nThat is especially true for older adults, who often experience muscle loss as they age, as well as for certain athletes and people trying to gain muscle.\n\nFor example, in an observational study of 2,066 adults aged 70–79, those who reported eating the most protein — about 1.1 gram per kilogram of bodyweight — lost 40% less lean mass during the three years of follow-up than did those who ate the least — around 0.7 grams per kilogram2.\n\n“For older adults, 1.2 grams per kilogram is just giving them a little extra protection,” says Nicholas Burd, a nutrition and exercise researcher also at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. Furthermore, older people might experience a decline in appetite, which makes it particularly important for them to pay attention to their protein intake. It doesn’t mean that they need to take protein supplements, he says. “It’s all things we can do with just normal incorporation of high-protein foods in our lives.”\n\nFasting for weight loss is all the rage: what are the health benefits?\n\nFor healthy adults, increasing protein can boost the effects of resistance exercise, such as weightlifting. A 2017 systematic review found that, among people engaged in this type of training, taking protein supplements enhanced muscle gain and strength3. But increasing protein beyond 1.6 grams per kilogram per day provided no further benefit.\n\nMeanwhile, some fitness influencers swear by eating 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight. For most people, that’s simply overkill, says Burd. There’s little harm, other than for people with kidney disease, but Burd adds: “You just create an inefficient system where your body gets very good at wasting food protein.”\n\nSome practitioners might recommend higher protein targets to ensure that people get enough, Burd says. But the protein craze has been driven mostly by aggressive marketing of high-protein foods and supplements, he says.\n\n“The myth of increased protein needs has seeped into popular imagination, including among health professionals, and has been conveniently reinforced by the food industry,” says Fernanda Marrocos, a researcher specializing in nutrition and food policy at the University of São Paulo in Brazil.\n\nAmino-acid goals",

The technology could allow doctors to administer small amounts of drugs to specific sites, avoiding the toxic side effects of body-wide therapies.\n\nThe microrobots — guided by magnetic fields — work in blood vessels in pigs and sheep, researchers showed in a paper published in Science on 13 November1.\n\nThe system has yet to be trialled in people, but it shows promise because it works in a roughly human-sized body, and because all its components have already been shown to be biocompatible, says Bradley Nelson, a mechanical engineer at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, who co-led the work.\n\nAround one-third of developed drugs that fail to come to market do so because they’re too toxic2, says Nelson. The team says the microrobots would allow smaller amounts of drugs to be given directly to the affected areas, thereby reducing potential side effects. The technique could be used to target stroke-causing blockages or brain tumours.\n\n“The demonstrations are compelling but still preclinical,” says Wei Gao, a medical engineer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, whose team has developed an alternative robotic drug-delivery system.

They used X-ray images to observe and manoeuvre the bots in real time with millimetre-precision. In trials in pigs, the team showed that in more than 95% of cases, the drugs were delivered to the correct location.",

          "title": "How genetically encoded sensors have lit up neuroscience",
          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "In the nervous system, synapses are where the action is. There, across a narrow gap between adjacent cells, neurons talk to one another through the dynamic exchange of chemical and electrical signals. Molecules known as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators induce or inhibit action potentials — spikes in voltage across neuronal cell membranes that trigger the release of other molecules. This cross-talk ultimately enables the production of emotions, thoughts, behaviours — everything that makes the brain what it is.\n\nA new way to capture the brain’s electrical symphony\n\nTo decode these conversations, researchers have relied on various tools. These include electrophysiology, in which electrodes are inserted into the brain or individual cells (in the case of patch-clamp recording) to measure the voltage changes linked to action potentials; microdialysis, in which some of the fluid surrounding neurons is extracted and analysed; and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, which uses implanted electrodes to detect certain signalling molecules.\n\nBut these methods have limitations. For instance, electrophysiology can precisely measure action potentials, but scientists can’t pinpoint the exact neurotransmitters or neuromodulators (collectively called neurochemicals) that drive them. Microdialysis can identify specific molecules, but it lacks the spatial and temporal resolution to pinpoint exactly when and where these neurochemicals are released, and voltammetry often struggles to distinguish molecules that are similar to each other.\n\nThe development of genetically encoded sensors over the past two decades has offered a way for neuroscientists to circumvent these issues. Such sensors were initially developed to identify action potentials in cells by tracking changes in calcium ions, but in recent years, researchers have expanded the toolbox to detect key neurochemicals.\n\nThe next generation of these sensors now enables scientists to ask questions such as: how much of a specific neurochemical is released in response to the firing of an action potential? How many action potentials are required to release a given neurochemical? And how long does that molecule stick around? “All these kinds of questions, for the vast majority of molecules — we’re talking about dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and many others — we know virtually nothing about,” says Nicolas Tritsch, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. “This new class of genetically encoded sensors has really opened up this world.”\n\nLighting up cells\n\nThe revolution in genetically encoded neurochemical sensing began with calcium. Action potentials activate specialized channel proteins on the neuron’s cell membrane and allow calcium to enter, changing the calcium concentration. By fusing the calcium-binding protein calmodulin with a fluorescent protein and genetically targeting the hybrid molecule to specific populations of cells, researchers have developed sensors that light up in response to calcium fluctuations — a proxy for neuronal activity.\n\nOne popular variety of genetically encoded calcium indicators, known as GCaMPs, has been around since 2001. Researchers have since optimized the sensors’ speed and sensitivity — and they are now mainstays of neuroscience research. “They’re so ubiquitous that most papers that use GCaMPs stopped citing the relevant papers,” says Loren Looger, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), whose team has been developing these sensors.\n\nGenetically encoded sensors offer several advantages (see ‘Tracking neurochemicals’). Researchers can express them at specific times in particular cells, then pair them with techniques such as optogenetics to cause them to fire in response to light. But they also require genetic manipulation and might change the biology of cells in unexpected ways.\n\nSources: GCaMP: Y. Yang et al. Ann. Rev. Anal. Chem. 17, 367–392 (2024); PBP & GPCR: Z. Wu et al. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 23, 257–274 (2022)\n\nStill, the success of these sensors motivated many tool developers, including Looger, to dream up similar strategies for detecting other neurochemicals. Among them are neurotransmitters such as glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine — which activate or inhibit nerve cells — and neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin and endocannabinoids, which trigger molecular pathways in the brain1.\n\nIn 2018, two papers2,3 published just weeks apart by teams in the United States and China independently described GCaMP-like sensors for dopamine, a neuromodulator involved in reward-based decision-making, learning and many other processes.\n\nDubbed dLight1 and GRAB-DA, respectively, both teams’ sensors were built on the dopamine receptor, one of a family of proteins known as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The teams, led by neuroscientist Lin Tian, then at the University of California, Davis, and by Yulong Li, a neuroscientist at Peking University in Beijing, modified the receptor to fluoresce in the presence of dopamine and inserted that gene into a virus. Researchers could then inject the sensors into a living animal and observe the activity of specific molecules in infected cells in the brain using fibre photometry, a technique that measures changes in fluorescence using an optical fibre implanted in the brain.\n\nHow to keep the lights on: the mission to make more photostable fluorophores\n\nThese sensors quickly became popular additions to the neuroscience toolkit, and the papers have been cited more than 800 times apiece. In part, says Mark Walton, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, their popularity is due to their ease of use. Conventional methods can be difficult to master — voltammetry, in particular, “is a bit of a black art”, he says. But with genetically encoded sensors, “we’ve never looked back”. Among other things, Walton and his team have used them to investigate dopamine fluctuations in almost 200,000 tests in mice, revealing that, contrary to previous results from conventional approaches, reward-based decision-making can happen independently of dopamine4.\n\nAnother benefit of GPCR-based sensors is their generalizability, with a design that has now been extended to receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin and endocannabinoids. “Those initial dopamine sensors and their subsequently optimized variants have been transformative,” says Matthew Banghart, a neuroscientist at UCSD. “It’s so easy to implement, and the sky’s the limit in terms of being able to apply this approach to any GPCR of interest.”\n\nEnabling discoveries\n\nThese sensors have begun to fundamentally shift our understanding of how neurotransmitters and neuromodulators work. Take dopamine, for instance. Although scientists have long known what it does, how exactly it transmits information in the brain has remained a mystery.\n\nAs a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in the late 2010s, Arif Hamid wanted to understand how dopamine fluctuates in the brain. One leading hypothesis at the time was that, when dopamine neurons were activated, the neuromodulator would be released across the brain uniformly. But when Hamid and his colleagues used the dLight sensor to track the molecule’s movements in the striatum of mouse brains — a region that contains many dopamine-responsive neurons — they discovered instead that the neuromodulator was released in waves5. “We were completely floored,” says Hamid, who is now a neuroscientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “It really defied our expectations.”\n\nGenetic light bulbs illuminate the brain\n\nTritsch and his team have found that acetylcholine, too, propagates in waves across the striatum. Using two-colour imaging in live mice with GRAB-DA-based sensors for both acetylcholine and dopamine, the researchers reported in 2023 that, rather than there being a stable, baseline concentration of the two molecules, their levels fluctuate with sub-second kinetics6. “We found signatures of dopamine and acetylcholine on timescales that are much, much faster than we thought was possible,” Tritsch says. “Our next step is to see how that’s influencing the brain on these timescales.”\n\nThe sensors are also revealing the secrets of other important neurochemicals. In 2021, a team led by researchers in California and Canada used a GRAB-based sensor to study endocannabinoid signalling in the mouse brain7. And earlier this year, another team used a GPCR sensor, called ntsLight1.1, that responds to the neuropeptide neurotensin, which is involved in feeding behaviour. The aim was to study what drives mice that are fed purely a high-fat diet to start avoiding calorie-rich foods8. Among other things, that analysis implicated a decline in neurotensin levels in a brain region linked with dopamine signalling as a possible cause.\n\nAnd it’s not only in basic neurobiology that these sensors show promise. For instance, Tian, who is now at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience in Jupiter, Florida, and her team have found a use that could help to develop treatments for anxiety. They showed that a sensor targeting neurons affected by the psychedelic drug 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine can be used to identify other cells that contribute to the drug’s anxiety-reducing effects in mice without producing hallucinogenic effects9. That’s a finding that could support the development of future psychedelics that could have therapeutic benefits without the mind-bending side-effects, the study authors write.\n\nMixed signals\n\nGenetically encoded sensors do have some important caveats, however.\n\nOne key consideration is how these proteins affect the biology of the cells in which they are expressed. Like most proteins, excessive expression can be toxic to neurons, so identifying the best concentration at which to use a sensor is paramount, says Tritsch. “With every batch, we need to know how much to dilute so we can see it, but so it’s not too much that it kills the neurons.”\n\nWhy this happens is an open question, but Tritsch and others suggest two possibilities: The GPCRs could be siphoning off molecules that are required for healthy neuronal functioning, or their overexpression could be overextending the cellular machinery required to build these molecules and deliver them to the membrane.",

          "authors": "Xiaoying You",
          "abstract": "The Chinese government hopes a new visa will encourage talented young researchers to move there.Credit: VCG via Getty\n\nChina has introduced a visa that will allow young foreign researchers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to move there without having to secure a job first.\n\nBefore the introduction of the K visa, most foreign STEM researchers hoping to move to China had to find a job in advance and then apply for a work visa.\n\nThe Chinese government is making “a serious bid” to attract the world’s brightest minds in STEM, says Jeremy Neufeld, the director of immigration policy at the Institute for Progress, a think tank in Washington DC. South Korea, Singapore and several other countries have also launched STEM-oriented visa programmes.\n\nThe K visa was officially rolled out on 1 October, but Nature understands that applications are yet to open. Few details about eligibility have been released, except that restrictions will apply on the basis of an applicant’s age, education and work experience. Foreign researchers who have graduated from ‘famous’ universities or institutes in China or abroad with a bachelor-or-higher degree in STEM will be eligible to apply. That also includes people who teach or research STEM topics in such organizations.\n\nA ‘big step forward’\n\nThe visa is designed to help the country boost its competitiveness in areas that it deems important for its future, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and new materials, says Yuen Yuen Ang, a political economist at Johns Hopkins University in in Baltimore, Maryland. As the US government cuts back on its support for science, Chinese leaders see an opportunity to attract the best foreign scientists, particularly those working in fundamental research, Ang says.\n\nLu Fengming, a political economist at the Australian National University in Canberra, says it is a big step for the Chinese government to allow scientists to move to the country without a job offer. Sponsorship is needed for most other Chinese visa types, Lu says. The visa is a smart move given China’s desire to attract global talent, he adds.\n\nThe country’s immigration figures are relatively low compared with those of other leading science nations. In 2023, only 0.05% of China’s overall population were foreigners, compared with 4.9% in South Korea and 14.3% in the United States, according to an analysis by Direct HR, a recruitment firm based in Shanghai. It is unclear how many of them work in STEM, but some estimates show that China has 5,000–10,000 foreign researchers with a PhD, compared with at least 100,000 foreign scholars at this level in the United States.\n\nHowever, the United States is now restricting some immigration. In late September, the administration of President Donald Trump imposed a US$100,000 fee on applications for an H-1B visa, which many foreign STEM researchers rely on to live in the country.\n\n“While the US seemed to be raising barriers, China sent a strong counter-signal that it was opening its doors,” says Changhee Kim, a human-resource researcher at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China.\n\nBut Wang Zichen, a research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a think tank based in Beijing, says China did not launch the K visa on a whim. He notes that the government called for “more proactive, open and effective talent policies” as early as 2022.\n\nChallenges ahead",

          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "In a town on the shores of Lake Geneva sit clumps of living human brain cells for hire. These blobs, about the size of a grain of sand, can receive electrical signals and respond to them — much as computers do. Research teams from around the world can send the blobs tasks, in the hope that they will process the information and send a signal back.\n\nWelcome to the world of wetware, or biocomputers. In a handful of academic laboratories and companies, researchers are growing human neurons and trying to turn them into functional systems equivalent to biological transistors. These networks of neurons, they argue, could one day offer the power of a supercomputer without the outsized power consumption.\n\nCan lab-grown brains become conscious?\n\nThe results so far are limited. But keen scientists are already buying or borrowing online access to these brain-cell processors — or even investing tens of thousands of dollars to secure their own models.\n\nSome want to use these biocomputers as straightforward replacements for ordinary computers, whereas others want to use them to study how brains work. “Trying to understand biological intelligence is a very interesting scientific problem,” says Benjamin Ward-Cherrier, a robotics researcher at the University of Bristol, UK, who rents time on the Swiss brain blobs. “And looking at it from the bottom up — with simple small versions of our brain and building those up — I think is a better way of doing it than top down.”\n\nBiocomputing advocates claim that these systems could one day rival the capability of artificial intelligence and the potential of quantum computers.\n\nOther researchers who work with human neurons are more sceptical of what’s possible. And they warn that hype — and the science-fictional allure of what are sometimes labelled brain-in-a-jar systems — could even be counterproductive. If the idea that these systems possess sentience and consciousness takes hold, there could be repercussions for the research community.\n\n“I’m nervous that, if this kind of work gets a lot of attention and is overstated, that the reaction won’t just be, ‘We need to think about this work a little more carefully’. It will be, ‘We need to stop this work entirely,’” says Madeline Lancaster, a developmental biologist who uses neural tissue to study development and disease at the University of Cambridge, UK, but is not involved in biocomputing projects. “That could bring in regulations that prevent all work, including on the side of the field that’s really doing research to try to help people.”\n\nPower down\n\nComputer scientists have long coveted the astonishing power efficiency of the human brain. Running on less than 20 watts — about enough to work a small desktop fan — its billions of neurons can spin through the equivalent of one billion billion mathematical operations each second. The best supercomputers can match that speed, but consume a million times more power in doing so.\n\nSome researchers are trying to replicate the super-efficient structure of the brain using silicon chips. This approach, broadly called neuromorphic computing, takes inspiration from how neurons connect and fire to communicate. Specifically, some systems seek to mimic how neurons must charge to a threshold before firing an electrical impulse.\n\nBiocomputing, on the other hand, goes back to the biological source material. Starting with induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which can be reprogrammed to become almost any type of cell, researchers culture communities of brain cells and nurture them with nutrients and growth factors. To communicate with them, researchers sit the cells on electrode arrays, then pass signals and commands to them as sequences of electrical pulses. These signals change the way that ions flow into and out of neurons, and might prompt some cells to fire an electrical impulse known as an action potential. The biocomputer electrodes can detect these signals and employ algorithms to convert them to usable information.\n\nNeurons in a dish learn to play Pong — what’s next?\n\nThe most common biocomputing approach cultures the neurons as 3D clusters called organoids. The composition of these brain-cell communities varies, depending on how the iPS cells differentiate, but typically includes neurons and cells that support them, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.\n\nIn August, Ward-Cherrier and his colleagues reported1 using human brain organoids of around 10,000 neurons to ‘recognize’ Braille letters. They first used a robot fitted with a tactile sensor to read the letters, and then converted the data collected for each letter into a distinct pattern of electrical pulses — varying the timing and intensity, for example — which they passed through a series of eight electrodes placed next to the surface of the organoid. These electrodes record the collective activity of many nearby neurons.\n\nThe researchers wanted to learn whether the patterns of firing in the organoid were different depending on the stimulation pattern it received, and whether those responses were consistent.\n\nFor each letter, they collected the response from each electrode, averaged them to yield an overall organoid output, and used machine learning to identify any patterns.\n\nThe results showed that, when fed electrical pulses corresponding to specific letters, a single organoid would produce the same characteristic response 61% of the time, on average. When responses from three organoids were combined, that went up to 83%. In other words, the organoids could perform a simple processing task: to distinguish between and identify inputs.\n\nFor Ward-Cherrier, it’s a solid proof of principle. “It is an initial kind of stab at showing that we can do these types of tasks. The next step is doing something a little bit more complex.” That could include interpreting messages from the cultured cells as instructions for the robot — to read the letter again, for example. Such abilities define what researchers call closed-loop-systems, which have not yet been demonstrated with human brain organoids — although a 2024 study2 reported that such a system, made of mouse neuronal organoids, could play Cartpole, a computer game in which the aim is to keep a wobbly pole upright on a moving cart.\n\nBecause the inputs and outputs in cultured systems are simple electrical signals, it’s easy to offer remote access to organoids through the web. So, even though the Braille-reading robot is based in Ward-Cherrier’s lab in Bristol, the organoids are grown and housed at the company FinalSpark, in Vevey, Switzerland.\n\nDevices containing tiny clumps of human brain cells sit inside a fridge at FinalSpark in Vevey, Switzerland.Credit: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty\n\nA self-confessed fan of science fiction, FinalSpark co-founder Fred Jordan says he wants to develop systems of biological neurons that can “perform some similar things as are done with AI today”.\n\nThere is a long way to go. As computers, the organoid systems are currently “totally useless from a practical perspective”, he admits. “There is a very big difference between dreaming or thinking about something and doing it for real. And I would love to be one of those people who make this step.”\n\nSelected academic groups, such as Ward Cherrier’s, get free access to FinalSpark organoids, and many teams have signed up for this. A team at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, for example, is testing different types of stimulation to see how the organoids behave, and researchers at the Free University of Berlin are focusing on how machine-learning tools can best extract information from neural firing patterns.\n\nFor clients with deeper pockets, including private companies, monthly fees of US$5,000 can secure exclusive online access to an organoid system. And plenty do. “We have very, very big companies active in individual fields that you would think are disconnected to this,” Jordan says. Unlike with the free work done by academic groups, FinalSpark does not know what paying customers use the organoids for.\n\nOther independent groups with organoid expertise are jumping into biocomputing. The neural organoids in Alysson Muotri’s lab at the University of California, San Diego, each contain about 2.5 million neurons of various types. Muotri aims to apply organoids to a real-world problem: predicting the path of possible oil spills in the Amazon jungle. The project, financed by an oil company, is due to conclude by 2028. “We’re taking the challenge,” he says. “We’ll see where we are in three years.”\n\nTraining ground\n\nFor many organoid users trying to run more-complex tasks, one immediate aim is to find ways to train the neurons and thereby encourage goal-directed behaviour. At present, the responses from FinalSpark’s lab-grown organoids have more in common with the reflex actions of the peripheral nervous system — when someone’s leg kicks in response to a tap below the knee, for example — than with the malleable processes that guide decision-making in the brain.\n\nTo handle more complexity, these neural systems must be able to learn. One way to encourage that, Jordan says, is to deliver neurotransmitters such as dopamine to try to tune the organoids’ responses to particular stimuli. Dopamine makes neurons more likely to fire and strengthens the synapses that connect them — two changes that make the same neural response to a stimulus more likely to be repeated in future.\n\nAnother is a technique called pattern training stimulation, which was used in 2022 by researchers at Cortical Labs, a company based in Melbourne, Australia, to encourage lab-grown brain cells to play the 1970s computer game Pong3.\n\nRather than working with organoids, they chose to create networks of cells in dishes (see ‘Computing with cells’). Then the researchers wired them up to a computer, which was programmed so that the response of the neurons to stimulation moved a virtual paddle while a virtual ball bounced around. To direct the paddle towards the ball, the researchers fed the neurons with an organized burst of electrical activity if the cells (at first, randomly) got it right. If the neurons moved the paddle in the wrong direction, they were blasted with chaotic white noise. Over time, the neurons learnt to hit the ball to receive the patterned response rather than the random one.\n\nThe strategy is drawn from the observation that brain cells tend to repeat activity that yields a predictable outcome, so will learn the kinds of behaviour that trigger familiar stimulation.\n\nCortical Labs has now developed a modular system that can link increasing numbers of individual wells, each containing at most 1,000 neurons, to form what the company calls a bioengineered intelligence. Each cell culture has a useful life of about six months before it must be replaced.",

          "abstract": "China has seen increasing international enrolments as its universities grow in stature, but this has also brought challenges.Credit: Yang Bo/China News Service/VCG via Getty\n\nIn 2018, I argued that China’s meteoric growth in research output masked deeper structural issues, including inconsistent research quality and a ‘publish or perish’ academic culture. Seven years on, that picture has changed.\n\nResearch quality in China has improved: in 2023, it overtook the United States as the leading country in the Nature Index, which tracks output in high-quality natural- and health-sciences journals. Since then, the gap between the two countries has only widened.\n\nThese gains reflect deliberate policy interventions, including the Chinese government’s Double First-Class Initiative, launched in 2017 to cultivate world-class universities and disciplines by awarding different levels of funding on the basis of performance and strategic goals, with a focus on quality over quantity.\n\nAt the institutional level, performance evaluations now place greater weight on originality, quality and international visibility, rather than raw output. Since 2020, in response to a national policy that aimed to address the pervasive focus on research output, rather than quality, some universities have reduced or abolished cash rewards for sheer numbers of publications, replacing them with recognition tied to global impact and peer esteem.\n\nBut structural challenges remain. Some universities are using pay bumps, rather than cash payments for papers, as a more indirect way to reward prolific authors1. Progress has been uneven: improvements are concentrated in a small cluster of elite universities and disciplines. Political sensitivities continue to constrain academic openness and freedom.\n\nEarlier this year, I interviewed 10 university administrators and academics and 12 international postgraduate students at two Chinese research universities to gain an understanding of how the country’s increasingly cautious approach to global collaborations is affecting their work.\n\nChanging landscape\n\nOne of the biggest changes the interviewees described is the shift away from US and UK collaborations, especially in politically sensitive areas, such as artificial intelligence (AI), aerospace and cybersecurity. Many universities now encourage partnerships with researchers in South and southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and continental Europe — regions with which China aims to strengthen trade and economic ties through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\nSome universities are using planning tools to manage international partnerships more carefully. A few interviewees mentioned a system that ranks potential research partners by geopolitical and reputational risk — green for low risk, amber for moderate and red for high, which needs approval from senior university leaders. It “has become a routine part of proposal review — even for conference participation or faculty exchanges”, one academic-affairs supervisor said.\n\nThis shift also affects international students, especially those from low- and middle-income countries participating in the BRI, who account for a growing share of enrolments at Chinese universities.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\nMany of these students face major challenges, including limited institutional support and language barriers. Some interviewees noted that as Chinese universities have shifted their focus from recruiting students from high-income countries, such as South Korea, Japan, the United States and United Kingdom, to students from lower-income regions, the system seems less equipped to accommodate their academic and cultural needs.\n\nFor example, interviewees suggested that students from richer countries generally received clearer information and stronger institutional support than did those from low- and middle-income countries, who were frustrated about being enrolled in ‘English-speaking’ classes that, in reality, were not taught in English. “Many assignments are in Chinese,” said a Pakistani student studying English linguistics. “I translate everything myself.”\n\nSome interviewees noted that administrative hurdles, such as delayed visa renewals, have intensified, particularly as enforcement of residency and exit–entry rules has become stricter. China’s regulations on the enrolment of international students — jointly issued in 2020 by the ministries of education, foreign affairs and public security — require universities to coordinate with local public-security bureaus and foreign-affairs offices to process visa and residence-permit approvals, thereby institutionalizing several layers of oversight.\n\nStudents sponsored by their home government said that they face strict requirements to return after graduating. “I have to return to Bangladesh and work in a government office for five years, or repay everything,” a student from the country explained. “It blocks career options.”\n\nThese rules reflect China’s policy of cultivating foreign talent — especially students from BRI countries who gain local experience and later return to their home countries to work in government or development sectors. The intent of the policy is to foster long-term ties and mutual understanding between China and these countries, as part of a broader strategy of education-driven diplomacy that combines talent development with international influence-building.\n\nSelf-funded international students, however, said they have reduced access to institutional support, travel grants and career resources compared with their government-sponsored peers, creating a two-tier system.\n\nAmbiguity and self-censorship\n\nIn addition to administrative hurdles, many students described an academic environment in which certain topics were ‘off-limits’, without clear guidelines. “We’re often discouraged from raising questions in class because we’re unsure what is politically acceptable,” said one European student studying international relations.\n\nDifferent disciplines seem to have different boundaries. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics students reported restricted access to international databases in genomics and biotechnology, for instance; social-science students encountered extended review processes or informal bans on politically sensitive topics.\n\nOne European student told me that they wanted to compare Taiwanese and mainland media narratives as part of an assignment, and their adviser told them to avoid “sensitive framing”, including terms such as “independence” and “resistance”.",

In the past year, women have also won leadership elections at the Kyiv Aviation Institute and the Vasyl Stefanyk Carpathian National University in Ivano-Frankivsk.\n\nIn our society, mothers and women have strong roles. The war is a crisis and maybe there is a feeling that a woman can protect us.\n\nYou want your university to lead in Europe. How will you achieve that?\n\nYes, I believe in the transformative power of ambition. Moreover, Ukrainian universities have long been underestimated. Our intellectual resilience, especially in times of crisis, is extraordinary. In my mind, the best university is the one that is the best place for people. We’re not just talking about rankings but about the feeling that ‘I like to spend my time here, not only for work or education, but also because this is a good place for me’.\n\n‘Education is possible in any situation’ — what I’ve learnt from teaching in Kyiv amid a war\n\nBrain drain is a problem in Ukraine. That’s why it is important to show our young people that they can and must stay in the country, not only for education but also for their future careers and to rebuild it.\n\nWe need sustained investment in research infrastructure. We need new laboratories and — importantly — deeper international partnerships. We need a culture that rewards innovation and inter-disciplinary thinking. But above all, we need to trust it’s possible, and act accordingly.\n\nYour university was bombed in July. What were the consequences?\n\nThe event was not just about the damaging of labs and classrooms: those can be rebuilt. It was about the emotional trauma to students and staff members. And it was about the mobilization of students and staff. Our community understands that we must rebuild, we must continue our work, we must continue our studying. Universities are not only the buildings: they are first of all the people.\n\nHow have you kept the community together and motivated?\n\nWe are replacing all of the damaged windows. We have raised funds from our partner companies to repair our labs. And for our community, we organized a psychological-support group for students and academics.\n\nWe have had to think about a trauma- informed educational model. We are a huge university and it is difficult to know whether any particular student is affected by trauma. We have a psychological-support centre for our students. It is busy all the time.\n\nResearchers at Lviv Polytechnic National University in Ukraine are developing hydrogel bandages for treating people with burns and other wounds.Credit: Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nWe are also holding a lot of motivational lectures — about new possibilities and time management — and meetings with successful people, not only Ukrainian professors, but also international ones. We organize workshops and courses on non-academic topics for students.\n\nI think these measures are working. Our academic staff members are highly motivated: they want to create something new.\n\nThe war has forced your university to innovate — how so?\n\nConventional education is about lectures, about labs, about practical issues. But having to deal with trauma as well as problems such as access to electricity and materials, it is important that we have a flexible model for our students and staff members.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nThat’s why we first reviewed our educational facilities. We are currently focusing on opening co-working zones where students and staff members can spend their free time and do their work, and on 24-hour lab access for everyone. In the AI department, students can now access the lab at any time.\n\nAnd we try to organize ways for our staff members to connect with our international partners. This is one of the most important parts of our strategy. And it is not about emergency support. It is about long-term integration into European research frameworks. This is, I think, the most important innovation.\n\nTo what extent has your university’s research pivoted during the war?\n\nBecause our economy is working on post-war recovery scenarios, we are having a radical reorganization of research agendas to support this. It is not about publishing papers: we are helping to rebuild the country. We have a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nThe most important thing for Ukraine now is the development of technologies, for example, drone systems and energy resilience. For instance, one project is upcycling bomb-damaged concrete into high-quality concrete for reconstruction. It’s funded by the UK government’s InnovateUkraine programme; our engineers have trained using equipment from the University of Leeds, and a mobile rubble-processing line has begun trials near Kyiv. The benefits include carbon dioxide savings, lower construction costs and simpler logistics for reconstruction.\n\nYour output of scientific papers is prolific. How do you manage this?",

In a clinical trial, ganaplacide–lumefantrine (GanLum) cured 97.4% of participants, outperforming an existing treatment, which cured 94%.\n\nNovartis, the maker of GanLum, based in Basel, Switzerland, says it is in the process of submitting the drug for regulatory approval, and it could be available in 12–18 months. It would be the first new class of malaria drug approved in more than 25 years.\n\nTackling resistance\n\nMalaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted to people mainly through mosquito bites. It infects hundreds of millions of people and causes nearly 600,000 deaths each year, most of which occur in children under the age of five.\n\nCurrently, the most widely used malaria treatments rely on artemisinin, a plant-derived compound that rapidly kills malaria parasites. But partial resistance to this compound has been identified in southeast Asia and several African countries. “There is a great need for non-artemisinin-based drugs to treat malaria,” says Philip Rosenthal, a malaria specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nAlthough it’s not clear whether this resistance is causing treatment failures, having alternatives is important in case current therapies lose effectiveness. For that reason, GanLum moving towards approval gives a “tremendous sense of relief”, says George Jagoe, executive vice-president at Medicines for Malaria Venture, an organization in Geneva, Switzerland, focused on increasing access to new malaria treatments. It collaborated with Novartis to develop the therapy, providing financial and scientific support.\n\nThe clinical-trial results were presented today at the American Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene (ASTMH) annual meeting in Toronto, Canada. Researchers compared GanLum with artemether–lumefantrine, a standard artemisinin-based treatment for malaria. The trial included 1,688 adults and children with malaria in 12 countries across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nTransmission block\n\nData from the study showed that GanLum could clear parasites with a mutation associated with artemisinin resistance in around 47 hours, much faster than the standard treatment, which took around 71 hours.",

A team of scientists took a submersible vessel beneath the Arctic sea ice and completed more than 40 dives, going as deep as 5,277 metres.\n\nThe analyses are far from complete, but this section of the Gakkel ridge might have hot-water vents that spew from the sea floor. Similar vents on the western, and better-explored, part of the ridge are home to bizarre ecosystems that thrive far from the reach of sunlight. They provide scientists with some of the best opportunities to understand how life might arise and evolve in icy oceans on worlds beyond Earth, such as on Jupiter’s ice-encrusted moon Europa.\n\nMissing piece\n\nExpedition scientists will spend the next few years studying the rocks, water and animals that they gathered during the submersible dives. “It’s the last piece of the puzzle” to understanding this unique Arctic environment, says Xiaoxia Huang, a marine geophysicist at the Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering in Sanya, China, and the expedition’s chief scientist.\n\nThe Gakkel ridge stretches from off the coast of Greenland to Siberia. Volcanic eruptions along it create new sea-floor crust, which spreads away from the ridge at some of the slowest rates on the planet — slower than the rate at which fingernails grow. Yet, somehow that sluggish geology manages to produce enough heat and chemical energy to sustain hydrothermal vents on the sea floor.\n\nIn 2001, a US–German expedition discovered hydrothermal vents on the western part of the Gakkel ridge1. Researchers have returned multiple times to that area to study the rich chemistry and biology of the deep, dark vent system2,3.\n\nBut the eastern side of the ridge is more remote and challenging to explore. Russian scientists have conducted some surveys, but the latest Chinese expedition is the first intensive geological survey and diving expedition in the area, Huang says.\n\n“It’s so hard to get there that anything anybody does is almost guaranteed to be exciting and different and new,” says Christopher German, a marine geochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. “The Chinese expedition is poised to yield significant new insights,” adds Elmar Albers, a marine geoscientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany.\n\nRisky expedition\n\nThe Chinese expedition, organized by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, paired a deep-sea crewed submersible, named Fendouzhe, with an ice-breaker. It was the first time Fendouzhe, which has explored many parts of the oceans, including the Mariana Trench, has visited the Arctic region. Other expeditions have used remotely operated vehicles to explore the Gakkel Ridge, because of the dangers of the vehicle becoming trapped under floating sea ice.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "A Tiny Reasoning Model beat Large Language Models in solving logic puzzles, despite being trained on a much smaller dataset. Credit: Getty\n\nA small-scale artificial-intelligence model that learns from only a limited pool of data is exciting researchers for its potential to boost reasoning abilities. The model, known as Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), outperformed some of the world’s best large language models (LLMs) at the Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI), a test involving visual logic puzzles that is designed to flummox most machines.\n\nThe model — detailed in a preprint on the arXiv server last month1 — is not readily comparable to an LLM. It is highly specialized, excelling only on the type of logic puzzles on which it is trained, such as sudokus and mazes, and it doesn’t ‘understand’ or generate language. But its ability to perform so well on so few resources — it is 10,000 times smaller than frontier LLMs — suggests a possible route for boosting this capability more widely in AI, say researchers.\n\n“It’s fascinating research into other forms of reasoning that one day might get used in LLMs,” says Cong Lu, a machine-learning researcher formerly at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. However, he cautions that the techniques might no longer be as effective if applied on a much larger scale. “Often techniques work very well at small model sizes and then just stop working,” at a bigger scale, he says.\n\nA test of artificial intelligence\n\n“The results are very significant in my opinion,” says François Chollet, co-founder of AI firm Ndea, who created the ARC-AGI test. Because such models need to be trained from scratch on each new problem, they are “relatively impractical”, but “I expect a lot more research to come out that will build on top of these results”, he adds.\n\nThe sole author of the paper — Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, an AI researcher at Samsung's Advanced Institute of Technology in Montreal, Canada — says that her model shows that the idea that only massive models that cost millions of dollars to train can succeed at hard tasks “is a trap”. She has made the model’s code openly available on Github for anyone to download and modify. “Currently, there is too much focus on exploiting LLMs rather than devising and expanding new lines of direction,” she wrote on her blog.\n\nTiny model, big results\n\nMost reasoning models are built on top of LLMs, which predict the next word in a sequence by tapping into billions of learned internal connections, known as parameters. They excel by memorizing patterns from billions of documents, which can trip them up when they come to unpredictable logic puzzles.\n\nThe TRM takes a different approach. Jolicoeur-Martineau was inspired by a technique known as the hierarchical reasoning model, developed by the AI firm Sapient Intelligence in Singapore. The hierarchical reasoning model improves its answer through multiple iterations and was published in a preprint in June2.\n\nThe TRM uses a similar approach, but uses just 7 million parameters, compared with 27 million for the hierarchical model and billions or trillions for LLMs. For each puzzle type the algorithm learns, such as a sudoku, Jolicoeur-Martineau trained a brain-inspired architecture known as a neural network on around 1,000 examples, formatted as a string of numbers.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide\n\nDuring training, the model guesses the solution and then compares it with the correct answer, before refining its guess and repeating the process. In this way, it learns strategies to improve its guesses. The model then takes a similar approach to solve unseen puzzles of the same type, successively refining its answer up to 16 times before generating a response.",

          "abstract": "People protested staff cuts at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March.Credit: Elijah Nouvelage/Getty\n\nIn the nine months since anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr stepped in as US health secretary, all eyes have been on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency that is tasked with protecting the health of Americans and that Kennedy had referred to before his appointment as a “cesspool of corruption”. In June, members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an expert panel that makes recommendations on what vaccines should be considered safe and effective for Americans, were dismissed and replaced with new advisers, most of whom have expressed anti-vaccine views. As a result, access to vaccines against COVID-19, seasonal influenza and measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, among others, has begun to erode.\n\nMichael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, understood the threat these changes posed to public health, and thought that he might be in a position to try and limit the damage. Osterholm directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), a group focused on providing scientific evidence to inform public-health policy. In April, the centre launched the Vaccine Integrity Project (VIP), an initiative aimed at presenting science-based evidence on vaccine safety and efficacy.\n\nVaccine sceptic RFK Jr is now a powerful force in US science: what will he do?\n\nIts first move was to convene specialists from across the US vaccine ecosystem to explore how a non-governmental group could help. The most pressing issue, they concluded, was to take up part of the work once done by the ACIP. In July, with respiratory-virus season looming, the VIP jumped into a rapid review of the data on seasonal vaccines for influenza, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to inform recommendations. And it is now analysing data on the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose, which has been recommended to nearly all infants born in the United States since the early 1990s. Even though the strategy has helped to keep hepatitis B under control, the current ACIP has decided to re-examine it.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, says that “ACIP remains the nation‘s scientific compass for immunization policy”. They add that CDC is not limiting access to vaccines, but “returning decision-making power to the American people.”\n\nCIDRAP has also announced plans to publish health alerts modelled on the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), a long-running public-health bulletin. The centre’s efforts have attracted former CDC officials, including former director Rochelle Walensky. The moves have led to some speculation that CIDRAP is evolving into a sort of shadow CDC that provides public-health guidance in the vacuum created by the overhaul of ACIP and massive layoffs at the agency. Osterholm dismisses this: “No one could replace the CDC,” he says.\n\nWhat has the VIP accomplished so far?\n\nWe were particularly concerned about the seasonal viral pathogen vaccines — influenza, coronavirus and RSV. So, we launched in early July what some said was an impossible task. We took a protocol-based approach to reviewing those vaccines, similar to what the ACIP would do. And from early July until late October, when the final product was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)1, we have been continuing to provide information to medical societies of what would be the scientific basis for them to make vaccine recommendations.\n\nOur next stop right now is a review of hepatitis B vaccine, and we’re really focusing on the importance of the infant first dose.",

          "abstract": "This week, as world leaders gather in Belém, Brazil, for the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), once again it seems that there will be more rhetoric than real solutions for the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate.\n\nMy native Belize — with its tropical rainforests, coastal wetlands and coral reefs — is one such country. Warming seas are killing our reefs. Hurricanes and wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity.\n\n‘Almost utopian’: how protecting the environment is boosting the economy in Brazil\n\nAs a biologist with two decades of experience in academia and conservation, I have learnt that, to protect natural resources, local communities must be empowered to steward these efforts — and that women are often best placed to drive them, at least in Latin America and the Caribbean, but probably everywhere.\n\nIn many cultures, women are the de facto main carers and custodians of community knowledge. They are often in positions, paid or otherwise, to make their communities healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful — making them well-suited to lead climate action and conservation work.\n\nI am the managing director of the Belize Maya Forest Trust, a non-profit organization dedicated to conserving nearly 1,000 square kilometres of the country’s tropical forest. I also chair the board of directors of the Belize Network of NGOs, an umbrella organization for many of the more than 100 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the country. In Belize, many prominent conservation organizations are led by women. Take the Community Baboon Sanctuary, a globally recognized conservation effort that protects the habitat of the Yucatán black-howler monkey (Alouatta pigra). Today, the sanctuary is managed by the Community Baboon Sanctuary Women’s Conservation Group, which is directed by women from seven Belizean villages.\n\nAnd over the past five years, working with the government of Belize and The Nature Conservancy, a global environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, women in Belize have had key roles in the execution of game-changing sustainable-financing initiatives. One is Belize’s first large-scale project to reduce emissions by avoiding deforestation, which is helping to protect the Belize Maya Forest, an area that includes some of the world’s most biodiversity-rich lands. Another is Belize Blue Bonds — which, when the deal closed in November 2021, was the world’s largest debt-refinancing scheme for ocean conservation.\n\nThe more I participate in advocacy and interact with civil-society organizations — both in Belize and internationally — the more I find myself in rooms full of women striving to protect the environment and defend human rights.\n\nBut I have also noticed that women are not usually negotiating for funds, deciding whether to launch large initiatives or setting national priorities.\n\nIs it time to give up trying to save coral reefs? My research says no\n\nBelize is again a case in point. In any of the ten elections since Belize gained independence in 1981, at most four women have been elected to the 28–31-member House of Representatives, the most powerful arm of the country’s legislature. Other female parliamentarians have been appointed by the prime minister, but these positions tend to have much less authority than do those elected through popular vote. Also, female ministers are usually put in charge of human or rural-development issues, rather than the country’s economy, land, infrastructure or defence.\n\nFor countries to build resilience and protect their biodiversity in the time needed, more women must be made equal partners in decision making.",

          "title": "To reform universities, first tackle global rankings",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Gadd",
          "abstract": "University reputations and finances often hinge on their position in global ranking tables. Students use rankings to quickly identify the best place to study — or, at least, what might be perceived to be the best by any future employer. Even a small shift in rank can affect how many students apply to a university, altering the income from tuition fees (R.-D. Baltaru et al. Stud. High. Educ. 47, 2323–2335; 2022).\n\nThe future of universities\n\nAnd governments love the simplicity of rankings. Many will fund their citizens’ overseas study only at institutions that are high up the listings. National investment initiatives — such as Russia’s 5-100 Academic Excellence project and Japan’s Top Global University project — often focus on universities that have a chance of making it into the upper echelons of the rankings. The UK government offers its High Potential Individual visas only to candidates who have studied at highly ranked universities.\n\nSuch reliance on rankings means that universities are shaped not by the needs of society or by innovations driven from inside the international higher-education community, but by unappointed third-party ranking agencies.\n\nThe indicators used by some of the dominant flagship rankings don’t capture the full range of qualities and functions of higher-education institutions. Each agency uses a slightly different ranking method, but all typically focus on a narrow range of criteria. These are centred heavily on publication-based measures, such as citations, and on reputation surveys.\n\nThe consequence is that most of the world’s universities tend to pursue one flavour of ‘excellence’, which looks rather like the old, wealthy, conservative, research-intensive institutions of high-income nations.\n\nInside our university’s mission to pivot to research\n\nMeanwhile, universities are facing a series of problems — from diminishing public funding and trust, to decreasing curriculum relevance in a rapidly changing job market and the need to demonstrate real-world impact from research. There is no shortage of ideas about how to reshape universities in response to these challenges, but the dominance of rankings as a measure of institutional success means that universities lack incentives to try. Many fear that stepping away from the status quo might result in a drop down the tables, making it harder for them to attract funding and talent.\n\nScholarly communities and universities must push for change. Here, I outline how.\n\nA flawed system\n\nIn my view, flagship global rankings over-rely on the data sources that they have easy access to: publication data or survey data that they collect themselves. (The Nature Index, produced by Springer Nature, ranks universities solely using contributions to research articles published in natural-science and health-science journals.) In many rankings, evaluations of teaching are based on flimsy proxies, such as staff-to-student ratios or the number of alumni with Nobel prizes. Most rankings place little to no weight on open-science practices, societal impacts, outreach or efforts to improve diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nRanking indicators are also weighted in a variety of ways without clear justification. For example, a ranking might allocate a 20% weighting to citations involving faculty members and only 5% to employment outcomes. Rankings are also presented without error bars, even though the data used are imperfect.\n\nEfforts to push back on narrow, publication-dominant forms of assessment have mostly put the onus on universities to change how they evaluate their staff and departments. Many universities have risen to the challenge. Narrative CVs and biosketches — accounts written by researchers that highlight the full range of their contributions — are becoming more common. In European universities, the development of templates to elicit evidence of a broader range of contributions from faculty members, known as Career Assessment Matrices, is expanding.\n\nBut there is a limit to how far institutions can move away from citation- and publication-based assessments, if they continue to be judged on these measures by global university rankings.\n\nStudents use rankings to choose universities.Credit: Getty\n\nIn the past three years, several groups, including the Union of Students in Ireland and the United Nations University think tank, the International Institute for Global Health, have appealed for universities to escape this stranglehold. They have called on institutions to stop supplying data to the rankings, which some, such as the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and the University of Zurich, Switzerland, have done. And the groups have asked universities to stop promoting their rank and to reduce how much they consider rankings of someone’s previous institution when making decisions, such as which staff members to recruit. The groups also endorse the More Than Our Rank initiative, which encourages institutions to describe their many achievements, activities and aspirations not captured by the rankings, through a narrative statement on their web pages. (I chair the INORMS Research Evaluation Group, which developed the More Than Our Rank initiative.)\n\nThese are valid recommendations, but asking individual universities to take responsibility will not lead to global reforms in how university performance is defined and assessed. To achieve this, a three-pronged solution is needed.\n\nCall out current rankings\n\nThe higher-education sector should collectively — and vocally — agree that the current rankings are not fit for purpose. It might seem unlikely that institutes currently at the top of the rankings, mostly located in Europe and the United States, would call out a system that benefits them. But geopolitical changes should give pause for thought. Chinese and Indian universities are taking more of the top spots in the rankings than before, with UK, US and Australian institutions in decline. If those currently at the top wait too long to speak out, they might soon find themselves lower down the ranks, with less clout to drive the reforms that would serve all institutions.\n\nHow universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now\n\nThe call for change should involve an education campaign aimed at students and policymakers, who rely on rankings for decision-making. This should be led by an independent body that is governed by experts from the international higher-education sector, many of whom have already expressed concern about the harms of global university rankings (see, for example, go.nature.com/4hy1kq9). The goal should be to help consumers of rankings to understand that ‘Which is the best university in the world?’ is not a useful question. ‘Which university might be best for me, given that I care about X and Y?’ is a better question — but one for which current measures are unlikely to provide a good answer.\n\nThe campaign should note that good assessments need to be nuanced and contextualized, and will take time to digest.

          "title": "Could humans live to 150? Why some researchers think we’re on the cusp of a major longevity breakthrough",
          "authors": "James Mitchell Crow",
          "abstract": "Credit: Simon Prades\n\nWill a human ever celebrate a 150th birthday? You bet, says Stephen Austad, a biology of ageing researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Austad is so sure that life expectancy is poised for another rapid rise, he put money down in 2000 that the first person to reach 150 was already alive.\n\nIt’s a fantastical idea, counters Jay Olshansky, a longevity researcher at the University of Illinois Chicago, who took Austad’s bet and foresees a payout for his descendants in 2150.\n\nSo far, the numbers seem to fall in Olshansky’s favour. During the twentieth century, medical advances added 30 years to human life expectancy. Since then, the rise has slowed significantly — as Olshansky was sure it would.\n\nNature Index 2025 Ageing\n\n“In 1990, colleagues and I forecast that the rise in life expectancy will slow, as more people live long enough to be exposed to the immutable force of ageing,” Olshansky says1. When Olshansky revisited this analysis in 2024, he and his co-authors confirmed that life expectancy in the developed world was flatlining2.\n\nThe human body has been pushed about as far as it can go by conventional medicine, Olshansky says. “As long as ageing remains unmodified, you can’t push out the envelope of survival much beyond where we are today.” The only path to further radical human lifespan extension, he concluded, is to slow the ageing process itself.\n\nAustad agrees. “I think we’re very close to being able to do it,” he adds, noting numerous approaches that have shown promise in animals and, increasingly, in people.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, given their wager, Olshansky also sees great potential in this work. “I’m very optimistic that we will be able to slow down the biological process of ageing,” he says. “I think it will happen in our lifetime.” On how much this might impact lifespan, Olshansky and Austad differ, although both agree that such considerations are a distraction. Ultimately, the point is not how long we live, but how well we live.\n\nYoung of heart\n\nLiving longer is a secondary goal of geroscience, a fast-growing field focused on uncovering the biological changes that make our cells, tissues and organs more prone to conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders as we age. Targeting individual diseases might extend lifespan, but it no longer guarantees a longer ‘healthspan’ — years lived fit and well, Austad says. For instance, age-adjusted deaths from heart disease have fallen by one-third since 2000, but people who don’t die from it typically never fully recover, compromising their quality of life and burdening health-care systems.\n\n“The fear is, if we continue with the disease model, we’re going to live longer and longer in the ‘red zone’ — with frailty and disability,” Olshansky says.\n\nGeroscience resets age-related disease management by targeting the biggest risk factor for their onset: ageing itself. One line of research has been to study centenarians who have remained naturally fit and healthy far beyond average life expectancy. “As a clinician, I was always intrigued by individuals who are very old and functioning very well” and finding out “what stimulates the longevity and healthspan in these individuals”, says Andrea Maier, a healthy-ageing researcher at the National University of Singapore.\n\nOther leads have come from the observation, first made in rodents a century ago, that animals fed a heavily calorie-restricted diet live longer. “In mice, it works, it slows down ageing,” says Zahida Sultanova, a postdoc at the University of East Anglia, UK, who studies factors that affect ageing. Studying how cellular processes changed in these long-lived animals has delivered many insights into ageing.\n\nSeveral processes identified in calorie-restricted animals have also shown up in healthy human centenarians. One such mechanism, identified by biology of ageing researcher, Leonard Guarente, and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, pointed to the importance of a set of genes and associated proteins called sirtuins3. Many organisms are now known to possess them. “If you make them more active, you extend the lifespan,” Guarente says. Some centenarians also carry extra-active sirtuins. Sirtuins were found to play a role in DNA maintenance and repair, but they rely on a molecule called NAD+, which naturally declines with age. In ageing mice, dietary supplements that increase cellular NAD+ levels can boost sirtuin activity and extend healthspan and lifespan.\n\nGuarente has spun off a company from his research to test this concept in people. “You can’t realistically run a clinical trial to determine how long humans live, because you’d have to wait 50 years for the result. So, we look at surrogate markers of health,” Guarente says. So far, in early-stage trials, boosting NAD+ has safely lowered markers of inflammation thought to be at the core of conditions including non-alcoholic fatty liver syndrome4 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease5.\n\nDousing inflammation\n\nChronic inflammation is so closely associated with ageing that it has been dubbed ‘inflammageing’. This over-activation of the immune system involves a complex interplay of signalling molecules called cytokines, some promoting inflammation and some suppressing it.\n\nCytokine interleukin-11 (IL-11) was long thought to be anti-inflammatory until, in 2017, Stuart Cook from Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School and his colleagues showed the opposite was correct6.\n\n“We found that IL-11 was involved in multiple ageing processes,” says Cook, a clinician scientist researching new biomedical targets for healthspan. Following a chance observation that IL-11 levels were increased in the organs of old rats, they investigated further. In a mouse study7 published in 2024, the team showed that treating the animals with an antibody that binds IL-11 and blocks its effects extended lifespan by up to 25%. “The benefits of anti-IL-11 were apparent in every organ we looked at,” says Cook, who suspects IL-11 is an evolutionary appendage that once played a role in limb regeneration in ancient fish but has no beneficial function in humans.\n\nClinical trials of IL-11-inhibitors have already begun. In June 2025, Alphabet-owned Calico Life Sciences struck a licensing deal for one such IL-11 blocker, developed by Chinese biotech firm Mabwell, based in Shanghai. Some of the big companies collaborating with Calico — including US pharma company AbbVie — should enable large-scale clinical trials to test IL-11 inhibition in people, Cook says. “Then we will know once and for all if anti-IL-11 is an anti-ageing drug for humans.”\n\nCleaner living\n\nOf course, there’s no guarantee that any potential anti-ageing medicine that generates results in mouse studies will succeed in human clinical trials. In the anti-ageing field, a group of drugs called senolytics have not, so far, fulfilled their preclinical promise.\n\nSenolytics are designed to clean out dysfunctional ‘senescent’ cells, which accumulate in many tissues and cause inflammation, prompting the hypothesis that such cells could be a fundamental driver of ageing. Following animal studies looking at the potential healthspan and lifespan benefits of senolytics, multiple clinical trials have been launched in the past five years — but so far, have failed to show the anticipated benefits in people, Austad says. “Senolytics went from the laboratory to clinical trials extremely fast — we’ll see if they fall out of favour just as fast,” he says.\n\nFor Austad, one reason for the poor success rate in translating animal-study successes into human findings is the way animal studies are conducted. Lab animals are cosseted, kept continually warm, well-fed and protected from pathogens. “This artificial situation has completely misled us about how treatments are going to translate into the real world,” says Austad, who is testing anti-ageing interventions in mice kept under a range of conditions to better approximate real life. “Treatments that work under all those conditions are the things that we should be most interested in,” he says.\n\nReuse and recycle\n\nSeveral anti-ageing approaches repurpose existing drugs, rather than looking for new ones. Two have been examined for their ability to mimic the metabolic effects of calorie restriction. One is the widely prescribed blood-glucose-lowering diabetes drug, metformin. Another is rapamycin, an immunosuppressant that inhibits a cellular nutrient sensor controlling cell growth and repair. Blocking this receptor can mimic caloric restriction by tricking the body into thinking food is scarce, Sultanova says. “You eat normally but hide it from yourself.”\n\nIn 2024, Sultanova and her colleagues released a meta-analysis of 167 animal studies8, looking at the lifespan impacts of rapamycin and metformin compared with actual caloric restriction. The analysis found that caloric restriction gave the largest and most consistent lifespan extension, closely followed by rapamycin. Metformin showed no clear benefit.\n\nSource: World Health Organization",

          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi, Benjamin Thompson",
          "abstract": "Bengio has pivoted his research to explore the risks posed by AI.Credit: Joel Saget/AFP via Getty\n\nYoshua Bengio is a computer scientist at the University of Montreal in Canada. In 2019, he won an A. M. Turing Award — considered the most prestigious honour in computer science — for pioneering the ‘deep learning’ techniques that are now making artificial intelligence (AI) ubiquitous. Last month, he also became the first person to top one million citations on Google Scholar.\n\nBengio has since turned his focus to exploring the risks posed by AI. He chairs an international panel of advisors in this field, which includes representatives from 30 countries, the European Union, the OECD and the United Nations. The group issued the International scientific report on the safety of advanced AI earlier this year.\n\nNature met with Bengio in London to talk about the potential and pitfalls of the technology he helped to invent. The following is an edited version of the conversation.\n\nAmong the many papers that you’ve written, are there any that you’re particularly proud of?\n\nThe string of papers that I co-authored on language modelling and attention — that started in the late ‘90s — on how we could introduce attention mechanisms in neural nets to make them more ‘system 2’, meaning more deliberate, and not just intuition machines.\n\nIs that the attention technique at the heart of a 2017 paper1 from Google researchers that introduced transformers — the technique that became the ‘T’ in ChatGPT?\n\nYes, but I would mention also another paper, which doesn’t get nearly as much attention — and that's the work on curriculum learning2, in which a machine is trained by feeding it data in a particular order rather than at random. It has become the standard way of doing things. The inspiration for me was learning in animals.\n\nThe existential risk posed by uncontrollable AI was not at the top of your worries until a few years ago. What has changed?\n\nWhen ChatGPT came out, in November 2022. It took me two or three months to realize we were on a path that could be extremely dangerous. And although I was initially pleased to see that deep learning had finally reached that milestone, I realized that because of the nature of these systems, we didn't know how to make sure they would behave in the ways that we want.\n\nI started thinking about my grandchild, and I thought, in 20 years, he’s going to be 22; will he have a life? Will he live in a democracy?\n\n‘Godfather of AI’ becomes first person to hit one million citations\n\nWhoever will control very advanced AIs in the future will have huge power. And they could use that power in ways that are good for them, maybe, but not for most of us. Democracy is about sharing power. If the power is concentrated in the hands of a few, that is not democracy — that is a dictatorship.\n\nBut there are other existential risks due to the power of AI in the wrong hands. There are people who, for ideological or mental health reasons, would press the red button — ask an AI to do something terrible that could cause the death of billions of people, like unleashing a new kind of extremely potent virus, or even mirror bacteria that could kill all animal life on this planet.\n\nThe International AI Safety Report identified three main areas of risk: unintended risk from malfunctions; malicious use; and systemic risk, such as loss of livelihoods. Which one is most likely to have a big impact in the short term? And which concerns you the most?\n\nMalicious use is already happening, but I think we're only seeing just the shades of it, with things like deepfakes and cyberattacks that are very likely to be driven by the most recent cyber capabilities of AI. We need to have much better guardrails to mitigate those risks. Those guardrails have to be both technical and political, meaning regulation or other kinds of incentives to make sure companies will do the right thing to avoid or mitigate those risks.\n\nWhat keeps me even more awake at night, of course, is the possibility of human extinction. That's why I pivoted my research to the question: How do we build AI that will not harm humans by design? And I now think that it is possible to do it. So it’s a big progress in my mind. I’m much more optimistic about this.\n\nIn this realm, you and your team have proposed the idea of the ‘Scientist AI’ with safety built in from the start. Tell us about that.\n\nThe way it’s designed is very much inspired by how human scientists go about understanding the world, and building models of the causal mechanisms and the laws of the world.\n\nThe Scientist AI is non-agentic. In other words, it has no goal, it has no intention. So, we can trust what it says. We can build systems that have the kind of ideal trustworthiness if we follow that path.\n\nNow, companies want to build agents — AIs that do things in the world, and actually scientists want to build AIs that help them design experiments, which is something you do in the world. You’re not just passively making predictions. The good news is that if you have good predictors, you can use them to construct guardrails, like predict whether an experiment or the action of an AI in a computer could give rise to bad outcomes and with what probability.\n\nHow was the International AI Safety Report received? Has it begun to have an impact on what governments do about AI?\n\nIt has. I’m really excited to see how much impact it's already having. What it has done is establish rigorously based on the scientific literature: what are the risks that we already understand? It also establishes what are the current mitigation approaches, and their limitations.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide",

          "abstract": "Carbon emissions are continuing to increase each year and are projected to rise by 1.1% by the end of 2025.Credit: Hendrik Schmidt/dpa via Alamy\n\nGlobal fossil-fuel emissions are likely to hit yet another record high this year, scientists announced today at the COP30 UN climate summit in Belém, Brazil, but there are signs that the world is approaching a peak. Indeed, some researchers argue that carbon dioxide emissions might have already begun to decline, and many think that overall greenhouse-gas emissions (including methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases) could begin to decline by the end of the decade.\n\nEmissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement production are projected to rise by 1.1%, to 38.1 billion tonnes of CO2 this year, according to data published on 13 November by the Global Carbon Project, an international consortium of researchers who track carbon emissions.\n\nOverall carbon emissions could decline slightly if a projected drop in deforestation and other land-use changes is factored in, but researchers warn that it’s still too early to say that the world has turned a corner on its fossil-fuel addiction (see When will carbon emissions peak?).\n\n“We don’t [project] the global inflection point until around 2030, unfortunately, but it does look like emissions are flattening off,” says Bill Hare, a physicist who is head of Climate Analytics, a non-profit consultancy in Berlin that analyses the impact of global climate policies.\n\nThe China factor\n\nAs it stands, greenhouse-gas emissions are around 10% higher than a decade ago, when the Paris climate agreement was signed, and a far cry from what is needed to limit warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, as called for under the agreement.\n\nEmissions among the major industrialized countries, which are responsible for the bulk of historical emissions, have been falling for more than two decades (see Which regions emit the most greenhouse gases?).\n\nHowever, they are rising nearly everywhere else. Although much of the focus tends to fall on rapidly developing juggernauts such as India and China, the growth is widespread as low- and middle-income countries seek to grow their economies and fulfil energy demands.\n\nBy far the biggest driver over the past two decades has been China, which now accounts for nearly one-third of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions. The main culprit is the country’s vast and still-growing fleet of coal-fired power plants, which burnt nearly 2.3 billion tonnes of coal last year, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nThere are signs of change, however, with China now leading the global clean-energy sector. The country is rapidly turning to electric vehicles as well as wind and solar energy and has committed to reduce overall greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 7% from peak levels by 2035. When China’s emissions peak, so, too, will global emissions, predicts Hare.\n\nHave China’s emissions already peaked?\n\nOthers argue that China’s carbon emissions have already begun to decline. Data from Carbon Monitor, a frequently updated data set that began tracking daily carbon emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest that China’s carbon emissions peaked in 2024 and will fall by 1.2% this year. Researchers at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a think tank based in Helsinki, have also documented a downward trend.\n\nAlthough the expansion of electric vehicles and renewable energy is having an impact, the biggest factor in the current decline is the collapse of the Chinese real-estate market, which has resulted in less demand for cement and steel, says Zhu Liu, an Earth-systems scientist at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\n\nEarth shattered heat records in 2023 and 2024: is global warming speeding up?\n\nGiven current energy and economic trends, as well as China’s climate goals, Liu says, emissions of CO2, at least, are likely to continue to decline. “I would say this is the peak of China’s carbon emissions,” Liu says.\n\nIf that’s the case, the question is whether emissions of other greenhouse gases, will follow.",

          "abstract": "Positive Tipping Points: How to Fix the Climate Crisis Tim Lenton Oxford Univ. Press (2025)\n\nEarth-systems scientist Tim Lenton has long been emphasizing the importance of ‘tipping points’ for climate change. In a seminal paper published in 2008, he and his co-authors identified several elements of Earth’s climate system that might shift to a different state irreversibly once physical thresholds are crossed (T. M. Lenton et al. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 105, 1786–1793; 2008). For example, the Greenland ice sheet, the Amazon rainforest and circulation patterns in the Atlantic Ocean could change suddenly as the world warms.\n\nThe race to uncover snow’s many mysteries before it disappears forever\n\nBreaches of climate tipping points are a reason for great concern and warrant rapid reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. Yet some types of tipping point could instead help to slow down climate change. Social ones, for example, could accelerate the transition to climate neutrality. Policies that have helped to reduce the cost of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, for example, have encouraged consumers and companies to use electric and renewable-energy sources. These trends are unlikely to be reversed even if such policies are revoked.\n\nIn Positive Tipping Points, Lenton takes a closer look at these social forces and discusses how they can be harnessed to avoid further drastic climate change. His engaging and thought-provoking discussion of how individuals can bring about positive tipping points and contribute to climate action is based on state-of-the-art research and packed with useful facts and figures. It is a breath of fresh air at a time when people are increasingly prone to feelings of ‘climate doom’, the idea that a climate catastrophe is unavoidable.\n\nBig changes\n\nThe first part of the book highlights that changes in the climate system and society are often non-linear and can occur rapidly. For systems with self-reinforcing feedback loops, a small perturbation might be enough to tip the climate system from one equilibrium state to another. For example, higher temperatures accelerate the melting of sea ice, reducing the amount of solar radiation that is reflected back into space, thus triggering further warming.\n\nPast tipping events include the transition, roughly 12,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the current Holocene interglacial period. Such drastic changes in environmental conditions had implications for human societies, too. The end of that big freeze enabled people to switch from foraging to farming as their main means of food production.\n\nOther wholesale cultural shifts might be expected in a warmer world. If humans are forced to live outside the climatic niche in which our societies evolved, social stability might be threatened. But other positive tipping points could emerge that work in favour of climate-change mitigation.\n\nPeople in Venice, Italy, plant trees to protect crucial salt-marsh ecosystems.Credit: Simone Padovani/Getty\n\nThe second part of Lenton’s book discusses how positive tipping points can help to avert a climate catastrophe. He includes numerous examples of how actions taken by small groups of people have resulted in large-scale social change. For example, Lenton describes how his aunt Lilian’s fight for women’s suffrage helped to change social norms, and how a small number of climate activists, such as Greta Thunberg, have sparked a global movement.\n\nThe author argues that the key to pushing social change towards a climate-friendly economy lies in feedback loops — progress in one area increases the probability of improvements in others. Social activism, alternative forms of democracy, technological progress and government policies could reinforce each other, allowing societies to overcome the current state of ‘carbon lock-in’ by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nSmall steps",

Chamois were rare then; the desire to learn about and protect them inspired me to become a biologist. Over the past 25 years, their population in my study area — the Northern Pindos National Park — has grown drastically, mainly thanks to a ‘human shield’ effect created by hikers visiting the upper parts of the Northern Pindos mountain range: their presence has made poaching more difficult.\n\nNow, I can easily see dozens of Balkan chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica) just a few hours from my village. In this picture, I’m counting them on the ledges of a cliff, one of their favourite habitats. We think that there are now around 1,000 individuals in the national park and nearby mountain ranges.\n\nStudying chamois requires the skills of a mountaineer and a scientist’s precision. My colleagues and I have built a habitat suitability model, based on elevation, vegetation, slope and human activity, and are testing it by checking for chamois presence in areas across northern and central Greece.

          "abstract": "Inside a laboratory at AstraZeneca, which is currently Britain’s most valuable company. Credit: Peter Byrne/PA via Alamy\n\nThe UK government says it wants to make Britain one of the top three places in the world to create, invest in and scale-up a fast-growing technology business. Launching the country’s industrial strategy earlier this year, ministers set themselves an ambitious target: to produce a domestic trillion-dollar company by 2035.\n\nPharmaceutical giants pull out of UK: why it matters for global science\n\nLast week, a report from a House of Lords committee poured cold water on the idea, arguing that the UK science-and-technology sector is, in fact, “bleeding to death”. The report warned that once a technology company reaches a certain level of success it’s likely to move to the United States. And with it would go the associated prosperity, including jobs and tax revenue.\n\nSo, can British science really produce a trillion-dollar technology company? And is such a goal even a good idea?\n\nNot everybody thinks so. “It’s a really silly target,” says Giles Wilkes, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government think tank who was a special adviser on industrial and economic policy to Theresa May when she was prime minister. “But it absolutely bewitches politicians.”\n\nIt is possible, however, he adds. The chances of such a UK corporate giant emerging within 20 years are about one in four, he says. “You never know, there might be some version of an obesity drug or something that can do it.”\n\nSize isn’t everything\n\nMeasured as market capitalization — the combined value of all traded shares — a trillion-dollar company would be almost four times the size of pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, Britain’s current biggest firm. Companies that reach the trillion-dollar mark often do so by exploiting a monopoly position in a large domestic market, Wilkes says.\n\n“That’s of dubious use to the whole economy. Companies that have gone from half a trillion dollars to three or four trillion dollars have not generated widespread prosperity,” he says. “It’s not the same as economic growth.”\n\nAndy Westwood, a public-policy researcher at the University of Manchester, UK, agrees. “It’s an odd way to express a strategic objective, because you could have a very successful industrial policy and not achieve that,” he says. But he thinks that more broadly, the government’s ten-year industrial strategy is good, and that having one is a good move for the United Kingdom. “The idea has gone in and out of fashion, not just in the UK but across lots of different countries.”\n\nGive UK science the overhaul it urgently needs\n\nThe government hopes that the industrial strategy will put the pieces in place to encourage the growth of a mega-company. It focuses on ways to encourage innovative research, help academics to commercialize discoveries and to put in place the financial support to allow rapid expansion. As a starting point, it seeks to support research and development in sectors including advanced manufacturing, clean-energy industries, defence, digital and technology businesses and the life sciences. That support comes in three main forms: funding, government procurement and changes to regulation.\n\nIt’s hard to predict whether such actions will produce anything approaching a trillion-dollar company, Westwood adds. Industrial strategies work on a very broad front, from improvements in infrastructure to targeted grants, making it impossible to know which measures are the most effective. And competing priorities can sometimes impede progress. The best such a policy can do is create what look like the most favourable conditions for successful businesses to thrive.",

For example, deforestation has substantially decreased since the start of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s latest term in 2023, and is now at its lowest rate for 11 years (see go.nature.com/442bqtp). As a member of the team in charge of the Ecological Transformation Plan at Brazil’s Ministry of Finance, I hope that our early successes will encourage other nations to proceed in a similar direction.\n\nFor real climate action, empower women\n\nTwo initiatives, in particular, could fundamentally reshape global climate finance — the funding systems that support climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. The first is the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), a fund ran by participating nations, with support from the World Bank, to help low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to preserve their tropical forests. The fund aims to reach US$125 billion in the coming years. An initial investment of $25 billion should come from nations and philanthropic organizations. Brazil has pledged to invest the first $1 billion, and other countries, including Norway, Indonesia, France and Germany, have announced substantial contributions. Another $100 billion is expected to come from capital markets, through the issuing of bonds that pay interest at the market rate.\n\nThe fund is made up of investments rather than donations — the distinction matters. Experience shows that aid flows are volatile and are subject to political winds and fiscal constraints in donor countries. The TFFF breaks this cycle. Here’s how it works: sponsors invest in the fund and receive annual returns that are comparable with those from low-risk sovereign bonds, at, say, 4%. The fund deploys this capital in a diversified portfolio of fixed-income assets, mainly bonds from emerging markets, with an expected yield of 7–8% (historically, a representative portfolio of diversified emerging-market bonds has paid out at around that rate). This portfolio excludes investments that finance fossil fuels or activities linked to deforestation.\n\nWhen mature, this mechanism could generate nearly $4 billion annually for forest conservation — rewarding ecosystem services and paying for anti-deforestation enforcement and capacity-building to foster the bioeconomy, such as biotechnology for pharmaceutical production.\n\nThe ‘implementation COP’: why the Belém summit must ratchet up climate action",

          "abstract": "The road to a first-author paper often isn't short or direct.Credit: Grant Ordelheide/Aurora Photos/Getty\n\nAs a fifth-year PhD candidate, I have a degree in not getting enough sleep and an unhealthy habit of scrolling through LinkedIn. My feed is a relentless highlight of everyone else’s successes: papers, major grants, coveted fellowships. And then there’s me, in a five-year-long, committed relationship with a massive project, in the field of neuroscience.\n\nIt’s not that I haven’t published anything. My name appears on co-authored papers that I’m proud of, collaborations in which I contributed data, analyses and expertise. But my own project was structured as a comprehensive story that kept expanding in scope, rather than as a series of publishable segments. This choice meant a longer road to first authorship compared with some of my peers, who were finishing projects and seeing their work published sooner. However, graduate students know that there’s a different gravity to first authorship. Co-authorship says ‘You were part of the story’, but first authorship says ‘This was your story to tell’.\n\nIt’s treated like the holy grail of the PhD journey, the golden ticket to a good postdoc, the milestone of independence and, in many programmes, the key to graduating. In a mid-sized laboratory such as mine, at Texas A&M University in College Station, landing a high-impact first-author paper isn’t just a personal win — it can be career-defining for the student and is a huge event for the lab. But it can also be a long, long wait.\n\n27 things we wish we’d known when we started our PhDs\n\nMy project began with a simple, elegant question: how does a little-known protein — a receptor that helps neurons to communicate — regulate flexibility in the brain’s learning circuits? The work quickly expanded, demanding new techniques and complex analyses. The results weren’t what we expected — and instead of answers, they led to more questions that had to be tested and untangled. Every new result came with the same question: do we publish a paper now, or do we hold off and build a single, ambitious story? The academic in me understood the power of the big narrative. The graduate student in me desperately wanted something to show for the years of work.\n\nThe tension between the desire to make the project as meaningful as possible and my own professional clock has been one of the hardest lessons of my PhD. Along the way, I’ve discovered three truths that reshaped how I think about progress.\n\nPlaying the long game\n\nThe hardest part of chasing a big paper isn’t the failed experiments or broken equipment. It’s the waiting. Without having something accepted or published, it often felt like my progress didn’t count.\n\nEventually, I realized that if I measured success only by a first-author paper, I’d buckle under the weight of waiting. I had to find other ways to recognize progress.\n\nI started noticing the number of skills I was building up. So, to keep myself honest, I made a simple spreadsheet. Each entry was proof of growth, and within months, I had dozens of examples. Mastering patch-clamp electrophysiology. Learning to run proteomics. Doing analyses that once made my head spin. These weren’t just chores on the road to publication, they were permanent upgrades to how I do science.\n\nWhat makes PhD students happy? Good supervision",

          "abstract": "James Watson shared in the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his role in elucidating the structure of DNA. Credit: AP Photo/AlamyAP Photo/Alamy\nJames Dewey Watson —who won the Nobel Prize for his role in divining the structure of DNA;was instrumental in initiating and propelling theHuman Genome Project; and who became notorious for his history ofracist and sexist comments— has died at 97.\n\nThe discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA paved the way for scientists to unravel the mechanisms behind genetic inheritance and how cells synthesize proteins. Gene therapies, the sequencing of the human genome and the development of monoclonal antibodies as treatments for cancer are just a few of the developments that would not have been possible without an understanding of DNA’s structure.\n\n“The elucidation of the structure of the double helix goes down, along with Mendel and Darwin, as the three greatest discoveries in biology,” says Bruce Stillman, president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, where Watson had various positions.\n\nLandmark paper\n\nWatson and Francis Crick, who worked together at the University of Cambridge, UK, solved the structure of DNA within a few years of their first meeting. In 1953, they published a seminal paper1 in Nature titled A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. Watson had just turned 25.\n\n“For him, nothing was impossible,” says Robert Martienssen, a geneticist at Cold Spring Harbor. “Nothing was out of reach.”\n\nBut the discovery of the DNA helix also became enmeshed in controversy. Watson and Crick elucidated the complex structure with the help of data and ideas from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, who were working at King’s College London at the time. Some of these data were shared without Franklin’s permission. Wilkins was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 with Watson and Crick. Franklin had died of ovarian cancer 4 years earlier at the age of 37, and so was ineligible for the award.\n\nWhat Rosalind Franklin truly contributed to the discovery of DNA’s structure\n\nWatson and Crick, “could have — and should have — requested permission to use the data and made clear exactly what they had done, first to Franklin and Wilkins, and then to the rest of the world”, wrote Matthew Cobb, and Nathaniel Comfort, historians of science at the University of Manchester, UK, and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, respectively, in a 2023 essay2 on Franklin.\n\nIn the aftermath of the discovery, Watson was particularly unkind about Franklin and dismissive of the role of women in science generally. In a best-selling book about the discovery of the double helix, he criticized Franklin’s appearance and wrote, “The thought could not be avoided that the best home for a feminist was in another person's lab.”\n\nNo answers\n\nColleagues who were close to Watson have long had to wrestle with his mixed legacy. Nancy Hopkins, a molecular biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that Watson convinced her to pursue her PhD, at a time when few women pursued careers in science. When she launched her own lab and feared she might not get tenure, Watson convinced her to push on. “Just keep working and when you come up for tenure, if the letters are good enough, you’ll get tenure. Or I’ll sue them,” Hopkins says Watson told her.\n\nHopkins later became a vocal advocate for women in science and says that she is just one of many women Watson trained and supported. She also says she is bewildered by Watson’s rhetoric on race.\n\nEnd racism in science\n\nA 2001 lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, left many in the audience stunned when Watson made remarks linking skin colour to sexual libido, and thinness to ambition.\n\n“That was the beginning of the end,” Hopkins says of the lecture. “What happened later on, I just don’t know the answer.”\n\nIn 2007, Watson abandoned a book tour after asserting that he thought Black people are less intelligent than white people. At the time, he was still active at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he had once been the director and had helped to make the lab a pre-eminent scientific institution. But he was removed from his leadership roles at the lab for his statements about race and intelligence. The institution severed ties with him completely after he made similar remarks in 2020. He also had a history of anti-Semitic comments, such as a 2007 remark that “Some anti-Semitism is justified.”\n\nInfluential textbook",

          "abstract": "Modern huskies have ancestral connections to early Arctic dogs.Credit: ventdusud/Panther Media Global via Alamy\n\nFrom Pomeranians to poodles, Saint Bernards to spaniels, dogs come in all shapes and sizes, a feature usually attributed to Victorian breeders.\n\nBut an analysis of skulls from than 600 ancient and modern dogs and wolves suggests that much of the diversity seen in present-day dogs emerged thousands of years ago1.\n\nThe analysis, together with a study of ancient dog genomes from central and eastern Eurasia2 — both published today in Science — offers clues about dogs’ origin story, but still no firm answers as to when, where or why they were first domesticated from wolves.\n\n“Dogs, from very early on in their relationship with humans, are a really important part of human cultures and society,” says Carly Ameen, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Exeter, UK, and co-author of one study.\n\nDistinctive skull shape\n\nOne challenge for scientists studying the origins of domestic dogs is that it can be hard to determine whether fossils, especially very old ones from the last Ice Age, belonged to dogs or wolves.\n\nTo address this, bioarchaeologists Allowen Evin, at CNRS University of Montpelier in France, and Carly Ameen, at the University of Exeter, UK, and their team compared three-dimensional scans of the skulls of 643 dogs and wolves that lived in the past 50,000 years.\n\nGenes unleashed: how the Victorians engineered our dogs\n\nThis analysis identified a distinctive dog skull shape — a shortened snout and widened face, compared to wolves — that was first seen in nearly 11,000-year-old fossils from northwest Russia. Earlier work had found that these specimens’ genomes also resembled that of domestic dogs3. Not long after, in dogs associated with late hunter-gatherers and early farming populations, there was “an explosion” in the variety of dog skull shapes and sizes, says Evin, capturing more than half of the diversity in today’s breeds.\n\n“We often assume that dog diversity emerged since the Victorian period over the last two centuries,” she says “But no — what we found is that from the beginning, there is a huge diversity, much more than what we expected.” Ameen adds that extreme skull shapes such as the flat faces observed in pugs and bulldogs aren’t found in the archaeological record, and must have come later.\n\nThe reason for this early dog diversity is not clear. It could represent early breeding efforts, as humans sought to adapt dogs to the needs of different populations, such as hunting, safety or even companionship, Evin says.\n\nLinked ancestries\n\nThe second Science study suggests that ancient human groups valued the distinctive features of their dogs. The team who carried out the research — which includes several authors in common with the skull study — sequenced the genomes of 17 dogs, found in East Asia and Central Eurasia, from the past 10,000 years, and compared them with previously published genomes from this period.",

          "abstract": "Geopolitical tensions are affecting international collaborations in key areas of research, including the semiconductor sector.Credit: Rebecca Bailey/AFP via Getty\n\nData indicate that geopolitical tensions are affecting how scientists around the world collaborate on research projects. But “rather than uniformly shrinking, global academic networks are being reconfigured”, says Marina Zhang, a technology and geopolitics researcher at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia. Collaborations with Israel and Russia, and between China and the United States, are among those seeing such shifts.\n\nScientific collaborations between Israeli researchers and academics in other countries have declined this year, following the war in Gaza, which began in October 2023 after Hamas attacks on Israel. The analysis, by Science|Business, a network of universities, companies and research and policy organizations, looked at patterns of co-authorship in preprints indexed in the Scopus database.\n\nCountries whose governments have been particularly critical of the Gaza war showed the biggest drops in collaborations with Israel. The percentage of all Israeli preprints that were co-authored with scientists in Spain fell from 9.2% in 2024 to 5.9% this year. Similarly, the proportion of Israeli preprints with South African co-authors declined from 3.4% in 2024 to just 1% this year (see ‘Research collaborations with Israel’).\n\nSource: sciencebusiness.net\n\nSome researchers who spoke to Nature say the data are an early indication that individual academics are boycotting Israeli science because of the war in Gaza. “This is a way of putting pressure on Israel,” says Giacomo Ortona, a nuclear physicist at Italy’s National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Turin. In September, Ortona was involved in a petition calling on CERN — Europe’s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland — to suspend cooperation with Israel.\n\nDavid Lehrer, director of the Centre for Applied Environmental Diplomacy at the Arava Institute, in Ketura, Israel, says the boycotts are having an impact on Israeli science. “We have recently encountered European countries such as Spain whose research institutes refuse to work with any Israeli research institute in applying for EU grants,” says Lehrer.\n\nBut Anat Paz, spokesperson for The Association of University Heads in Israel (VERA) says the data do not provide a full picture and that it is “too early to draw a conclusion” regarding the trend of collaborations involving Israeli universities. “We will have a much clearer picture once the complete data for 2025 has been compiled and reviewed early next year,” Paz adds.\n\nTop tips for building and maintaining international collaborations\n\nIn May 2024, VERA published a press release in response to a statement made by the Conference of Rectors of Spanish Universities (CRUE) expressing regret about the situation in Gaza, saying the association wishes to correct misunderstanding which “presupposes the possibility that Israeli academic institutions are not dedicated to peace and to international humanitarian law. [We] too mourn the loss of innocent life in this horrific conflict and want a better future for Palestinians and Israelis both. However, academic boycotts are dangerous and may very well cause more harm than good,” they wrote in the press release.\n\nRussian collaborations\n\nIndications of drop in collaborations between Israel and international research partners is part of a broader geopolitical story. A similar decline in global collaboration was seen with Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nUnlike individual scientists boycotting Israeli research, the decline in partnerships with Russia involves top-down policy statements from governments, most notably in the United States, “to reduce or eliminate scientific work with Russia”, says Caroline Wagner, a science-policy researcher at Ohio State University in Columbus.\n\nAn analysis by Nature in 2023 found research collaborations between Russia and Western institutions had dropped a year into its war on Ukraine. Some funders of these institutions and the Ukrainian government discouraged the co-authoring of papers with Russian researchers. This decline was not seen for China and India, whose collaborations with Russia increased the same year.\n\nA separate analysis published in August this year by VoxUkraine, an independent analytical platform based in Kyiv, found that global publications with Russian co-authors dropped by 26% between 2021 and 2024. These papers were also cited less — with an 89% drop in the number of citations these papers received in 2024 compared to 2021 (see ‘Sharp fall in citations with Russian papers).\n\nThese “formal restrictions” have changed research collaborations with Russia. “Sanctions, funding cuts, brain drain, and tighter state control have deepened the decline since 2022,” says Zhang.\n\nSource: voxUkraine.org\nUS-China collaborations\n\nDeclining rates of collaborations with individual countries such as Russia and Israel are part of a wide-ranging reconfiguration of global academic networks, says Zhang.\n\nPolitical tensions between the China and the United States have also affected collaborations between the two countries. China still remains the top partner of the United States, and Chinese scientists are increasingly leading joint projects with the United Kingdom, United States and Europe, but the number of Chinese research papers with US co-authors dropped by 6.4% between 2017 and 2023.\n\nChina–US research collaborations are in decline — this is bad news for everyone",

          "abstract": "The rules for the 2025 version of the influential Highly Cited Researchers list exclude scientists whose co-authors have engaged in practices such as a tendency to cite their own papers. Credit: Getty\n\nThe creators of an influential list of highly cited researchers have shaken up their methodology this year, taking a swipe at scientists who associate with those linked to possible ethical breaches. The new rules have allowed the field of mathematics to return to the list, after being excluded for the past two years owing to concerns over suspicious citation patterns.\n\nThe Highly Cited Researchers (HCR) list is produced by the multinational data-analytics company Clarivate, which also owns the Web of Science database. The list aims to recognize contemporary researchers with “significant and broad influence”, who are among the authors of papers that are in the top 1% in their field by number of citations. The programme recognizes thousands of individuals each year across 21 natural- and social-science fields and factors into influential rankings of universities.\n\nThousands of highly cited scientists have at least one retraction\n\nThis year, the list was compiled with a new step: exclusion of any papers with an author who had been knocked off the previous year’s HCR list owing to research-integrity issues. This means that anyone who routinely co-authored papers with someone who’d been excluded in the previous year was less likely to be acknowledged than before the change.\n\n“It’s quite a good idea. It’s a big cleaning,” says Lauranne Chaignon, a bibliometrician at PSL University in Paris, who has studied the HCR list1. There is, she adds, a small chance of removing a deserving scientist.\n\nThis year’s list, announced today, recognizes 6,868 people.\n\nGaming the system\n\nStarting around 2016, HCR organizers noticed a rise in suspicious activity in the data used to compile the list, says David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate’s Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). The issue became most pronounced in maths: a few people were publishing large numbers of papers, especially in the field of fractional differential equations. These authors frequently cited each other, causing others to fall off the HCR list. “A lot of these people were not known to us, and they were from institutions sometimes we’d never heard of,” says Pendlebury. “The world-famous mathematicians that we originally were seeing were disappearing.”\n\nMaths is particularly vulnerable to gaming because its metrics are small: mathematicians tend to publish fewer papers with fewer co-authors and citations than do academics in other fields2. “Just a few more citations into the system is quite disruptive,” says Pendlebury. As a result, Clarivate chose to omit the field entirely from the 2023 and 2024 lists.\n\nSimple fix\n\nThe process of constructing the HCR list starts with a ‘long list’ of about 200,000 papers and reviews that are in the top 1% in their field by citation count. The ISI team then whittles this down by removing retracted papers and those with more than 30 authors (on which it’s hard to determine individual contributions), for example.\n\nHundreds of extreme self-citing scientists revealed in new database",

To address this issue, we conducted a systematic search of databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, Business Source Ultimate, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, Medline; last updated May 2025) of empirical studies examining antecedents or outcomes of goal adjustment. Studies were eligible if they examined predictors or wellbeing/functional/goal-related outcomes of goal disengagement, goal reengagement, or goal-striving flexibility. We identified 1,421 effect sizes from 235 studies, which we categorized and mapped onto a conceptual model. Further, we used random-effects meta-analyses to examine the strength and direction of associations between model categories and goal adjustment variables. Despite relatively high-quality ratings (assessed using QualSyst), the overall standard of accumulated evidence was determined to be low to moderate due to the reliance on cross-sectional studies, risk of publication bias and high heterogeneity. Nonetheless, we identified associations between multiple antecedent categories and goal disengagement, reengagement and flexibility, as well as associations between these different aspects of goal adjustment and wellbeing, functional and goal-related outcomes. We conclude that different aspects of goal adjustment are predicted by unique combinations of antecedent variables, and predict distinct outcomes. Our conceptual model consolidates the literature on goal adjustment and provides a roadmap for a more systematic investigation of this field going forward.",

The results show that eye-specific rivalry arises from interocular inhibition between adjacent ocular dominance columns in the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex, but not between ocular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Eye-specific feedback from the intraparietal sulcus plays an active role in biasing and synchronizing local competitions in the primary visual cortex into perceptually coherent representations, even without awareness of eye-of-origin information. These findings reveal the mesoscale mechanisms of perceptual conflict resolution in humans: local conflicts in sensory input are resolved by inhibitory microcircuits in the sensory cortex, while feedback signals from the parietal attention network bias and integrate local competitions into unified conscious perception.",

          "abstract": "Sensorimotor feedback is a fundamental mechanism of active sensing. In olfaction, the primary motor behaviour is the sniff. Thus, in active olfactory sensing, we would expect the dynamics of the sniff to change according to detailed odour characteristics. Furthermore, percept-related modulations of sniffing behaviour should correspond to neural activity in participating brain regions. Here we analysed a high-precision functional MRI dataset including more than 4,300 sniffs per participant taken of 160 odours during ~18 hours of scanning, to probe the relationship between odour-induced sniff modulations and perceptual features at a high level of granularity. We found that fine-grained perceptual odour information—and even odour identity—can be decoded from sniffing dynamics, and that olfactory brain regions, particularly the amygdala, are involved in percept-driven modulation of sniffing behaviour. Thus, olfactory cortical areas participate in real-time modulations of sniffs according to perceptual properties of the odour at a high level of granularity.",

          "authors": "Atsunobu Suzuki, Kenta Ishikawa, Matia Okubo",
          "abstract": "People tend to form impressions of others’ trustworthiness based on their facial appearance and make trust-related decisions accordingly. In such face-based trustworthiness judgments (FBTJs), older adults are generally more likely than younger adults to attribute higher trustworthiness. This pattern is sometimes referred to as positivity bias and has been proposed as a potential risk factor for fraud victimization in later life. However, previous studies lack objective ground-truth measures of the actual trustworthiness of FBTJ targets, thus limiting their ability to assess the accuracy and bias of such judgments. To address this gap, we conducted three studies to examine age-related differences in FBTJ accuracy and bias using behavior in a trust game (Studies 1 and 2, Japanese participants) and records of political corruption convictions (Study 3, British participants) as ground-truth indicators of trustworthiness. In participant-level analyses, older adults demonstrated either higher accuracy (Studies 1 and 3) or comparable accuracy (Study 2) relative to younger adults. Furthermore, younger adults consistently tended to judge others as untrustworthy; however, older adults did not exhibit this negativity bias (Studies 1 and 2), and only a milder positivity bias emerged in Study 3. Although these age-related differences, particularly in accuracy, became less evident when face-level variability was considered, the overall results suggest that older adults perform as well as, or even better than, younger adults in terms of FBTJ accuracy and bias. This finding challenges the conventional view that older adults’ FBTJs are positively distorted and increase their vulnerability to deception.",

          "abstract": "Poverty is characterized by multidimensional economic, social, and psychological constraints that undermine people’s agency to pursue new opportunities and shape their life outcomes. How can interventions best support the agency of low-income individuals and, in so doing, boost poverty-reduction efforts? We theorize and find that agency interventions are effective when designed to be “culturally wise,” i.e., attuned to the model of agency predominant in a cultural context. Focusing on low-income women in rural Niger, Study 1 finds that local mental models of economic success primarily reflect interdependence, grounded in relational factors like advancing social harmony, respectfulness, and collective benefits. As evidenced by data from a United States sample, this contrasts with a more independent model common in the West grounded in personal factors like self-initiative. Study 2 finds empirical support for relational factors (e.g., subjective social standing) in addition to self-oriented personal factors (e.g., self-efficacy) as mechanisms of women’s economic advancement in a highly effective multifaceted poverty reduction program. Study 3 reports a field experiment with program participants (n = 2,628) to compare a Western-derived personal agency intervention and a culturally wise relational agency intervention each to a control. Only relational agency caused significant improvements in economic outcomes over 12 mo, as well as in some personal and relational outcomes. By contrast, personal agency showed limited effects, shifting only personal outcomes. These findings reveal the promise of research at the intersection of social and cultural psychology, behavioral science, and development economics to help address global poverty.",

          "abstract": "Theory predicts that metacommunities, or connected ensembles of local communities, can be stabilized by dispersal in the face of environmental changes. Using a 25-y dataset from 80 grassland sites embedded in a 2,800-ha landscape, we tested for stabilizing effects of connectivity, defined here as the amount of source grassland habitat within dispersal-relevant radii of each site. We found no relationship of connectivity to the temporal variability of total cover or estimated biomass, or to the retention of species diversity over time, and no predicted unimodal relationship of connectivity to species richness. Connectivity did show a predicted positive relationship to temporal species turnover, but this effect disappeared after accounting for livestock grazing history. These grasslands changed toward taller exotic annual grass species and lower species richness over the study period, regardless of connectivity or grazing history, and the richness-reducing shift to taller grasses was consistent with previously documented thermophilization, i.e., shift to warmer and drier species composition. Connectivity in this system appears not to stabilize local communities undergoing directional change.",

          "abstract": "Each year, hundreds of millions of people are sickened by diseases that are transmitted through mosquito bites, including dengue, Zika, and malaria. Mosquito biting does not occur uniformly throughout the day and peak biting times follow species-specific patterns. While host-associated cues, like carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), behaviorally activate human-biting mosquitoes to search for a host, the mechanisms that regulate these responses throughout the day remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce an automated behavioral tracking system to investigate time-of-day variation of CO 2 responsiveness in Aedes aegypti . We find that while acute responses to CO 2 remain consistently high throughout the light phase, response persistence peaks only at dawn and dusk, in alignment with field-observed biting rhythms. We identify the circadian neuropeptide Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF) as a key regulator in the daily timing of spontaneous locomotor activity and CO 2 response persistence. Mosquitoes lacking PDF show reduced activity and CO 2 persistence in the morning. In response to a blood meal baited with heat and human odorants, pdf mutants also show reduced feeding in the morning and midday. Additionally, loss of pdf impacts the spatial pattern of PDF immunostaining and cell-autonomous clock gene oscillation in the central circadian system. Notably, acute CO 2 responsiveness remains rhythmic without external zeitgeber cues and is unaffected in pdf mutants, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms for acute CO 2 activation versus response persistence. These findings reveal a circadian layer of control of mosquito activity pattern that temporally modulate host-seeking drive.",

          "abstract": "Cellulosic biomass represents a promising feedstock for biofuel and biochemical production. However, its recalcitrant structure strongly hinders enzymatic degradation. Cellulosomes are large multienzyme complexes, highly efficient at degrading cellulose. A cellulase in a cellulosome has a dockerin domain that binds to a cohesin module on the CipA (cellulosome integrating protein A). In a native cellulosome all cohesins are identical, so that the cellulase types and their positions in a CipA cannot be controlled. Here, we constructed the largest designer CipA known to date. Using innovative techniques, we synthesized a designer CipA gene that encodes nine distinct cohesins and two cellulose-binding modules, which we named DCipA2B9C . Then, we fused nine distinct fungal cellulases separately with nine distinct dockerins for their precise positioning on DCipA2B9C to achieve enzyme proximity-effect. We constructed three yeast hosts to compare their performances. First, an enzyme host (EH) secretes nine dockerin-fused cellulases, including endoglucanases (EgIII-a, EgIII-m, and EgIII-c), exoglucanases (CBHII-j and EXG2-r), β-glucosidases (BGS-f and BGS-l), and cellulase boosters, including a LPMO-t and CDH-b. Second, the scaffoldin host (SH) expresses DCipA2B9C. Third, the cellulosome-9 host expresses DCipA2B9C and nine dockerin-fused cellulases. Native-PAGE and ELISA confirmed specific interactions between dockerins and cohesins. Additionally, native-PAGE, SDS-PAGE, and LC-MS verified the successful assembly of the multienzyme complex. Our performance evaluation showed that coculturing of EH and SH outperformed the cellulosome-9 host. It degraded microcrystalline cellulose efficiently to produce 14.29 g/L bioethanol, which surpassed all previously constructed yeast cellulosomes by fourfold or more. In summary, our study provides an effective approach to biomass degradation.",

While innovative nanotherapeutic approaches offer improved drug delivery through targeting and stimulus-responsive release mechanisms, clinical translation is limited by poor tissue specificity and manufacturing limitations. We present a universal therapeutic hypothermia (TH, i.e., 32 to 35 °C)-enhanced strategy that amplifies nanocarrier targeting across multiple CVD models. Both hard and soft nanocarriers showed 1.6- to 3-fold increased pathological tissue accumulation under TH versus normothermia, correlating with enhanced therapeutic efficacy in multiple murine models of CVDs, including heart failure, myocardial hypertrophy, ventricular fibrillation, ischemic stroke, atherosclerosis, and deep vein thrombosis. Mechanistically, TH induces temperature-dependent enrichment of apolipoproteins C1 (ApoC1) and C4 in the protein corona of nanoparticle surface, enabling receptor-mediated targeting through upregulated lipoprotein receptors in injured cardiovascular tissues. Notably, ApoC1-mediated targeting outperformed established cardiac-targeting peptides in directing nanoparticles to diseased hearts. The TH-driven approach and direct ApoC1 functionalization provide a straightforward, scalable, and cost-effective approach to enhance nanotherapy precision for CVD treatment, potentially addressing critical barriers in clinical translation.",

The proposed strategy has enabled us to generate wall-free and self-powered microfluidic systems capable of both cargo transport and mixing along with the downstream flow. We analyze the performance of these active pumps, both isolated and within cooperative ensembles in terms of their output velocity and hydrostatic pressure buildup. Finally, we demonstrate strategies to incorporate them into specifically designed microfluidic platforms to advantageously tailor the geometry of active flows.

          "abstract": "The angrite parent body (APB) is the most volatile-depleted among known differentiated bodies in the Solar System, yet the mechanisms responsible remain poorly constrained. Here, we present high-precision nickel (Ni) isotope data from a suite of angrite samples to reconstruct the APB’s volatile depletion history. Plutonic angrites contain unusually high proportions of metallic iron and exhibit chondritic δ 60/58 Ni values (0.202 ± 0.028‰; per mille mass-dependent 60 Ni/ 58 Ni deviation relative to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material (SRM) 986). These observations are consistent with a homogeneous Ni isotope composition of the APB after core formation and the subsequent incorporation of endogenous core material in plutonic angrites. In contrast, a dunite and megacrystic olivines from volcanic angrites, derived from the mantle, display suprachondritic δ 60/58 Ni values (0.4 to 0.7‰). We argue that these values are consistent with Ni loss via evaporation during a high-energy impact that follows an initial stage of volatile loss from a magma ocean generated by 26 Al heating. Thermodynamic modeling confirms Ni to be more volatile than Mn, Fe, Si, and Mg during evaporation from silicate liquids, in agreement with the observed relative magnitude of isotopic fractionation. Volcanic angrite matrices show variable and often subchondritic δ 60/58 Ni values (down to −0.5‰), reflecting mixing with isotopically heavy megacrystic olivines and recondensation of light Ni vapor onto the crust. These findings imply that volatile elements are stratified (core–mantle–crust) in the APB and provide direct isotopic evidence for impact-driven vapor loss and recondensation on a differentiated planetary body.",

          "abstract": "China faces the challenge of simultaneously improving fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and ozone (O 3 ) air quality while tackling climate change. However, most studies have focused on either the cocontrol of PM 2.5 and O 3 or the synergy between CO 2 reduction and PM 2.5 improvement, leaving comprehensive strategies for tackling all three underexplored. Here, we evaluate various combinations of clean-air and climate policies in China using an integrated framework that consists of a technology-based emission projection model, a goal-oriented measure selection and optimization method, a chemical transport model, and a detailed cost–benefit assessment approach. Our results show that while maintaining current clean-air policies is effective in controlling PM 2.5 , their impact on O 3 remains limited. Maximizing cost-effective end-of-pipe measures targeting NO x and volatile organic compounds can achieve cocontrol of PM 2.5 and O 3 , but remain vulnerable to unfavorable meteorological conditions. Near-term climate policies alone contribute limited improvements in air quality, particularly for O 3 , due to the lower synergy between CO 2 and O 3 precursor emission sources. Only a combined strategy, integrating stringent clean-air actions and ambitious climate mitigation, can achieve the “triple control” of PM 2.5 , O 3 , and CO 2 . Under this strategy, national annual mean PM 2.5 and national O 3 -8 h 90th percentile concentrations are reduced to 19.1 μg m −3 and 126.9 μg m −3 by 2030, respectively, yielding net benefits of over 3,000 billion RMB.

Here, we identify a polymorphic effector (termed Bhe1) that exhibits a binary presence–absence distribution pattern among strains of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana . Gene deletion and overexpression in Bhe1- present strains revealed that this gene functions as a virulence factor against Drosophila species but dispensable for infection of mosquitoes, beetles, and locusts. Through targeted protein screening, we verified that Bhe1 targets a drosophilid-specific factor with an unknown function (termed Dsff1). The expression of Dsff1 is induced in Drosophila melanogaster upon fungal infection and is controlled by the Toll pathway. Survival of Dsff1 RNA interference (RNAi) flies was impaired after infection with the wild-type but not Δ Bhe1 strain of B. bassiana . Overexpression of Bhe1 and Dsff1 in D. melanogaster, respectively, suppresses and promotes fly antifungal immunity. Further investigations reveal that Dsff1 binds Bombardier (Bbd), and Bhe1 blocks their interaction. Consistent with Bbd’s role as a Toll-mediated immune factor, both Dsff1 and Bbd RNAi flies exhibit similar defects in the secretion of immune factors, including antifungal peptides. While revealing the mechanistic control of parasite host preference, our identification of a novel immune factor in Drosophila underscores a compelling instance of host–parasite evolutionary arms race.",

While these studies suggested no metal participation or the presence of a Zn 2+ ion in Mak16, we identify a previously unexplored iron–sulfur (Fe/S) cluster in yeast Mak16 through both in vivo and in vitro methods. We demonstrate a functional link between mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis and ribosome assembly, highlighting an overlooked aspect of 60S ribosomal biogenesis. Characterization of human and yeast Mak16 revealed a redox-active [4Fe-4S] 2+/1+ cluster with a midpoint potential below –500 mV. Oxidative stress destabilizes Mak16 and disrupts its interaction with Rpf1 in vivo, while in vitro H 2 O 2 causes [3Fe-4S] 1+ cluster formation. Our findings also reveal that upon binding to rRNA expansion segment 7 the redox properties of the nearby Fe/S cluster largely remain unchanged. However, disruption of Fe/S cluster coordination destabilized Mak16, impaired the Mak16–Rpf1 complex formation and decreased the 25S rRNA level. The critical role of Fe/S proteins in eukaryotic DNA replication and repair, mitoribosomal function, and maturation has now been extended to nuclear ribosomal assembly. Relying on a vulnerable cofactor comes at a cost, as cluster loss can severely disrupt essential cellular processes. The inherent biosynthetic complexity and instability of the Fe/S cluster of Mak16 allows it to function as sensor for redox imbalance, creating the possibility to regulate cellular homeostasis under stress.",

          "abstract": "Silica is the paradigmatic network glass-former and understanding its response to pressure is essential for comprehending the mechanical properties of silica-based materials and the behavior of silicate melts in the Earth’s interior. While pressure ( P )-induced changes in the short-range structure—particularly the breakdown of tetrahedral symmetry—have been well documented, structural transformations on larger length scales, important for many material properties, remain poorly understood. Here, we numerically investigate the three-dimensional structure of silica glass as a function of compression up to P ≈ 100 GPa. Using a many-body correlation function, we reveal a complex medium-range order: While for P ≲ 10 GPa, one finds tetrahedral, octahedral, and cubic symmetries, the structure at higher P s exhibits alternating cubic and octahedral particle arrangements. The P -dependence of the corresponding structural correlation length displays two distinct maxima, which permits to rationalize the anomalous compressibility of silica. The identified complex structural organization on intermediate range scales is the result of a pressure-and scale-dependent interplay between directional bonding, packing efficiency, and network stiffness. Since these competing effects are common in network glass-formers, the identified three-dimensional medium-range order, and hence the physical properties of the glass, are expected to be universal features of such materials under extreme conditions.",

          "abstract": "We show that the braiding of anyons in a quantum spin liquid leaves a distinct dynamical signature in the nonlinear pump–probe response. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques, we study the nonlinear pump–probe response of the toric code in a magnetic field, a model with mobile electric e and magnetic m anyonic excitations. While the linear response signal oscillates and decays with time like ∼ t − 1.3 , the amplitude of the nonlinear signal for χ XZZ ( 3 ) features a linear-in-time enhancement at early times and a stronger enhancement t α with α &gt; 1 at later times. The comparison between χ XZZ ( 3 ) , which involves nontrivial braiding of e and m anyons, and χ XXX ( 3 ) that involves trivial braiding of the same types of anyons, distinguishes the braiding statistics of anyons. We support our analysis with a hard-core anyon model with statistical gauge fields to develop further insights into the time dependence of the pump–probe response. Pump–probe spectroscopy provides a distinctive new probe of quantum spin liquid states, beyond the inconclusive broad features observed in single spin-flip inelastic neutron scattering.",

          "abstract": "Although Methoprene-tolerant (MET) is well established as the intracellular receptor mediating the genomic actions of juvenile hormone (JH) in insects, the identity of the receptor responsible for initiating extranuclear JH responses has remained elusive. In the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti , we identify the platelet-derived growth factor- and vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor related (PVR) protein as a key mediator of membrane-initiated JH signaling. JH treatment induces robust PVR phosphorylation in the fat body of adult female mosquitoes. Disruption of PVR function suppresses JH-induced activation of the phospholipase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways and impairs primary follicle growth during the previtellogenic stage. Strikingly, JH-induced PVR phosphorylation and downstream signaling require MET, specifically its ligand-binding activity, but not its DNA-binding domain. A subpopulation of MET localizes to the plasma membrane of fat body cells, where it physically interacts with PVR between 24 h postemergence and 24 h post–blood feeding, suggesting that membrane-localized MET functions as the extranuclear JH receptor. Transcriptomic analyses following RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of Met or Pvr demonstrate that PVR broadly contributes to JH-regulated gene expression. Notably, PVR-dependent signaling modulates genes that are also regulated by nuclear MET and enables JH to regulate additional gene sets independently of MET-mediated transcriptional regulation. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized MET–PVR signaling axis and support an integrated model of JH action in which membrane and nuclear pathways cooperate to enhance the specificity and complexity of JH function during the previtellogenic phase in mosquitoes.",

          "abstract": "Epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation plays a fundamental role in tumor lineage plasticity (LP). However, the underlying mechanisms, especially for the initial events of LP development, are still poorly understood. Here, we report that in progression of prostate cancer from adenocarcinoma to treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC), anti-androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) reprogram the function of circadian regulator/nuclear receptor REV-ERBα by switching its target gene programs from kinase signaling and metabolic programs to programs of LP, which includes neurogenesis, stem cell, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition as well as over fifteen LP drivers including POU3F2/BRN2, ASCL1, FOXA2, ONECUT2, and MYCN. Unexpectedly, REV-ERBα facilitates the chromatin occupancy of BRN2, ASCL1, and FOXA1 in their activation of LP programs, thus functioning as a master regulator of ARSI-induced LP driver network. Mechanistically, REV-ERBα induces chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac modification at promoters of LP genes through its recruitment of BRD4 and p300. Overexpression of REV-ERBα alone is sufficient to induce LP and neuroendocrine phenotype and confers resistance to ARSI in adenocarcinoma cells. Loss of REV-ERBα potently inhibits NEPC cell growth and abolishes the expression of LP drivers and gene programs. Pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERBα exhibits high potency in blocking the growth of NEPC tumors including patient-derived xenografts. Our findings reveal that therapy-induced LP development entails a coordinated induction of a network of LP drivers and that REV-ERBα is an unexpected master regulator of the network and a promising therapeutic target for treatment of advanced prostate cancer such as NEPC.",

The α 1 -antitrypsin Z variant self-assembles into polymer chains that deposit within hepatocytes, predisposing to liver disease. Here, the 4.0Å subunit structure of polymers isolated directly from human liver tissue has been determined using cryoelectron microscopy. Challenges of flexibility, small subunit size, heterogeneous length, and preferred orientations were mitigated using antibody Fab domains and sample preparation strategies. This structure demonstrates that the formation of polymers in vivo involves self-incorporation of an exposed structural element (the reactive center loop) as an additional β-strand into the central β-sheet of α 1 -antitrypsin and displacement of a C-terminal region from one subunit with incorporation into the next. Unlike amyloid aggregation, this well-folded structure partially recapitulates a conformation adopted during normal function of the protein. These perturbations to the constituent α 1 -antitrypsin subunits of human tissue-derived polymers are consistent with a pronounced stability, their tendency toward long-chain forms, the ability of a subset to undergo canonical secretion, and the action of a class of small molecules that block polymerization in vivo.",

Tropical environments are undergoing intense rates of environmental change, and these changes may be driving large declines in genetic diversity.

The degree to which diversity loss has occurred in tropical species, particularly marine species, remains an open and important question. Here, we directly compare genomic data from modern and museum collections of two commercially harvested nearshore marine fishes ( Equulites laterofenestra and Gazza minuta ) gathered from a single location in the Philippines, spanning a century of intense environmental change. These data reveal a marked loss in genetic diversity and evidence for multiple orders of magnitude reductions in effective population size ( N e ) in both species, indicating substantial genomic erosion. Such a decline highlights the long-lasting genomic consequences of anthropogenic activity and sheds light on an, until-now, invisible loss of diversity from the most biodiverse ocean region.",

Using MC1Re/e mice lacking functional MC1R, we demonstrate impaired wound healing marked by delayed reepithelialization and increased neutrophil extracellular traps—pathological features observed in human CWs. To investigate MC1R’s therapeutic potential, we developed a new murine CW model that replicates human pathology, presenting as nonhealing, exudate-rich ulcers. Topical application of the MC1R-selective agonist BMS-470539 restored healing by reducing exudate production, stimulating vascularization, and enabling reepithelialization. The critical role of MC1R was further evidenced by MC1Re/e mice, which developed more severe ulcers with excessive exudate and NETosis. In acute wound studies, we found that topical MC1R agonist enhanced wound bed perfusion and lymphatic drainage through increased angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and reduced scarring by modulating fibroblast phenotype. Together, these findings establish the MC1R/POMC axis as a fundamental regulator of skin repair and identify promising therapeutic strategies to drive healing.",

We show angle dependence in Cholodny–Went-based auxin asymmetry and growth response, which we tracked back to angle-dependent variation in PIN asymmetry and statolith sedimentation in the columella.

In particular, the existence of disorder–order or order–order transitions has been increasingly reported in experimental and simulation studies, and the electrode potential identified as the corresponding driving force. The microscopic mechanisms and the stages of the process are, however, poorly understood, and the free energy variation during the transition remains insufficiently characterized. To fill this gap, we investigate the crystallization of the adsorbed layer in a prototypical molten salt–metal interface. We demonstrate that the transition from the disordered to ordered structures proceeds in two stages. Preordering effects are observed across a wide range of potentials, resulting in the formation of a polycrystalline structure on the electrode surface, before an abrupt ordering transition finally occurs. The preordering displays signature of a continuous transition. On the other hand, finite-size effects analysis proves the first-order character of the transition toward the monocrystalline state. Upon increasing the system size, a shift in the onset applied voltage is observed, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the free energy barrier. The latter reflects in the interfacial capacitance, which displays a peak that sharpens with increasing system size.",

Recent fluorescence experiments underscored the pivotal role of GPCR–G protein complex lifetime in their coupling efficiency and selectivity. However, these experiments are often expensive, time-consuming, and limited to a small number of GPCR–G protein systems. On the other hand, it is challenging to simulate GPCR–G protein dissociation using molecular dynamics (MD) methods. Here, we have employed Protein–Protein Interaction Gaussian accelerated MD (PPI-GaMD) simulations and experiments to probe the kinetics and pathways of G protein dissociation from GPCRs. For five systems with published experimental kinetic data, PPI-GaMD simulations successfully captured G protein dissociation from the GPCRs, including the adrenergic, adenosine, and muscarinic receptors. The simulations allowed identification of two distinct dissociation pathways and calculation of the G protein dissociation rates, which were in good agreement with experimental data. Additionally, we simulated the effect of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the adenosine A 1 receptor (A 1 R) in Gi protein dissociation and supported simulation findings with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor experiments evaluating G βγ kinetics following A 1 R activation. A 1 R PAMs were found to strengthen the agonist–receptor and receptor–G protein interactions and significantly reduce dissociation rates of the Gi protein. In summary, complementary PPI-GaMD simulations and kinetic assays have enabled detailed characterization of the kinetics and pathways of G protein dissociation, a critical event in the GPCR signaling cascade, and the effects of GPCR allosteric modulators.",

          "abstract": "Memories are believed to be stored in synapses and retrieved by reactivating neural ensembles. Learning alters synaptic weights, which can interfere with previously stored memories that share the same synapses, creating a trade-off between plasticity and stability. Interestingly, neural representations change even in stable environments, without apparent learning or forgetting—a phenomenon known as representational drift. Theoretical studies have suggested that multiple neural representations can correspond to a memory, with postlearning exploration of these representation solutions driving drift. However, it remains unclear whether representations explored through drift differ from those learned or offer unique advantages. Here, we show that representational drift uncovers noise-robust representations that are otherwise difficult to learn. We first define the nonlinear solution space manifold of synaptic weights for fixed input–output mappings, which allows us to disentangle drift from learning and forgetting and simulate drift as diffusion within this manifold. Solutions explored by drift have many inactive and saturated neurons, making them robust to weight perturbations due to noise or continual learning. Such solutions are prevalent and entropically favored by drift, but their lack of gradients makes them difficult to learn and nonconducive to future learning. To overcome this, we introduce an allocation procedure that selectively shifts representations for new stimuli into a learning-conducive regime. By combining allocation with drift, we resolve the trade-off between learnability and robustness.",

          "abstract": "In Drosophila, germline cysts arise through synchronous mitotic divisions and acquire a polarized architecture organized by the fusome, which guides oocyte specification and supports meiotic progression. Similar cyst structures exist in nonmammalian vertebrate ovaries, but their polarity and function have remained uncertain. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution imaging, we reconstructed the germ cell differentiation trajectory in Xenopus laevis and uncovered striking parallels with invertebrate and mouse cyst development. We identified a distinct germline stem cell (GSC) population marked by piwil4 , low translational activity, and expression of neuronal-specific and transposon-silencing genes. Downstream from GSCs, during cyst development, an asymmetric fusome-like structure composed of stable microtubules forms a rosette-like connection between cystocytes and contains Golgi vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting polarized trafficking. In contrast to previous claims, ~80% of cyst cells turned over rather than forming oocytes, consistent with a nurse cell fate. The striking parallels described here between cyst and fusome formation, polarization, cyst breakdown, and nurse-like cell turnover to produce relatively few oocytes argue that amphibian cysts have important functions in female gametogenesis.",

          "abstract": "The vascular cambium contains bifacial stem cells producing secondary phloem in one and secondary xylem to the opposite direction. In Arabidopsis roots, these stem cells are first established adjacent to primary xylem cells suggesting that undifferentiated primary xylem cells function as stem-cell organizers. Here, we show that auxin transport-guided auxin accumulation in the cells with primary xylem identity (PXI cells) within the root apical meristem defines the vascular cambial stem-cell organizer already during the primary development. Ablation of PXI cells or transient interference of auxin transport resulted in respecification of stem cells within the vascular bundle in a scattered manner. Similarly, ablation of cells with secondary xylem identity (SXI cells) in the mature vascular cambium resulted in the regeneration of SXI cells from stem cells within the same radial cell files. Reciprocally, ablation of stem cells in mature vascular cambium led to respecification of new stem cells from adjacent SXI cells. Thus, in response to injury, xylem identity cells and stem cells form an interchangeable unit, which we propose to define as a stem cell niche. Successful respecification of stem cells required functional auxin transport and presence of undifferentiated xylem cells. Overall, our findings reveal that undifferentiated secondary xylem functions as the stem cell reservoir and highlight the key role of auxin transport-mediated auxin accumulation in stem cell positioning during cambium development and regeneration.",

However, SERK5, the closest paralog of BAK1/BKK1, is long considered a nonfunctional kinase due to a mutation in the conserved arginine-aspartic acid (RD) motif within its kinase domain. Here, we show that artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated cosilencing of BAK1 / BKK1 / SERK5 induces autoimmunity, which is more severe than that observed in bak1 bkk1 double mutants. Complementation with the amiRNA-resistant mSERK5 , but surprisingly not with mSERK5Km encoding an ATP-binding-deficient SERK5, rescues this autoimmunity. Knockout of ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 , a central component of plant immunity with important functions in effector-triggered immunity (ETI), or BAK-TO-LIFE 2 , a surveillance protein sensing BAK1/BKK1 perturbations in immunity, partially suppresses the amiRNA-mediated autoimmunity. The bacterial elicitor elf18 swiftly upregulates SERK5 expression. BAK1 / BKK1 / SERK5 cosilencing seedlings complemented with mSERK5 maintain wild-type levels of elf18-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, while overexpression of SERK5 , but not unrelated SERK1 or SERK2 , restores normal elf18-induced MAPK activation in bak1 null protoplasts. These findings unmask a substitute coreceptor role for SERK5 in elf18 signaling, and suggest that plants can monitor and discriminate between concurrent BAK1/BKK1/SERK5 inactivation and BAK1/BKK1 depletion to fine-tune the severity of downstream ETI responses.",

The early onset and moderate severity of the US 2022–2023 influenza season may have resulted from reduced use of nonpharmaceutical interventions or lower population immunity after 2 y of limited influenza virus circulation. We used a mathematical model of influenza virus transmission that incorporates vaccine-derived protection against both infection and severe disease to estimate the impact of influenza vaccines on healthcare burden. Assuming reported levels of past vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection and hospitalization, we estimate that influenza vaccines prevented 69,886 (95% CI: 51,860 to 84,575) influenza-related hospitalizations nationwide during the 2022–2023 season, with 57% attributable to reduced susceptibility and onward transmission. Despite limited data on VE against infection, our analyses suggest substantial indirect protection, particularly from young adults to other age groups. This is supported by a significant negative correlation between young adult (aged 18 to 49 y) vaccination rates and observed hospital burden across US states. Among those aged ≧65 y, nearly half of averted hospitalizations resulted from vaccinating younger age groups. These findings highlight the need for better estimates of influenza VE against infection and the potential benefits of increasing young adult influenza vaccination rates to reduce both direct and indirect disease burden.",

          "abstract": "Presynaptic active zones (AZs) perform essential functions in orchestrating speedy and accurate neurotransmission. Despite extensive studies on their molecular constituents, it remains unclear how transsynaptic signals are organized at AZs. The two members of the CASKIN family of multidomain scaffold proteins, CASKIN1 and CASKIN2, bind to several AZ proteins and LAR receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), and thus likely contribute to presynaptic assembly. Analysis using conditional knockout (cKO) mice deficient for CASKIN1 and/or -2 revealed that CASKIN2, but not CASKIN1, is critical for proper synaptic transmission, synaptic strength, and AZ protein arrangement at glutamatergic synapses. CASKIN1/2 deletion recapitulates Caskin2 -cKO phenotypes. Strikingly, presynaptic CASKIN2 at hippocampal CA3 neurons specifically regulates postsynaptic N -methyl- D -aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated responses, NMDAR surface expression, and long-term potentiation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Moreover, PTPσ-mediated tyrosine dephosphorylation and multimerization of CASKIN2 are critical for the ability of CASKIN2 to regulate excitatory synaptic transmission, NMDAR functions, and activity-dependent presynaptic F-actin rearrangement. Last, the presence of CASKIN2 and PTPσ at Schaffer collateral circuits contributes to proper novel object location memory in mice. Our findings establish crucial roles of CASKIN2 in orchestrating LAR-RPTP-mediated transsynaptic NMDAR-related synaptic functions.",

CR increases Sirt6 levels, and its beneficial effects are mediated by the gasotransmitter H 2 S, a one-carbon pathway product. Yet, the role of this pathway in Sirt6-regulated longevity remains elusive. Here, we show that Sirt6 controls hepatic one-carbon metabolism, preventing the aging-dependent H 2 S reduction, and the elevation of the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Sirt6 downregulates Slc7a11 expression in an Sp1-dependent manner, decreasing cystine uptake and increasing Cgl H 2 S production activity. Additionally, comparative acetylome in old livers revealed Sirt6-related differential acetylation of most of the one-carbon enzymes. Specifically, Sirt6-dependent Matα1 K235 deacetylation reduces its SAM production activity and Cbs binding, thereby reducing its activation of Cbs-dependent H 2 S production. The net outcome is H 2 S and SAM levels as observed in young animals. Thus, we unveil a fundamental mechanism for the promotion of healthy longevity by Sirt6.",

Whether and how this process is controlled are not clear. Here, we show that Chlamydomonas MAK (CrMAK), related to mammalian ICK/MAK, regulates axonemal microtubule assembly by phosphorylating FAP256/CEP104, a microtubule plus-end tracking protein. CrMAK, primarily present in cilia, associates with the axoneme via its C-terminal tail, and is enriched at the ciliary tip during active ciliary assembly. It is constitutively active during this process and acts downstream of a ciliary length-regulatory complex composed of LF1, LF3, and LF2, a CCRK homologue. Loss of CrMAK or its kinase activity leads to aciliated cells. CrMAK interacts with and phosphorylates FAP256/CEP104 and dephosphorylation of FAP256/CEP104 impairs ciliary assembly.

A simple experimental model is constructed in which the elastic sheet is initially stretched and floats on a free surface. When the sheet retracts rapidly from the initially stretched state, the imbalance of the shear stresses exerted on the sheet causes the tip to flutter. Because of this tip flutter, the free surface becomes unstable, breaking up into separated liquid ligaments, and the tip flutter wavelength matches the spacing of the liquid ligaments. Furthermore, the contraction of the sheet induces the formation of wrinkles, particularly when the length of the retracting sheet becomes less than its original length. The tip flutter and wrinkle wavelengths increase with the bending rigidity and original length of the sheet, while they decrease with the initial strain of the sheet. A scaling relation between the experimental parameters and wavelengths is also established, using the balance between the dominant forces for each of the retraction and tip flutter/wrinkling processes.",

We develop a framework for identifying metastasis regulators using CRISPR/Cas9-based screening in a genetically defined organoid model of colorectal adenocarcinoma. We conduct in vitro screens for invasion and migration alongside orthotopic, in vivo screens for gain of metastasis in a syngeneic mouse model. We identify CTNNA1 and BCL2L13 as bona fide metastasis-specific suppressors which do not confer any selective advantage in primary tumors. CTNNA1 loss promotes cell invasion and migration, and BCL2L13 loss promotes anchorage-independent survival and non-cell-autonomous changes to macrophage polarization.

Stem cells in the shoot apical meristem form much of the plant body, but only those in the L2 can form gametes. This raises the question of whether the mutation rate is optimized for this developmental plan. To test this, we compare stem cell mutations accumulated over decades of clonal propagation in two potato varieties with those arising during leaf-cell regeneration. By sequencing DNA from layer-enriched cell fractions, we found that variant allele frequencies in whole-leaf DNA can predict a mutation’s layer of origin. We further observed that mutations accumulate independently in L1 but jointly in L2 and L3. In cultivar Desiree, L1 mutation rates were fourfold higher than in deeper layers, suggesting germline-progenitor protection. In Red Polenta, layer-specific DNA from regenerants marked by a periclinal chromosomal translocation revealed a similar, though subtler, bias, with L1 exhibiting a 1.6-fold higher rate. In stark contrast, mutations during regeneration of differentiated cells were fiftyfold more frequent and bore a pronounced 8-oxoguanine signature confined to intergenic regions. Across all samples—and consistent with enhanced repair or purifying selection—the genic mutation rate was less than half that of intergenic regions. These findings indicate that plants employ mechanisms to restrict mutations according to cellular context and genomic region and suggest that the layered organization of angiosperm meristems evolved to balance genetic fidelity with adaptability",

A major impediment is the paucity of therapeutically useful phages and the great variation in the phage infection profiles, especially among Mycobacterium abscessus clinical isolates. These limitations—together with the abundance of mycobacteriophage genes of unknown function—could be addressed by synthetic genetic construction of viruses in which undesirable genes can be eliminated and genetic payloads can be readily added. However, the relatively high G+C% content of mycobacteriophage genomes (64.1%) can be challenging for DNA synthesis using phosphoramidite chemistry, and the genomes are relatively large (40 to 150 kbp) for assembly and rebooting in a bacterial host. Here, we demonstrate efficient de novo synthesis of high G+C% DNA fragments using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase chemistry, the reconstruction of complete mycobacteriophage genomes using High-Complexity Golden Gate Assembly, and efficient rebooting via electroporation into Mycobacterium smegmatis . Using this approach, we synthesized the genomes of phages BPs (41.9 kbp, 66.6% G+C%) and Bxb1 (50.5 kbp, 63.6% G+C%), and constructed variants carrying targeted mutations or added payloads.

This land management practice offers numerous economic and ecological advantages over conventional tillage as evidenced by its rapid expansion since the 1960s, now practiced on 15% of the global arable land. Nevertheless, various crops exhibit persistent yield losses even decades after transition to NT. Here, we demonstrate that the promise of beneficial and sustainable soil management may be undermined by a gradual and invisible threat of subsoil compaction. We report on a risk of subsoil compaction stemming from the episodic passage of heavy machinery (e.g., harvesters). The threat is of dynamic and asymmetric nature whenever compaction events occur more frequently than the natural rates of soil structure recovery, resulting in a gradual increase in soil degradation. Our analyses show that nearly 40% of global NT lands (0.8 million km 2 ) are under high subsoil compaction risk (primarily in heavily mechanized Canada, United States of America, and Brazil). Awareness and mitigation of subsoil compaction by scaling field operations to soil mechanical limits and adoption of smaller robotic vehicles will contribute to a sustainable and holistic conservation agriculture.",

However, the mechanisms promoting this noncanonical translation remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2) as a key eIF2α kinase that enhances RAN translation under proteotoxic stress. We show that MARK2-eIF2α signaling, activated by misfolded proteins including DPRs and TDP-43, is upregulated in C9-ALS patient tissues. Loss of MARK2 significantly suppresses RAN translation in reporter cells, patient-derived neurons, and a mouse model and confers neuroprotection under proteotoxic conditions.

Their use in bacteria has led investigators to conclude that a wide array of cellular stresses owe their toxicity to the formation of ROS. However, in the present study we find that this dye reacts too poorly with physiological concentrations of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide to signal their presence, and that lethal doses of hydroxyl radicals are dispersed among too many intracellular targets for the dye to be detectably oxidized. Instead, common redox moieties inside the cell—including flavins, quinones, and metal centers—capably oxidize the dye. Indeed, the dye is oxidized as rapidly inside anaerobic cells as inside aerobic ones, refuting any involvement of ROS. The ability of diverse stresses to increase the dye signal derives from the fact that both the reduced and oxidized forms of the dye are continuously exported by protonmotive force-driven pumps. Any stress or growth condition that diminishes the cellular energy charge has the effect of slowing these pumps and thereby causing an increase in the intracellular dye signal. Therefore, the unfortunate combination of ROS-independent dye oxidation plus stress-driven metabolic slowdowns have led investigators to conclude incorrectly that diverse stressors generate ROS. Those conclusions, including ones involving clinical antibiotics, must be reconsidered.",

          "abstract": "Abnormal blood vessels limit the delivery and function of endogenous T cells as well as adoptively transferred Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells in tumor microenvironment (TME). We recently showed that vascular normalization using anti-VEGF therapy can overcome these challenges and improve the outcome of CAR-T therapy in glioblastoma models in mice. Here, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to simulate the dynamics of both adoptively transferred CAR-T cells and endogenous immune cells in solid tumors following vascular normalization. Similar to our data, our model simulations show that vascular normalization reprograms the TME from immunosuppressive to immunosupportive by enhancing infiltration of endogenous CD8 + T cells and CAR-T cells, increasing M1 macrophages, and reducing M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells, thereby improving efficacy. Strikingly, vascular normalization reduces the number of infused CAR-T cells needed for tumor control by approximately fivefold. Moreover, synchronizing a second CAR-T infusion at their peak proliferative phase maximizes antitumor function. Furthermore, the efficacy of CAR-T cells engineered to secrete anti-VEGF antibody depends on the ability of CAR-T cells to induce vascular normalization. Additionally, combining vascular and stromal normalization can improve the efficacy of anti-VEGF antibody-producing Fibroblast Activated Protein-CAR-T cells for the treatment of desmoplastic tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Finally, the model predicts that local CAR-T delivery can sustain high concentrations within the TME and induce recruitment of other antitumor immune cells, improving outcomes. Our model provides a versatile framework to optimize dosing strategies, treatment sequencing, and delivery routes for improving CAR-T therapies for solid tumors.",

In the first application of this experimental platform, the stability of the pair beam is studied as it propagates through a meter-length plasma, analogous to TeV γ -ray-induced pair cascades in the intergalactic medium. It has been argued that pair beam instabilities disrupt the cascade, thus accounting for the observed lack of reprocessed GeV emission from TeV blazars. If true, this would remove the need for a moderate strength intergalactic magnetic field to explain the observations. We find that the pair beam instability is suppressed if the beam is not perfectly collimated or monochromatic, hence the lower limit to the intergalactic magnetic field inferred from γ -ray observations of blazars is robust.",

          "abstract": "The unique, hypnotic pulsation behavior of certain soft corals of the Xeniidae family, the result of rhythmic opening and closing of their tentacles, has fascinated scientists since the 18th century. Repetitive motion is regulated by autonomous neural circuits known as pacemakers or central pattern generators. However, little is known about such circuits in nonbilaterian organisms like corals. In this report, Xenia umbellata , a fast-growing octocoral, served as a model organism to study the muscular and neural mechanisms of pulsation. Leveraging this coral’s rapid regeneration ability, we tested somatic regrowth and pulsation recovery following oral disc amputation. Transcriptomic analysis upon transitioning from nonpulsation to intermediate and synchronized pulsation during regeneration demonstrated shared pulsation-related genes in X. umbellata and bilaterians, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved rhythmic machinery. Pharmacological interference experiments supported transcriptomic findings, showing that acetylcholine regulates pulsation and anoctamin channels affect pacemaker rhythm. Interestingly, in the intermediate pulsation phase tentacles could pulsate individually without synchronization, suggesting the development of separate pacemakers. At the synchronized pulsation phase a dense nerve net developed around the mouth opening and overlapping muscle fibers between tentacles, providing the mechanisms for tentacle synchronization. However, when polyp tentacles were cut into small pieces, the fragments remained alive and each retained independent pulsation, revealing a unique pacemaker system driven by a diffuse nerve network lacking any centralized control. This finding uncovers a mechanism of rhythmic behavior generation in nonbilaterian animals, which could represent either a lineage-specific innovation or an ancient origin for more centralized control.",

          "abstract": "Conjugation accelerates bacterial evolution by enabling bacteria to acquire genes horizontally from their neighbors. Plasmid donors must physically encounter and connect with recipients to allow plasmid transfer, and different environments are characterized by vastly different encounter rates between cells, based on mechanisms ranging from simple diffusion to fluid flow. However, how the environment affects the conjugation rate by setting the encounter rate has been largely neglected, mostly because existing experimental setups do not allow for direct control over cell encounters. Here, we describe the results of conjugation experiments in Escherichia coli in which we systematically varied the magnitude of shear flow using a cone-and-plate rheometer to control the encounter rate. We found that the conjugation rate increases with shear until it peaks at an optimal shear rate ( γ ˙ = 1 × 10 2 s − 1 ), reaching a conjugation rate fivefold higher than the baseline set by diffusion-driven encounters. This optimum marks the transition from a regime in which shear promotes conjugation by increasing the rate of cell–cell encounters to a regime in which shear disrupts conjugation. Regions of high fluid shear are widespread in aquatic systems, in the gut of host organisms, and in soil, and our results indicate that these regions could be hot spots of bacterial conjugation in the environment.",

While mechanobiology has primarily focused on factors such as cell-generated contractility and mechanical properties of extracellular matrix, a interesting mechanobiological paradigm highlights the role of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping epithelial tissues. In our study, we developed an in vitro model of cell-coated microsized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) which allows to decipher the interplay between cellular activities and tissue mechanics. Drastic, isotropic MHS compressions were observed once the epithelia reached confluence. Further studies revealed that the compression was a process independent of cell contractility but rather regulated by active transepithelial fluid flow. Compressive stresses of about 7 kPa are generated by such an active hydraulic mechanism. Tissue homeostasis is then maintained by a fine balance between cell proliferation and extrusion. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of fluid transport in generating mechanical forces within epithelial tissues. Supported by a theoretical mechanohydraulic model, a mechanistic framework for understanding the intricate interplay between cellular processes and tissue mechanics was established. These results challenge traditional views of epithelial tissue mechanics, emphasizing the pivotal influence of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping tissues. We anticipate that this study will advance the understanding of epithelial tissue development, the maintenance of homeostasis, and the mechanisms underlying pathological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Covert visual attention allows the brain to select different regions of the visual world without eye movements. Predictive cues of a target location orient covert attention and improve perceptual performance. In most computational models, researchers explicitly incorporate an attentional mechanism that alters processing at the attended location (gain, noise reduction, divisive normalization, biased competition, Bayesian priors). Here, we assess the emergent neuronal mechanisms of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that exhibit behavioral signatures of covert attention, despite lacking a built-in attention mechanism. We use neuroscience-inspired approaches to analyze 1.8 M units of CNNs trained on the cueing paradigm. Consistent with neurophysiology, we show early layers with retinotopic neurons separately tuned to the target or cue, and later layers with neurons with joint tuning and increased cue influence on target responses. CNN computational stages mirror a Bayesian ideal observer (BIO), but with more gradual transitions. The cue influences the target sensitivity through four mechanisms. A BIO-like cue-weighted location summation, and three mechanisms absent in the BIO: an opponency across locations, a summation/opponency location combination, and interaction with the thresholding Rectified Linear Unit. Reanalyses of mice’s superior colliculus neuronal activity during a cueing task show CNN-predicted but previously unreported cue-inhibitory, location-summation, and location-opponent cells in addition to the commonly reported cue (attention) excitatory cells. The single-unit CNN analysis approach establishes a likely system-wide characterization mediating covert attention and a framework to identify new neuron types and emergent computational mechanisms contributing to perceptual behavior.",

Limited treatment options lead to renal failure in the vast majority of affected individuals. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Recent evidence has identified inflammation as an important driver of ADPKD. We analyzed transcriptional profiles in an orthologous Pkd1 mouse model and found a strong upregulation of the inflammasome pathway. To investigate the role of inflammasomes on cyst formation and kidney function, we modulated inflammasome activity through genetic targeting of the essential inflammasome component Pycard/Asc or treatment with the inflammasome inhibitor MCC950. Genetic deletion of Pycard/Asc in Pkd1 mutant mice significantly reduced cyst formation, and kidney function was improved. Reductions were seen in inflammation, fibrosis, and urinary excretion of IL-18. Analogous results were obtained through tubule-specific inactivation of Pycard/Asc or treatment of Pkd1 mutant mice with the inflammasome inhibitor MCC950. These findings demonstrate that inflammasomes act as drivers of disease severity in an orthologous mouse model of ADPKD. We pinpoint a separate, epithelial pool of inflammasomes in the diseased kidney and identify inflammasome inhibition as a promising strategy for the treatment of ADPKD.",

Using a massive-scale, first-principles study, we show that while reacting with p -block elements under increasing pressure from ambient to Earth core conditions, iron tends to reverse its redox nature, changing from an electron donor (reductant) to an electron acceptor (oxidant), and oxidizes many p -block elements. Such reverse redox propensity significantly impacts the stoichiometries, bond types and strengths, structures, and properties of iron compounds under deep planetary conditions. This change transforms many p- block elements (conventionally labeled lithophile or chalcophile) into highly siderophile species. The chemical binding strengths with iron show an inverse correlation with the depletion of p -block elements in the silicate Earth. Furthermore, silicon shows a distinct anomaly in its bonding to iron, which suggests silicon may readily be incorporated into Earth’s core.",

We also show how further interactions with the ribosomal complex are necessary to properly position RF2 for polypeptide release.

This relationship holds across major phylogenetic groups, suggesting a general biogeographical rule for range size variation. Our findings indicate that latitudinal and elevational gradients in range size arise from selective pressures and species sorting based on climatic tolerance. Additionally, we show that species with larger range sizes tend to be ecologically dominant, supporting a long-suspected connection between range size, niche breadth, and local and regional abundance. Our results suggest a spectrum of dominance, where species with extensive geographic ranges and broader climatic tolerances tend to be more abundant.

Mechanistically, Dpf2 deficiency leads to loss of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks at Cacna1d enhancer, impairing Cacna1d messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and reducing intracellular calcium. Consequently, loss of Dpf2 attenuates mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling activity, promoting an anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization.

We also showed that our strategy significantly improved the biosynthesis of other products such as sesquiterpene β-elemene and phenolic acids.

          "abstract": "Macrophages rely on dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements to respond to their environment. This plasticity supports biomechanical transitions and functional polarization, mediating tissue homeostasis, antimicrobial defense, and repair processes. In the tumor environment context-specific reprogramming leads to functional diversification, from antitumorigenic to immunosuppressive phenotypes. Altering cytoskeletal dynamics modifies macrophage behavior and holds promise to shift their profile toward desired features. Here, we show that abolishing the activity of the serine/threonine kinase PAK2 transforms macrophage properties, resulting in abundant membrane expansion and amplified engulfment of diverse targets. Simultaneously, PAK2 is essential to coordinate endosomal receptor trafficking including SIRPA recycling to the cell surface. In vivo PAK1 and PAK2 cooperate in restraining oxidative responses, and in maintaining cytokinetic fidelity and gut barrier integrity to safeguard from a macrophage-driven hematologic malignancy associated with low-grade inflammation. Targeted interference with PAK2 holds promise in immunotherapy by harnessing hyperphagia and SIRPA sequestration for accelerated cancer cell killing.",

Here, we measured and modeled wing displacement fields and characterized spatiotemporal encoding of the wing mechanosensors. Our data show how dragonfly wing architecture prescribes deformation modes consistent across models and measurements. We found that the wing’s state under normal flapping conditions is detected by the spike timing of few sensors, with additional sensors recruited under perturbation.

          "abstract": "Mammalian cells sense and respond to environmental changes using a complex and intelligent system that integrates chemical and mechanical signals. The transduction of mechanical cues into chemical changes modulates cell physiology, allowing a cell to adapt to its microenvironment. Understanding how the chemical and mechanical regulatory modules interact is crucial for elucidating mechanisms of mechanosensation and cellular homeostasis. In this study, we find that cells exhibit nonmonotonic changes in cell volume and intracellular pH when subjected to physical stimuli and varying degrees of actomyosin cytoskeleton disruption. We find that these nonmonotonic responses are mediated by a chemical compensation mechanism, where the attenuation of actomyosin activity stimulates the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway. This, in turn, activates sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), resulting in elevated intracellular pH and increased cell volume. Furthermore, we identify a competitive interaction between the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways—two major regulators of cell proliferation and motility. This competition modulates the chemical compensation based on the relative activities of these pathways. Our mathematical modeling reveals the network structure that is essential for establishing the nonmonotonic response. Interestingly, this regulatory system is altered in HT1080 fibrosarcoma, highlighting a potential mechanistic divergence in cancer cells in contrast to their normal-like counterpart, such as NIH 3T3 and HFF-1 fibroblasts. Overall, our work reveals a compensatory mechanism between chemical and mechanical signals, providing an infrastructure to elucidate the integrated mechanochemical response to environmental stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Electrokinetic transport of nanoparticles in porous media is crucial for separation technologies, but the boundary-field coupling effects in three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous spaces remain challenging to understand. Using superresolution 3D tracking of nanoparticles in interconnected cavities, we observed an unexpected disconnect between cavity escape time and directional bias as a function of electric field strength. The cavity escape times of individual nanoparticles decreased dramatically even with weak fields (2 V/cm), enhancing effective diffusion. However, directional bias was negligible at low field strengths, and became significant only for stronger fields (~7 V/cm). Simulations revealed that at low field strengths, when Brownian motion dominated the nanoparticle dynamics [Péclet number (Pe) &lt; 0.005], the transport was stochastic with accelerated random exploration and cavity escape without directional preference, facilitated by the coordination of weak electrophoresis and electroosmotic (EO) recirculating flow. The combined effect creates localized vortices that position particles closer to internal boundaries, increasing exit encounter probability. At larger Pe values, electrophoretic forces start to overcome the apparently random motion, and establish a preferred migration direction through the porous network. These findings demonstrate the delicate balance between Brownian fluctuations, electrophoretic force, and EO flow in interface-confined and interconnected environments, providing mechanistic insights for optimizing electrokinetic separation in chromatographic columns, separation membranes, and nanocargo delivery systems.",

Mining these data holds significant potential for enhancing disease diagnosis and prognosis, though challenges remain, especially in noncancer contexts. In this study, we developed a statistical framework that links raw histological images and their derived features to the genotype, transcriptome, and chronological age of the samples. We first demonstrated an association between image features and genotypes, identifying 906 image quantitative trait loci (imageQTLs) significantly associated with image features. Next, we identified differentially expressed (DE) genes by stratifying samples into image-similar groups based on image features and performing DE comparisons between groups. Additionally, we developed a deep-learning model that accurately predicts gene expression in specific tissues from raw images and their features, highlighting gene sets associated with observed morphological changes. Finally, we constructed another deep-learning model to predict chronological age directly from raw images and their features, revealing relationships between age and tissue morphology, especially aspects derived from nucleus features. Both models are supported by a computational approach that greatly compresses gigapixel whole-slide images and extracts interpretable nucleus features, integrating both large-scale tissue morphology and smaller local structures. We have made all interpretable nucleus features, imageQTLs, DE genes, and deep-learning models available as online resources for further research.",

The sliding clamp loader is a conserved AAA+ ATPase that binds the sliding clamp, opens the ring, and places it onto DNA. While recent structural work on both the canonical and “alternative” clamp loaders has shed light into how these machines perform their task once, it remains unclear how clamp loaders are recycled to load multiple sliding clamps. Here, we present structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC) in absence of sliding clamp or supplemented nucleotide. Our structures indicate that RFC holds onto ADP tightly in at least two of its four ATPase active sites, suggesting that nucleotide exchange is regulated. Our molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical data indicate that binding of the sliding clamp Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) causes rapid exchange of tightly bound ADP. Our data suggest that PCNA acts as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) by prying apart adjacent subunits, providing a pathway for ADP release. We propose that, by using its own substrate as a NEF, RFC excludes off-pathway states that would arise from binding DNA prior to PCNA.",

A set of autophagy-related (ATG) regulators are recruited to the phagophore assembly site for phagophore initiation, including its expansion and closure, and subsequent delivery into the vacuole. However, it remains elusive how the phagophore assembly is regulated under different stress conditions. Here, we described an uncharacterized Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) ERC (ELKS/Rab6-interacting/CAST) protein family as an interacting partner of ATG8. ERC1 proteins translocate to the phagophore membrane and develop into ring-like autophagosomes upon autophagic induction. Notably, we found that ERC1 proteins possess the ability to assemble into substantial droplets together with ATG8e proteins prior to ATG8 conjugation to the membrane. Through multiscale characterization, we demonstrated that the ERC1 membraneless droplet represents a distinct type of plant condensate. Additionally, ERC1 directly binds to NBR1 to promote NBR1 degradation. ERC1 dysfunction suppresses the turnover of ubiquitinated substrates and compromises plant tolerance to heat stress. Our study suggests a model for autophagic degradation in response to heat stress by the action of ERC1-mediated biomolecular condensation in Arabidopsis .",

Through a comprehensive simulation study and the analyses of eight publicly available ST datasets from various tissues and technologies with different resolutions, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MMM in identifying cell-type-specific SVGs. Notably, our integrative analysis with genome-wide association studies reveals that the cell-type-specific SVGs identified by MMM in a mouse brain study exhibit significant heritability enrichment in brain-related phenotypes. This finding suggests that cell-type-specific SVGs play a vital role in elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. When applying MMM to analyze a high-resolution Xenium human breast cancer dataset by accounting for the uncertainties in cell segmentation, we find that certain cell-type-specific SVGs may contribute to cell–cell communications, thereby regulating the tissue microenvironment. Furthermore, we show the versatility of MMM by applying it to the 3D tissue models constructed from multiple ST slices, highlighting its utility in analyzing the 3D ST data.",

While bone marrow injury, such as by bone fracture, disrupts marrow vasculature, the consequences for local oxygen tension remain unclear. Here, we show in mice that while the tissue oxygen tension in bone marrow is low (25 mmHg, ~4% O 2 ), intracellular oxygenation is heterogeneous, and erythroid cells are high in oxygen. Bone fracture elevates oxygen tension in the injured bone marrow (&gt;55 mmHg, ~8%), which persists for over a week postinjury. This oxygen elevation results not from angiogenesis, but rather from localized expansion of erythroid precursor cells in the injured bone marrow. Injury-activated erythroid precursors synthesize hemoglobin and concentrate oxygen at the injury site; however, blocking transferrin receptor 1 (CD71)-mediated iron uptake impairs hemoglobin synthesis, reduces local oxygen levels, and enhances bone regeneration through increased angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Together, these findings identify erythroid precursors as active regulators of local oxygen availability in the bone marrow niche, which may be targetable to enhance tissue regeneration.",

Its interpretation however is unclear, as Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments in the Andreev and tunneling regimes show two distinct energy scales whose origin is mysterious. We show using a Green’s function formulation that the two energy scales cannot be understood as a SC gap in the Andreev spectra and a pseudogap in tunneling. We also show that the ballistic Andreev regime can never be realized in moire SCs as the large mismatch in the Fermi velocity v F of the flat-band SC and the STM tip renormalizes a transparent interface toward the tunneling regime. We discuss self-energy corrections to v F that determines the conductance. Finally, we model the Andreev experiment as a circular metallic disc embedded in an unconventional SC. With strong v F mismatch the low bias conductance is dominated by tip-induced Andreev bound states, responsible for the low energy scale distinct from the SC gap seen in tunneling.",

In this work, we demonstrate that thick-electrode fast charging is constrained by solvent withdrawal within porous electrodes and the resulting electro-osmotic drag polarization, which is driven by cation-induced electro-osmotic drag. To reduce electro-osmotic drag polarization, we designed electrolytes with weak cation solvation and strong anion solvation, where a difluorinated solvent weakens lithium-cation solvation and its difluoromethyl hydrogen atoms enhance anion solvation through hydrogen bonding. This electrolyte enables thick-electrode, energy-dense batteries to achieve 80% charge within 13 minutes.",

          "abstract": "Dogs exhibit an exceptional range of morphological diversity as a result of their long-term association with humans. Attempts to identify when dog morphological variation began to expand have been constrained by the limited number of Pleistocene specimens, the fragmentary nature of remains, and difficulties in distinguishing early dogs from wolves on the basis of skeletal morphology. In this study, we used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyze the size and shape of 643 canid crania spanning the past 50,000 years. Our analyses show that a distinctive dog morphology first appeared at about 11,000 calibrated years before present, and substantial phenotypic diversity already existed in early Holocene dogs. Thus, this variation emerged many millennia before the intense human-mediated selection shaping modern dog breeds beginning in the 19th century.",

Mechanisms by which the first-strand cDNA becomes stably inserted duplex, including requirements for junction formation at the cDNA 3′ end and second-strand synthesis, are unknown. We screened for cellular factors that influence site-specific transgene synthesis into the human genome by an R2 retrotransposon protein. We discover that insertion lengths and junction signatures differ based on alternative repair processes involving ATR-dependent Polymerase θ end-joining, 53BP1-directed Shieldin/CST-Polα-primase fill-in synthesis, or limited strand annealing dependent on CtIP-MRN. These insights shed light on how genome-primed cDNA synthesis by a non-LTR retrotransposon protein can support stable new gene insertion, with major implications for native retrotransposon mobility and genome engineering.",

In this work, we show that Ms4a7 is up-regulated in cDC1s after tumor antigen uptake or exposure to exogenous stimuli and is required for their cross-priming ability. Although Ms4a7 −/− mice showed normal cDC1 development and turnover, they failed to prime antigen-specific CD8 + T cells following infection or tumor development. In human cancers, MS4A7 was expressed in a subset of cDC1s, preferentially enriched in dLNs, and correlated with patient survival.

We identified genes encoding a predicted nuclease paired with a trypsin-like protease repeatedly acquired by multiple, otherwise unrelated antiviral immune systems in bacteria. Cell-based and biochemical assays revealed the nuclease is a proenzyme that cleaves DNA only after activation by its partner protease. Two distinct immune systems, Hachiman and AVAST (antiviral adenosine triphosphatase/nucleoside triphosphatase of the STAND superfamily, Avs), use the same mechanism of proteolytic activation despite their independent evolutionary origins. Examination of nuclease-protease inheritance patterns identified caspase-nuclease ( canu ) genomic loci that confer antiviral defense in a pathway reminiscent of eukaryotic caspase activation. These results uncover the coordinated activities of pro-nucleases and their activating proteases within different immune systems and show how coevolution enables defense system innovation.",

The new data matrices and 10 published datasets were analyzed in 785 topology tests conducted using integrative phylogenomics, a method that unifies concatenation and coalescence to identify genes with a consistent phylogenetic signal. All 490 statistically significant tests supported the sponge-sister hypothesis and none supported the ctenophore-sister hypothesis; the remaining 295 tests were inconclusive. These results provide compelling evidence for the sponge-sister hypothesis and suggest that integrative phylogenomics provides a robust and powerful approach for disentangling branches in the tree of life.",

The basis for these phenotypes remains obscure. We found that loss of ARPC5, but not the ARPC5L isoform, in the mouse hematopoietic system caused early-onset intestinal inflammation after weaning. This condition was initiated by microbiota breaching the ileal mucosa and led to systemic inflammation. ARPC5-deficient macrophages and neutrophils infiltrated the ileum but failed to restrict microbial invasion. Specifically, macrophages that lack ARPC5 struggled to phagocytose and kill intracellular bacteria.

Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects whereas combined loss markedly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing indicated that loss of PIEZO function reduced expression of connexin43 ( Gja1 ), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction.

The integrated stress response (ISR) is elicited by phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2, which traps and inhibits rate-limiting translation factor eIF2B thereby attenuating translation initiation. Termination of this pathway thus requires relieving eIF2B from P-eIF2 inhibition. Here, we found that eIF2 phosphatase subunits PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B (R15B) bound P-eIF2 in complex with eIF2B. Biochemical investigations guided by cryo-EM structures of native eIF2-eIF2B and P-eIF2-eIF2B complexes bound to R15B demonstrated that R15B enabled dephosphorylation of otherwise dephosphorylation-incompetent P-eIF2 on eIF2B. This sheds light on ISR termination, revealing that R15B rescues eIF2B from P-eIF2 inhibition, thereby safeguarding translation and cell fitness.",

Angstrom-level thickness control and subangstrom smooth layers enable quantum-confined photoluminescence of CsPbBr 3 from monolayer, bilayer, and through to bulk. The interfacial structure controls the electronic structure from a Cs‒PEA-terminated interface (type II heterojunction) to a PEA‒PEA-terminated interface (type I heterojunction), with a layer-tunable band offset shift exceeding 0.5 electron volts. Electron transfer from CsPbBr 3 to PEA 2 PbBr 4 for a type II Cs‒PEA heterojunction results in delayed electron-hole recombination beyond 10 microseconds.

Most natural epivariants that we tested can be inherited without DNA sequence changes and are therefore bona fide epialleles, although genetic factors modulate their recurrence or persistence.

          "abstract": "Health polarization has emerged as a critical factor shaping public health attitudes and behaviors, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides a systematic review of the key determinants driving health polarization, highlighting the complex interplay of political, social, economic, and psychological factors. By synthesizing findings from 90 studies, we identify six primary drivers: political ideology and partisanship, misinformation and disinformation, social media structures and dynamics, trust in health institutions and professionals, risk and public health perceptions, and socioeconomic factors. Our analysis reveals how these determinants reinforce societal divisions, exacerbate health inequalities, and influence adherence to public health measures. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for designing effective interventions that address the root causes of health polarization. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these divisions is essential for mitigating their negative impact on public health and fostering more cohesive, evidence-based health communication strategies.",

A representative sample of 2089 U.S. citizens evaluates whether universities should engage in initiatives such as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), free speech, and environmental sustainability, benchmarking views against corporations. We include an incentivized experiment asking respondents to allocate money between universities based on performance on various dimensions. Results show broad support for engagement in initiatives related to environmental sustainability, well-being, and free speech but opposition to political engagement. Views on DEI are polarized: Women and liberals reward universities excelling in DEI but conservatives and men penalize them, even when academic performance is equal. These findings highlight the polarization surrounding universities’ societal roles.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate text, raising urgent questions about whether their judgments are consistent, unbiased, and robust to framing effects. Here, we examine inter- and intramodel agreement across four state-of-the-art LLMs tasked with evaluating 4800 narrative statements on 24 different topics of social, political, and public health relevance, for a total of 192,000 assessments. We manipulate the disclosed source of each statement to assess how attribution to either another LLM or a human author of specified nationality affects evaluation outcomes. Different LLMs display a remarkably high degree of inter- and intramodel agreement across topics, but this alignment breaks down when source framing is introduced. Attributing statements to Chinese individuals systematically lowers agreement scores across all models and, in particular, for DeepSeek Reasoner. Our findings show that LLMs’ own judgment of agreement with narrative statements exhibit systematic bias from framing effects, with substantial implications for the neutrality and fairness of LLM-mediated information systems.",

Here, we test whether mass shootings increase electoral participation using the most granular dataset to date. We draw information on mass shootings from the Gun Violence Archive and estimate national block group-level turnout using four snapshots of the national voter file. Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we find that mass shootings mobilize local voters (especially in heavily Democratic areas) but do not shift presidential vote choices. Furthermore, we show that pre-election mass shootings were associated with increased support for a 2016 Californian gun reform ballot initiative. Our results show the (geographically bounded) salience of mass shootings for local political engagement and ballot reform efforts.",

          "abstract": "How nationalism spreads and is reinforced has long been debated. This study examines how nationalistic messages and sentiments propagate on Chinese social media, focusing on interactions between celebrities and fans. We analyzed more than 8 million Weibo microblogs and comments, classified their content using machine-learning techniques, and examined the dynamics between celebrities and fans. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings reveal that fans exert a stronger influence on celebrities than vice versa in spreading nationalism. Fans often shape the nationalist narratives that celebrities amplify, with those aligned with specific political leanings (e.g., within the state-conformist camp) having a greater influence. These results highlight the critical role of grassroots online communities in shaping nationalism in nondemocratic contexts, offering insights into the dynamic interactions between the masses and influential figures in reinforcing nationalist ideologies and sentiments.",

          "abstract": "Social networks are shaped by complex, intersecting identities that drive our connection preferences. These preferences create tie inequalities: Systematic differences in the number of links members of different groups accumulate. Understanding tie inequalities is critical because they contribute to disparities in social capital, with downstream consequences for access to opportunities and resources. Previous research has examined the impact of single-dimensional identities on tie disparities, but when multiple identities intersect, network disadvantages accumulate nonlinearly, disproportionately harming individuals belonging to several disadvantaged groups. However, how multidimensional connection preferences affect network dynamics and amplify or mitigate differences in ties remains unknown. Using a network model, we characterize the effects of multidimensional preferences and attribute correlation. We find that correlation creates counterintuitive tie inequalities unobservable in one-dimensional systems. We calibrate the model with high school friendship data and derive closed-form expressions for tie inequalities, which reproduce the empirical patterns with remarkable accuracy. Our findings have substantial implications for addressing intersectional inequalities in social networks.",

          "abstract": "Using original data from the Family Incarceration Costs Survey, we present national estimates of the direct financial costs of family member incarceration. We find that most Americans with an incarcerated family member provide them direct financial support. The median monthly direct expense among those who contribute is $172, which represents 6% of their household income. On average, Blacks and Hispanics incur higher direct expenses than whites despite their lower household incomes. Men and women contribute similar amounts, but these direct expenses reflect a larger share of women’s household income. Poor families’ direct expenses are comparable to those of affluent families and are similar to their spending on health care, utilities, and car-related costs. Together, these results suggest that familial incarceration is a prominent line item that strains marginalized families’ already-tight household budgets and is a substantial yet underappreciated mechanism through which mass incarceration has reshaped the texture of American poverty in recent decades.",

          "abstract": "Complementary integrated circuits in an elastic format are essential for systems toward emerging applications in wearable health monitors, soft robotics, and implantable medical devices. However, their development is very nascent, largely owing to the imbalance of p- and n-type elastic transistors. Here, we report fully stretchable complementary integrated electronics combining elastic n-type transistors based on metallic carbon nanotube (CNT)–oped poly{[ N , N ′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} with p-type transistors using semiconducting CNT networks. The layered elastomer-semiconductor-elastomer architecture provides both type transistors with stable, well-matched electrical characteristics up to 50% strain. Using these components, we demonstrate stretchable digital logic gates—including inverters, NAND, and NOR—which retain function under large strain. As a system-level demonstration, a complementary inverter active matrix integrated with a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator array realizes a stretchable tactile sensing skin. The stretchable complementary integrated electronics demonstrated here hold promise in many fields, particularly these require seamless integration with dynamic living systems.",

The clinically most advanced TBV candidate contains part of the Pro-domain (Pro) and Domain 1 (D1) of Plasmodium falciparum surface protein Pfs230. Subunit vaccines that contain other domains of Pfs230 have so far failed to induce functional antibodies. Here, we produced eight single-domain fragments of Pfs230 in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells and assessed their immunogenicity in mouse immunizations. In addition to D1-specific antibodies, antibodies raised against D12 showed strong functional transmission-reducing activity in membrane feeding assays with cultured parasites, an activity that was complement dependent. Murine D12-specific antibodies further reduced mosquito transmission of parasites acquired from naturally infected parasite carriers.

Here, we identify two insecticidal proteins in Paeniclostridium ghonii , designated PG-toxin 1 (PG1) and PG-toxin 2 (PG2), which are homologs of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). Unlike BoNTs, PG1 and PG2 contain two separate proteins: One is the protease light chain (LC), and the other is the heavy chain containing the translocation domain and the receptor binding domain. Crystal and cryo–electron microscopy structures show a conserved BoNT-like architecture but without an interchain disulfide bond. Functional characterizations establish that the LCs of PG1 and PG2 cleave insect synaptosomal–associated protein 25 (SNAP25), but not human or rat SNAP25, and microinjection of PG1 and PG2 caused paralysis and death in Drosophila and Aedes mosquitoes. These findings identified unique two-component BoNT-like insecticidal proteins, revealing insights into the evolution of the BoNT family of toxins, and broadening our understanding of bacteria that can be used for biopest controls.",

This study highlights the crucial role of tropical cyclones (TCs) in disrupting MHWs by altering ocean temperatures. As demonstrated by Tropical Cyclone Bavi, intense sea surface temperature (SST) cooling, reaching up to 7°C, immediately terminated a mature MHW and suppressed subsequent MHW development for up to 8 months. More generally, on the basis of post-TC MHW cases (reoccurring within 1 month) during 2014 to 2023, we found that MHW disruption duration is proportional to the magnitude of TC-induced SST cooling, ~5 to 7 days per degree of cooling. At a broader scale, a 20-year (2004 to 2023) analysis revealed 99% significant inverse relationships between seasonal MHW and TC activity. These findings suggest that TCs can act as natural regulators, effectively mitigating heat stress from MHWs and potentially serving as a lifeline for marine ecosystems.",

LsSCPL2 and LsSCPL4 catalyze the synthesis of chicoric acid using caftaric acid as the acyl acceptor. In contrast to the BAHD acyltransferases found in Echinacea species, LsSCPL1 and LsSCPL3 alter their substrate preferences through key amino acid substitutions and use tartaric acid as the acyl acceptor to synthesize caftaric acid. These tandemly duplicated SCPL genes are observed across several evolutionarily related species within the tribe Cichorieae.

Two key mechanisms shape this inheritance: the bottleneck, which drives stochastic transmission of maternal mtDNA variants, and purifying selection, which actively removes mutant mtDNA. Whether these mechanisms interact has been unresolved. To address this question, we generated a series of mouse models with random mtDNA mutations alongside alleles altering mtDNA copy number or decreasing autophagy. We demonstrate that tightening the mtDNA bottleneck increases heteroplasmic variance between individuals, causing lower mutational burden and nonsynonymous-to-synonymous ratios. In contrast, reduced autophagy weakens purifying selection, leading to decreased interoffspring heteroplasmic variance and increased mutational burden with higher nonsynonymous-to-synonymous ratios. These findings provide experimental evidence that the mtDNA bottleneck size modulates the efficacy of purifying selection. Our findings yield fundamental insights into the processes governing mammalian mtDNA transmission with direct implications for the origin and propagation of mtDNA mutations causing human disease.",

Estimates from satellite data show a heat gain between 16.4 ± 3.4 and 21.78 ± 0.62 zettajoules during the past six decades. The global ground heat storage presents a positive acceleration between 0.16 ± 0.15 and 0.624 ± 0.032 zettajoules per square decade, similarly to the rest of components of the Earth heat inventory.

Whether GLP-1 dysregulation directly links diet-induced dysbiosis to colitis severity, and if this pathway can be therapeutically targeted independently of dietary fiber, remains unclear. Here, we show that dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)–induced colitis severity correlates with compensatory GLP-1 increases, while receptor blockade worsens damage, confirming GLP-1’s protective role during colitis. Fiber deficiency impaired L cell function and GLP-1 release, increasing colitis susceptibility. GLP-1 receptor agonist reversed these effects, restoring barrier integrity and accelerating recovery. We engineered a probiotic, releasing a microbial peptide, that locally elevates GLP-1, which normalized gut parameters in fiber-deprived mice and alleviated colitis via GLP-1–dependent mechanisms, including improved metabolism, antimicrobial defenses , and barrier restoration. Our findings mechanistically connect fiber deficiency to colitis through GLP-1 and demonstrate that probiotic-mediated GLP-1 modulation can bypass dietary fiber requirements to maintain gut homeostasis.",

Using mouse hippocampal slices, we showed that l -fucose enhanced excitatory neurotransmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) through regulation of presynaptic release. Such effects required l -fucose be metabolized through the FCSK-driven salvage pathway, suggesting a metabolic-signaling mechanism. Human Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and 5xFAD mouse brains showed signs of fucose hypometabolism with impaired l -fucose signaling. Such abnormalities were corrected by exogenous l -fucose, exemplified by rectification of LTP deficits in 5xFAD hippocampus. A dietary l -fucose supplement, which increased cerebral free l -fucose levels and up-regulated FCSK to drive the salvage pathway, mitigated synaptic and behavioral deficits of 5xFAD mice.

Here, inspired by modular origami, we propose a set of single-degree of freedom (DOF) reconfigurable modules with rich symmetry configurations through the inherent kinematic bifurcation. Subsequently, all 17 space groups in the Euclidean plane can be achieved with only two sets of module tessellations, which can be reversibly tuned by a simple binary pressurization strategy for air pouches.

During apoptosis, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by BCL-2-associated X protein/BCL-2 Homolog Antagonist Killer (BAX/BAK) pores facilitates release of apoptotic factors, while the role of inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) remodeling remains less understood. Here, we identify serine beta-lactamase-like protein (LACTB), a filament-forming serine protease and tumor suppressor, as a regulator of IMM dynamics during apoptosis. LACTB suppression reduces cytochrome c release and apoptosis, whereas its overexpression promotes these effects. LACTB does not affect BAX or Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria. Rather, LACTB is required for apoptosis-induced mitochondrial remodeling, independent of OPA1 processing. Intriguingly, LACTB knockdown does not affect mitochondrial shape changes induced by CCCP treatment, suggesting that LACTB action is apoptosis-specific. Purified LACTB binds and remodels cardiolipin-enriched membrane nanotubes preferentially over planar lipid membranes, suggesting a direct effect in apoptotic membrane remodeling. Collectively, our findings suggest LACTB to be a mediator of apoptosis-induced IMM remodeling, a possible mechanism for tumor suppression in cancer.",

          "abstract": "The functionalization of methane, ethane, and other gaseous alkanes represents a central goal in chemistry, though synthetic tools that allow their straightforward conversion into high-value products are still rare. Here we report a general and mild photocatalytic methodology for the direct C─H allylation of gaseous alkanes. This protocol provides an efficient tool to convert these raw materials into synthetically versatile products, as illustrated by its application to the telescoped conversion of methane and ethane into important pharmaceutical intermediates and the nonsteroidal estrogen dimestrol. Successful implementation of the method requires the use of a FeCl 3 ·6H 2 O/collidine system that serves as an efficient ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) photocatalyst. Mechanistic studies highlight the crucial role of an in situ formed L n FeCl 4 − (L = collidinium) species in which stabilizing hydrogen bond interactions are key to prevent competing alkane C─H chlorination by attenuating the Fe─Cl bond reactivity, securing a kinetically compatible catalytic regime that provides an efficient platform for the C─H allylation reaction.",

          "abstract": "Siderite [iron(II) carbonate] is a major constituent of most iron formations. Its origin, which is currently disputed, affects interpretations about the composition of the ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere on early Earth. Direct precipitation from anoxic seawater is unlikely because of its prohibitively slow nucleation rate even in supersaturated solutions. However, recent modeling suggests that siderite may have precipitated at higher temperatures during hydrothermal fluid–seawater mixing in ancient anoxic oceans. Here, we report the presence of iron-rich siderite microparticles (&lt;1.0 micrometers) in 3.49- to 3.25-Ga exhalative iron cherts from the Pilbara Craton, Australia, which we interpret to have formed during venting of iron(II)-rich hydrothermal fluids into anoxic water columns. Geochemical modeling suggests that coexisting magnesium-rich siderite formed in solutions dominated by seawater. The lack of hydrothermal iron siderite and predominance of magnesium siderite in younger analogs indicate that the bulk of siderite in iron formations is diagenetic and formed from marine pore fluids.",

However, artificial thermoreceptors rarely match the acuity and perceptual richness with their biological counterpart, leaving a critical gap in thermosensory functionality for human-machine integration. Here, we introduce a structurally programmed iontronic platform that leverages energy landscape engineering in a heterogeneous polymer electrolyte to establish a continuous distribution of potential wells hosting a continuum of ionic carrier states. This architecture enables semiconductor-like thermally activated conduction by ionic carriers, achieving detection of temperature variations as small as 8 mK. Building on this platform, we develop a biomimetic ionic skin that interprets airflow, humidity, solar irradiation, thermal conductivity variations, and evaporative cooling through thermal cues, mirroring the multifaceted thermoreception of biological skin. This work complements the existing research paradigm of iontronics by integrating solid-state physics principles. The artificial thermoreceptor thus narrows the gap between artificial and biological thermosensation, advancing human-machine integration and biohybrid systems.",

Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of HSV-1 HP bound to a forked DNA template alone and in complex with pritelivir or amenamevir.

To address this, we developed a visual search task to simultaneously track selection among internal search goals held in working memory and external search targets in the environment. Capitalizing on sensitive gaze and neural markers, we provide proof-of-principle evidence in humans that internal and external selection processes do not necessarily take turns in a strictly serial manner but can develop concurrently. These concurrent processes are supported by largely nonoverlapping neural activity patterns in the human brain and can be performed effectively even when engaging opposite spatial locations in working memory and perception. Our findings challenge views portraying brain states as being either internally or externally focused and bring insight into how internal and external selection processes work together to yield efficient search behavior.",

          "abstract": "Telomerase, crucial for maintaining telomere integrity and genomic stability, is typically silenced in somatic cells with advancing age. In this study, we identify circHERC1 as a regulator of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) transcription. Specifically, circHERC1 binds to the TERT promoter, facilitating the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and c-Fos, thereby activating TERT expression. Notably, circHERC1 expression exhibits a decline with age, which correlates with reduced telomerase activity. Restoration of circHERC1 expression enhances telomerase activity, promotes telomere elongation, and reverses aging-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, delivery of circHERC1 using adeno-associated virus vectors or extracellular vesicles effectively restores telomerase activity, preserves telomere integrity, and mitigates senescence. This intervention leads to improvements in cognitive function, physical performance, and a reduction in inflammation. These findings highlight the important role of circHERC1 in telomerase regulation and the aging process, positioning it as a potential therapeutic target for antiaging interventions.",

We exploit an unconventional excitation via energy transfer from tunneling electrons in graphene tunnel junctions to strongly bound excitons in proximate CrSBr layers. This enables us to excite CrSBr crystals ranging in thickness from a bilayer up to 250 nanometers, with the strong linear polarization of the electroluminescence confirming the excitonic origin. We assign the electrically excited emission to self-hybridized exciton polaritons, highlighting the strong coupling between optical excitations and confined photon modes in CrSBr.

Here, we combine single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to map pancreatic cell populations across space and time, from embryonic development to adult homeostasis in mice. Using these maps, we resolve spatial heterogeneity among pancreatic cell types and uncover epithelial-mesenchymal units as basic tissue niches, which we functionally characterize in both mouse and human models. We also demonstrate that the mesenchymal lineage diversifies into various specialized subtypes during development, but this complexity diminishes over time, ultimately converging into a few fibroblast subtypes in adulthood. Together, our findings reveal how different progenitor lineages codevelop and organize into structured communities that establish a functional pancreas, providing a framework to guide in vitro organogenesis and tissue engineering for pancreatic diseases.",

We revealed how the moiré interlayer coupling at the high-symmetry points on the Brillouin zone boundaries can produce additional cavity modes with twist angle–controlled wave vectors. We showed that the moiré-induced band-edge modes can support lasing with low thresholds. By sweeping the pump area to access different twist angles, we achieved tuning of laser emission angles in a continuous and wide range (&gt;30°) from a single device.

By comparing winter and summer observations taken with the Cassini Composite InfraRed Spectrometer, we find a winter temperature ~7 kelvin warmer than passive modeling predicts, accounting for uncertainties in emissivity and thermal inertia. An additional endogenic heat flux of 46 ± 4 milliwatts per square meter is required to match the observed radiance. The implied local shell thickness is 20 to 23 kilometers—consistent with the higher end of thickness models based on gravity, topography, and libration measurements.

Oligo-CALL achieved &gt;95% efficiency in linking lineage identity to transcriptomes, uncovering diverse clone-specific pathways with underlying resistance. Paired analysis of barcode-matched clones from naïve and resistant populations revealed transient and fixed resistance phenotypes. Notably, DNA repair pathways are recurrently altered in resistant clones, and inhibition of poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate–ribose) polymerase synergizes with KRAS G12C inhibition to overcome resistance.

We generated a conditional Nf1-mutant mouse model where NFs spontaneously transform into MPNSTs, faithfully recapitulating the human situation. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling demonstrated progression of NFs into MPNSTs, with a glial-to-mesenchymal transition. Sox9 was identified as a marker of this transition and key player in tumor growth. The transition is followed by a loss of the tumor suppressor gene (TSG) Cdkn2a and acquisition of pathogenic variants of other TSGs. Finally, a proof-of-concept drug screen aimed at reducing Sox9 expression in tumor cells identified 12 FDA-approved drugs. Notably, several of these agents target the RAS signaling cascade, suggesting that multi-targeted inhibition of this pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy against MPNSTs.",

We found that inhaled NPs triggered rapid, neutrophil recruitment, localized to alveolar NP deposition hotspots, orchestrated by alveolar macrophages (AMs) through both their motility and phagocytic activity. AM motility inhibition in the alveoli via intercellular adhesion molecule–1/LFA-1 blockade reduced neutrophil recruitment, as did impaired AM phagocytosis through C5a receptor 1/Fc-γ receptor I inhibition or by stealth NP surfaces. In addition, cellular degranulation inhibition indicated the importance of spatially focused cytokine release in neutrophil recruitment.

Other models involve jet-powered shocks that lead to bipolar explosions reflected in the geometry of the shock-breakout emission. We report measurement of the geometry of the shock breakout through unprecedentedly early spectropolarimetry of the nearby type II supernova 2024ggi starting ~1.2 days after the explosion. The measurement indicates a well-defined symmetry axis of the shock breakout, which is also shared by the hydrogen-rich envelope that emerged after the circumstellar matter was engulfed by the ejecta, revealing a persisting and prominent symmetry axis throughout the explosion.

Analyses of cells derived from a patient with AD, postmortem tissue, and 5×FAD mice reveal that DKK1 and DKK3 are elevated in AD and reduce Aβ uptake and degradation in neurons and astrocytes. Mechanistically, DKKs inhibit Aβ clearance by competitively binding LRP1 and promoting its internalization. In 5×FAD mice, DKK3 overexpression worsens, while knockout improves, Aβ pathology and cognitive outcomes. A targeted high-throughput screen of ~3000 compounds identified SJ-300 as a potent and selective inhibitor of the DKK3-LRP1 interaction.

          "abstract": "Evolutionary theory of aging predicts that women with increased reproductive effort live shorter lives, but evidence is inconsistent. These inconsistencies could be because environmental conditions influence how much a mother’s life span is reduced when having more children, i.e., their life-span cost of reproduction. Using a structural equation measurement model, we compare how reproductive effort affects the life span of 4684 women exposed across different life stages, or not at all, to the Great Finnish Famine. We find that life-span costs of reproduction became higher in mothers exposed to the famine during reproduction and, for these mothers, amounted to lower life expectancies of ~0.5 years per child. Conversely, reproduction did not shape the life spans of mothers not exposed to the famine or exposed postreproduction or during development. This natural experiment reveals how environmental adversity can influence reproductive costs, providing a biological explanation for previous inconsistent findings while showing how reproductive behavior has shaped the evolution of aging in humans.",

Here, we used archival, immunolabeled 2D pancreas sections to assess morphological EO parameters in donors with or without type 1 diabetes (T1D), varying in age and disease duration. We confirm that abundant small, insulin-positive EOs are present in donors without diabetes and comprise most of the pancreatic endocrine area in early life. Small EOs are virtually absent in individuals with T1D, and this effect is most pronounced in children diagnosed with T1D in their earliest years. We conclude that extraislet β cells are affected in T1D development, and their early loss is a characteristic feature. This finding has important implications, which will inform future screening and treatment strategies for T1D.",

At anaphase onset, sister separation is triggered by the proteolytic cleavage of the cohesin subunit SCC1/RAD21 by separase. SCC1 contains two cleavage sites, where cleavage is stimulated by SCC1 phosphorylation. Substrate recognition and cleavage are only partly understood. Here, we determined structures of human separase in apo- or substrate-bound forms that, together with biochemical analysis, provide critical insights into separase cleavage regulation. We verify the first SCC1 cleavage site and reassign the second. We show that substrates, including separase autocleavage sites and the two SCC1 cleavage sites, interact with docking sites in separase, including five phosphate-binding sites. We also describe the interaction between the cohesin subunit SA1/SA2 and separase, which promotes cleavage at the second SCC1 site. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry and cryo–electron microscopy, we propose how cohesin is targeted by human separase.

As a key neuronal resilience metabolite, the oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) slows down AD progression in preclinical studies with several clinical trials ongoing. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms around how NAD + enhances neuronal resilience, especially whether it has any effect on ASEs, have remained elusive. This study shows that NAD + augmentation corrects the ASEs of many genes via a key protein, EVA1C (epithelial V-like antigen 1 homolog C), which is involved in neuronal development and activities. EVA1C is reduced in the hippocampus in patients with AD compared to cognitively normal ones. NAD + -induced memory retention is partially dependent on EVA1C, as adeno-associated virus–based Eva1c knockdown in the hippocampal CA1 region annuls NAD + -induced memory improvement in pathological Tau–bearing mice. We propose that NAD + reduces AD pathologies, at least partially, via amplification of the NAD + - EVA1C splicing axis, pointing to a potential splice-switching therapy for AD.",

Widespread synaptic reorganization and neural activity changes, including exaggerated beta oscillations and bursting, follow dopamine depletion (DD) of the basal ganglia (BG). Our computational model examines DD-induced neural activity changes and synaptic reorganization in the BG subcircuit comprising the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus externus. Calcium-dependent synaptic and structural plasticity mechanisms were incorporated, allowing neural activity to alter network topology. We show how hyperactivity of indirect pathway striatal projection neurons (iMSN) can induce synaptic connectivity changes consistent with PD animal models. Our results suggest that synaptic reorganization following DD results from a series of homeostatic calcium–based synaptic changes triggered by iMSN hyperactivity. While this structural plasticity functions as a compensatory mechanism in the cascade of changes following elevated iMSN input from striatal DD, it may become compromised if iMSN and cortical inputs show substantial bursting activity.",

By developing a mathematical model, we provide a mechanistic explanation: An oncogenic variant that elicits higher cancer mortality in older and less-reproductive individuals is detrimental to cooperative mammalian societies but can lead to a counterintuitive overcompensation in population size and fitness within competitive contexts. The phenomenon of a population increasing in response to a decrease in its per capita survival rate is called the hydra effect, a process never explored in the field of cancer before.

A bulk-defect correspondence produces degenerate topological modes, lying below the cladding light line. We use various theoretical methods to confirm their topological origins, including a spectral localizer that makes minimal assumptions about the band structure. Our experiments on the fabricated fiber show it transmitting visible to near-infrared light with low losses of 10 to 20 decibels per kilometer, which do not increase substantially when the fiber is bent.

Here, in contrast to the often hypothesized negative temperature dependence of microbial CUE, we observed a positive microbial CUE-temperature relationship after a decade of modest ecosystem-level warming (+1.0° and +2.1°C) in subtropical China. The warmed microbial community shifted toward more K -strategists, and the increased network stability drove metabolic thermal adjustments. These thermal adjustments resulted in homeostasis, such that warmed soils did not differ from unwarmed (+0°C) soils in microbial respiration and growth, weakening the initially stimulated carbon decomposition. These results suggest that warming-induced soil-plant system imbalance can recover to a prewarming steady state within a few seasons, mitigating predicted increases in soil carbon losses.",

          "abstract": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a highly lethal malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of only 18.8%, largely due to late-stage diagnosis in the absence of effective population-wide screening. Survival improves to 42.9% when detected at a localized stage (I/II). More than 90% of esophageal adenocarcinoma cases are diagnosed without prior identification of Barrett’s esophagus, its only known precursor. We present a swallowable, string-tethered capsule that expands in the stomach to enable atraumatic retrieval of esophageal epithelial cells without sedation or endoscopic guidance, completing the procedure in under 3 minutes. Capsules are fabricated via gas-foamed expansion of nanofiber mats or hybrid aerogel formation, enabling rapid in situ reexpansion upon gastric fluid exposure and safe retrieval. In swine studies, capsules dissolved within 2 minutes, reexpanded within seconds, required minimal retrieval force, and consistently captured intact epithelial layers without injury. This platform could enable low-cost, high-throughput esophageal sampling in primary care and resource-limited settings.",

Lead-free double-perovskite semiconductors, such as Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , attract particular interest in this respect due to their structural phase transition and strong carrier-lattice coupling. Here, we reveal that the giant anisotropic photostriction in halide perovskites with tetragonal crystal structure provides an efficient nonthermal tool for generating coherent transverse phonons. Using time-domain Brillouin spectroscopy, we observe transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons with comparable amplitudes in the tetragonal phase of Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 below the temperature of 122 kelvins, while, in the cubic phase, only longitudinal phonons are generated. The polarization of the transverse phonons is dictated by the projection of the crystal c axis on the surface plane, which leads to a prominent anisotropic polarization response in the detection. The generated strain pulses correspond to soft transverse acoustic eigenmodes with a strong temperature dependence of dispersion, providing an additional degree of freedom for hypersonic manipulation.",

Here, we integrate satellite light detection and ranging (LIDAR) measurements with machine learning to assess the Southern Ocean air-sea CO 2 fluxes between 2007 and 2020. We reveal that CO 2 outgassing south of 50°S was underestimated by up to 40% in previous studies. While the midlatitude Southern Ocean (30° to 50°S) strengthens as a carbon sink, the high-latitude region (50° to 90°S) shows Southern Annular Mode (SAM)–modulated alternation between uptake and outgassing. The air-sea CO 2 partial pressure difference (Δ p CO 2 ) increasingly dominates flux variability over wind-driven transfer velocity. We propose a framework involving three latitudinal loops with differing p CO 2 controls: (i) Antarctic (salinity/sea ice), (ii) polar front (atmospheric CO 2 /chlorophyll), and (iii) subpolar (sea surface temperature/CO 2 ). The findings underscore the winter processes’ critical role and necessitate year-round observations to understand Southern Ocean’s global carbon cycle impact.",

We establish four major findings in adult male rats: (i) BLA projection neurons are necessary and sufficient for stress-induced neuroendocrine activation; (ii) projection populations have a heterogeneous spatial distribution across the BLA; (iii) diverse BLA populations targeting the prelimbic cortex, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, central amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and ventral hippocampus are activated by acute stress, with the location of activated populations biased toward the medial basal amygdala; and (iv) inhibition of singular projections does not recapitulate global inhibition of BLA projection neurons.

This study demonstrates a real-time Mandarin speech BCI that decodes monosyllabic units directly from neural signals. Using the 256-channel microelectrocorticographic BCI, we achieved robust decoding of a comprehensive set of 394 distinct syllables based purely on neural signals, yielding median syllable identification accuracy of 71.2% in a single-character reading task. Leveraging this high-performing syllable decoder, we further demonstrated real-time sentence decoding.

Here, we identify L-type calcium channel (LTCC)–expressing thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) as a critical component regulating both behaviors. ELT-induced excessive LTCC activity in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) RE neurons and its corresponding effects on persistent neuronal activation contribute to increasing susceptibility to aggression and self-harm. Activation of vGlut2 RE neurons projecting to ventral hippocampus (vCA1), but not medial prefrontal cortex, promotes these behaviors in control mice. Furthermore, we found that RE neurons modulate two distinct subsets of vCA1 neurons, with one projecting to the hypothalamus to drive aggression and another to the basal amygdala to mediate self-harm. Our findings uncover how LTCC functions in the RE-to-vCA1 neural pathway increase the risk of aggression and self-harm, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for mitigating destructive behaviors following early adversity.",

Herein, we implanted an intracortical microelectrode array of 100 electrodes in the visual cortex of two blind volunteers. We recorded the neural activity around the electrodes while performing electrical stimulation to induce visual perceptions. Besides showing how stimulation parameters influence perceptual thresholds, perceived brightness, and the minimum interval required to distinguish separate stimuli, our results indicate that subjective visual experience can be accurately predicted from the recorded neural activity. These results highlight the potential for using the neural activity of neighboring electrodes to accurately infer and control visual perceptions in cortical visual prostheses.",

Despite progress in decoding language-related information from human brain activity, generating comprehensive descriptions of complex mental content associated with structured visual semantics remains challenging. We present a method that generates descriptive text mirroring brain representations via semantic features computed by a deep language model. Constructing linear decoding models to translate brain activity induced by videos into semantic features of corresponding captions, we optimized candidate descriptions by aligning their features with brain-decoded features through word replacement and interpolation. This process yielded well-structured descriptions that accurately capture viewed content, even without relying on the canonical language network. The method also generalized to verbalize recalled content, functioning as an interpretive interface between mental representations and text and simultaneously demonstrating the potential for nonverbal thought–based brain-to-text communication, which could provide an alternative communication pathway for individuals with language expression difficulties, such as aphasia.",

Here, we applied three-dimensional minimal flux optical nanoscopy to mouse IHC-SGN synapses to chart the positions of key pre- and postsynaptic proteins with single-digit nanometer resolution. We demonstrate that nanoclusters of ion channels and their interacting proteins govern the topography of AZs and postsynaptic densities (PSDs). We count synaptic proteins and their nanoclusters and determine their spatial organization, feeding into computational modeling of AZ function.

This is corroborated by matching AlphaFold3 models of UNC-1 multimers with our subtomogram average structure; by expressing GFP-tagged UNC-1, leading to cap structures with additional density; and by coarse-grained MD simulations.

This orchestrated hydration yields an interfacial toughness of 6 kilojoules per square meter (&gt;1.8× literature benchmarks; 1.4 to 3.8× commercial tapes), while preserving stability across harsh conditions (pH 1 and 13, 3.5% saline). Multiscale experiments and simulations reveal water’s triple role as a hydrogen bond catalyst at the interface, a dynamical reorganizer of supramolecular networks, and a mechanical decoupler of interfacial adhesion/bulk cohesion.

We investigated the site of Aguada Fénix, Mexico, which features the oldest and largest monumental architecture in the Maya area. Using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and excavations, we documented a site plan composed of nested cross forms built between 1050 and 700 BCE. Its center was marked by a large cruciform cache containing the earliest known directional color symbols in Mesoamerica. The overall pattern consisted of 9- and 7.5-kilometer-long axes delineated by canals and corridors. The builders constructed canals, measuring up to 35 meters wide and 5 meters deep, and a dam to supply them with lake water. Although the canals appear unfinished, this site plan exceeded or rivaled the extents of later Mesoamerican cities. Aguada Fénix was probably designed as a cosmogram, which likely attracted people from a broad area.",

          "abstract": "From a humble kitchen blender to the vast galactic disks, rotating turbulent flows exhibit remarkable diversity. They are also replete with puzzling features. A notable example is the energy spectrum of a widely studied rotating flow—the turbulent Taylor-Couette (TC) flow. Previous studies have shown that, unlike other canonical turbulent flows, it does not obey Kolmogorov’s universal power law or any other power law. Here, we report measurements of the energy spectra in turbulent TC flow from unique “flying-wire” experiments where a rotating probe sweeps through the flow. In contrast with previous studies, which focused primarily on spectral power laws, we analyze spectral data collapse. Through this broader approach, we show that, contrary to the prevailing understanding, the spectral structure of small scales in turbulent TC flow is in excellent accord with the potent paradigm of Kolmogorov’s small-scale universality.",

          "abstract": "Reefs are important hotspots of marine biodiversity today and have acted as cradles of diversification in the geological past. However, we know little about how the diversity of reef-supporting regions varied through deep time, and how this differed from other regions. We quantified regional diversity patterns in reef-supporting and non–reef-supporting regions in the fossil record of Phanerozoic marine invertebrates. Diversity in reef-supporting regions is on average two- to threefold higher than in non–reef-supporting regions and has been remarkably stable over timescales of tens to hundreds of millions of years. This signal is present in both reefal and non-reefal facies within reef-supporting regions, suggesting that reefs enriched diversity in surrounding environments. Sepkoski’s “Modern Fauna,” an assemblage of higher taxa that includes gastropods, bivalves, and echinoids, has been a key component of reef-supporting regions since the Paleozoic, contrasting with its later rise to dominance in non–reef-supporting regions during the later Mesozoic-Cenozoic.",

          "abstract": "The drivers behind the marked 2- to 3-km relief canyons carved into the ca. 3.7-km-high Andean Plateau remain debated, with proposed triggers ranging from plateau surface uplift to precipitation-enhanced erosion. We integrate a surface processes model with published cross-section–derived estimates of structural geometry, kinematics, and shortening rates, as well as precipitation estimates from global atmospheric circulation models, to assess whether the geometry, sequential fault motion, and resulting surface uplift can reproduce plateau morphology. Endorheic basins form where uplift on faults exceeds incision. A decrease in shortening after ~10 Ma allows rivers to compete with uplift and incise into endorheic basins at the plateau edge. Two modeled basin capture events at ~7 to 5 Ma and ~3.5 to 0.5 Ma, coupled with climate-driven discharge fluctuations, markedly increase rivers’ discharge, erosion, and sediment transport, facilitating canyon incision and highlighting the importance of basin captures in canyon formation along the northeastern edge of the Andean Plateau.",

          "abstract": "The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a key basal ganglia output nucleus, is modulated by dopamine (DA) believed to be released locally from midbrain DA neurons. Although DA has been proposed to regulate γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release from medium spiny neuron (MSN) terminals via presynaptic D1 receptors, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Using presynaptic optical recordings of synaptic vesicle fusion, calcium influx in D1-MSN synapses together with postsynaptic patch-clamp recordings from SNr neurons, we found that DA inhibits D1-MSN GABA release in a frequency-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, this effect was independent of DA receptors and instead required 5-HT1B receptor activation. Using two-photon serotonin biosensor imaging in slices and fiber photometry in vivo, we demonstrate that DA enhances extracellular serotonin in the SNr via inhibition of serotonin reuptake. Our results suggest that serotonin mediates DAergic control of basal ganglia output and contributes to the therapeutic actions of dopaminergic medications for Parkinson’s disease and psychostimulant-related disorders.",

Most of these types are established early in embryogenesis and persist into adulthood. In indirectly developing sea urchins, however, the continuity between embryonic and adult stages is interrupted by a planktonic larval stage that undergoes complete metamorphosis. While gene regulatory networks controlling embryonic and larval lineages are well studied, the molecular and morphological identities of postmetamorphic cell types remain poorly understood. Here, we reconstructed the cell atlas of postmetamorphic Paracentrotus lividus juveniles using single-nucleus transcriptomics, revealing conservation of regulatory mechanisms. We identified signatures of eight distinct cell type groups and analyzed 29 neuronal families, including 15 unique photoreceptor types. By combining transcriptomics, spatial analysis, and ultrastructure, we identified vertebrate neuronal and opsin homologs expressed across the juvenile. These findings show that the echinoderm body plan is predominantly head-like and exhibits an “all-brain” organization.",

          "abstract": "Polymeric immunoglobulins are essential components of the immune system in jawed vertebrates. While mammalian immunoglobulin M (IgM) typically forms a pentamer linked by the joining chain (J-chain), Xenopus laevis IgX can assemble into a J-chain–independent polymer. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of IgX, revealing its hexameric configuration. By incorporating the IgX tailpiece into human IgM, we achieved efficient IgM hexamer formation. Truncating IgM’s natural tailpiece to a range of 11 to 16 residues also substantially enhanced hexamerization efficiency. Furthermore, introducing a shortened IgM tailpiece to IgG resulted in effective IgG hexamer formation. We further show that the engineered IgM and IgG hexamers targeting CD20 demonstrated robust complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against several B lymphoma cells. In addition, the IgG-Fc hexamer functioned as a decoy, attenuating CDC in cell cultures. These findings deepen our understanding of polymeric immunoglobulin evolution and introduce innovative strategies for the development of IgM- and IgG-based biologics.",

          "abstract": "Offshore wind farms may induce changes in the upper ocean and near-surface atmosphere through coupled ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. Yet, the role of air-sea interactions mediated by offshore wind farms remains poorly understood. Using fully coupled ocean-atmosphere-wave model simulations for seasonally stratified conditions along the US East Coast, we show that simulated cumulative reductions in wind stress due to large-scale wind farm clusters lead to sea surface warming of 0.3° to 0.4°C and a shallower mixed layer. This warming drives upward heat fluxes, destabilizing the atmospheric boundary layer and enhancing wind stress, which partially offsets wake-induced wind deficits. These wake-ocean interactions influence near-surface meteorology and air-sea fluxes, suggesting that a coupled modeling approach may be necessary for assessing potential oceanographic impacts of offshore wind developments. However, ocean coupling exerts limited influence on winds at turbine-relevant heights or within downstream wakes, resulting in minimal impact on long-term energy. These findings suggest that models without ocean coupling may be adequate for wind energy applications.",

          "abstract": "The development of regioselective methods for C(sp 3 )─Br bond formation in unactivated alkenes remains a fundamental challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a nickel hydride–catalyzed method that enables regiocontrolled hydrobromination of both terminal and internal alkenes through strategic deployment of an N -fluoropyridinium oxidant. The method features two complementary approaches: direct hydrobromination of alkenes with high proximal selectivity and a chain-walking strategy that enables switchable site-selective functionalization in extended alkyl chains. Notably, temperature-controlled reaction parameters enable regiodivergent access to β- or γ-brominated products from identical alkenes with excellent selectivity. The protocol demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and enables late-stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic studies, including deuterium labeling, radical clock experiments, and density functional theory calculations, revealed a radical-mediated pathway featuring temperature-dependent regioselectivity in the chain-walking process. This unified method provides a versatile platform to access diverse alkyl bromides and offers fundamental insights into selective C─Br bond construction through direct and chain-walking pathways.",
