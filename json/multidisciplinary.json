          "abstract": "Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) persistently infects more than 90% of the human population, causing infectious mononucleosis1, susceptibility to autoimmune diseases2 and multiple malignancies of epithelial or B cell-origin3. EBV infects epithelial cells and B cells through interaction between viral glycoproteins and different host receptors4, but it has remained unknown whether a common receptor mediates infection of its two major host cell targets. Here, we establish R9AP as a crucial EBV receptor for entry into epithelial and B cells. R9AP silencing or knockout, R9AP-derived peptide and R9AP monoclonal antibody each significantly inhibit, whereas R9AP overexpression promotes, EBV uptake into both cell types. R9AP binds directly to the EBV glycoprotein gH/gL complex to initiate gH/gL–gB-mediated membrane fusion. Notably, the interaction of R9AP with gH/gL is inhibited by the highly competitive gH/gL-neutralizing antibody AMMO1, which blocks EBV epithelial and B cell entry. Moreover, R9AP mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion in cooperation with EBV gp42–human leukocyte antigen class II or gH/gL–EPHA2 complexes in B cells or epithelial cells, respectively. We propose R9AP as the crucial common receptor of B cells and epithelial cells and a potential prophylactic and vaccine target for EBV.",

Here we report the discovery of a first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor targeting PurF, the first enzyme in the mycobacterial de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. The lead candidate, JNJ-6640, exhibited nanomolar bactericidal activity in vitro. Comprehensive genetic and biochemical approaches confirmed that JNJ-6640 was highly selective for mycobacterial PurF. Single-cell-level microscopy demonstrated a downstream effect on DNA replication. We determined the physiologically relevant concentrations of nucleobases in human and mouse lung tissue, showing that these levels were insufficient to salvage PurF inhibition. Indeed, proof-of-concept studies using a long-acting injectable formulation demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of the compound. Finally, we show that inclusion of JNJ-6640 could have a crucial role in improving current treatment regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Together, we demonstrate that JNJ-6640 is a promising chemical lead and that targeting de novo purine biosynthesis represents a novel strategy for tuberculosis drug development.",

          "abstract": "All contemporary Eurasians trace most of their ancestry to a small population that dispersed out of Africa about 50,000 years ago (ka) 1–9 . By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa 10–15 . These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000 years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70 ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50 ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success.",

          "abstract": "Climate change threatens global food systems1, but the extent to which adaptation will reduce losses remains unknown and controversial2. Even within the well-studied context of US agriculture, some analyses argue that adaptation will be widespread and climate damages small3,4, whereas others conclude that adaptation will be limited and losses severe5,6. Scenario-based analyses indicate that adaptation should have notable consequences on global agricultural productivity7,8,9, but there has been no systematic study of how extensively real-world producers actually adapt at the global scale. Here we empirically estimate the impact of global producer adaptations using longitudinal data on six staple crops spanning 12,658 regions, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories. We estimate that global production declines 5.5 × 1014 kcal annually per 1 °C global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise (120 kcal per person per day or 4.4% of recommended consumption per 1 °C; P < 0.001). We project that adaptation and income growth alleviate 23% of global losses in 2050 and 34% at the end of the century (6% and 12%, respectively; moderate-emissions scenario), but substantial residual losses remain for all staples except rice. In contrast to analyses of other outcomes that project the greatest damages to the global poor10,11, we find that global impacts are dominated by losses to modern-day breadbaskets with favourable climates and limited present adaptation, although losses in low-income regions losses are also substantial. These results indicate a scale of innovation, cropland expansion or further adaptation that might be necessary to ensure food security in a changing climate.",

          "abstract": "Each spring, billions of Bogong moths escape hot conditions across southeast Australia by migrating up to 1,000 km to a place that they have never previously visited—a limited number of cool caves in the Australian Alps, historically used for aestivating over summer 1,2 . At the beginning of autumn, the same individuals make a return migration to their breeding grounds to reproduce and die. Here we show that Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby navigating in their inherited migratory direction towards their distant goal. By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator 3–5 , we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth’s known magnetic sense 4 ), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions. Visual interneurons in different regions of the moth’s brain responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation, firing maximally when the moth was headed southwards. Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth’s magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination.",

          "abstract": "Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is a primary sensor for short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota. Consequently, FFA2 is a promising drug target for immunometabolic disorders1,2,3,4. Here we report cryogenic electronic microscopy structures of FFA2 in complex with two G proteins and three distinct classes of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), and describe noncanonical activation mechanisms that involve conserved structural features of class A GPCRs. Two PAMs disrupt the E/DRY activation microswitch5 and stabilize the conformation of intracellular loop 2 by binding to lipid-facing pockets near the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. By contrast, the third PAM promotes the separation of transmembrane helices 6 and 7 by interacting with transmembrane helix 6 at the receptor–lipid interface. Molecular dynamic simulations and mutagenesis experiments confirm these noncanonical activation mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the molecular basis for the Gi versus Gq bias, which is due to distinct conformations of intracellular loop 2 stabilized by different PAMs. These findings provide a framework for the design of tailored GPCR modulators, with implications that extend beyond FFA2 to the broader field of GPCR drug discovery.",

          "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a polygenic disorder occurring after extreme trauma exposure. Recent studies have begun to detail the molecular biology of PTSD. However, given the array of PTSD-perturbed molecular pathways identified so far1, it is implausible that a single cell type is responsible. Here we profile the molecular responses in over two million nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 111 human brains, collected post-mortem from individuals with and without PTSD and major depressive disorder. We identify neuronal and non-neuronal cell-type clusters, gene expression changes and transcriptional regulators, and map the epigenomic regulome of PTSD in a cell-type-specific manner. Our analysis revealed PTSD-associated gene alterations in inhibitory neurons, endothelial cells and microglia and uncovered genes and pathways associated with glucocorticoid signalling, GABAergic transmission and neuroinflammation. We further validated these findings using cell-type-specific spatial transcriptomics, confirming disruption of key genes such as SST and FKBP5. By integrating genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data, we uncovered the regulatory mechanisms of credible variants that disrupt PTSD genes, including ELFN1, MAD1L1 and KCNIP4, in a cell-type-specific context. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive characterization of the cell-specific molecular regulatory mechanisms that underlie the persisting effects of traumatic stress response on the human prefrontal cortex.",

Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07518-6 (2024).\n\nGeologic faults exhibit a rich variety of slip behaviours, from ‘stick-slip’, in which faults remain locked most of the time and slip during earthquakes only, to slow slip events that last days to months, to quasi-steady creep1. Lee et al.2 proposed that slip behaviour may depend on the orientation of nearby faults: faults that are well aligned are argued to promote creep, whereas faults that have diverse orientations are argued to promote unstable slip. The statistical analysis of Lee et al.2 considers surface creep only and does not explain depth-dependent transitions in fault locking that are well resolved by geodetic observations. Furthermore, the inferred correlation between creep and fault alignment does not necessitate a causal relationship and can be readily explained in terms of regional variations in the state of stress. Existing evidence overwhelmingly indicates that transitions from stable to unstable slip are controlled by variations in lithology, effective normal stress and/or temperature, rather than the fault-network geometry.",

The human sweet taste receptor, a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heterodimer composed of TAS1R2-TAS1R31,2, senses a wide range of sweet compounds — including natural sugars, artificial sweeteners and sweet proteins — impacting metabolic regulation beyond taste. However, the lack of three-dimensional structures hinders our understanding of its precise working mechanism. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the full-length human sweet taste receptor in apo- and sucralose-bound states. These structures reveal a distinct asymmetric heterodimer architecture, with sucralose binding exclusively to the Venus flytrap domain of TAS1R2. Combining mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations, this work delineates the sweeteners recognition modes in TAS1R2. Structural comparisons further uncover the conformational changes upon ligand binding and unique activation mechanism. These findings illuminate the signal transduction mechanisms of chemosensory receptors in class C GPCRs and provide molecular basis for new-generation sweetener design.",

          "abstract": "Climate change may amplify the frequency and severity of supply-demand mismatches in future power systems with high shares of wind and solar energy1,2. Here, we use a dispatch optimization model to assess potential increases in hourly costs associated with such climate-intensified gaps under fixed, high penetrations of wind and solar generation. We further explore various strategies to enhance system resilience in the face of future climate change. We find that extreme periods—defined as hours in the upper decile of hourly costs (i.e., the most-costly 10% of hours)—are likely to become more costly in the future in most countries, mainly due to the increased need for investments in flexible energy capacity. For example, under the SSP126 scenario, 47 countries that together account for approximately 43.5% of global future electricity generation are projected to experience more than a 5% increase in average hourly costs during extreme periods, with the largest reaching up to 23.7%. Promisingly, the risk of rising costs could be substantially mitigated through tailored, country-specific strategies involving the coordinated implementation of multiple measures to address supply-demand imbalances and enhance system flexibility. Our findings provide critical insights for building future climate-resilient power systems while reducing system costs.",

          "abstract": "Aromatic rings, also known as arenes, containing two or more adjacent different substituents are ubiquitously found in small molecule drugs1. Strategies that can rapidly introduce diverse vicinal substituents to readily available precursors would greatly benefit generation of analogues of bioactive compounds2, which, however, remain challenging to realize to date. The existing approaches for preparing vicinal difunctionalized arenes lack modularity, or regioselectivity, or generality. Here we report a nickel-catalyzed vicinal diborylation method that can directly install two chemically differentiated boryl groups in a regio- and site-selective manner using readily available aryl triflates or chlorides as substrates. This reaction operates under simple and mild conditions and is scalable. It also shows a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Given that each boryl group can be independently transformed into various functional groups, this method offers a modular, regioselective, and divergent approach to access diverse vicinal difunctionalized arenes, showing promise for constructing analogue libraries. The combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal a highly unusual reaction pathway, involving the formation of a dearomatized gem-diboryl species and 1,2-boron migration. The site- and regioselectivity of this reaction are proposed to be controlled by steric interactions of the boryl groups with the nickel catalyst. The mechanistic insights gained in this investigation could have broad implications on developing other boron-mediated functionalization reactions.",

Focusing on seven enhancers that are active in the developing brain, heart, limb and face, we created over 1,700 transgenic mice for over 260 mutagenized enhancer alleles. Systematic mutation of 12-base-pair blocks collectively altered each sequence feature in each enhancer at least once. We show that 69% of all blocks are required for normal in vivo activity, with mutations more commonly resulting in loss (60%) than in gain (9%) of function. Using predictive modelling, we annotated critical nucleotides at the base-pair resolution. The vast majority of motifs predicted by these machine learning models (88%) coincided with changes in in vivo function, and the models showed considerable sensitivity, identifying 59% of all functional blocks. Taken together, our results reveal that human enhancers contain a high density of sequence features that are required for their normal in vivo function and provide a rich resource for further exploration of human enhancer logic.",

          "abstract": "Sexual reproduction relies on meiotic chromosome pairing to form bivalents, a process that is complicated in polyploids owing to the presence of multiple subgenomes 1 . Uneven ploidy mostly results in sterility due to unbalanced chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, pentaploid dogroses ( Rosa sect. Caninae ; 2 n = 5 x = 35) achieve stable sexual reproduction through a unique mechanism: 14 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted biparentally, while the remaining 21 chromosomes are maternally inherited as univalents 2,3 . Despite being studied for over a century, the role of centromeres in this process has remained unclear. Here we analyse haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies for three pentaploid dogroses. Subgenome phasing revealed a bivalent-forming subgenome with two highly homozygous chromosome sets and three divergent subgenomes lacking homologous partners, therefore explaining their meiotic behaviour. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny, phylogenetic relationships and centromere composition indicate that the subgenomes originated from two divergent clades of the genus Rosa . Pollen genome analysis shows that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins form bivalents, supporting multiple origins of dogroses and highlighting variation in subgenome contributions. We reveal that bivalent-forming centromeres are enriched with ATHILA retrotransposons, contrasting with larger tandem-repeat-based centromeres mainly found in univalents. This centromere structural bimodality possibly contributes to univalent drive during female meiosis. Our findings provide insights into the unique reproductive strategies of dogroses, advancing our understanding of genome evolution, centromere diversity and meiotic mechanisms in organisms with asymmetrical inheritance systems.",

However, it remains unclear how the microbiota contributes to inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), where these microorganisms are typically absent. Here we report that T cells that recognize gut-colonizing segmented filamentous bacteria can induce inflammation in the mouse intestine and CNS in the absence of functional regulatory T cells. Gut commensal-specific CD4 T cells (Tcomm cells) that are dysregulated in the inflamed gut can become licensed to infiltrate into the CNS regardless of their antigen specificity and have the potential to be re-stimulated by host protein-derived antigens in the CNS via molecular mimicry, whereupon they produce high levels of GM-CSF, IFNγ and IL-17A, triggering neurological damage. These infiltrated Tcomm cells initiate CNS inflammation by activating microglia through their IL-23R-dependent encephalitogenic programme and their IL-23R-independent GM-CSF production. Together, our findings reveal potential mechanisms whereby perturbation of Tcomm cells can contribute to extraintestinal inflammation.",

Enhanced particle adhesion increases the filtration of airborne particulates while maintaining air permeability, providing longer filter lifetime and increased energy savings.

While extensive structural studies have been conducted on recombinant AMPARs and native calcium impermeable (CI)-AMPARs alongside their auxiliary proteins2-5, the molecular architecture of native calcium permeable (CP)-AMPARs has remained undefined. To elucidate the subunit composition, physiological architecture, and gating mechanisms of CP-AMPARs, here we present the first visualization of these receptors, immunoaffinity purified from rat cerebella, and resolve their structures using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results indicate that the predominant assembly consists of GluA1 and GluA4 subunits, with the GluA4 subunit occupying the B and D positions, while auxiliary subunits, including TARPs, are located at the B′/D′ positions and CNIHs or TARPs at the A′/C′ positions. Furthermore, we resolved the structure of the Noelin 1-GluA1/A4 complex, wherein Noelin 1 (Noe 1) specifically binds to the GluA4 subunit at the B and D positions. Notably, Noe 1 stabilizes the amino-terminal domain (ATD) layer without affecting receptor gating properties. Noe 1 contributes to AMPAR function by forming dimeric-AMPAR assemblies that likely engage in extracellular networks, clustering receptors within synaptic environments and modulating receptor responsiveness to synaptic inputs.",

Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward-prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning. Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction that we validated with behavioural experiments.",

          "abstract": "Kupffer cells (KCs) are tissue-resident macrophages that colonize the liver early during embryogenesis1. Upon liver colonization, KCs rapidly acquire a tissue-specific transcriptional signature, mature alongside the developing liver and adapt to its functions1,2,3. Throughout development and adulthood, KCs perform distinct core functions that are essential for liver and organismal homeostasis, including supporting fetal erythropoiesis, postnatal erythrocyte recycling and liver metabolism4. However, whether perturbations of macrophage core functions during development contribute to or cause disease at postnatal stages is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a mouse model of maternal obesity to perturb KC functions during gestation. We show that offspring exposed to maternal obesity develop fatty liver disease, driven by aberrant developmental programming of KCs that persists into adulthood. Programmed KCs promote lipid uptake by hepatocytes through apolipoprotein secretion. KC depletion in neonate mice born to obese mothers, followed by replenishment with naive monocytes, rescues fatty liver disease. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF1α) in macrophages during gestation prevents the metabolic programming of KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, thereby averting the development of fatty liver disease. These results establish developmental perturbation of KC functions as a causal factor in fatty liver disease in adulthood and position fetal-derived macrophages as critical intergenerational messengers within the concept of developmental origins of health and diseases5.",

Here we establish long-term, live light-sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labelled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviours and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development 4 . We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labelling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track actin, tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue-state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization and brain regionalization. On the basis of imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrix-induced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signalling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the WNT ligand secretion mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of non-telencephalic brain regions. Together, our work provides an inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics have a central role during brain regionalization.",

Here we present a method to increase photon-avalanche nonlinearity beyond 500 by reconstructing the sublattice and extending the avalanche network. We demonstrate that lutetium substitution in the host material induces significant local crystal field distortions. These distortions strengthen cross-relaxation, the key process governing population accumulation. As a result, the optical nonlinearity is significantly amplified, enabling sub-diffraction imaging through single-beam scanning microscopy, achieving lateral and axial resolutions of 33 nm (about 1/32 of λExc) and 80 nm (around 1/13 of λExc), respectively (where λExc is the excitation wavelength). Moreover, our research shows regional differentiation within photon-avalanche nanocrystals, in which photon-avalanche performance varies across different regions at the single-nanoparticle level. This effect, coupled with extreme optical nonlinearity, enables visualization of nanoemitters at resolutions beyond their physical size using simple instrumentation.

          "abstract": "The Matthew effect describes how scientists who win grant funding early in their careers are more likely to have success later on. Credit: malerapaso/Getty\n\nPerseverance is key when it comes to securing science funding, finds an analysis of more than 100,000 grant applicants that looks at how early success affects future prospects.\n\nThe research shows how the Matthew effect — a phenomenon describing how those with an early advantage or success tend to accumulate more over time — could be driving inequity in academia.\n\nPrevious work has suggested that those who win funding early in their career are more successful further down the line. But the latest study, described in a working paper posted on the preprint platform Figshare on 12 June1, is the largest of its kind, and the first to look at trends across different funders and countries. “They’re able to shed a bit more light on the mechanisms” driving the effect, says Thijs Bol, a sociologist at the University of Amsterdam.\n\nThe vast data set highlights a ‘barrier’ in research, says Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. “Some promising scientists may be discouraged and leave science. This could create a net loss to society in terms of scientific discoveries.”\n\nThe rich get richer\n\nThe Matthew effect was named after a Biblical parable that describes how “to those who have, more will come”, and is one of the most widely discussed sociological theories in research. It was first proposed by sociologist Robert Merton in the late 1960s, and has been observed in science funding before.\n\nIn 2018, a landmark paper co-authored by Bol was the first to use funding data to show2 that junior researchers in the Netherlands who narrowly secured an early-career grant from the national funder later outperformed those who just missed out, and were 50% more likely to become professors — despite the two groups having similar publication and citation records when they first applied.\n\nTo see whether the pattern persists more broadly, Vincent Traag, a computational social scientist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and his colleagues expanded on this experiment with data on more than 100,000 grant applications to 14 funding programmes in Canada, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and Austria.\n\nThey found that across all funders, 26% of successful applicants for awards later on in their careers had previously secured early-career awards, compared with 15% who hadn’t. “This is a major expansion of the work,” says Bol. Not only does the latest study find the effect exists at many more funders in different countries, he adds, but it also holds true for researchers who scored across the spectrum on grant applications — not just those who narrowly secured funding.\n\nMathematical modelling suggested that the difference was caused by those who had early grant success applying more often for future grants than those who did not secure early funding, rather than any bias by grant reviewers favouring researchers who had won previous money.\n\nThe setback effect\n\nThe results suggest that funders should consider other ways to allocate funding, Traag says. “A higher funding rate for promising but previously unsuccessful applicants may be more effective than providing even more funding to those who already secured funding.”",

Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first images, leaving astronomers in awe of the unprecedented capabilities of the observatory’s 3,200 megapixel digital camera — the largest in the world. The images were created from shots taken during a trial that started in April, when construction of the telescope was completed.\n\n“Wow. You want to observe the grandeur of the Universe? This is the way to observe it!” says astronomer Robert Williams, former head of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nMajor telescope hosts world’s largest digital camera: how it will transform astronomy\n\nOne of the images shows the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula, in a region of the Milky Way that is dense with ionized hydrogen and with young stars or those in the process of forming. The picture was created from 678 separate exposures taken by the observatory’s Simonyi Survey Telescope in just over seven hours. Each image was monochromatic and taken with one of four filters, resulting in the rich colours of the final product.\n\nThe Rubin, which sits atop Cerro Pachón in the Andes Mountains in central Chile, is a US$810 million, US-led facility. The observatory has a very large field of view that will be able to cover the entire southern sky every 3–4 nights. Other telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, have superior sensitivity to tiny details and take in one small section of the sky at a time.\n\nThe latest images were put together mainly for aesthetic impact and to showcase how the observatory’s digital camera can scan large swaths of sky with high sensitivity and in a short time. As such, they are quite different from the type of ‘data products’ that astronomers around the world will use for research purposes, says Sandrine Thomas, deputy director for the observatory’s construction, who is based in Tucson, Arizona. And yet, they are a reminder of what drives astronomers in the first place. “We go into astronomy because we like to look at the sky — and at the beauty of it,” she says.",

However, photographers have long known that stacking detectors improves efficiency. Kodachrome film, introduced in 1935, consisted of three layers of emulsion, sensitive to blue, green and red light, respectively. This meant that every point on the film captured the full colour spectrum. In a paper in Nature, Tsarev et al.1 translate that 90-year-old idea to a single chip. Their device is a stack of three light detectors made from crystals called perovskites that absorb red, green and blue light. The device collects more photons than do conventional cameras — even today’s best digital ones — and yields brighter, truer colours and sharper images.",

The discovery that they can find their way using only the stars — reported in an 18 June Nature paper1 — makes this moth the first invertebrate to be observed using celestial navigation for long-distance journeys.\n\nFlight simulator for moths reveals they navigate by starlight\n\n“The first time we saw them flying under the night sky with no other cue and flying in the right direction we had to hold on to the edge of the table,” says study co-author Eric Warrant, an entomologist at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nBogong moths emerge from their cocoons in southeastern Australia and some regions of New Zealand and begin the long flight to mountain caves that they have never previously visited. The following autumn these moths make the return flight to reproduce and die. “How on earth do they know how to find their way there?” Warrant says.\n\nWarrant and his team suspected the moths were guided by looking at the stars, an ability previously identified only in humans, birds, and possibly seals. To test this, they captured wild moths and placed them in a ‘flight simulator’ — a clear cylindrical box in which the insects were tethered and their movements recorded while being shown projections of the starry sky.\n\nThe researchers manipulated the magnetic field in the simulator to observe whether moths could navigate without this cue. They also recorded the activity of visual neurons in the moths’ brains to investigate whether they have an internal representation of the starry sky.\n\nCelestial compass",

The resulting enzymes catalyse a chemical reaction that no known natural protein can execute, achieving a reaction rate and efficiency similar to those typical of naturally occurring enzymes.\n\nThe proteins, described on 18 June in Nature1, open the door to an era in which bespoke enzymes can be rapidly designed to facilitate a variety of reactions.\n\n“They’re remarkable,” says Sílvia Osuna, a computational chemist at the University of Girona in Spain, who was not involved in the study. “It’s very hard to computationally design a highly efficient enzyme.”\n\nStreamlined enzymes\n\nThe ability to build synthetic enzymes could lead to innovative ways of making medicines and industrial chemicals. But attempts to use computer algorithms to design such enzymes have produced inefficient catalysts that researchers must later improve in the laboratory — an approach that “is very laborious”, says Sarel Fleishman, who studies computational protein design at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.\n\nI told AI to make me a protein. Here’s what it came up with\n\nFleishman and his colleagues sought a better approach. As a test case, they decided to construct a catalyst for a non-natural chemical reaction called the Kemp elimination, which involves the removal of a proton from a carbon atom in certain substrates.\n\nThe team assembled data on a group of natural enzymes to serve as a starting point, and computationally broke these protein sequences into fragments. The fragments were then shuffled and recombined into an array of all possible combinations.\n\nThe researchers fed these combinations into their computer algorithms. These used models of how the atoms in proteins behave to predict which combinations would serve as the ideal chemical ‘backbone’ for the new enzyme.\n\nAlgorithm with intuition\n\nThe team also tweaked the enzyme’s active site, where chemical catalysis takes place. For years, scientists have assumed that it was essential to have a ring-shaped amino acid in a key position near that site. But Fleishman and his colleagues asked their algorithm to predict what would happen if other amino acids were placed there.\n\nThe program favoured a non-ringed amino acid in that spot. With that change, the enzyme’s efficiency shot through the roof, says Fleishman: “I was shocked.”\n\nIn the end, the most efficient enzyme that the team designed differed from its closest naturally occurring cousins by more than 140 amino acids. It was also 100 times more efficient than similar enzymes previously designed using artificial intelligence (AI).",

          "authors": "Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "Children’s health could be under threat as a result of cuts to research funding.Credit: Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle/Getty\n\nAmid the hurly-burly of US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s crusade to revolutionize the nation’s health agencies, one message rings clear: it’s all about the kids.\n\nKennedy has pledged that his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement will focus on improving the health of the nation’s children. Last month, Kennedy’s MAHA Commission released the Make Our Children Healthy Again: Assessment report to guide federal efforts to tackle chronic disease among kids. “For Americans to be healthy, we must start when they are children,” Kennedy said in a statement to the US Senate on 14 May.\n\nHow paediatrician researchers are advancing child health\n\nBut many scientists who study paediatric health and disease fear that the US government’s push to reduce science spending jeopardizes that goal. Since Kennedy became head of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in February, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) — which is part of the HHS — has axed more than 1,900 research grants, and US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting the NIH’s funding by about 40% for 2026.\n\n“These cuts are catastrophic,” says Laura Anthony, a clinical and developmental psychologist at the Children's Hospital of Colorado in Aurora, who spoke to Nature in her own capacity and not on behalf of her employers. “I worry that this is going to affect a whole generation, both of kids and scientists.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump administration says grant terminations by the NIH have largely focused on wasteful spending projects. Last week, a federal judge told the NIH to reinstate many of the terminated grants and said that their cancellation was discriminatory and “bereft of reasoning”.\n\nMixed bag\n\nA key goal of the MAHA movement is to address what its supporters consider to be the roots of chronic disease in the United States. This includes overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, and exposure to environmental factors such as industrial and agricultural chemicals, fluoride in drinking water and electromagnetic radiation. The MAHA report, released on 22 May, focused on the effect of these and other influences on children’s health, and called for more research in areas including nutrition, toxicology and drug safety.\n\nMAHA’s spotlight on children’s health is welcome — especially its emphasis on diet and mental health, says Wendy Chung, a geneticist and chief of the department of paediatrics at Boston Children’s Hospital in Massachusetts. “This could be the decade of the kids, and that would be an amazing thing,” she says.\n\n154 million lives and counting: 5 charts reveal the power of vaccines\n\nBut, she adds, the report also expressed scepticism about the safety of childhood vaccines known to protect children from numerous harmful diseases. The American Academy of Pediatrics has said that it welcomed the report’s focus on disease prevention and mental health, but that the report misrepresented the academy’s treatment guidelines for obesity. The MAHA report also cited several studies that do not exist. The White House press secretary attributed the fictitious references to “formatting issues”.\n\nMAHA’s handling of scientific evidence has worried researchers. “It’s not a bad idea to make people healthy,” says Phyllis Dennery, chair of paediatrics at Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island. “The approach just has to be based in science.”\n\nA spokesperson for the White House denied that it challenges the value of vaccination. “HHS remains committed to advancing children’s health through gold-standard science and evidence-based policy,” says an HHS spokesperson.\n\nKids’ research cancelled\n\nThe 1,900 or more grants cancelled since Kennedy took his position include some paediatric studies. “I don’t see any evidence of increased funding,” says Anthony. “Instead, it has been a drastic, tragic decrease.”\n\nSome areas of paediatric research have been hit particularly hard. In January, Trump signed one executive order that officially recognized only two sexes, and another that banned US funding or support for some gender-affirming medical treatments for people under the age of 19. A Nature analysis in April found that nearly one-quarter of cancelled NIH grants at that time were related to the health of transgender people and members of other gender and sexual minority communities (LGBTQ+). “The medical interventions for gender dysphoria that the prior administration pushed are not backed by evidence,” a spokesman for the White House says.\n\nExclusive: NIH to terminate hundreds of active research grants\n\nThese funding cuts pose a particular problem for children’s health, says Dennery, given the growing number of adolescents who are seeking gender-affirming care in the United States, and the need for more data on how best to provide it. “It’s hard to understand the logic behind these research cuts,” says Dennery. “They may, in fact, make less information available in terms of guiding treatment.”\n\nOn 16 June, a federal court ordered the NIH to restore some terminated grants pertaining to LGBTQ+ people and Black people. Many of those grants were cancelled after Trump issued an executive order to end programmes for diversity, equity and inclusion. His administration could appeal against the court’s decision.",

          "authors": "Mariana Lenharo",
          "abstract": "The United Nations, governments and aid agencies are scrambling to save one of the world’s largest public-health databases from extinction. In February, the US government cut all funding for the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programme, which collects and publishes data on health, nutrition and gender equality in more than 90 countries.\n\nThe termination was a result of the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which had supported the DHS programme for some 40 years, including a 5-year, US$236-million grant awarded last year.\n\nThe surveys collect data on HIV, childhood and maternal mortality, malaria, tuberculosis and other health topics. With around 345,000 citations on Google Scholar, it is the most-cited international household-survey programme in the world, says João Pedro Azevedo, chief statistician at UNICEF, the UN children’s fund, based in New York City. The data are also used to track health-related indicators supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nEnding the DHS would be catastrophic, says Peter Macharia, a spatial epidemiologist from Kenya, now at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. Macharia says his PhD on child health interventions was based entirely on DHS data from Kenya. “Where would we get our new statistics from?” he asks. “We would not know what is happening in terms of health in the communities and the needs in each area,” he says.\n\n“For many countries, [the DHS] was one of the very few sources of reliable micro-data to inform policies and monitor the well-being of children and women especially,” Azevedo adds. “The discontinuity of the US grants was a big loss.”\n\nNow, a task force has been established by the UN Statistical Commission, the world's body that sets standards for statistics. The task force, which includes representatives from national governments, UN agencies and international funders, is assessing how access to the database can continue, along with finding alternative funding sources.\n\nLarge funders, including the World Bank, headquartered in Washington DC, and the Gates Foundation, based in Seattle, Washington, are involved. A Gates Foundation spokesperson confirmed that funders are searching for ways to keep the DHS going for at least the next three years. They said the foundation regards the DHS as a “public good”. Many of these organizations also rely on DHS data to guide their funding decisions, says Haoyi Chen, a member of a UN-convened body called the Inter-Secretariat Working Group on Household Surveys, which is coordinating the task force.\n\nWho owns the data?\n\nThe taskforce is also grappling with how to clarify who owns the data, which will influence whether or how other funders will get involved. USAID subcontracted the surveys programme to ICF International, a private consulting company based in Reston, Virginia. The firm oversees both the physical data collection from household surveys and the online platform that hosts the database, which is accessed by policymakers and researchers worldwide.\n\nUsers already registered on the platform have retained data access. But new users can no longer request it. ICF International has not publicly disclosed its plans for the database.\n\n“ICF has the redistribution rights, and presumably countries own their own data. But this has never been written in a contract,” Chen says. One risk, she notes, is if the company starts charging for access. “It’s a for-profit company. So, what if the company says, ‘I have the data, I own it, so you have to pay to get it?’”\n\nThe company did not reply to Nature’s request for a comment by the time this article was published.",

          "title": "Why air-traffic controller shortages are not to blame for US airport chaos",
          "authors": "Ashley Nunes",
          "abstract": "As US airports get busier, some are struggling to cope. Ageing technology and bad weather are often blamed for cancelled flights. But shortages of air-traffic controllers are also coming under widespread criticism in the media.\n\nAt Newark airport in New Jersey, hundreds of flights have been delayed or cancelled since the start of May. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) — which regulates aviation in the United States — says that 22 controllers are currently handling air traffic at Newark, considerably fewer than the 38 recommended by the agency (see go.nature.com/4mzavxw). Nationwide, only 2 out of 313 air-traffic facilities meet the staffing targets set by both the FAA and the union that represents controllers.\n\nA cleaner future for flight — aviation needs a radical redesign\n\nConcerns about staffing levels have been raised since the mid-1980s. But, as demand grows, more planes require more air-traffic controllers to guide aircraft safely. The consequences of inadequate staffing levels are potentially serious. In June 2023, a US government report concluded that low numbers of staff pose “a risk to the continuity of air traffic operations” (see go.nature.com/4225jum).\n\nFAA officials, union representatives and independent government watchdogs all propose just one solution: raise staffing levels. On 1 May, the FAA unveiled efforts to supercharge recruitment. By the end of the year, the agency expects to have hired at least 2,000 extra controllers — just 1,000 shy of its staffing target of at least 14,000.\n\nHowever, having scrutinized how the FAA estimates staffing levels, there are reasons to question its assessment.\n\nFor one, the FAA ‘staffs to traffic’ — it bases staffing targets on forecasts of future flight volumes. The agency’s goal is to ensure that enough controllers are available to handle both peaks in air traffic and disruptions, such as bad weather.\n\nSevere turbulence ahead – how scientists can keep air travellers safe in a warming world\n\nYet, as a US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report (see go.nature.com/43xanb5) notes, “FAA’s traffic forecasts, at least since 2000, have consistently overestimated future levels of air traffic.” In other words, the forecasts lead to a surplus — rather than a shortage — of controllers.\n\nA more pressing concern is the mathematical model that the FAA uses to establish the staffing standard, which is defined as the number of controllers at each facility (of which there are more than 300) required to cover the 90th percentile of daily traffic (see go.nature.com/3tmacze). The model estimates, for each 15-minute period of the day, a controller’s ‘task load’, or the level of difficulty they encounter when doing the work.\n\nThe task load is assessed by scrutinizing the controller’s duties and calculating the time required to do them. A higher total indicates a higher, or more difficult, task load and thus requires more staff members. However, there are numerous problems with this approach.\n\nModel estimates of the time needed for each task have not been validated using data from either the laboratory or functioning air-traffic control rooms. According to the NAS report, durations for seven of the nine tasks modelled by the FAA are “not based on data from the field”, whereas those for the remaining tasks are “based on input from subject matter experts—that is, task times are not derived from observing or analyzing controllers performing the tasks in the field or in experiments”. But if the loads are inaccurate, then so are the FAA’s modelled staffing requirements.",

          "abstract": "Working scientist profiles\n\nThis article is part of an occasional series in which Nature profiles scientists with unusual career histories or outside interests.\n\nMore than 300 people gathered at Senegal’s seaside Hôtel Terrou-bi for the centenary celebration of the Pasteur Institute of Dakar (IPD) last December, an event at which the Pasteur Network — which has 32 institutes in 25 countries — toasted the IPD’s achievements. The occasion drew a rich selection of African researchers, philanthropic leaders, policymakers and health ministers, many of whom flocked around virologist Amadou Alpha Sall. The IPD’s former chief executive was the first Black person to have run the institution since it was founded in 1924.\n\nWearing a long, sparkly Senegalese kaftan, Sall, aged 56, and 2 metres tall, seemed to be everywhere at once in the room.\n\nThe radical plan for vaccine equity\n\nIn West Africa’s scientific community, Sall is mostly known simply as Amadou. For more than three decades, he has worked as a virologist and public-health expert responding to epidemic outbreaks in dozens of countries, and persuading African government officials and policymakers to support scientific research and the manufacturing of health tools — diagnostics and vaccines — that Africans need in Africa. Solomon Zewdu, a former senior executive of the MasterCard Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in Toronto, Canada, describes Sall as “unusually approachable and fun”.\n\nDuring his years at the IPD, Sall built international partnerships and amassed support from foreign funders, investors, biotech companies and multilateral organizations. He played a crucial part in decolonizing the IPD, transforming it into a Senegalese non-profit foundation with a mostly Senegalese management staff. Until 2009, it was a private research entity owned by the Pasteur Institute in Paris. “The scientific standing of the institution has continued to improve under Amadou,” says Peter Piot, an Ebola and HIV virologist who chairs the IPD’s scientific advisory board.\n\nThe MADIBA manufacturing complex on the outskirts of Dakar.Credit: INSTITUT PASTEUR de DAKAR\n\nIn the last four years of his nine-year tenure as head of the IPD, Sall’s focus was a US$220-million project to build and staff a state-of-the-art vaccine-manufacturing facility in Senegal. The project, Manufacturing in Africa for Disease Immunization and Building Autonomy, known as MADIBA, aims to produce 300 million to one billion doses of high-quality vaccines annually against the most common diseases affecting Africans, including Ebola and measles. (The facility is partly named after Nelson Mandela’s Xhosa clan name, Madiba, as a nod to the former South African president and civil-rights leader’s fight for African independence.) To achieve this, Sall must also build the scientific workforce of his home country. He envisions an end-to-end vaccine-manufacturing hub that will help to ensure vaccine sovereignty for Africa. “We want to own our destiny and not rely on others,” he says.\n\nTrump’s cuts to international aid are stifling Africa’s HIV research\n\nHis vision has spurred young, talented Senegalese scientists to return from overseas to run MADIBA, and Sall encourages them by giving them leading roles in the initiative. “My dream is to have Africa become a leader in manufacturing and bring vaccines to the people where they are,” he says. Presidents, health ministers and billionaires, including Bill Gates and Strive Masiyiwa, a Zimbabwean business leader and philanthropist, have backed the project.\n\nThings come together\n\nThe MADIBA manufacturing complex lies on the outskirts of Dakar, amid carpets of grass and gleaming, newly paved roads. One of its large buildings, bearing the MADIBA name in bold, blue letters, houses high-performance NevoLine biomanufacturing platforms, consisting of bioreactors used for cell culture, virus manufacturing and the production of viral vaccines.\n\nOn a warm, sunny Friday in February, Sall and two site managers, Lamine Sène and Youssouf Balde, toured the five-hectare facility wearing hard hats and orange vests. Balde, a Senegalese bioengineer recruited by Sall from Canada, explains that the plant can handle various levels of production, from small bioreactors to large-scale manufacturing. And its multi-suite drug platforms, designed by the Stockholm-based company KeyPlants, mean that MADIBA has the ability to carry out pharmaceutical and biomanufacturing processes to produce drugs that go beyond viral-vaccine manufacturing. “The design includes modules for different technologies, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in case of disruptions,” such as a key supply becoming too costly, Balde says.\n\nScientists at work in a laboratory run by the Pasteur Institute of Dakar, where Amadou Sall launched his MADIBA project to support biomanufacturing in Africa.Credit: INSTITUT PASTEUR de DAKAR\n\nSall adds that, once operational, the facility will produce both liquid and freeze-dried vaccines against a range of epidemic-prone diseases, including measles, rubella, Rift Valley fever, Lassa fever and Ebola. AfricAmaril, a second plant, next to MADIBA, will use egg-based cell-culture techniques to boost the production of yellow-fever vaccine from 5 million to 30 million doses per year, to meet the needs of the continent.\n\nMADIBA’s arrival couldn’t be timelier. More people die from infectious diseases in Africa than anywhere else in the world, but the continent has lagged behind in developing the tools needed to address its health challenges. More than 90% of drugs and 99% of vaccines used by Africans are imported — a stark reality that was revealed during the COVID-19 pandemic. “I find it so unfair that Africans are dying of some disease where there’s a solution,” Sall says.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed inequities in global vaccine distribution and highlighted the dangers of African countries relying on wealthier nations. As a result, African leaders and the African Union’s 55 member states pledged to increase the share of vaccines produced on the continent from 1% to 60% by 2040. For Balde, the pandemic was a painful reckoning. But it was also an opportunity: “Why couldn’t we have those hands [making vaccines] work within Africa?”\n\nThe end of AIDS is in sight: don’t abandon PEPFAR now\n\nAs the pandemic raged in 2021, Balde, who was working at ProMetic BioSciences in Laval, Canada, organized a virtual conference for Senegalese-diaspora scientists to discuss ways in which they could contribute to fighting the pandemic from abroad. There, he first met Sall, who presented the MADIBA concept and convinced Balde that progress can happen when Africa’s brightest minds abroad gain knowledge and then return home to build up capacity. “He didn’t claim to have all the answers, but I saw that he’s creating the space for talented individuals to contribute, to build something bigger than themselves,” says Balde. By May 2024, Balde was on the job in Senegal.\n\nThe MADIBA project kicked off in early July 2021. Such a big initiative needed hundreds of millions of dollars in international bank investments and private donations, and a land grant from Senegal’s government. Sall has won over more than a dozen major investing partners and donors, including the European Investment Bank, the European Union and the International Finance Corporation, by convincing them of the economic impacts of saving lives and building human capital.\n\nFor example, the Mastercard Foundation is bankrolling a US$45-million advanced vaccine-bioprocessing laboratory at the IPD’s campus in central Dakar; the lab also serves to train young Africans in vaccine manufacturing. The IPD’s vaccine-research centre currently has more than 50 scientists working on vaccine development, of whom about 60% have returned from overseas. Marie-Angélique Sène, the head of the centre, was recruited by Sall while completing her PhD at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. “It was a no-brainer for me. What you’ll get from the mission, you won’t get anywhere else.”\n\nHowever, getting MADIBA off the ground hasn’t been easy. As the facility tour comes to an end, Sall looks tired. “He is always working all the time,” Balde says. The job is hard, and Sall admits he has paid for it in lost sleep.\n\nBringing it home\n\nOver a lunch of yassa — a spicy Senegalese dish of braised chicken and rice, with copious onions — at a restaurant near the IPD, Sall recounts how his childhood in Dakar shaped his leadership skills.",

The neurons of the paraventricular nucleus release a hormone called corticotropin and have a role in regulating stress. But the neural mechanisms underlying the effect of stress on sleep and memory have remained elusive.\n\nFor co-author Shinjae Chung, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, the question of exactly how stress affects these processes is personal, because, she says, “I experience a lot of sleep problems when I’m stressed”. She adds that “when I have an exam deadline, I have a tendency to have bad sleep that really affects my score the next day”.\n\nLosing sleep\n\nTo study how neurons in the paraventricular nucleus translate stress into sleep and memory problems, the researchers put laboratory mice through a stressful experience by physically restraining the animals in a plastic tube. The team then tested the creatures’ spatial memory and monitored their brain activity as they slept.\n\nAs expected, the stressed mice showed difficulty sleeping and struggled with memory when tested the following day. Stimulating neurons in the paraventricular nucleus mimicked these effects, whereas blocking these neurons resulted in modest improvements in sleep, and more substantial gains in memory performance.",

Tougher rules around visas and border control in the United States have prompted some conferences to move elsewhere. But what are the best places to hold a scientific conference right now? Could a greater variety of host countries be good for science?\n\nConferences are currently heavily concentrated in the Western world, with the United States being the most common location, says Geert Somsen, a historian of science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\n\nIn 2023, he co-authored a paper examining the contribution of international conferences throughout history to the understanding and communication of science1. The location of conferences “reflects a certain idea of what the world order is like”, he says.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s latest crackdown has made it more difficult for non-citizens to enter the United States and banned citizens of 12 countries from visiting. But even before then, it was difficult for people from low- and middle-income countries to get visas to attend conferences there, says Hazel Biana, a philosopher at De La Salle University in Manila.\n\n“It’s really been a challenge for us over the years,” she says. The United States ranks 81 — close to the bottom — on global financial-advisory firm Arton Capital’s Welcoming Countries Rank, which classifies countries according to the number of passports they accept visa-free or with relatively simple entry requirements. “I’ve known a lot of people who had encountered problems,” says Biana.\n\nThe current climate in the United States is prompting organizers to think deeply about how conference location affects who can attend and presents an opportunity to increase accessibility, which could be good for science, say researchers.\n\nConferences today tend to be “deeply shaped by Western and European traditions”, says Somsen. If they moved to a more diverse set of locations, a wider range of scientists could go, which would benefit science itself by integrating diverse knowledge and experience.\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nSo, ideally, where should a conference be held? After the latest crackdown in the United States, several conferences relocated to Canada. The International Conference on Comparative Cognition, for example, will move to Montreal next year. But Canada also has onerous entry restrictions: it is only one place above the United States on the Welcoming Countries Rank.\n\nResearchers’ picks for conference locations include Thailand and Indonesia, which rank 38 and 50, thanks to their generous visa allowances. Both offer ‘visa on arrival’, which eliminates the complicated visa-application process for many people. Biana describes Bangkok as “the perfect place for a conference that’s really quite inclusive”.\n\nShe also mentions Budapest as a promising location outside North America and southeast Asia, owing to its affordability. Hungary scores 53 on the Welcoming Countries Rank.\n\nBudapest could be an attractive, affordable European option for a conference.Credit: Alexander Spatari/Getty\n\nVisas are not the only thing to consider: also important is freedom of expression, says Charlotte Bigg, a historian of science at the Alexandre-Koyré Centre in Paris and co-author of the 2023 paper on the history of conferences.\n\nHuman rights issues",

          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi",
          "abstract": "Nature’s Memory: Behind the Scenes at the World’s Natural History Museums Jack Ashby Allen Lane (2025)\n\nNatural history museums are crucial for conservation — and for communicating its importance to the public. But step through the ‘staff only’ doors, and museums look very different. In vaults and laboratories, curators store, catalogue and preserve millions of specimens collected from the natural world — sometimes in controversial ways.\n\nIn Nature’s Memory, zoologist Jack Ashby explains how all of this works, and the human choices that it entails. Ashby, who studies marsupials and monotremes, is assistant director of the University Museum of Zoology in Cambridge, UK. He is also president of the Society for the History of Natural History in London.\n\nIn his office, plastered with posters of some of the world’s best nature dioramas, Ashby told Nature about his quest to communicate the importance of natural history museums.\n\nDo you have a favourite?\n\nOne is the Biological Museum in Stockholm. The building looks like a wooden Norwegian church, and it’s effectively one giant diorama that goes up three storeys. It covers all of the Nordic biomes. And it shows that we do have some exciting wildlife in Europe.\n\nEgypt is building a $1-billion mega-museum. Will it bring Egyptology home?\n\nAnother is the National Natural History Museum in Paris. You walk into the comparative-anatomy section and it’s one giant wall with thousands of skeletons all facing towards you, so tightly packed that you cannot walk between them.\n\nThese probably shouldn’t be my favourites, because they are so old fashioned, but they are stunning.\n\nDo museums teach science in a neutral way? In one book chapter, you highlight male biases in specimen collection and display.\n\nNatural history museums are amazing, but of course they are built by people, and people have interests and biases. One study, by biologist Natalie Cooper at the Natural History Museum in London and her collaborators, looked at more than 2 million specimens at 5 museums, and found that only 40% of the birds were female (N. Cooper et al. Proc. R. Soc. B 286, 20192025; 2019). For mammals, the figure was 48%, but in some of the mammalian groups, particularly artiodactyls — such as deer and antelope — only 40% were female. In another study, curator Rebecca Machin found that almost three-quarters of the natural-history specimens on display at the Manchester Museum, UK, were male (R. Machin Museum Soc. 6, 54–67; 2008).\n\nThe numbers are huge, but it’s also about how they are displayed, presented and interpreted. For example, descriptions of male specimens are much more likely to give general facts: this is where the animal lives, how it’s adapted to its environment, and so on. Whereas, for a female specimen, you tend to have more of a story of ‘this is how the species reproduces’.\n\nHow did the idea of collecting natural-history specimens arise?\n\nIn a sense, all museums — but certainly natural history museums — have their philosophical origins in the Wunderkammern, the private cabinets of curiosity maintained by aristocrats and natural philosophers in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Some museums today are direct descendants of those collections.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment period, when scientific proof became important, collecting at an institutional level grew. And it went hand in hand with the ‘age of discovery’. Some of those voyages explicitly focused on finding out what resources were out there in the world that could be traded or acquired. And museums were both a place to study those resources — be they animal, vegetable or mineral — and a tool to promote the mission: ‘Look what we’ve got in our newly found colony’.\n\nThe British colony in southeastern Australia was intended to be founded in what’s now Botany Bay, near Sydney. And the colonists called it Botany Bay — it already had a name, Kamay, in the Indigenous language Dharawal — because, in 1770, on the voyage of Captain James Cook, naturalist Joseph Banks spent weeks collecting plants there. He came back and later said to Parliament, on the basis of what he had found, ‘this is where you should set up a colony’. Those plants are now in the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nSpecimens at the National Museum of Ireland — Natural History in Dublin.Credit: Lucas Vallecillos/VWPics/Redux/eyevine\nBanks also wanted to collect the heads of Aboriginal people for his anatomical studies. Isn’t that problematic?\n\nIt was. Scientists at the time had theorized a racial hierarchy of people across the world, and then sought people’s remains without consent to try to back up this theory. It fed into the eugenics movement starting in the late nineteenth century, which has repercussions today. The desire to categorize people is inherently linked to extraordinary forms of violence and has been used in a pseudoscientific way to justify horrific social policy.\n\nHow are museums dealing with this legacy of colonialism?\n\nThere isn’t one museum that I would say is doing colonial history particularly well. But a lot of the research being done in natural history museums is, partly, understanding the true origins of the collections and who really collected them.\n\nI bring up nineteenth-century naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in that context, because he was relatively good at giving credit to people that he was working with. Two Malay teenagers called Ali and Baderoon, in particular, helped him during his eight-year voyage to the Malay Archipelago. Out of the 125,000 specimens that we lazily say were ‘collected by Wallace’, we know he attributed many to other people. But the institutions of science decided to ignore that and give the credit to Wallace.\n\nSome museums have begun to repatriate human remains and artefacts. Should every collection be repatriated?\n\nThe important question is, where does an object have the most meaning? It’s always going to be on a story-by-story basis. Take the thylacine, for example, the extinct Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus). There are nearly 800 specimens in museums around the world, and there are more in Australia, where they were native, than anywhere else. It is good that all of the thylacines aren’t in Australia. Because we talk about human-driven extinction in museums all around the world, that’s an important story — objects have power by being spread around.\n\nWhy museums should repatriate fossils\n\nBut there are no specimens of gorillas in museums in any of the gorilla’s home states. If anyone who studies gorillas in Central Africa wants to use museum collections, they have to go to another part of the world, which is not right. If a museum has many gorilla specimens, to repatriate some of them would be a good thing.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Plackett",
          "abstract": "There’s no two ways about it: tardigrades are badass.\n\nThese eight-legged, microscopic water-dwellers have survived the vacuum of space, extreme dehydration, and temperatures ranging from near absolute zero to above boiling point. In 2021, researchers fired frozen tardigrades from a gun onto a target several metres away, to simulate a meteorite impact, and showed that they lived to tell the tale1.\n\nTardigrades are also transparent, skin-shedding and occasionally cannibalistic — traits seemingly at odds with their cuddly appearance and ‘water bear’ nickname. And they have great PR. They have a dedicated subreddit on which people showcase their tardigrade tattoos and soft toys. There are tardigrade fan clubs and memes, as well as online merchandise. Water bears might not care, but the Internet certainly does. People can’t seem to get enough of them.\n\nNew species of tardigrade reveals secrets of radiation-resisting powers\n\nBut for a burgeoning community of researchers getting ready to converge this month on Tsuruoka, Japan, for the 16th International Symposium on Tardigrada, it’s all about the legs.\n\nTardigrades “are one of the smallest animals on Earth that we know of that have limbs,” explains Ana Lyons, a neuroscientist at Keio University in Tokyo. “At the same time, they also have simple eye spots, a central brain and a peripheral nervous system.”\n\nTardigrades, therefore, exist in a sweet spot: simple enough to study properly and intricate enough for it to be worth doing so. That’s one of the reasons that neuroscientists such as Lyons are working to make tardigrades a model organism for studying how neural circuits work — a field of research called systems neuroscience.\n\nNot every organism has what it takes to be ‘model’, however — there are basic requirements. Ideally, they are easy to maintain and breed in the lab and have a short life cycle. They should also be genetically tractable and, for systems neuroscientists, have well-understood neurocircuitry. It is these latter two issues that scientists need to work on if tardigrades are ever to transition from meme to model organism.\n\nFortunately, tardigrade enthusiasts are a confident bunch.\n\n“There’s work to be done, but I have faith in the tardigrade community,” says Jasmine Nirody, an organismal biologist at the University of Chicago in Illinois. “We’re determined.”\n\n‘A little space alien’\n\nLyons has been into tardigrades since the age of 15. In rural Michigan, where she grew up, there were no advanced science courses available at her school, so she took a course at a specialized ‘magnet’ school. In search of a topic for a project, she wandered around the local library. An encyclopaedia of North American invertebrates caught her eye.\n\n“It had a black and white [scanning electron microscope] photograph of a heterotardigrade” on the cover, she recalls. “Those are the really cool tardigrades that have all the cilia on their backs and really prominent eye spots and their claws on their legs are very distinct. It just looked like a little space alien to me.”\n\nAna Lyons wants to help build a ‘neural atlas’ of tardigrades.Credit: Ana Lyons\n\nFascinated, she reached out to the author of the tardigrade chapter and struck up a conversation. That author, Diane Nelson, invited Lyons to visit her laboratory at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. “I spent my 16th birthday there, learning how to handle and identify tardigrades,” Lyons says. They ended up co-authoring a paper when Lyons was an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge — although, because there were no tardigrade labs at MIT at the time, she mostly studied fruit flies and yeast.\n\nLyons returned to water bears during a fellowship year in Germany and continued her work as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. For her postdoc, she joined the lab of neuroscientist Saul Kato. A worm biologist, Kato was looking to branch into a new experimental system when he started his lab at the University of California, San Francisco — he describes tardigrades as “Caenorhabditis elegans with feet”. They met at a tardigrade conference in 2018, and she joined his lab in 2022.\n\nA Goldilocks-shaped niche\n\nAs Lyons and Kato outline in a preprint review posted earlier this year, tardigrades could fill a Goldilocks-shaped niche in the systems-neuroscience space2. Mice and fruit flies (Drosophila), tardigrade-enthusiasts argue, are too complicated for the field. It’s too difficult to isolate and connect behaviours with neural networks in these species. “You have to understand a simple system before you can understand a complex system,” says Kato. “We are so far from even having the language or frameworks to truly understand how these large, complex neuro systems work in mice, and arguably it’s the same with Drosophila.”\n\nAt the other extreme, nematodes such as the roundworm C. elegans are too simple. “You can’t get at the question of ‘what is the role of the central nervous systems versus the peripheral nervous system when it comes to limb movement’ [in worms], because worms don’t have limbs,” says Lyons.\n\nTardigrades do; they “have a very trimmed-down neural system but still have a brain and ganglia throughout their bodies and have limbs and can walk”, says Lyons. Most organisms that walk need thousands of neurons to do so, she explains, but not water bears. “We don’t yet know how many neurons tardigrades have, but they seem to be in the order of 300 to 700,” she says.\n\nThat simplicity makes it relatively easy — in theory — to tinker with tardigrade neurobiology and observe the consequences. It has also led some researchers to wonder whether tardigrades might be similar to, if not the ancestors of, arthropods: the group that includes insects, spiders and crustaceans. “It is one of the most ancestral states,” says Georg Mayer, a zoologist at the University of Kassel in Germany, of tardigrades; studying them “almost enables you to look back in time at a living fossil”.\n\nLive fast, die young\n\nAnother string to the bow of tardigrades as a model organism, is their translucency. Pretty much any of their cells can be observed while the animal is alive and in motion. That’s especially important when you’re trying to study the role of neurons in delivering various behaviours. “You can actually see them,” says Lyons. “We’re trying to genetically encode florescent reporter proteins so that, in theory, we could see all their neurons.”\n\nTardigrades also behave in interesting and unusual ways for such small creatures. “How do they both crawl in a very organized, coordinated fashion, and have their legs move independently and grasp things?” asks Kato. “There seems to be both local control of the limb and top-down control.” Kato wants to know more about how the animal’s nervous system accomplishes both at the same time.\n\n“There are so many other versions of this type of question in neuroscience and we think this is the perfect animal to study and find out,” Kato adds.\n\nAnd then there’s the question of aesthetics — water bears are basically charismatic microfauna. “Tardigrades are definitely cuter than worms,” Kato says, “Nobody calls a worm cute.” That cuteness, he admits, has probably contributed to the water bears’ appeal as a research subject. “They’re sort of the darlings of the Internet.”\n\nBasic barriers\n\nGiven all these potential upsides, why do researchers know more about worms and Drosophila than they do about the seemingly ideal tardigrade? Why have water bears been “leap-frogged”, as Kato puts it, by people who want to study systems neuroscience?\n\nFor one thing, tardigrades were late to the party. Researchers have conventionally gravitated towards either worms or fruit flies, because that’s where most of the early grunt work had been done and key genetic tools created. “That’s not the case with tardigrades,” says Nirody. “We still have to pin down our basic understanding of some of their genetics and neurology.”\n\nSaul Kato thinks tardigrades could be models for systems neuroscience.Credit: Saul Kato\n\nResearchers aren’t even sure which specific type of tardigrade to focus on. There are around 1,300 tardigrade species, and it’s not yet clear which would be the most suitable as a model organism. But as a group, they have many traits in common.\n\nFor example, says Mayer, tardigrade genomes tend to include lots of duplicated genetic material. “They have multiple copies of some gene families, which is crazy, since they’ve kept their genome so small,” says Mayer. “They have a small generation time and so it’s a disadvantage to them to have to duplicate a lot of DNA.” Why those duplications exist is a mystery that would be helpful to solve.\n\nTardigrade researchers are also struggling to genetically manipulate the animals — especially when it comes to inserting genes into their genome, a technique known as knock-in transgenics. At a conference in March on genetic tools for new model organisms, Lyons “was reassured to learn” that tardigrade researchers aren’t alone in facing this difficulty. “It’s all emerging model organisms, such as cuttlefish,” she says. “It seems to be much more straightforward to knock out genes.”\n\nA 2024 paper from a Japanese group showed limited success with one approach3 that used the editing tool CRISPR to insert genetic material into a tardigrade genome. But not at scale. Researchers need to be able to routinely knock-in hundreds of base pairs, and that isn’t yet possible.\n\n“We don’t yet know the best way to do knock-in for tardigrades,” Lyons concludes. “Is it CRISPR? Transposons? Viruses? Or something else? Do we target tardigrades when they’re early-stage embryos? Or do we try to get in through the ovaries of the mother tardigrade?”\n\nOnce scientists answer those questions, they’ll need to work out how to do it without popping the egg or killing the embryo. “That took a long time to figure out in Drosophila, for example, but once we realized you slightly dehydrate the embryos and then replace the liquid, boom. That was it. So, there are lots of little things like that which we need to know,” says Kato.\n\nOne not-so-little unknown for systems neuroscientists is basic neuroanatomy. Tardigrade enthusiasts don’t know how many cells the typical organism has, let alone how many neurons. Nor do they know what types of neuron the animals have, nor what they do.\n\nLyons is applying a battery of fluorescence-microscopy techniques to find out. “I’m finding all kinds of weird and cool cell morphologies,” she says, “and some of the suspected neurons look very different from what we see in worms or fruit flies. To be sure they’re all neurons, we really need to confirm the presence of synapses using electron microscopy.”",

          "abstract": "Outdated ideas about masculinity can mean some male academics are hesitant to participate in conversations about advancing gender equity in science.Credit: Vasyl Dolmatov/Getty\n\nCarers working in academia — the vast majority of whom are women — face disproportionate career burdens, and the cultural shift needed to correct that imbalance will require considerable action from men. To advance that cause, the international non-profit organization Mothers in Science (MIS) is launching a global awareness campaign to amplify the voices of fathers who are redefining fatherhood and advancing gender equity.\n\nCalled Fathers Who Care, the campaign kicked off on 16 June to follow Father’s Day in many countries, as well as Men’s Mental Health Awareness Day, part of Men‘s Health Week. In addition to releasing a resource guide and rolling out new data and testimonials from men in academia, MIS hosted a webinar on 19 June, led by a panel of fathers who shared their journeys and strategies for building more equitable partnerships. Fifteen organizations have endorsed the campaign so far, including the UK advocacy group Pregnant Then Screwed and DadsRock, a charity based in Edinburgh, UK, that offers workshops, group meetings and one-to-one support for fathers.\n\nUS National Academies report outlines barriers and solutions for scientist carers\n\nIsabel Torres co-founded MIS, which is based in France, in 2019, and says that the organization has struggled to recruit men and engage them in the difficult conversations needed to bring about structural change. The reasons for their hesitation aren’t always clear, but Torres acknowledges that men also experience stigma rooted in outdated ideas of masculinity, and a lack of mental-health support that can dampen their participation. “We’re at a place now where we can try to dig into that by speaking to the men we do have in our networks,” she says.\n\nEarly takeaway messages from those discussions suggest that many men remain unaware of the ‘maternal wall’ in academia that penalizes women for having children. A 2019 study found that becoming a parent prompted more than 40% of new mothers (and about one-quarter of new fathers) to leave full-time employment in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, and about 15% of new mothers to leave the workforce entirely1. Among those who do understand these career disparities, there are often feelings of shame or a sense that, because of their roles in perpetuating inequality, men’s voices would not be welcome.\n\n“I do see that a lot of men want to be more involved, but there is a fear of interfering because they feel this is a women’s space,” Torres says.\n\nRebalancing the norm\n\nThis lack of participation was particularly striking to Andrew Weightman, a medical mechatronics researcher at the University of Manchester, UK, who was a moderator of the 19 June panel. Earlier this year, Weightman attended a presentation by MIS and was shaken both by how few men he saw there and by his self-reflection on his role as a parent. Weightman’s wife is a teacher, and together they have a seven-year-old son. Although his institution offered shared parental leave, Weightman says it was ultimately his wife who stayed at home and who continues to work part-time today.\n\n“Reflecting on the past, I don’t think the balance has been right, and the social norm has been for me to work and my wife to take time off. That’s a problem, and I don’t know how to address it,” he says, adding that his participation in MIS is one attempt to do so. “I need to be vocal and open about my mistakes and to have conversations on how we can get to a more equal society.”",

On the screen of Stephens’s remote control, the pancake-shaped floes show up in the thermal images as dark circles, whereas open water and thin ice glow bright orange, indicating energy escaping from the ocean into the frigid polar air.\n\nThe transfer of heat from ocean to atmosphere is at the heart of one of the most important components of Earth’s climate — a system of currents that snakes across the entire length of the Atlantic Ocean and transports warm water from the tropics to high northern latitudes. Known by the unwieldy name of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), this network of currents affects weather conditions for billions of people around the world. It’s the reason that north-western Europe is relatively mild in the winter and much warmer than Labrador in Canada, which is at a similar latitude.\n\nAlexandra Stephens pilots a drone that collects data on heat escaping from the ocean.Credit: Tim Kalvelage\n\nBut scientists are increasingly concerned that this crucial current system is weakening as the planet is getting hotter because of greenhouse-gas pollution building up in the atmosphere.

This would have catastrophic impacts across the globe; one study published last year projects that temperatures in north-western Europe could drop by as much as 15 °C, plunging the region into a new ice age, while the southern hemisphere would suffer more severe warming1. It also suggests that a near-collapse of the AMOC would drive disruptive changes in rainfall in the Amazon basin. “The effects of an AMOC collapse will be so extreme that it will be difficult for us to adapt,” says physical oceanographer Henk Dijkstra at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, a co-author of the study.\n\nDespite its importance, the AMOC is one of the big unknowns in projections about Earth‘s future climate. Researchers have little information about how the current system is changing — particularly in the polar North Atlantic, a key region for the AMOC. That’s what brought the Norwegian ice-breaker RV Kronprins Haakon to the western Greenland Sea in February as part of a project known as ROVER, which is funded by the European Union. With its strengthened hull, the ship can venture into the ice-covered region to collect precious data on how the AMOC might evolve.\n\nOn the bridge of Kronprins Haakon at dawn, chief scientist Kjetil Våge (left) and captain Hallgeir M. Johansen discuss the route through the sea ice. Credit: Tim Kalvelage\n\n“This is a very sparsely sampled area, especially in winter when hardly anyone ever goes out here,” says Kjetil Våge, a physical oceanographer at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway, who is leading the ROVER mission. He suspects the loss of sea ice near Greenland caused by global warming might actually help to stabilize the AMOC and prevent it from slowing as much as people fear.\n\nI joined the ROVER expedition in February as it collected data that will take the pulse of the AMOC and help researchers to assess how it will change in coming decades.\n\nCrossing currents\n\nAs the RV Kronprins Haakon left Norway’s Svalbard archipelago at the start of the expedition, the Arctic was still veiled in the perpetual darkness of the polar night. The far-reaching influence of the AMOC was obvious as we crossed Fram Strait, which separates Svalbard and Greenland (see ‘Winter journey’). On the first part of the journey, the ship passed through northward-flowing Atlantic waters that kept the ocean ice free. As we left that current, the Kronprins Haakon quickly encountered heavy pack ice from the Arctic Ocean drifting south.\n\nSources: Bathymetry: GEBCO; Ice extent and glaciers: NSIDC; Greenland ice sheet: ESA Glaciers CCI; Cruise data: Kjetil Våge\n\nThe AMOC is often described as a conveyor belt — a highly simplified but apt description because its upper currents and deeper ones move in opposite directions. In the Northern Hemisphere, the surface strands, which include the Gulf Stream, carry warm and salty water from the equator towards the pole. At high latitudes that water releases huge amounts of heat into the atmosphere that helps to warm parts of Europe in winter.\n\nWhen the surface water of the AMOC cools off, it becomes dense enough to sink into the abyss in the North Atlantic near Greenland, which locks away huge amounts of carbon dioxide and supplies oxygen to the deep sea. At depth, the water flows south until it resurfaces again near Antarctica (see ‘Heat flows’).\n\nSources: S. Rahmstorf Oceanography 37, 16–29 (2024)/R. Curry and C. Mauritzen Science 308, 1772–1774 (2005)\n\nComputer climate simulations suggest that global warming could disrupt the current system in several ways: as air temperatures in the Arctic and subarctic increase, the surface water doesn’t cool as much in winter, which keeps it from getting as dense as it normally would. Another factor at play is the melting of sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet. This melting adds fresh water to the uppermost ocean, reducing the density of the surface water even more. These changes inhibit the sinking that drives the AMOC2.\n\nIt’s not just a theoretical concern that this could happen: evidence from Earth’s past suggests that there were abrupt shifts in the strength of the AMOC between ice ages and warm periods3.\n\nConcerns about the future prompted scientists to start monitoring the Atlantic Ocean in the early 2000s. To track what is happening with the AMOC, international research consortia have anchored instruments to the sea bed at various latitudes across the ocean’s basin to measure water temperature, salinity and current speed. The longest-running programme, RAPID-MOCHA, has gauged the strength of surface and deep-ocean currents of the AMOC since 2004 in the subtropics at 26° N. Another effort, called OSNAP, monitors the AMOC at more than 50 sites from Labrador to South Greenland to Scotland.\n\nSo far, their records show considerable variability but no consistent changes in how much water the AMOC moves4,5. The time span of the observations is simply too short to make out a trend, says Susan Lozier, a physical oceanographer at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, and head of OSNAP. “We are in this messy middle of trying to understand what is happening with the overturning circulation.”\n\nThe ship travels through the pack ice of the Greenland Sea near 76° N at dawn.Credit: Tim Kalvelage\n\nBecause researchers have only two decades of direct current measurements, they rely on indirect means of gauging the strength of the AMOC. For example, records of sea surface temperatures show that the subpolar North Atlantic has cooled since the 1950s while the ocean as a whole has warmed: some scientists interpret the cooling as a sign of a reduction in the amount of warm water from the subtropics reaching the region, which would correspond to a 15% decline in the strength of this current system6. Others, however, have found the AMOC to be stable for the past few decades7.\n\nSeveral modelling studies in the past few years warn that the AMOC could weaken drastically in the near future — up to the point of causing a near-shutdown. A collapse would not happen abruptly but would take 50–100 years, says Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany. Beyond a crucial tipping point, however, a further decline is unstoppable. “I think there is a 50–50 chance that we will pass the tipping point this century,” he says.\n\nThe idea that the AMOC is heading for collapse is controversial. The question is, can climate models realistically simulate the present and therefore produce reliable forecasts? To do so, scientists need observations to evaluate and refine their models, says Ben Moat, a physical oceanographer at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, UK, and one of the heads of RAPID-MOCHA. “Observations are critical to our understanding of what‘s happening to the future AMOC.”\n\nScientists deploy a buoy in the Greenland Sea to study sea ice.Credit: Tim Kalvelage\n\nVåge thinks that processes in the Nordic Seas north of Iceland, which are not well resolved by current climate models, could help to decide the fate of the AMOC. That’s why his team ventured into the icy waters of the Arctic in February.\n\nHidden heat\n\nEarly one afternoon, the Kronprins Haakon stops some 250 kilometres off the coast of Greenland. The ship’s crew opens a large hydraulic hatch in the hangar on the main deck and lowers a metal frame carrying 24 empty bottles and a suite of sensors, called a CTD rosette, into the ocean. Doctoral student Erika Giorgi at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research watches the data coming back from the CTD rosette as it sinks to a depth of 2,090 metres. “It’s exciting to be out here in winter and see these measurements in real time,” she says. The temperature of the water climbs from −1.8 °C at the surface — the freezing point of seawater — to about 2 °C at 200 metres, before dropping again to below zero towards the bottom.\n\nA device called a CTD rosette collects water samples and measures current flows and other properties.Credit: Tim Kalvelage\n\nThe layer of relatively warm and salty water is what interests the researchers the most. It is water that had previously flowed north through the Atlantic, taken a U-turn in Fram Strait or made a loop around the Arctic Ocean and is now travelling south in the East Greenland Current. As it continues west of Iceland, the dense subsurface water of this current crosses a marine mountain ridge and cascades down into the abyssal North Atlantic. This makes it a major source for the deep branch of the AMOC and one of the prime subjects that the ROVER project aims to study.\n\nIn the past, the East Greenland Current has been fully covered by sea ice in winter, which allowed little heat to escape from the ocean. But with rising temperatures in the past few decades, the wintertime ice cover in this region has been shrinking. This is exposing the East Greenland Current to extremely cold polar air, which could help to spur water to sink — a crucial part of the overturning circulation. For Giorgi, this possibility provides “a glimmer of hope” compared with the mostly gloomy future scenarios of the AMOC.\n\nVåge suggests that deep-water formation driven by intense heat loss in this region could make the AMOC more resilient to climate change than some researchers have assumed. He points to some pilot data from a previous study8 that support his hypothesis of enhanced heat loss along the East Greenland Current. “But we do not know how much or how important it is,” he says.\n\nChief scientist Kjetil Våge on deck in the ice-covered Greenland Sea.Credit: Tim Kalvelage\nInto the wild",

Director Steven Spielberg’s creation entertained and terrified in equal measure, and brought about an enduring change in how we perceive sharks.\n\nDavid Shiffman is a marine conservation biologist based in Washington DC, and the author of Why Sharks Matter (2022). He spoke to Nature about how Jaws influenced the public perception of sharks and the importance of protecting marine life.\n\nHow did Jaws affect the public’s opinion of sharks?\n\nThere are some people who were afraid to even go into ankle-deep ocean water the summer Jaws came out. My mom says she didn’t want to go swimming at a pool. Around the same time, Star Wars came out, and no one was afraid that the Death Star was going to blow up Earth.\n\nA colleague of mine coined the ‘Jaws effect’, which is now used in public-policy literature to explain how fictional portrayals of real-world issues impact what voters want leaders to do about those issues.\n\nHas public opinion changed in the 50 years since Jaws was released?\n\nMore people now love sharks, are aware of shark conservation and want to help sharks than ever before. But there’s still widespread fear, and in some cases it’s quite pseudoscientific in nature.\n\nHow do these negative perceptions influence shark conservation?\n\nSharks were swimming in the ocean before there were trees on land and before Saturn had its rings. And in the past 50 years, they’ve experienced some of the worst population declines in their 400-million-year-plus history.\n\nUnsustainable fishing practices are the largest threat to marine biodiversity. To save the ocean as a whole, including but not limited to sharks, we need to do more sustainable fisheries management. Scientists and environmental advocates, in many cases, know what we should do, but we're not the ones in charge. We need to convince policymakers to make changes to conservation policy, and that requires public support.\n\nWhen fear and panic aren’t ruling our emotions, it’s clear that we should be trying to protect these animals, not trying to eradicate them.\n\nThe film Jaws was released in the United States on 20 June 1975.Credit: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy\nWhy is shark conservation so important?\n\nHumans depend on the oceans, which provide billions of people with a major source of food and tens of millions with employment and job security. To have a healthy food chain, you need to have a healthy top of the food chain. When we lose predators, the whole system can unravel.\n\nHow can we change public opinion on sharks?\n\nPart of the problem is that most people hear about sharks only in the context of inflammatory media coverage or pseudoscientific nonsense.\n\nYearly, more people are bitten by other people on the New York City subway system than are bitten by sharks in the whole world.\n\nThe media and popular press definitely have a role to play. It would be great if they would educate about real things or, at the very least, stop saying nonsense.",

And in countries such as China and India, those numbers are exploding.\n\nConventionally, the doctorate was a stepping stone to a lifelong career in academia. But today, the number of PhD graduates vastly exceeds the number of job openings at universities and research institutions. Researchers say that many universities are not preparing graduates for a career outside academia.\n\n“We need to make doctoral education more meaningful, more sustainable and better aligned with the diverse societal and labour-market needs,” says Cláudia Sarrico, the Secretary of State for Higher Education in Portugal, who previously worked at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris.\n\nThe PhD explosion\n\nAmong the 38 countries belonging to the OECD, the number of new doctorate holders almost doubled between 1998 and 20171, and has continued to increase in the years since. (Although several countries, including Australia and Brazil, have seen a dip in PhD enrolments over the past few years, driven in part by high living costs and low stipends.)\n\nIn China, the number of doctoral students has doubled — from around 300,000 in 2013 to more than 600,000 students enrolled in PhD programmes in 2023. “The numbers are massive, and they keep growing,” says Hugo Horta, who researches higher-education policy and practice at the University of Hong Kong. There are several factors driving this growth, Horta explains, such as the increasing number of people with bachelor’s and master’s degrees, and the expectation among many in the country that an investment in higher education will provide better economic and social prospects.\n\nBut the number of jobs in academia has not kept pace with the growth in PhD holders, says Horta. People coming into these doctoral programmes are, for the most part, training to become academics, so many future graduates are going to face fierce competition for any position, he says.\n\nGreat expectations\n\nIn countries such as the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, non-academic jobs are increasingly becoming the norm for people with PhDs. A 2023 study2 of more than 4,500 PhD graduates in the United Kingdom found that over two-thirds of doctoral graduates were employed outside academia.\n\nSuch employment can mean graduates taking jobs that aren’t research based or that are outside their area of expertise. In South Africa, out of more than 6,000 PhD graduates who completed a 2020 survey, 18% said that they had had trouble finding jobs related to their expertise. “Even though they do find jobs, it’s not necessarily linked to their PhDs, and it’s not always the jobs that they expected or that they wanted,” says Milandré van Lill, a researcher at Stellenbosch University in South Africa and a co-author of the study. “From my perspective, we have reached saturation point in terms of PhD graduates.” Some graduates who find jobs outside of academia feel overqualified and undervalued, says van Lill.\n\nThat isn’t the case everywhere. The 2023 study found that job satisfaction among PhD graduates was generally high, with more than 90% saying they were happy with their career2. Those in science- and technology-related fields were more likely to find research-related roles — which are linked to higher levels of job satisfaction — than were those in the social sciences, arts and humanities.",

Zhang et al./Nature Comm.\n\nThey’re small, elusive and crucial to cellular organization. Now, scientists have found a way to jam the inner workings of biomolecular condensates — membrane-free droplets that coordinate key reactions in cells.\n\nA synthetic ‘killswitch’ protein, just 17 amino acids long, can be dropped into these liquid-like compartments to selectively disrupt their function and pause the molecular traffic within.\n\nDescribed on 4 June in Nature1, the approach gives researchers a previously unattainable handle on difficult-to-study cellular structures linked to cancer, viral replication, gene expression and more. Just as importantly, the tool could open the door to a new class of therapeutic strategies that target not just individual molecules in cells, but the dynamic environments that sustain them.\n\n“This offers a powerful tool to selectively affect dynamic properties at each individual condensate,” says Rick Young, a biologist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “That’s a frontier kind of thing — it’s going to be extremely valuable.”\n\nCondensate control\n\nBiomolecular condensates are a relatively recent addition to the cell-biology lexicon, emerging from a concept just 16 years old and terminology that is less than half that age. Unlike membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus or mitochondria, these compartments form spontaneously through a process known as phase separation — much like oil forming droplets in water.\n\nProteins and RNA molecules coalesce into viscous structures that concentrate specific molecules and exclude others. This organization lets cells choreograph complex tasks — transcribing genes, splicing RNA or orchestrating stress responses — with remarkable efficiency and spatial precision.\n\nYet, probing these structures has proved tricky. Most tools available to researchers either dissolve all condensates indiscriminately or involve manipulations that alter more than the targeted structure, often triggering compensatory changes across the cell.\n\nThe killswitch, by contrast, is more surgical. It doesn’t dissolve condensates or prevent them from forming. Instead, it infiltrates and fixes them in place, transforming dynamic assemblies into static ones.\n\n“You basically just superglue the targeted protein in condensates,” explains Denes Hnisz, a biochemist at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Genetics in Berlin, who co-led the study.\n\nStuck in place\n\nArmed with a nanobody-based delivery system, the killswitch can then be steered towards specific condensates in living cells, arresting proteins that once moved freely and revealing how the physical properties of these droplets shape their biochemical roles. “It enables us to really change the emergent properties of condensates,” Hnisz says.\n\nFocusing on the nucleolus — a droplet-like structure involved in producing the cell’s protein-making machinery — Hnisz and his colleagues showed that immobilizing one of its key scaffolding proteins disrupted its internal dynamics and molecular composition, unexpectedly causing some components to be excluded from the structure entirely.\n\nThe researchers also applied the killswitch in two disease-specific contexts. In leukaemia cells, targeting condensates formed by cancer-driving protein fusions rapidly reduced the proliferation of malignant cells in mice. In virus-infected cells, directing the killswitch to condensates involved in viral assembly sharply curtailed the production of infectious particles.\n\nDroplets to drugs\n\nSuch findings hint at therapeutic opportunities in the growing field of condensate-targeted drug discovery.\n\n“You can imagine using this rationale to design a cell-penetrating peptide that homes to a specific disease-driving condensate and changes its emergent properties,” says Isaac Klein, chief scientific officer of Dewpoint Therapeutics, a condensate-focused drug company in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nAlternatively, notes Klein, the killswitch could serve as a drug-discovery tool — for example, to identify compounds that alter condensate properties in similar ways. “It sets the stage for it,” he says.",

The raids targeted Iran’s uranium-enrichment facilities in Fordow and Natanz, and its nuclear research centre in Isfahan, using stealth bombers to drop massive ‘bunker-busters’, and cruise missiles.\n\nAlthough Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, experts have long assessed that Iran was close to having the capability of building nuclear weapons if it chose to do so. The US attacks followed a bombing campaign by Israel, which has since carried out further attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. On 23 June, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that \"very significant damage is expected to have occurred\" at the underground Fordow site.\n\nResearchers at academic institutions and think tanks are also assessing the potential impacts of the attacks on Iran's nuclear capabilities. Analysts have said that the attacks probably set the nuclear programme back substantially, but not permanently. In particular, Iran could have moved stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium, and perhaps some enrichment centrifuges, elsewhere. David Albright, a nuclear policy specialist and president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington DC, spoke to Nature about what researchers know.\n\nHow do you assess the impact of the bombings on Iran's nuclear capabilities?\n\nThere aren’t many researchers who are able to assess the impact of the bombings. We have decades of experience with the Iranian nuclear programme, so we know their facilities and activities very well. And we have great access to satellite imagery — which we have to buy. We try to buy some every day. And we utilize analysts who have decades of experience to analyze these images. We also have lots of contacts with governments, and we have colleagues who also have contacts with governments.\n\nCraters and holes at the Fordow nuclear facility in Iran following US strikes.Credit: MAXAR TECHNOLOGIES HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nA lot of the damage is on the surface, so it’s a question of knowing what the building did [in terms of its role in the nuclear program]. We rely on our repository of information about the sites that are attacked. So it’s pretty straightforward.\n\nObviously, more problematic is the underground sites. When we initially assessed Israel’s bombing of Natanz, three days later I saw a very small crater above the underground hall. I could work out and link it to a type of Earth-penetrator weapon that Israel is known to have. It would leave a really small crater when it went in, and the damage would be underground. The United States bombed it with a much more powerful Earth penetrator. So damage is probably more extensive.\n\nHow and when will we know for sure the extent of the damage?\n\nAs nuclear experts, we’d like to see this done with diplomatic agreements, where Iran would allow intrusive inspections into its programme. If that does not happen, then it’s the job of US and Israeli intelligence to assess the damage. They’re looking at communications intercepts, or trying to recruit people on the inside to reveal information.\n\nWould there be radioactive materials detected outside Natanz, Esfahan and Fordow if the attacks were successful?\n\nSo far, the IAEA reports no such leaks. And it appears that Iran had moved the enriched uranium stockpiles in the days before the bombings. The United States has said that the target of its bombings was the facilities, so they understand they are not getting at the nuclear material.",

          "title": "Medical AI can transform medicine — but only if we carefully track the data it touches",
          "authors": "Akhil Vaid",
          "abstract": "The practice of modern medicine is built on pattern recognition — whether in a patient’s history, physical examination, laboratory results or response to treatment. A skilled physician can identify crucial patterns early and distinguish them from others that appear deceptively similar.\n\nBut some patterns are too chaotic, too subtle or too fleeting to raise red flags. No doctor can reliably catch early-stage pancreatic cancer from routine blood tests, for example. Answers to many questions of profound importance that demand knowledge of the future1, such as whether a tumour will spread or how long a person might live, are thus subjective — often coming down to a physician’s cumulative experience or ‘gut feeling’.\n\nOne approach to reducing subjectivity in medicine is through supervised machine learning — a technique based on creating computer models that can detect patterns by learning from labelled data. For instance, by examining many mammogram images that either include or lack tumours, models can learn how to recognize the statistical features that tend to go with one label or the other, even when those features aren’t obvious to the human eye.\n\nWhy an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science\n\nUnsurprisingly, interest in predictive modelling has exploded. In cases involving tumour spread, organ failure or narrow treatment windows, accurate knowledge of how someone’s condition might unfold can conserve resources, reduce suffering and save lives. In 2024 alone, the citation database PubMed indexed more than 26,000 studies mentioning artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning or deep learning in patient health care and clinical medicine. The global market for AI in health care is projected to exceed US$46 billion by the end of this year, and $200 billion by 2030.\n\nYet any model, no matter how sophisticated, is still a source of uncertainty. If it underestimates risk, it contributes to clinicians overlooking serious concerns. And if it overestimates risk, it could lead to unnecessary tests and interventions, and wasted resources.\n\nA model’s usefulness is typically judged by how well it generalizes to previously unseen data, which is treated as a proxy for real-world performance. But there’s a catch: in learning to predict outcomes, models also absorb the clinical decisions, relationships and biases that are baked into the data used to train them. Supervised learning relies on the assumption that these conditions, including the biases, will remain stable during model use. Without this foundation, things fall apart.\n\nFor example, ‘Is this patient at risk of dying tomorrow?’ is a different question in a rural outpatient clinic than in a cardiac intensive-care unit, and a model trained in one setting is likely to perform poorly in the other.\n\nCurrent best practices2 emphasize transparency in data sources and encourage testing models in the environments where they will be used. Still, given that many medical data sets are small, biased or tied to narrow populations, the odds that models will underperform or stop working altogether remain uncomfortably high.\n\nHowever, the greatest threat to the widespread adoption of predictive modelling in health care could come not from the instances in which the model fails outright, but rather those in which it succeeds in delivering results.\n\nData contamination\n\nWherever machine learning is used in a health-care setting, it is typically built on the foundation of the electronic health record (EHR) for patients. Although EHR adoption varies globally, it is deeply embedded in many high-income countries, where it serves as both the source of training data for predictive models and the system through which those predictions are returned to clinicians. At its core, the EHR is a dynamic database that continuously logs almost all aspects of patient care — including lab results, medication, clinical notes and key events such as infections or deaths.\n\nCould biomarkers mean better pain treatment?\n\nBy expanding the amount of patient data available, the EHR enables a standardized workflow: data are pulled from the EHR to train models, and once the models are deployed, they analyse fresh patient data to predict potential health risks. These predictions can guide clinical decisions — for example, prompting a physician to order a chest X-ray or to begin administering antibiotics if a model flags a high risk of pneumonia, even before classic symptoms fully develop.\n\nBut the EHR is also the destination of the predictions of models — and the consequences of those predictions. Take, for example, a model designed to detect early signs of the onset of sepsis. Ideally, the physician is alerted and takes timely action in administering antibiotics or fluids to prevent the condition from progressing. This is exactly the kind of impact we want from AI in health care. Sepsis is notoriously hard to catch early and has a mortality rate of 30–40%, so swift intervention can save lives.\n\nBut therein lies the rub: because the physician intervened, the patient doesn’t develop sepsis. As a result, the pattern the model flagged — originally linked to sepsis — is now recorded in the EHR as being associated with a non-septic outcome. This creates a ‘contaminated association’3 in the data, in which warning signs of sepsis seem to lead to good outcomes, simply because of successful intervention. As these associations accumulate, they begin to erode the reliability of existing and even future models.\n\nOver time, even well-performing AI models can degrade. Shifts in patient demographics, evolving standards of care, new medications or changes in clinical practice can all cause a model’s predictions to become less accurate — a phenomenon known as model drift.\n\nA physician in a French hospital studies an X-ray in which an artificial-intelligence model has flagged possible fractures. Credit: Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty\n\nRetraining models on newer, more representative data is widely considered the best way to recover performance4. But as the EHR database gets corrupted with false associations, retraining becomes effectively impossible. The data set used to train the model now contains a pattern that implies sepsis, but also ‘not-sepsis’. This is the equivalent of teaching addition to a child by telling them that two plus two is four. Sometimes. At other times it’s three, but only when it’s not five3.\n\nSerious conditions such as pneumonia, acute kidney injury (AKI) and sepsis often occur together during a single illness or hospital stay. A model that successfully prevents one of these conditions might indirectly prevent the others as well. This introduces misleading associations into the EHR — not just for current models, but for those yet to be built3.\n\nThings get even more complicated when multiple AI models are used in the same clinical setting. For example, one model might predict the risk of AKI, while another might forecast blood clots. These are different conditions, but both rely on the same lab values, such as measurements of the waste product creatinine, blood platelets or inflammatory markers. If a physician responds to the AKI alert by adjusting fluids or medications, that could render the predictions of the blood-clot model obsolete, or unreliable. In this way, an intervention triggered by one model can quietly disrupt another, even if they are focused on entirely different outcomes3.\n\nHigher-order effects\n\nCurrent approaches to predictive modelling in health care don’t account for how models interact with each other or with clinical decision-making. This raises serious questions about some of the field’s core practices, starting with how researchers monitor model performance after deployment.\n\nIf a model helps to prevent an adverse event, its predictions do not occur — for example, patients do not die of sepsis — and its real-world performance might appear to decline5. That said, a drop in performance could also mean that the model isn’t working well in practice and is making poor predictions. It is often difficult to tell the difference between these two situations.\n\nOne way to improve understanding of what’s happening is to regularly compare outcomes between periods when the model is active and when it is not. This kind of side-by-side comparison can help to determine whether the model is truly effective or if it’s falling short. In this scenario, an expected range of performance change should be established as part of the evaluation process. If performance drops beyond this range, it might indicate model degradation. If the drop is smaller than expected, it could point to limited model use or ineffective integration into clinical practice. Estimating this range in advance can be difficult, because factors such as model drift or clinical variability might interfere. A more reliable approach might be to determine the range experimentally, under controlled conditions.\n\nA question of trust for AI research in medicine\n\nUnfortunately, real-world patient care, especially in environments with multiple models and providers, is far removed from controlled conditions. Although randomized controlled trials6 (RCTs) remain the gold standard for evaluating clinical treatments and models, applying that level of control in day-to-day clinical settings is rarely possible. In practice, clinicians might need to choose between several overlapping or even conflicting models. As the number of deployed models grows, the results of isolated, tightly controlled studies become less reliable as indicators of real-world effectiveness. Unless a model is going to be used in exactly the same controlled environment in which it was tested — free from competing models, system changes or drift — its performance in isolation should be interpreted with caution.\n\nEven if we accept RCTs at face value as being able to provide usable proof of a predictive model’s effectiveness, they come with substantial financial and time costs. A more practical way to assess a model is to test it on entirely new data — such as from another hospital or site. This process, often called external validation, helps to show whether the model can detect real biological patterns rather than just those specific to the data it was trained on. But akin to the challenges related to retraining models, this kind of testing becomes much harder7 when previous models have already shaped or influenced the data being used for testing.",

Now, scientists are taking what they have learnt from these animals and are applying that knowledge to human cells, thanks to advances in genomics, proteomics and imaging at the level of the single cell.\n\n“There’s a big push right now to exploit super-healing species and to try to see how quickly we can translate those findings,” says Albert Almada, a stem-cell biologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n\nSeveral research teams presented their latest findings at the International Society for Stem Cell Research meeting in Hong Kong last week.\n\nZebrafish spines\n\nA zebrafish (Danio rerio) with a severed spinal cord can go from being paralysed to moving fluidly in eight weeks. Mayssa Mokalled, who studies tissue regeneration and stem-cell biology at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and her colleagues have identified a population of cells in the zebrafish that are important for this recovery — and these cells are similar to human fetal astrocytes. After an injury, astrocytes create a protective barrier around the damaged site, but can also inhibit neuronal repair.\n\nMokalled and her colleagues looked for molecules involved in the activation of the cells that induce regeneration in zebrafish. When the team introduced the same molecules into human astrocytes, the cells started to look and behave more like those of the zebrafish. In preliminary studies in which the researchers transplanted the transformed human cells into mice, the cells seemed more effective at creating the protective barrier, but the inhibitory post-injury response was reduced. “I would love to see this go all the way to therapy,” says Mokalled.\n\nLizard tails\n\nBut the evolutionary distance between zebrafish and humans is wide. Almada is instead looking at the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). Lizards are the closest living relatives to humans that can regenerate an entire appendage. Humans and lizards share many of the same genes. “We think it’ll be more translatable to human biology, because they have a lot of the same machineries at the DNA level,” says Almada.\n\nAt the conference, Almada described how a population of muscle stem cells in lizards regenerates the animal’s tail. The cells are similar to those found in mice and humans, except that the lizard version can make muscle tissue from scratch, which the mouse and human versions cannot, he says. Almada hopes to work out how the lizard cells achieve this feat and eventually apply that to muscle growth in humans to treat degenerative muscular diseases, strengthen muscles in older people and treat wounds.",

Credit: Jaco Marais/Foto24/Gallo Images/Getty\nRadioastronomy in Africa\n\nIn 2005, when South Africa and its partner countries in Africa submitted a proposal to host the world’s largest radio telescope, called the Square Kilometre Array, the continent had five radioastronomers, all based in South Africa. That year, the country embarked on a targeted human-capital development programme to develop talent needed to build, operate and use radio telescopes, which collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the government-funded programme has created 5 research-chair positions and more than 1,370 scholarships for undergraduate, master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral studies — at a total cost of about 500 million rand (US$28 million).\n\nNow, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is under construction. It will have more than 100,000 tree-like antennas in Australia and almost 200 dish antennas in South Africa. South Africa owns and operates several radio telescopes, and there are hundreds of radioastronomers and students at universities and institutions in African countries.\n\nNature’s careers team spoke to officials and scientists working to grow Africa’s radioastronomy capacity, in part through the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. In the first of a short series of articles investigating the growth of the discipline on the continent, Bernie Fanaroff, who led South Africa’s SKA bid, describes how a relatively small amount of money can create a critical mass of internationally competitive researchers.\n\nWhen we threw our hat in the ring to host the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), we knew that we had to be very focused in how we spent our money. One of the conditions for government support for the bid, both from the South African government and from the African Union heads of state, was human-capital development on the continent. Back then, there were a handful of radioastronomers in Africa. We wanted to create a discipline here.\n\nIn the first year, we had about 40 million rand (US$2 million) to start developing the skills to build and use a pathfinder telescope to show that South Africa had the capability to host the SKA. We did not want to spread the money too thinly and were strict about which projects qualified for support. We started to get very good people, but there weren’t enough Black or female students entering the programme for there to be any kind of transformation at the graduate level. Black people account for more than 80% of the South African population but, historically, astronomers in South Africa were white men. We wanted to change that.\n\nStar-struck: living my childhood dream as an astronomer\n\nIn response, we extended our development programme to undergraduate students, but we still struggled to attract Black and female candidates, and so we went further back, to secondary schools. For example, although our scholarship programme offers preferential access to students from the Karoo, the region in South Africa where the telescopes are based, pupils there struggled to meet the university entrance requirements for science and mathematics. So, we relocated specialist secondary-school teachers to the area to create an end-to-end process.\n\nThere’s a whole pool of young people out there who are extremely capable but have not had an opportunity to get into science. There are real social and economic barriers for women and for Black students in South Africa.\n\nYou can’t expect diverse candidates to appear out of nowhere. You have got to go and look for these people, find them and recognize that, given the circumstances, they have immense promise. Then, you have to take a chance on that person.\n\nIf you come from an under-resourced school or previously disadvantaged area, it is difficult to negotiate university — an entirely new environment. Students might have real gaps in their basic learning, but it’s not only that. They often don’t have the confidence, the study skills or the knowledge of university bureaucracy to succeed. A 2019 government study1 found that three out of five less-privileged South African students do not complete their university studies.\n\nCareer resources for African scientists\n\nStudents have got to feel that there’s somebody there, even just as a psychological mentor. Kim Anthony, head of human-capital development for the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cape Town, and her team have been very hands-on and made a huge difference by simply caring about these students.\n\nWe also required universities to show that they had the appropriate people to mentor students. Initially, there were not enough supervisors for the growing pool of students, so we funded five research-chair positions and some mid-career positions, with funds for students, postdocs and start-up costs. That’s been very successful.\n\nPlanting the seeds of astronomy\n\nSouth Africa’s 64-dish MeerKAT telescope, inaugurated in 2018, demonstrated that the country was becoming a hub for advanced radioastronomy, technology and science. MeerKAT, which is one of the most sensitive radio telescopes in the world, will eventually be absorbed into the SKA. It attracted world-leading researchers in science and engineering, and our young people now have access to this telescope and that international expertise.",

Using large language models (LLMs) to streamline two laborious steps in the systematic-review process, the team rapidly reproduced a dozen Cochrane reviews — a particularly rigorous type of study — and even updateed a review in just 20 minutes, says co-author Christian Cao, a medical student at the University of Toronto, Canada.\n\nCan AI review the scientific literature — and figure out what it all means?\n\n“It’s crazy to see that, in the time I get a coffee, a systematic review would be done,” says Cao. He and two of his collaborators have started a spin-off company called otto review to turn their methods into a commercial software platform.\n\nBut other researchers question whether the technology can accelerate the process as much as its creators suggest. They point out that the team has not yet automated some key tasks, and that the system needs to be tested independently — which would require more details of the study to be released. “For a scientific paper, its claims need to be verifiable — and I can’t verify it,” says James Thomas, a systematic-review specialist at University College London.\n\nLengthy task\n\nSystematic reviews are important because they help put many academic studies into context by combining their results. They underlie the guidelines used in medical practice worldwide and are increasingly used to guide decisions in policy, education and elsewhere.\n\nBut doing a systematic review is a chore. It involves searching academic databases to find potentially thousands of relevant studies, screening them to pull out the handful of most pertinent ones, assessing whether they could be biased or untrustworthy and extracting and analysing the data, often using a statistical technique called a meta-analysis. The process often takes months — sometimes years — and its cost often exceeds US$100,000 per review, according to one estimate, which is why many systematic reviews are not kept up to date.\n\nScientists are building giant ‘evidence banks’ to create policies that actually work\n\nResearchers have long used software to help, but the past few years have seen a surge of interest in using LLMs to automate parts of the task. “This field is awash with hype-y claims from companies,” says Justin Clark, who builds automated review tools at Bond University in Gold Coast, Australia.",

In a small study, the drug liraglutide reduced monthly migraine episodes by nearly half among people with obesity who experience the headache-inducing condition.\n\nMigraine is more than a headache — a radical rethink offers hope to one billion people\n\nThis is the first clinical study to explore the potential of the popular weight-loss drugs — known as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists — to curb migraine, a condition that affects around 15% of people worldwide and is characterized by debilitating headaches that can be accompanied by nausea, light sensitivity and fatigue.\n\nThe pilot study’s results were presented on 21 June at the Congress of the European Association of Neurology in Helsinki, a few days after publication in the journal Headache1. The work did not include a control group, so part of the headache reduction observed could be down to the placebo effect, says Lanfranco Pellesi, a physician specializing in headache disorders at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense who was not involved in the study. (The placebo effect is when a person experiences a benefit from a drug because they know they’re taking it and expect to feel better.)\n\nBut the results are promising enough to justify a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis, Pellesi says. Such a trial would be needed to prove that the drugs can be used against migraines, he adds.\n\nGLP-1 drugs are already used to treat obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but they are being tested against a wide range of other conditions, including arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease and addiction.\n\nBetter quality of life\n\nIn the study, Simone Braca, a neurologist at the Federico II University of Naples in Italy, and his colleagues administered liraglutide to 31 people with chronic migraine and obesity.

The same company manufactures semaglutide, which is sold as Ozempic to treat diabetes and Wegovy to stimulate weight loss. Both liraglutide and semaglutide mimic the hormone GLP-1, which is involved in blood-sugar regulation and appetite suppression.",

Here we conducted a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis on two measures of co-offending, prevalence and group size, using data from 110 included studies from 17 countries.

When used in Chinese (versus English), GPT exhibits a more interdependent (versus independent) social orientation and a more holistic (versus analytic) cognitive style. Second, we replicate these cultural tendencies in ERNIE, a popular generative AI model in China. Third, we demonstrate the real-world impact of these cultural tendencies. For example, when used in Chinese (versus English), GPT is more likely to recommend advertisements with an interdependent (versus independent) social orientation. Fourth, exploratory analyses suggest that cultural prompts (for example, prompting generative AI to assume the role of a Chinese person) can adjust these cultural tendencies.",

          "abstract": "Previous research and theorizing have overwhelmingly focused on the psychological underpinnings of conspiracy beliefs. Here we examine what conspiracy beliefs imply for attitudes and behaviours relevant for the social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. We propose that conspiracy beliefs mostly contribute negatively to sustainability, either by reducing sustainable attitudes and behaviours or by justifying (and thereby reinforcing) people’s existing unsustainable attitudes and behaviours. Specifically, conspiracy beliefs are mostly associated with reduced public health and well-being, weakened social cohesion and deteriorated basic human rights (social sustainability); with lower support for reducing carbon emissions, investing in clean energy sources and preserving delicate ecosystems (environmental sustainability); and with reduced trust and cooperation, diminished support for technological innovation and increased harm to the international relationships necessary for fair trade (economic sustainability). However, most studies supporting these relationships were conducted in western democratic societies, underscoring a need for more cross-cultural research on these issues.",

This has implications for both gender equity and viewpoint representation. Sampling over 400,000 publications and a similar number of authors, we examine gender differences in several scholarly outcomes including publication count, career survival, coauthor gender, journal status, and mean citation count. We find men and women are similarly productive, successful, and connected, though women have shorter research careers and thus fewer papers. We also find gender homophily effects in collaboration, but no evidence of gender bias in peer review.",

          "authors": "Xiaoyu Ge, Yubo Hou",
          "abstract": "Regional collectivism has been observed to contribute to better coping with public crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study poses a reverse question: Does the eruption of public crises increase people’s conformity to the collective? To answer this question, we analyzed real-world transactions on Taobao (the largest e-commerce platform in China), each with a purchase decision and a list of candidates considered before purchasing. Conformity to the collective was measured using two indicators: whether the decision-maker opted for the A) most-sold and B) best-rated options within the candidate option set. The results reveal that both conformity variables were significantly higher in the 10 wk subsequent to January 19, 2020 (when the nationwide COVID-19 crisis erupted in China), than in the 8 wk prior. These shifts were common across subpopulations, regions, and product categories and remained significant after strictly matching across weeks and after using a within-person, longitudinal sample. These shifts were more confidently attributed to the pandemic by further conducting difference-in-differences analyses to compare pandemic-affected regions with their unaffected, comparable counterparts using data from six subsequent regional waves in China. Furthermore, regions with larger increases in conformity during the early stage of the pandemic achieved better antipandemic outcomes. These findings provide real-world evidence for previous theories on behavioral immune systems, terror management, and compensatory control. Additionally, cross-regional comparisons of effect sizes offer exploratory insights into cultural psychology. In summary, these findings capture how human societies dynamically adjust their values to better adapt to unanticipated survival challenges.",

          "abstract": "Indirect reciprocity is a compelling explanation for stable cooperation in a large society: Those who cooperate appropriately earn a good standing, so that others are more likely to cooperate with them. However, this mechanism requires a population to agree on who has good standing and who has bad standing. Consensus can be provided by a central institution that monitors and broadcasts reputations. But how might such an institution be maintained, and how can a population ensure that it is effective and incorruptible? Here, we explore a simple mechanism to sustain an institution for judging reputations: a tax collected from each member of the population. We analyze the possible tax rate that individuals will rationally pay to sustain an institution of judgment, which provides a public good in the form of information, and we derive necessary conditions for individuals to resist the temptation to evade their tax payment. We also consider the possibility that institution members may be corrupt and subject to bribery, and we analyze how strong the incentives against corruption need to be. Our analysis has implications for establishing robust public institutions that provide social information to support cooperation in large populations—and the potential negative consequences associated with wealth or income inequality.",

          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more widely used, people increasingly rely on them to make or advise on moral decisions. Some researchers even propose using LLMs as participants in psychology experiments. It is, therefore, important to understand how well LLMs make moral decisions and how they compare to humans. We investigated these questions by asking a range of LLMs to emulate or advise on people’s decisions in realistic moral dilemmas. In Study 1, we compared LLM responses to those of a representative U.S. sample ( N = 285) for 22 dilemmas, including both collective action problems that pitted self-interest against the greater good, and moral dilemmas that pitted utilitarian cost–benefit reasoning against deontological rules. In collective action problems, LLMs were more altruistic than participants. In moral dilemmas, LLMs exhibited stronger omission bias than participants: They usually endorsed inaction over action. In Study 2 ( N = 474, preregistered), we replicated this omission bias and documented an additional bias: Unlike humans, most LLMs were biased toward answering “no” in moral dilemmas, thus flipping their decision/advice depending on how the question is worded. In Study 3 ( N = 491, preregistered), we replicated these biases in LLMs using everyday moral dilemmas adapted from forum posts on Reddit. In Study 4, we investigated the sources of these biases by comparing models with and without fine-tuning, showing that they likely arise from fine-tuning models for chatbot applications. Our findings suggest that uncritical reliance on LLMs’ moral decisions and advice could amplify human biases and introduce potentially problematic biases.",

AI-based tools have become particularly common in assessment decisions, such as when recruiting employees or admitting students. Calls for transparency and new legislation require organizations to disclose the use of AI assessment tools, thus making people under assessment aware of its use. We investigate whether this shift from human to AI assessment affects people’s behavior during the assessment. We propose that people emphasize their analytical characteristics and downplay their intuitive and emotional ones under AI (vs. human) assessment, a phenomenon we label “the AI assessment effect.” Twelve studies (eight in text and four in the Supporting Information; N = 13,342) document the AI assessment effect and its underlying mechanism: the lay belief that AI prioritizes analytical characteristics in its assessment. Whereas prior work has studied perceptions of AI assessment tools and their productivity gains, the current research demonstrates systematic behavioral changes because of AI assessment. The findings offer theoretical contributions to the psychology of AI and practical insights for organizations using AI assessment.",

          "abstract": "Determining how people behave in contexts governed by social norms can clarify both how norms influence human behavior and how norms evolve. We examined cooperative farming harvest division among the Derung, a Tibeto-Burman-speaking horticultural society in southwestern China. In the village of Dizhengdang, the norm dictates that cofarming harvests should be divided equally among participating households. This contrasts with an alternative norm followed in some other Derung villages that holds that harvests should be divided equally among participating laborers. Rational choice theory and evolutionary models of norm-based cooperation assume that individuals weigh the material and social payoffs of different actions and follow norms because doing so maximizes their payoff. However, the behavior of the Derung in Dizhengdang is not consistent with payoff maximization. Using interviews on co-farming behaviors and attitudes, along with an ultimatum game experiment framed as co-farming harvest division, we found that most respondents preferred divisions based on labor contribution. They also accurately guessed that others shared this preference and would approve of such divisions. Nonetheless, they still followed the prevailing norm of dividing by household. Their self-reported explanation for this behavior was that they desired to follow their traditional practices. Such a normative decision-making algorithm can allow individually consequential norms to persist without costly policing by other group members.",

We identify millions of pairs of relatives within our sample (82 different kinds, in total), including not only conventional biological relatives such as siblings and cousins, but also relatives-in-law, relatives through adoption, twins, and relatives connected through twins. When fitting models which assume that family resemblance arises solely from additive genetic effects and assortative mating, we find that they describe much of our data well, but that they systematically underestimate the similarity of close relatives (particularly monozygotic twins), maternal relatives, relatives-in-law, and relatives through adoption.

          "abstract": "Protein structure–function relationships are critical for understanding molecular mechanisms and the impacts of genetic variation. Mutational scanning approaches can deliver scalable analysis, usually through the study of loss-of-function variants. Rarer dominant negative and gain-of-function variants can be more information rich, as they retain a stable proteoform and can be used to dissect molecular function while retaining biological context. Dominant variant proteoforms can still engage substrates and interact with binding partners. Here, we probe the structure–function relationships of the Mus81 endonuclease by ectopic expression of deep mutational scanning libraries to find amino acid variants that confer dominant sensitivity to genotoxic stress and dominant synthetic lethality. Screening more than 2,200 MUS81 variants at 100 positions identified 13 amino acids that can be altered to elicit a dominant phenotype. The dominant phenotype of these variants required the presence of the obligate Mus81 binding protein, Mms4. The dominant variants affect amino acids in a contiguous surface on Mus81 and fall into two distinct classes: residues that bind the catalytic magnesium atoms and residues that form the hydrophobic wedge. Most of the variant amino acids were conserved across species and cognate variants expressed in human cell lines resulted in dominant sensitivity to replication stress and synthetic growth defects in cells lacking BLM helicase. The dominant variants in both yeast and human MUS81 resulted in phenotypes distinct from a MUS81 knockout. These data demonstrate the utility of dominant genetics using ectopic expression of amino acid site saturation variant libraries to link function to protein structure providing insight into molecular mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "The Late Paleozoic Ice Age (~340 to 260 Ma) occurred under peak atmospheric O 2 (1.2 to 1.7 PIAL, pre-industrial atmospheric levels) for Earth history and CO 2 concentrations comparable to those of the preindustrial to that anticipated for our near future. The evolution of the marine redox landscape under these conditions remains largely unexplored, reflecting that oceanic anoxia has long been considered characteristic of carbon cycle perturbation during greenhouse times. Despite elevated O 2 , a 10 5 -y period of CO 2 -forced oceanic anoxia was recently identified, but whether this short-term interval of widespread oceanic anoxia was anomalous during this paleo-ice age is unexplored. Here, we investigate these issues by building a high-resolution record of carbonate uranium isotopes (δ 238 U carb ) from an open-marine succession in South China that permits us to reconstruct the global marine redox evolution through the deep glacial interval (310 to 290 Ma) of near peak O 2 . Our data reveal repeated, short-term decreases in δ 238 U carb coincident with negative C isotopic excursions and rises in paleo-CO 2 , all superimposed on a longer-term rise in δ 238 U carb . A carbon–phosphorus–uranium biogeochemical model coupled with Bayesian inversion is employed to quantitatively explore the interplay between marine anoxia, carbon cycling, and climate evolution during this paleo-glacial period. Although our results indicate that protracted, enhanced organic carbon burial can account for the long-term O 2 increase, seafloor oxygenation, and overall low CO 2 , episodic pulses of C emissions had the potential to drive recurring short-term periods of marine anoxia (with 4 to 12% of seafloor anoxia) despite up to 1.7 times higher atmospheric O 2 than present day.",

          "abstract": "The contact between two rough surfaces has been a topic of significant interest since early studies on Coulombic friction and remains crucial for numerous technological applications. However, theoretical progress has outpaced experiments due to the challenges in measuring contact areas across scales ranging from subnanometers to macroscopic dimensions. Here, we demonstrate the use of commonly available infrared-based (IR) spectroscopy in combination with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical simulations to measure separation gaps and contact areas for glassy polymers ranging in roughness over two orders in magnitude. With the combined IR and FDTD simulations, we can overcome the optical diffraction limits and take advantage of the chemical specificity of IR spectroscopy to overcome limitations due to scattering. The scaling of the contact area ratio as a function of pressure illustrated the limitations of using pure elastic or plastic deformation in explaining the results. At both low and high pressures, the contact area ratios scale linearly with pressure as expected for purely elastic deformations at low pressures or plastic deformations at high pressures. However, if analyzed over a broad range of pressure, the power laws we observe are much larger than 1, exemplifying the need to consider elastoplastic models in explaining results for softer polymer contacts compared to other brittle, glassy materials. In comparison, the separation gaps scale exponentially with pressure, as expected. These results have important implications for the interpretation of properties such as friction, adhesion, and conductivity for softer, glassy contact interfaces.",

Although this lattice which is physically tethered to the membrane might be expected to hinder cell division, we show that the S-layer flattens the membrane at cytokinesis to accelerate ESCRT-III-dependent cell division—and is important for robust, successful cell divisions under conditions of mechanical stress. Taken together, these results define the rules governing S-layer self-assembly and show how a flexible lattice coat that is coupled to the underlying membrane can both provide a cell with mechanical support and help to drive rapid and functionally important changes in cell shape.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by Nature, we present a polypeptide-based organic redox-active material constructed from renewable feedstocks, L-glutamic acid (an amino acid) and riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ), to address challenges with start-to-end-of-life management in energy storage systems (ESSs). The amino acid was utilized to establish a degradable polymer backbone, along which many copies of riboflavin were incorporated to serve as the redox-active pendant groups that enabled energy storage. The overall synthesis involved the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of an l -glutamic acid-derived N- carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomer, followed by side chain activation with azides and, finally, click coupling to achieve installation of alkyne-functionalized riboflavin moieties. The steric bulkiness and rich chemical functionality of riboflavin resulted in synthetic complexities that required reaction optimization to achieve the desired polymer structure. Electrochemical characterization of the resultant riboflavin polypeptide, in organic electrolyte, showed quasireversible redox activity with a half-wave potential (E 1/2 ) of ca. −1.10 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc + ). Cell viability assays revealed biocompatibility, as indicated by negligible cytotoxicity for fibroblast cells. The polypeptide design, consisting of labile amide backbone linkages and side-chain ester functionalities that tethered the riboflavin units to the backbone, enabled hydrolytic degradation to recover building blocks for future upcycling or recycling. This bioinspired strategy advances the development of degradable redox-active polymers and promotes sustainable materials design for circular energy storage technologies.",

Studies of viral genome organization and replication mechanisms are fundamental to the understanding of virus pathogenicity. In this study, we identified an unique transcript from EIAV in vivo and in vitro by Sanger sequencing and Northern blotting. The transcript contains a complete open reading frame and has length 369 nt. We named the protein encoded by this transcript S4 and demonstrated its expression in EIAV-infected cells. An S4-deficient EIAV infectious clone displayed obviously impaired virion release and attenuated virus replication in vitro, demonstrating that S4 plays a role in the release step of EIAV. The host restriction factor tetherin has broad-spectrum antiviral activity and prevents the release of a wide range of enveloped viruses, including lentiviruses. Here, we demonstrated that S4 enhances the release of the EIAV-like particle by counteracting the equine tetherin (eqTHN). S4 interacts with the eqTHN and sequesters it within intracellular membrane compartments, attenuating eqTHN expression on the cell surface and thereby disrupting its antiviral activity. Further investigation revealed that S4 retains eqTHN in the endoplasmic reticulum and trans-Golgi network through impacting its anterograde transport to the cell surface and may interfere with the posttranslational modification of this membrane protein. Collectively, our findings uncover an accessory protein, S4, of EIAV and reveal its ability to promote virion release by antagonizing the antiviral activity of the host restriction factor tetherin.",

How this phage is organized and how it promotes biofilm formation and infection at the molecular level is unclear.

Comparison with other filamentous bacteriophages offers clues about inoviral genome encapsidation mechanisms, providing a framework for understanding the evolutionary diversity of inoviruses. A disordered, N-terminal segment in the MCP presents hydrophobic patches on the surface of assembled phage particles, which, together with electron cryotomography data of phage bundles, furnishes a structural rationale for phage–phage interactions that were seen previously in an epithelium adhesion infection model of N. meningitidis . Taken together, our results shed light on the structure, organization, and higher-order assembly of a biomedically relevant phage encoded in the genome of a human pathogen. Molecular insights gleaned from this study increase our understanding of phage evolution, phage-mediated bacterial adhesion, and pathogenicity.",

In cyanobacteria, single RRM domain proteins are involved in mRNA targeting to the thylakoid membrane and acclimation to certain stress conditions, but many details of their physiological functions and molecular targets have remained unknown. The model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has a family of three genes encoding the RRM domain–containing proteins Rbp1, Rbp2, and Rbp3. Here, we verified the RNA-binding activity of Rbp3 in vivo and show that cells of a Δ rbp3 deletion strain had a lower photosystem (PS) I:PSII ratio and decreased pigment content and were significantly smaller than wild-type cells. To identify the set of interacting molecules, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed with a strain expressing a C-terminally FLAG-tagged Rbp3. Mass spectrometry of the elution fraction suggested physical proximity between Rbp3, ribosomes, and a very small number of other proteins. The most highly enriched transcript in the coeluting RNA fraction was the psaAB mRNA. This was corroborated by fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses showing decreased psaA mRNA signals in Δ rbp3 , and colocalization with Rbp3 fusions to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the wild type. Other mRNAs coenriched with Rbp3 encode thylakoid, plasma membrane, and carboxysome proteins. Binding assays using Bio-layer Interferometry validated the Rbp3- psaAB mRNA interaction, indicating a preference for folded RNA segments near or overlapping the respective stop codons.",

          "abstract": "The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) harbors extraordinarily high levels of biodiversity and endemism. The region is warming at a rate twice the global average, yet the evolutionary dynamics of its unique biota are poorly understood. Here, we used the endemic land plant genera of the QTP to investigate how its floristic endemism was shaped over time by Cenozoic geoclimatic changes. We first clarified that the QTP hosts 82 endemic land plant genera; we found that the origins of these endemic genera were most likely driven by ecological niche and elevation differentiation, caused by the uplift of the QTP and associated climate change. By sampling 37 land plant clades that together encompass 1,740 species, covering all 82 endemic genera, we show that QTP floristic endemism had emerged by the Early Eocene. Furthermore, the unique biodiversity of the QTP comprises a mix of indigenous elements and immigrants. Among the three subregions of the QTP (Plateau Platform, Himalaya, and the Hengduan Mountains), the processes associated with floristic endemism are asynchronous, reflecting different geoclimatic events with the Miocene as a particularly critical period. The relative contributions of in situ speciation and immigration to the unique biodiversity of the three subregions are also markedly different; in situ speciation dominated in the Hengduan Mountains, which hosts the oldest endemic components of the flora and has served as an important “pump” and “sink” of unique biodiversity. These findings provide insights into how past geoclimatic events may have shaped floristic endemism on the QTP and also have important conservation implications.",

          "abstract": "Freshwater resources are fundamental to supporting humanity, and measures of water scarcity have been critical for identifying where water requirements and water availability are imbalanced. Existing water scarcity metrics typically account for blue water withdrawals (i.e., from surface-/groundwater), while the contribution of green water (i.e., soil moisture) and water quality—dimensions with important implications for multiple societal sectors—to water scarcity remains unclear. Here, we introduce the concept of multidimensional water scarcity that explicitly assesses all three of these dimensions of water scarcity and evaluates their individual and combined effects. We find that 22 to 26% of the global land area and 58 to 64% of the global population are exposed to some form of water scarcity annually, with multidimensional (i.e., blue, green, and quality) water scarcity particularly high in India, China, and Pakistan. Examining seasonal water scarcity, we estimate that 5.9 billion people (or 80% of the world’s population in 2015) were exposed to at least one dimension of water scarcity for at least 1 mo per year and that 1-in-10 people (10%) were exposed to multidimensional water scarcity at least 1 mo per year. Our findings demonstrate that the challenges of water scarcity are far more widespread than previously understood. As such, our assessment provides a more holistic view of global water scarcity issues and points to overlooked scarcity where action needs to bring human pressure on freshwater resources into balance with water quantity and quality.",

In this study, we observed a continuous LLPT with an inversion of electronegativity in a K–Rb binary alloy. This uniquely exhibits a three-state system behavior. The transition, induced by pressure-driven reordering of electronic orbital energies, progresses through a sequence from s -metal to electride to d -metal, accompanied by a valence reversal: Potassium transitions from a negative to a positive valence, while rubidium undergoes the opposite shift. This process is marked by two successive anomalies in the alloy’s optical, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties over a broad pressure range. The observation of similar LLPT phenomena in other alkali and alkaline earth metal liquids suggests that this three-state system mechanism may provide broader insights into the nature of continuous phase transitions.",

Accumulating evidence from patients with PIK3CA -related disorders indicates that peripheral nerves are frequently affected, leading to severe neurological symptoms. However, the exact underlying mechanism of these disorders remains unclear. To address this, we developed a mouse model with a PIK3CA gain-of-function mutation specifically in Schwann cells, which successfully mirrored the clinical features observed in patients. In this model, we observed that PIK3CA -mutated cells communicate with neighboring healthy cells, such as adipocytes and hair follicles, through a unique crosstalk mechanism that triggers their growth, proliferation, and anagen phase expansion. Additionally, we demonstrated that PIK3CA mutation in peripheral nerves leads to a metabolic shift through glycolytic activation. We investigated the effects of alpelisib, an approved pharmacological inhibitor of PIK3CA, in the model. Early administration of alpelisib significantly improved the signs and symptoms in the mice. However, when treatment was delayed, its efficacy was diminished due to the drug’s inability to penetrate the myelin sheath effectively. In summary, our study offers a valuable mouse model for studying PIK3CA -related neuropathy, uncovers a unique communication between healthy and affected tissues, and highlights the potential benefits of early pharmacological intervention using alpelisib.",

Recently, to overcome the challenge that genetic information of nonparticipants is unavailable, it is shown that by comparing the IBD (identity by descent) shared and not-shared segments between participating relative pairs, one can estimate the genetic component underlying participation. That, however, does not directly address how to adjust estimates of heritability and genetic correlation for phenotypes correlated with participation. Here, we demonstrate a way to do so by adopting a statistical framework that separates the genetic and nongenetic correlations between participation and these phenotypes. Crucially, our method avoids making the assumption that the effect of the genetic component underlying participation is manifested entirely through these other phenotypes. Applying the method to 12 UK Biobank phenotypes, we found eight that have significant genetic correlations with participation, including body mass index, educational attainment, and smoking status. For most of these phenotypes, without adjustments, estimates of heritability and the absolute value of genetic correlation would have underestimation biases.",

To probe the interfacial hydrogen-bond network, atmospheric water capture is a powerful tool.

In this study, we explored the role of the gut microbiome in memory regulation using a parasitoid wasp-induced oviposition depression paradigm in Drosophila melanogaster . Our findings show that flies with depleted gut microbiota, either through axenic culture or antibiotic treatment, exhibited significant memory impairments. However, reintroducing the commensal bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum alone was sufficient to restore memory, while coinoculation with Acetobacter pomorum further enhanced memory performance. Hemolymph metabolomic analyses revealed reduced amino acid levels in antibiotic-treated flies, which were linked to impaired Drosophila target of rapamycin (dTOR) signaling. Additionally, genetic manipulation of dTOR or dietary supplementation with branched-chain amino acids either mimicked or rescued the memory deficits caused by antibiotic treatments. These results suggest that the gut microbiome is essential for regulating memory function by maintaining amino acid homeostasis and proper dTOR signaling, with profound implications for advancing knowledge of cognitive regulation.",

In this work, we study the diffusion-limited settling of highly porous particles in a density-stratified fluid through a combination of experiment, analysis, and numerical simulation. By delineating and appealing to the diffusion-limited regime wherein buoyancy effects due to mass adaptation dominate hydrodynamic drag, we derive a simple expression for the steady settling velocity of a sphere as a function of the density, size, and diffusivity of the solid, as well as the density gradient of the background fluid. In this regime, smaller particles settle faster, in contrast with most conventional hydrodynamic drag mechanisms. Furthermore, we outline a general mathematical framework for computing the steady settling speed of a body of arbitrary shape in this regime and compute exact results for the case of general ellipsoids. Using hydrogels as a highly porous model system, we validate the predictions with laboratory experiments in linear stratification for a wide range of parameters. Last, we show how the predictions can be applied to arbitrary slowly varying background density profiles and demonstrate how a measured particle position over time can be used to reconstruct the background density profile.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary adaptation to new environments likely results from a combination of selective sweeps and polygenic shifts, depending on the genetic architecture of traits under selection. While selective sweeps have been widely studied, polygenic responses are thought to be more prevalent but remain challenging to quantify. The infinitesimal model makes explicit the hypothesis about the dynamics of changes in allele frequencies under selection, where only allelic effect sizes, frequencies, linkage, and gametic disequilibrium matter. Departures from this, like long-range correlations of allele frequency changes, could be a signal of epistasis in polygenic response. We performed an Evolve &amp; Resequence experiment in Drosophila melanogaster exposing flies to a high-sugar diet for over 100 generations. We tracked allele frequency changes in &gt;3000 individually sequenced flies and population pools and searched for loci under selection by identifying sites with allele frequency trajectories that differentiated selection regimes consistently across replicates. We estimate that at least 4% of the genome was under positive selection, indicating a highly polygenic response. The response was dominated by small, consistent allele frequency changes, with few loci exhibiting large shifts. We then searched for signatures of selection on pairwise combinations of alleles in the new environment and found several strong signals of putative epistatic interactions across unlinked loci that were consistent across selected populations. Finally, we measured differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across treatments and show that DEGs are enriched for selected SNPs. Our results suggest that epistatic contributions to polygenic selective response are common and lead to detectable signatures.",

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism has diverse functions, including methylation, polyamine biosynthesis, and transsulfuration, making its regulation and control crucial. Recent studies have revealed the feedback regulation of SAM production; however, the mechanisms governing its consumption are still poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the stability of SAM levels in the fat body (FB) of Drosophila , which serves as a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver and adipose tissue, under conditions of SAM shortage, including nutrient deprivation. We found that glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt), a major SAM-consuming methyltransferase in the FB, decreased via the nuclear ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS), along with the inhibition of SAM synthesis and starvation. The inhibition of Gnmt level reduction by suppression of the nuclear UPS causes starvation tolerance. Thus, the regulation of Gnmt levels through nuclear UPS-mediated reduction helps maintain SAM levels under SAM shortage conditions.",

In 2020, newly hatched Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) fry in California’s Central Valley (CCV) hatcheries swam in corkscrew patterns and died at unusually high rates due to a lack of this essential vitamin. We subsequently investigated the impacts and causes of thiamine deficiency in California’s anadromous salmonids. Our laboratory studies defined the relationship between thiamine concentrations in Chinook salmon eggs and early life-stage survival in offspring; we used these data to develop a model that estimated 26 to 48% thiamine-dependent fry mortality across consecutive years (2020–2021) for winter-run Chinook salmon. We established an egg surveillance effort that found widespread thiamine deficiency in CCV Chinook salmon in 2020 and 2021, and emerging thiamine deficiency in Klamath River and Trinity River coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ) in 2021. We determined that thiamine injections into adults raised egg thiamine concentrations above levels found to impact early life-stage survival and swimming behavior. Ocean surveys, prey nutrition, salmon gut contents, and stable isotope data link thiamine deficiency to an ocean diet dominated by a booming population of northern anchovy ( Engraulis mordax ). This forage fish had low thiamine, high lipid, and high thiaminase activity levels consistent with both a thiaminase and oxidative stress hypothesis for causing thiamine deficiency in California salmon. Our research suggests California’s already stressed anadromous salmonids will continue to be impacted by thiamine deficiency as long as their ocean forage base and diet are dominated by northern anchovy.",

          "abstract": "The outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by diderm bacteria have important roles in cell envelope homeostasis, secretion, interbacterial communication, and pathogenesis. The facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STm) activates OMV biogenesis inside the acidic vacuoles of host cells by upregulating the expression of the OM protein PagC, one of the most robustly activated genes in a host environment. Here, we used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy (EM), with native bacterial OMVs, to demonstrate that three histidines, essential for the OMV biogenic function of PagC, constitute a key pH-sensing motif. The NMR spectra of PagC in OMVs show that they become protonated around pH 6, and His protonation is associated with specific perturbations of select regions of PagC. The use of bacterial OMVs is a key aspect of this work enabling NMR structural studies in the context of the physiological environment. PagC expression upregulates OMV production in Escherichia coli , replicating its function in STm. Moreover, the presence of PagC drives a striking aggregation of OMVs and increases bacterial cell pellicle formation at acidic pH, pointing to a potential role as an adhesin active in biofilm formation. The data provide experimental evidence for a pH-dependent mechanism of OMV biogenesis and aggregation driven by an OM protein.",

          "abstract": "Despite over a century of studies, fundamental questions remain about the processes governing crystal nucleation from melts or solutions. Research over the past three decades has presented mounting evidence for kinetic pathways of crystal nucleation that are more complex than envisioned by the simplest forms of classical theory. Such observations have been presented for colloidal and elemental systems with covalent and metallic bonding. Despite the technological and geochemical importance of molten salts, similar studies for these ionically bonded systems are currently lacking. Here we develop a machine learning interatomic potential for a model ionic system: LiF. The potential features quantum-level accuracy for both liquid and multiple solid polymorphs over wide temperature and pressure ranges and accurately reproduces experimentally measured properties. Thanks to the efficiency of the potential, which enables microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, induction times for nucleation of LiF solids from their melts are computed over a range of undercoolings. With the aid of a set of robust local order parameters established here, the simulations reveal that homogeneous crystal nucleation in undercooled melts preferentially initiates from liquid regions showing slow dynamics and high bond orientational order simultaneously, and the second-shell order of both precritical nuclei and the surface of postcritical nuclei is dominated by hexagonal close packing and body-centered cubic local structure, even though the nucleus core is dominated by face-centered cubic structure corresponding to the stable rocksalt crystal structure. Finally, we establish a connection between the crystallization pathway and the equilibrium crystal–melt interface structure.",

          "abstract": "Island populations of large vertebrates have experienced higher extinction rates than mainland populations over long timescales due to demographic stochasticity, genetic drift, and inbreeding. While being more susceptible to extinction and as such potentially targeted for conservation interventions such as genetic rescue, small-island populations can experience relatively less anthropogenic habitat degradation than those on larger islands. Here, we determine the consequences and conservation implications of long-term isolation and recent human activities on genetic diversity of island populations of two forest-dependent mammals endemic to the Wallacea archipelago: the anoa ( Bubalus spp.) and babirusa ( Babyrousa spp.). Using genomic analyses and habitat suitability models, we show that, compared to closely related species, populations on mainland Sulawesi exhibit low heterozygosity, high inbreeding, a high proportion of deleterious alleles, and experience a high rate of anthropogenic disturbance. In contrast, populations on smaller islands occupy higher-quality habitats, possess fewer deleterious mutations despite exhibiting lower heterozygosity and higher inbreeding. Site frequency spectra indicate that these patterns reflect stronger, long-term purging in smaller-island populations. Our results thus suggest that conservation efforts should focus on protecting small-island high-quality habitats and avoiding translocations from mainland populations. This study highlights the crucial role of small offshore islands for the long-term survival of Wallacea’s iconic and indigenous mammals in the face of development on the mainland.",

          "abstract": "The utility of a pure population of highly regenerative satellite stem cells (SSCs) is a prerequisite for successful cell-based muscle therapies. Previous works have reported several methods for the SSC isolation. However, the majority of cells isolated using previous methods are fibroblasts and other nonmyogenic cell types, necessitating further expensive and time-consuming purification steps often affecting the regenerative quality of the isolated SSCs. Here, we describe a simple, time-effective, and robust protocol for the isolation of a pure population of SSCs in a single direct step, eliminating the need for further purification steps. By separating the muscle fascicles from the adjacent connective tissues (i.e., epimysium and perimysium) and utilizing a defined dissociation medium, a cell pool enriched in SSCs was successfully obtained. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed the stemness and the myogenic purity of the isolated cells (~97%). Upon myogenic induction, SSCs gave rise to multinucleated myofibers that exhibited spontaneous contraction in the culture dish for up to 21 d. Efforts to optimize the culture conditions revealed that tissue culture plates (TCPs) coated with a tissue-specific extract significantly enhanced SSCs’ attachment, growth, and differentiation compared to collagen I, Matrigel-coated TCPs, or noncoated TCPs. Further studies confirmed the robust myogenic regenerative capacity of the isolated cells, as evidenced by their ability to display key regenerative characteristics, demonstrating the mild effects of our isolation protocol on their regenerative capacity. The isolation protocol presented herein can potentially be used to obtain SSCs with high myogenic purity for skeletal muscle regenerative engineering and clinical indications.",

          "abstract": "Salt marshes provide valuable ecosystem services but are vulnerable to drowning with accelerated sea-level rise (SLR). Marsh belowground biomass (BGB) production helps avoid drowning by building marsh surface elevation. Reductions in BGB can serve as an early warning sign of marsh deterioration, as they often precede decreases in aboveground biomass (AGB). However, landscape-scale BGB assessments to predict broad trends in marsh deterioration have not been previously available. We applied the Belowground Ecosystem Resiliency Model (BERM) to assess standing stocks and trends in both BGB and AGB over the past decade (2014–2023) across US Georgia coast Spartina alterniflora marshes (691 km 2 ). Over this time period, BGB and AGB averaged 841 ± 323 and 221 ± 14 g m −2 , respectively, but showed opposite trends. BGB decreased on average by 0.94% per year and over most of the marsh area (72%), while AGB increased on average by 0.66% per year and showed a net increase across most of the marsh area (88%). This disconnect suggests that AGB is not a good indicator of marsh resilience, and we highlight two areas with similar AGB but different BGB. Inundation intensity, an important predictor of BGB, rose through time and was negatively related to BGB. SLR trends suggest continuing increases in inundation, which will result in further declines in BGB followed by widespread marsh drowning. Landscape BGB assessments are a valuable tool to identify ecosystem vulnerability and proactively manage salt marshes and the services they provide under rising sea levels.",

Fibrosis also contributes to immune exclusion in tumor tissues. Targeting fibrosis might be a strategy for prolonging allograft survival while suppressing cancer development. Here, single-cell transcriptomes of human and mouse heart allografts showed that macrophages accumulated in grafts with fibrosis were reprogrammed via histone methylation regulated by Setdb1, an H3K9 methyltransferase. Myeloid-specific deletion of Setdb1 prolonged heart allograft survival but reversed immune exclusion in tumor tissues. Interestingly, myeloid-specific Setdb1-knockout led to lower fibrosis in heart allografts and tumor tissues in mice. Our single-cell sequencing data showed that Setdb1 ablation impaired Fn1 + and SPP1 + profibrogenic macrophage reprogramming. Mechanistically, Fn1, which was induced by the CCR2-Creb/Setdb1 axis, upregulated the expression of genes related to fibrosis in fibroblasts and macrophages via ITGA5 and PIRA receptors. Blocking the interaction between FN1 and these receptors inhibited fibrosis in allograft and tumor tissues. Our results reveal a target, histone methylation in macrophages, for the treatment of fibrosis-related disease.",

          "abstract": "The freezing of droplets on surfaces is closely relevant with various industrial processes such as aviation, navigation, and transportation. Previous studies mainly focus on physiochemically heterogeneous but electrically homogeneous surfaces, on which the presence of vapor pressure gradient between droplets is the predominant mechanism for interdroplet freezing bridging, propagation, and eventual frosting across the entire surface. An interesting yet unanswered question is whether electrostatic charge on surfaces affects freezing dynamics. Here, we find an interdroplet freezing relay (IFR) phenomenon on electrically heterogeneous surfaces that exhibits a three-dimensional, in-air freezing propagation pathway and an accelerated freezing rate. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that this phenomenon originates from the presence of surface charge gradient established between the frozen droplet and neighboring water droplet, which leads to a spontaneous shooting of desublimated ice needles from the frozen droplet and then triggers the freezing of neighboring water droplet in in-air manner. We further demonstrate its generality across various dielectric substrates, liquids, and droplet configurations. Our work enriches conventional perspectives on droplet freezing dynamics and emphasizes the pivotal role of electrostatics in designing passive anti-icing and antifrosting materials.",

This record suggests a rapid increase in fire activity since approximately 50,000 y ago, indicating a decoupling from the monsoon climate, and this pattern is consistent with fire histories in Europe, Southeast Asia, and Papua New Guinea-Australia regions. By integrating extensive archaeological data, we propose that the intensified global expansion of modern human and population growth, coupled with the rising demand for fire use during cold glacial periods, resulted in a significant increase in fire utilization from 50,000 y onward. This suggests that a measurable human imprint on the carbon cycle via fire likely predates the Last Glacial Maximum.",

Androgenesis, a way for producing offspring solely from male genetic material, is limited in mammals, presumably due to barriers arising from genomic imprinting, an epigenetic mechanism leading to monoallelic gene expression. Here, we report adult mammalian offspring derived from the genetic material of two sperm cells. These mice, which we refer to as androgenetic mice, were produced via targeted DNA methylation editing of seven imprinting control regions (ICRs) through CRISPR-based epigenome engineering. Two sperm cells were injected into an enucleated oocyte to form putatively diploid embryos. Allele-specific epigenetic editing was achieved by injecting guide RNAs with protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences designed to match one allele but not the other. The birth of androgenetic mice that were able to develop to adulthood demonstrates that mammalian androgenesis is achievable by targeted epigenetic remodeling of a few defined ICRs.",

Our previous work demonstrated that MYCN drives metabolic reprogramming in NB, including upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. Here, we identify peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) as a promising therapeutic target in NB. Pharmacological inhibition of PRDX6 reduces MYCN levels, induces apoptosis, and promotes neuronal differentiation accompanied by lipid droplet accumulation, essential for the phenotypic reprogramming. Moreover, combined inhibition of PRDX6 and glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1), a key antioxidant enzyme needed for PRDX6 activation, demonstrated synergistic effects both in vitro and in vivo. This strategy results in neuronal maturation as well as activity and initiates downstream pathways distinct from the ones triggered by retinoic acid, the differentiation-inducing agent currently used in clinical practice for NB. Notably, both PRDX6 and GSTP1 are highly expressed in the developing murine adrenal gland, as well as in high-risk, MYCN -amplified NB, correlating with an undifferentiated state and poor prognosis. Together, our results provide insights into the potential of PRDX6 and GSTP1 as therapeutic targets for differentiation induction for children with NB.",

Although HBZ protein is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the dynamics of HBZ protein localization and its contribution to oncogenesis have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular expression pattern of HBZ in primary HTLV-1–infected T cells from asymptomatic carriers and leukemic cells of ATL patients using the Proximity Ligation Assay. Nuclear localization of HBZ protein was significantly higher in fresh ATL cells than in HTLV-1–infected cells from carriers. Importantly, translocation of HBZ protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after TGF-β activation was observed in ATL patients, but not in HTLV-1 carriers. In ATL cells, the cellular transcription factors JunB and pSmad3 interact with HBZ and facilitate its nuclear translocation upon TGF-β stimulation. JUNB knockdown inhibits cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and promotes apoptosis in ATL cells but not in HTLV-1–infected nonleukemic cells, indicating that JunB has important roles in maintaining ATL cells. In conclusion, TGF-β-induced nuclear translocation of HBZ–JunB complexes is associated with ATL oncogenesis.",

We quantified climate change exposure–shifts to species’ currently unoccupied climate zones–for 32,089 tree species globally by 2100, assessing both species-level and local tree diversity risks. On average, 69% of species are predicted to experience macroclimatic shifts in at least 10% of their range, while 14% face exposure in over 50% of their range under a high-emission (4 °C warming) future scenario. This suggests that most species retain substantial climate refugia within their current range. However, local tree diversity exposure is predicted to be severe in vast regions, including Eurasia, the northwestern United States and Canada, northern Chile, and the Amazon Delta. Under a moderate (2 °C warming) scenario, high tree diversity exposure is mostly restricted to taiga regions in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings provide conservative estimates of climate-driven biodiversity risk, as our approach focuses solely on macroclimate and does not account for additional stressors such as land-use change or species interactions. Identifying tree species and areas of high macroclimatic shift exposure allows for targeted conservation strategies, including species stability monitoring, assisted migration, and the protection of climate refugia.

To tackle this challenge, we developed an approach termed glycan-dependent affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (GAP–MS), specifically designed to characterize changes in glycoprotein PPIs under varying glycosylation conditions. GAP–MS integrates metabolic control of glycan profiles in cultured cells using small molecules referred to as glycan modifiers with affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis (AP–MS). Here, GAP–MS was applied to characterize and compare the interaction networks under five different glycosylation states for four bait glycoproteins: BSG, CD44, EGFR, and SLC3A2. This analysis identified a network comprising 156 interactions, of which 131 were determined to be glycan dependent. Notably, the GAP–MS analysis of BSG provided distinct information regarding glycosylation-influenced interactions compared to the commonly used glycosylation site mutagenesis approach combined with AP–MS, emphasizing the unique advantages of GAP–MS. Collectively, GAP–MS presents distinct insights over existing methods in elucidating how specific glycosylation forms impact glycoprotein interactions. Additionally, the glycan-dependent interaction networks generated for these four glycoproteins serve as a valuable resource for guiding future functional investigations and therapeutic developments targeting the glycoproteins discussed in this study.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the delayed interferon response. Interferons are typically produced upon host recognition of pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns, such as nucleic acids. While the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evades host recognition of its RNA are well studied, how it evades immune responses to cytosolic DNA—leaked from mitochondria or nuclei during infection—remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein directly suppresses DNA sensing by cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). Although primarily known for packaging the viral RNA genome, we uncover that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein also binds DNA with high affinity and competitively blocks cGAS activation. Using cell-free biochemical and biophysical approaches, including single-molecule optical tweezers, we show that the nucleocapsid protein binds to DNA at nanomolar concentrations and cocondenses with DNA at micromolar concentrations, thereby impeding stable cGAS-DNA interactions required for signal propagation. Hyperphosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein diminishes its competitive binding capacity. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in directly suppressing the cGAS-STING pathway, strongly suggesting that this contributes to the delayed interferon response during infection. This study raises the possibility that nucleocapsid proteins of other RNA viruses may also exhibit moonlighting functions by antagonizing host nucleic acid–sensing pathways.",

The endogenous ligand for ERβ is the dihydrotestosterone metabolite, 5β-androstane-3β, 17β-diol (3β-Adiol). Thus, treatment with 5-α reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) should produce a phenotype similar to that seen in ERβ −/− mice. By comparing RNA-Seq of the ventral prostates (VP) of ERβ knockout mice (ERβ crispr−/− ) and wild-type (WT) mice, we confirmed that ERβ modulates androgen receptor (AR) signaling indirectly by suppressing AR coactivators. Compared to WT mice, basal cell genes from ERβ crispr−/− mouse VP were significantly upregulated. A population of abnormal basal cells coexpressing P63 and AR was identified in the ERβ crispr−/− mouse VP by immunohistochemistry. In men treated with 5-ARI for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), there was induction of a P63-positive intermediate cell population characterized by down regulation of Krt14 without significant change in the expression of Krt15, upregulation of AR and NKX3.1, and increased proliferation. In both VP of aging ERβ crispr−/− mice and in human prostates after 5-ARI treatment, there was substantial immune infiltration. Testosterone treatment inhibited immune infiltration in the VP of ERβ crispr−/− mice. We conclude that ERβ is a gene critical in maintaining normal basal cells and modulating immune environment in the prostate. Its loss leads to histological changes suggesting prostatitis and increases the number of intermediate cells, which are considered to be the cells of origin of prostate cancers. We suggest that an ERβ agonist could protect against 5-ARI-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and defects in the basal cell layer in BPH.",

Metabotropic glutamate receptors and HCN ion channels inside clusters contact their neighbors through structured extracellular and intracellular domains, respectively. Other ion channels, including Kv2.1 and Slo1, appear to form clusters through prominent intrinsically disordered sequences in the cytoplasm. These distinct modes of interaction are associated with clusters exhibiting varying degrees of compactness and order.

In this study, we demonstrate a role for BMP-9 in regulating pulmonary vascular architecture and homeostasis. Our findings reveal that BMP-9 signaling intersects with VEGF pathways and contributes to the delicate balance between vascular growth and remodeling in the lungs. We also show that disruption of this pathway can shift vascular responses toward an HHT-like state, potentially altering disease susceptibility.

Previously, we have shown that signaling of ABA in the endodermis leads to protoxylem (PX) differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that ROPs suppress PX differentiation in the roots of both Arabidopsis and tomato. Fourier transform and Shannon’s entropy show that endodermal ABA signaling controls the periodicity and overall order of PX secondary cell wall (SCW) coils in an ROP-dependent manner. Correspondingly, in the PX, GFP-ROP11 is initially dispersed and gradually becomes distributed in an oscillatory fashion with a periodicity corresponding to that of the SCW coils. Oryzalin treatments disrupt the frequency and increase the entropy of the GFP-ROP11 signal, suggesting that microtubules delimit ROP distribution. Signaling of ABA in the endodermis encourages the enlargement of metaxylem SCW pits, while ABA signaling in the stele limits this enlargement. Pit size and density are decreased in ROP mutants while ABA enhances ROP11 expression in the stele and broadens its distribution in the endodermis. Taken together, non-cell-autonomous and cell-autonomous interactions between ABA and ROPs regulate xylem differentiation and SCW patterning.",

          "abstract": "Recently, extensive evidence has demonstrated that the brain operates close to a critical state, characterized by dynamic patterns known as neuronal avalanches. The critical state, reflecting the delicate balance between neural excitation and inhibition, offers numerous advantages in information processing. However, the role of genetics in shaping brain criticality is not fully understood. Whether there is any shared genetic factor influencing the critical state and cognitive functions remains elusive. Here, we aimed to address these questions by examining the heritability of brain criticality and its relation to cognitive function by analyzing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in 250 monozygotic twins, 142 dizygotic twins, and 437 Not-twin subjects. We found that genetic factors substantially influenced brain criticality across various scales, encompassing brain regions, functional networks, and the whole brain. These genetic influences exhibited heterogeneity, with the criticality of the primary sensory cortex being more strongly influenced by genetic factors compared to that of the association cortex. Furthermore, we combined rs-fMRI data with transcriptional microarray data from the Allen Brain Atlas: Human Brain (ABHB) dataset and found that the organization of regional critical dynamics was highly explained by a specific gene expression profile. Finally, our results showed that the critical state was correlated with total cognition and had a genetic link with it. These findings provide empirical evidence that brain criticality is a biological phenotype and suggest a shared genetic foundation underlying brain criticality and cognitive functions. Our results pave the way toward revealing specific biological mechanisms contributing to critical dynamics and their associations with brain function and dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "Negative feedback of the cochlear efferent system plays a critical role in control of hearing sensitivity and protection from noise trauma. Type II auditory nerves (ANs) innervate outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea and provide an input to the cochlear efferent system to achieve hearing sensitivity controlling and protection; in particular, medial olivocochlear efferent nerves innervate OHCs to control OHC electromotility, which is an active cochlear amplifier in mammals. However, little is known about channel information underlying type II AN activity and consequent function. Here, we report that ATP-gated P2x7 receptor had a predominant expression at type II spiral ganglion (SG) neurons and the synaptic areas under inner hair cells and OHCs with lateral and medial olivocochlear efferent nerves. Knockout (KO) of P2x7 increased hearing sensitivity with enhanced acoustic startle response, auditory brainstem response, and cochlear microphonics by increasing OHC electromotility. P2x7 KO also increased susceptibility to noise and exacerbated ribbon synapse degeneration. Middle-level noise exposure could impair active cochlear mechanics resulting in hearing loss in P2x7 KO mice. These data demonstrate that P2x7 receptors have a critical role in type II SG neuron’s function and the cochlear efferent system to control hearing sensitivity; deficiency of P2x7 receptors can impair type II SG neuron’s function and the cochlear efferent suppression leading to increase of active cochlear amplification and hearing oversensitivity, i.e., hyperacusis, and susceptibility to noise, which may also associate with other hearing disorders, such as tinnitus.",

In the visual system, this process is regulated by corticothalamic feedback during the experience-dependent phase of development. Yet the cortical circuits modulating this feedback remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate opposing roles for cortical somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in shaping retinogeniculate connectivity during the thalamic sensitive period (P20-30). Early in the refinement process, SST interneurons promote the strengthening and pruning of retinal inputs in the thalamus, as evidenced by disrupted synaptic refinement following their ablation. In contrast, PV interneurons, which mature later, act as a brake on this refinement, with their ablation leading to enhanced pruning of retinogeniculate connections. Notably, manipulating the relative balance between these inhibitory circuits can regulate sensory deprivation-induced retinogeniculate remodeling. Taken together, our findings show that cortical SST and PV interneuron circuits drive experience-dependent reciprocal antagonism that gates cortical feedback regulation of feedforward thalamic refinement.",

          "abstract": "The thymus is one of the most important organs of the immune system. It is responsible for both the production of T cells and the prevention of their autoimmunity. It comprises two types of tissue: The cortex, where nascent T cells (thymocytes) are generated; and the medulla, embedded within the cortex, where autoreactive thymocytes are eliminated through negative selection. In mice, the medulla exhibits a complex, convoluted morphology, which has raised the question of whether its form impacts its function. Intriguingly, experiments also reveal a reverse dependency: The interactions between medullary stroma and thymocytes shape the medullary structure. However, an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of medulla morphogenesis emerging from these interactions remains elusive. Here, we present a conceptual theoretical model showing that central, experimentally verified signaling pathways suffice to shape the convoluted medullary structure. The mathematical analysis of the model explains the observed effects of chemotaxis on thymocyte localization, and the reported morphological changes resulting from the modulation of thymocyte production. Our findings reveal that the cross-talk between medulla growth and negative selection of thymocytes not only regulates medullary volume but also orchestrates the morphology of the thymus medulla. This mechanism of structure formation robustly organizes the medulla in a way that accelerates thymocyte negative selection by improving their chemotactic migration into the medulla. Thereby, we identify a feedback between the function of the thymus medulla and its form. Our theoretical study motivates further experimental analysis of the spatial distribution of thymic cell populations and predicts morphological changes under genetic perturbations.",

          "abstract": "Climate change pushes species toward higher latitudes and altitudes, but the proximate drivers of range expansions vary, and it is unclear whether evolution facilitates climate change–induced range changes. In a temporally replicated field experiment, we translocated wall brown butterflies ( Lasiommata megera ) descending from range interior and range margin populations to sites at 1) the range interior, 2) the range margin, and 3) beyond the current northern range edge. Thereby, we tested for local adaptation in seasonal timing and winter survival and evaluated to what extent local adaptation influences the ongoing, climate-driven range expansion. Almost all individuals from all populations entered diapause at an appropriate time, despite previously identified among-population variation in diapause induction thresholds. Caterpillars of northern descent, however, grew faster than those from southern populations at all field sites. This may be a countergradient adaptation to compensate for the short, northern growing seasons, but we found no evidence for prewinter body mass affecting winter survival. In fact, winter survival was low overall—extremely so at the beyond range site—regardless of population origin, indicating that the primary constraint to range expansion is an inability to adapt to winter conditions. Hence, although range-expanding wall browns show clear local evolution of two traits related to seasonal timing, these putative local adaptations likely do not contribute to range expansion, which is instead limited by winter survival. To predict future range changes, it will be important to distinguish between the traits that evolve during range expansion and those that set the range limit.",

In the case of octoploid strawberry with four subgenomes designated ABCD, the identities of the diploid progenitors for subgenomes C and D have been subject to much debate. By integrating new sequencing data from North American diploids with reticulate phylogeny and admixture analyses, we uncovered introgression from an extinct or unsampled species in the clade of Fragaria viridis , Fragaria nipponica , and Fragaria nilgerrensis into the donor of subgenome A of octoploid Fragaria prior to its divergence from F. vesca subsp . bracteata . We also detected an introgression event from F. iinumae into an ancestor of F. nipponica and F. nilgerrensis. Using an LTR-age-distribution-based approach, we estimate that the octoploid and its intermediate hexaploid and tetraploid ancestors emerged approximately 0.8, 2, and 3 million years ago, respectively. These results provide an explanation for previous reports of F. viridis and F. nipponica as donors of the C and D subgenomes and suggest a greater role than previously thought for homoploid hybridization in the diploid progenitors of octoploid strawberry. The integrated set of approaches used here can help advance polyploid genome analysis in other species where hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting obscure evolutionary relationships.",

This framework has animated research on psychological phenomena ranging from habit formation to social learning, moral decision-making, and cognitive development. Here, we propose that model-based and model-free algorithms may not be as aligned with deliberate and automatic evaluative processing as prevailing theories suggest. Across three preregistered behavioral experiments involving adult human participants (total n = 2,572), we show that model-based algorithms shape not only deliberate but also automatic evaluations. Experiment 1 numerically replicates past findings suggesting that deliberate (but not automatic) evaluative responses are uniquely shaped by model-based algorithms but, critically, also reveals confounds that render interpretation of this evidence equivocal. Experiments 2 to 3 eliminate these confounds and reveal robust model-based contributions to automatic evaluative processing across two measures of automatic evaluation, supported by multinomial processing tree modeling. Together, these results suggest that dominant frameworks may considerably underestimate both the ubiquity of model-based algorithms and the computational sophistication of automatic evaluative processing.",

Public genome databases revealed high UBR4 expression in LUAD patients, associated with a dysregulated cell cycle and impaired mitochondrial homeostasis. UBR4 knockout (ΔUBR4) in A549 lung cancer cells induced cellular senescence with defective mitochondria. Restoration of UBR4 or antioxidant treatment reversed the ΔUBR4 phenotypes caused by impaired mitophagy. Mitochondrial stress exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction in ΔUBR4 cells, contributing to diverse cellular phenotypes. Additionally, ΔUBR4 cells exhibited substantially slow tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. In LUAD patients, UBR4 levels correlated with tumor stage, mitophagy markers, and poor survival. These findings suggest a tumor-promoting function of UBR4 in LUAD by regulating mitochondrial quality control. Further research into the pharmacological inhibition of UBR4 could open promising avenues for developing effective antitumor therapies targeting LUAD.",

Quantifying the aesthetic value of reef ecosystems and uncovering the conditions that enhance it could support NCP-based management. Here, we combine a global dataset of reef fish surveys, species-level aesthetic values, and causal modeling to assess the global status and drivers of reef fish assemblage aesthetic value. We find that aesthetic value is inherently linked to species richness, displaying a latitudinal gradient with peaks in the tropics, but varies strongly with the presence of exceptionally beautiful or less-beautiful species. Sea surface temperature, primary productivity, human gravity, and protection status are the strongest drivers of assemblage-level aesthetic value. Protection against human impacts consistently enhances aesthetic value by boosting taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, and this effect is greatest in species-rich, tropical ecoregions. Economic development has little influence, indicating that low-income countries are not constrained from maintaining beautiful fish assemblages. Our results therefore suggest that marine protected areas (MPAs) can support multiple NCPs simultaneously, particularly in developing tropical countries. While we highlight the effectiveness of MPAs, given the low level of marine protection globally and the sensitivity of aesthetic value to environmental conditions, the beauty of the world’s reefs appears severely threatened. Aesthetic value should be immediately integrated into reef conservation and management plans.",

However, those current models of machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) consider no relevant physical constraints or global scaling and thus may owe intrinsic out-of-domain difficulty which underlies the challenges of model generalizability and physical scalability. Here, by incorporating the global universal scaling law, we develop an ultrasmall parameterized MLIP with superlinear expressive capability, named SUS 2 -MLIP. Due to the global scaling derived from the universal equation of state (UEOS), SUS 2 -MLIP not only has significantly reduced parameters by decoupling the element space from coordinate space but also naturally outcomes the out-of-domain difficulty and endows the model with inherent generalizability and scalability even with relatively small training dataset. The non-linearity-embedding transformation in radial function endows the model with superlinear expressive capability. SUS 2 -MLIP outperforms the state-of-the-art MLIP models with its exceptional computational efficiency, especially for multiple-element materials and physical scalability in property prediction. This work not only presents a highly efficient universal MLIP model but also sheds light on incorporating physical constraints into AI–aided materials simulation.",

Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe 3 using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons, which soften via the Kohn anomaly, we find the electronic excitations exhibit purely relaxational dynamics well described by a diffusive model, with the diffusivity peaking just below the critical temperature, T C 1 . Additionally, we report for the first time a divergence in the real part of χ ( q , ω ) in the static limit ( ω → 0 ), a long-predicted hallmark of CDWs.

          "abstract": "Ivy League universities have dominated recent news headlines, having become popular targets for critics of higher education. But the threats they face—cuts to federal research funding, assaults on academic freedom, and bans on admitting international students—extend far beyond their campuses. Research universities across the country—large and small, public and private—are grappling with these same pressures. These institutions are behind the breakthroughs that shape daily lives. Undermining them doesn’t just jeopardize higher education, it threatens national and global strength. This means that economic, technological, and intellectual collapse is inevitable if US research institutions fall to federal and state disinvestment.",

          "abstract": "Plastic pollution threatens marine and freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide. Although plastic bag bans and taxes are increasingly implemented worldwide, their effectiveness in reducing plastic litter remains unknown. Leveraging the patchwork of bag policies across different geographic scales in the United States and citizen science data on 45,067 shoreline cleanups, we assess the impact of these policies on plastic bag litter. We find that plastic bag policies lead to a 25 to 47% decrease in plastic bags as a share of total items collected at cleanups relative to areas without policies, with taxes possibly further reducing shoreline litter. At a time when many jurisdictions are considering bag policies, while others are preemptively prohibiting them, our study provides evidence that they mitigate shoreline plastic pollution.",

Sourness, one of the primary tastes, is aversive in mammals, whereas many birds frequently consume acidic fruits, suggesting a potential tolerance. Our study uncovers a mechanism enabling avian sour tolerance that involves changes to the sour receptor [otopetrin 1 (OTOP1)]. We demonstrate that sour tolerance is a conserved trait in birds, with avian OTOP1 exhibiting acid-induced inhibition and OTOP1 modulation affecting sour perception and tolerance. Ancestral reconstruction reveals that the increase in acid tolerance may have evolved at the same point in the songbird phylogeny as the regain of sweet sensing in this clade. This shift might have enabled songbirds to feed on a wider range of fruits, affecting the evolution and diversification of the songbird radiation.",

From a circuit screen in mice, we identified a group of thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) neurons activated during sleep deprivation (SD) and required for sleep homeostasis. Optogenetic activation of RE neurons leads to an unusual phenotype: presleep behaviors (grooming and nest organizing) followed by prolonged, intense sleep that resembles RS. Inhibiting RE activity during SD impairs subsequent RS, which suggests that these neurons signal sleep need. RE neurons act upstream of sleep-promoting zona incerta cells, and SD triggers plasticity of this circuit to strengthen their connectivity. These findings reveal a circuit mechanism by which sleep need transforms the functional coupling of a sleep circuit to promote persistent, deep sleep.",

However, plant responses to heat are scale-dependent, complicating cross-scale prediction. We highlight recent progress revealing how and why plant responses to heat change across scales, including scales of biological organization and space versus time. We give examples of scaling up from molecular- and leaf-scale data and processes, which are modified by homeostatic and buffering mechanisms at whole plant and ecosystem scales. We show that scaling down—predicting plant responses to warming from broad-scale spatial patterns—can also be misleading, even in direction. Addressing such scale dependencies is essential to improving the prediction of plant responses to heat.",

By querying 1375 genomes of the species-rich Malawi cichlid fish radiation, we discovered five large inversions segregating in the benthic subradiation that each suppress recombination over more than half a chromosome. Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagic Diplotaxodon through admixture, whereas the others established early in the deep benthic clade. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage, and a notable excess of protein changing substitutions points toward selection on neurosensory, physiological, and reproductive genes. These results indicate that repeated interplay between depth adaptation and sex-specific selection on large inversions has been central to the evolution of this iconic system.",

We outline how temperature cues are integrated into preexisting signaling cascades using inherently temperature-sensitive proteins or processes.

In this work, we introduce an organic photoredox catalyst system that overcomes these obstacles to drive chemical transformations that require super-reducing capabilities. This advancement is accomplished by coupling the energy of two photons into a single chemical reduction, whereas inefficiencies from back electron transfer are mitigated through a distinct proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism embedded in the catalyst design.

The activity of cholinergic feedback axons in OB correlated with orofacial movements, with little responses to passively experienced odors. When mice engaged in an olfactory task, OB cholinergic axons rapidly shifted their response patterns from movement correlated to odor aligned. This response shift was absent in cholinergic axons projecting to the dorsal cortex during olfactory task engagement, and in OB, during an auditory task. Inactivation of OB-projecting cholinergic neurons impaired olfactory task performance and reduced odor responses in OB granule cells.

          "abstract": "Jaundice is a common presentation of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which arises from the accumulation of circulating bilirubin. It is not understood whether it represents an adaptive or maladaptive response to Plasmodium spp. infection. We found that asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in humans was associated with a higher ratio of unconjugated over conjugated bilirubin and parasite burden compared with symptomatic malaria. Genetic suppression of bilirubin synthesis by biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) increased parasite virulence and malaria mortality in mice. Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in plasma, through genetic inhibition of hepatic conjugation by UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), was protective against malaria in mice. Unconjugated bilirubin inhibited P. falciparum proliferation in red blood cells by a mechanism that suppressed mitochondrial pyrimidine synthesis. Moreover, unconjugated bilirubin inhibited hemozoin crystallization and compromised the parasite’s food vacuole. Hence, jaundice appears to represent a metabolic response to Plasmodium spp. infection that limits malaria severity.",

We found viral peptides originating from detected noncanonical ORFs presented on class-I human leukocyte antigen in infected cells and hundreds of upstream ORFs that likely modulate translation initiation of viral proteins.

This Earth energy imbalance has strengthened over the period 2001 to 2023 with satellite data. Here, we show that low climate sensitivity models fail to reproduce the trend in Earth energy imbalance, particularly in the individual longwave and shortwave contributions to the imbalance trend. The inability to produce a strong positive shortwave and strong negative longwave Earth energy imbalance trend is found to be a robust feature in the low climate sensitivity models, especially for models with a climate sensitivity below 2.5 kelvin. The negative longwave contribution to Earth energy imbalance is driven by surface temperature increases and is therefore most pronounced in high climate sensitivity models, whereas the shortwave contribution is generally positive and amplified by greater surface warming.",

In this study, we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and characterization of the centrosymmetric material Li 2 Co 3 (SeO 3 ) 4 , which violates this relationship not by defying symmetry-imposed selection rules but by invoking a photophysical process not previously characterized for crystalline solids. This process originates from an interference between linear dichroism and linear birefringence, referred to as LD-LB, and involves strong chiroptical signals that invert upon sample flipping. In addition to enabling a chiroptical response under centrosymmetry, this process opens up photonic engineering opportunities based on crystalline solids.",

Using satellite observations of ocean chlorophyll a (Chl) concentration, we show that the surface ocean experienced a poleward greening from 2003 to 2022. Contemporaneously, the subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere experienced a decrease in Chl. As such, the latitudinal disparity in Chl, as documented by an inequality index, has been increasing over the past two decades, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Rising water temperatures may primarily influence the Chl trends. The increasing Chl inequality—marked by “greener green and bluer blue” waters—has the potential to cascade to higher trophic levels, with implications for the fisheries and economies of coastal nations.",

Here, we report that RNA transcripts govern G4 landscapes through coordinated G-loop assembly and disassembly. G-loop assembly involves activation of the ATM and ATR kinases, followed by homology-directed invasion of RNA opposite the G4 strand mediated by BRCA2 and RAD51. Disassembly of the G-loop resolves the G4 structure through DHX36-FANCJ–mediated G4 unwinding, which triggers nucleolytic incision and subsequent hybrid strand renewal by DNA synthesis. Inhibition of G-loop disassembly causes global G4 and R-loop accumulation, leading to transcriptome dysregulation, replication stress, and genome instability. These findings establish an intricate G-loop assembly-disassembly mechanism that controls G4 landscapes and is essential for cellular homeostasis and survival.",

In contrast to the situation with persistent and often inorganic contaminants in the 1970s, current monitoring schemes lack control of a much larger number of organic chemicals and their degradates.

This universal process is mediated by peptide release factors (RFs) that recognize stop codons and catalyze the hydrolysis of peptidyl transfer RNA (peptidyl-tRNA) on the ribosome, presumably by activating a water molecule. We report structures of the bacterial ribosome in complex with peptidyl-tRNA and RFs in the prepeptide release state. No hydrolytic water molecule was seen in the peptidyl transferase center. Instead, RFs induced rearrangements of the peptidyl-tRNA adenine 76 (A76) ribose pucker that orient the 2′-OH for the nucleophilic attack onto the neighboring carbonyl group. These findings suggest a catalytic mechanism of RF-mediated peptide release and provide a structural basis for the universal conservation of the catalytic domain in peptide RFs.",

          "abstract": "Continued greenhouse gas emissions will accelerate global warming and intensity of heat waves, which already harm crop productivity. From the stability of key enzymes to canopy processes, photosynthesis is affected by temperature. All crops suffer declines in photosynthetic rate when temperatures cross critical thresholds, with irreversible losses typically occurring above 40° to 45°C. Protective measures within plants can be induced by growth at elevated temperatures but not from the sudden temperature elevation of heat waves. Strategies to improve the heat resilience of photosynthesis include modifying surface energy balance, optimizing canopy architecture, improving enzymatic heat tolerance, and (re)engineering key metabolic pathways for greater efficiency or to remove bottlenecks. This Review summarizes present knowledge on the major mechanisms that underlie high-temperature inhibition of photosynthesis and explores opportunities for breeding and biotechnological interventions to overcome them.",

We present a model of the corona that evolves continuously in time, by assimilating photospheric magnetic field observations as they become available. This approach reproduces dynamical features that do not appear in time-stationary models. We used the model to predict coronal structure during the total solar eclipse of 8 April 2024 near the maximum of the solar activity cycle.

Here we show that DRT9 forms a hexameric complex with its upstream noncoding RNA (ncRNA) to mediate antiphage defense by inducing cell growth arrest through abortive infection. Upon phage infection, the phage-encoded ribonucleotide reductase NrdAB complex increases intracellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate levels, activating DRT9 to synthesize long, polyadenylate [poly(A)]–rich single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), which likely sequesters the essential phage single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein and disrupts phage propagation. We further determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the DRT9-ncRNA hexamer complex, providing mechanistic insights into its cDNA synthesis. These findings highlight the diversity of RT-based antiviral defense mechanisms, expand our understanding of RT biological functions, and provide a structural basis for developing DRT9-based biotechnological tools.",

          "abstract": "While occupying an influential position within one’s social network brings many advantages, it is unknown how certain individuals rise in social prominence. Leveraging a longitudinal dataset that tracks an entirely new network of college freshmen ( N  = 187), we test whether “climbing the social ladder” depends on knowing how other people are connected to each other. Those who ultimately come to occupy the most influential positions exhibit early and accurate representations of their network’s general, abstract structure (i.e., who belongs to which communities and cliques). In contrast, detailed, granular representations of specific friendships do not translate into gains in social influence over time. Only once the network stabilizes do the most influential individuals exhibit the most accurate representations of specific friendships. These findings reveal that those who climb the social ladder first detect their emerging network’s general structure and then fine-tune their knowledge about individual relationships between their peers as network dynamics settle.",

          "abstract": "Competition among news sources over public opinion can incentivize them to resort to misinformation. Sharing misinformation may lead to a short-term gain in audience engagement but ultimately damages the credibility of the source, resulting in a loss of audience. To understand the rationale behind news sources sharing misinformation, we model the competition between sources as a zero-sum sequential game, where news sources decide whether to share factual information or misinformation. Each source influences individuals based on their credibility, the veracity of the article, and the individual’s characteristics. We analyze this game through the concept of quantal response equilibrium, which accounts for the bounded rationality of human decision-making. The analysis shows that the resulting equilibria reproduce the credibility-opinion distribution of real-world news sources, with hyperpartisan sources spreading the majority of misinformation. Our findings provide insights for policymakers to mitigate the spread of misinformation and promote a more factual information landscape.",

However, extensive data transfers and intensive high-precision computing are necessary for network training, which challenges conventional digital computing platforms. Here, we demonstrated the potential of a heterogeneous computing-in-memristor (CIM) system to accelerate the FNO for scientific modeling tasks. Our system contains eight four-kilobit memristor chips with embedded floating-point computing workflows and a heterogeneous training scheme, representing a heterogeneous CIM platform that leverages precision-limited analog devices to accelerate floating-point neural network training. We demonstrate the capabilities of this system by solving the one-dimensional Burgers’ equation and modeling the three-dimensional thermal conduction phenomenon. An expected nearly 116 times to 21 times increase in computational energy efficiency was achieved, with solution precision comparable to those of digital processors. Our results extend in-memristor computing applicability beyond edge neural networks and facilitate construction of future AI-for-Science computing platforms.",

          "abstract": "Our sense of hearing processes sound intensities spanning six orders of magnitude. In the ear, the receptor potential of presynaptic inner hair cells (IHCs) covers the entire intensity range, while postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) tile the range with their firing rate codes. IHCs vary the voltage dependence of Ca 2+ channel activation among their active zones (AZs), potentially diversifying SGN firing. Here, we tested this hypothesis in mice modeling the human Ca V 1.3 A749G mutation that causes low-voltage Ca 2+ channel activation. We demonstrate activation of Ca 2+ influx and glutamate release of IHC AZs at lower voltages, increased spontaneous firing in SGNs, and lower sound threshold of Ca V 1.3 A749G/A749G mice. Loss of synaptic ribbons in IHCs at ambient sound levels of mouse husbandry indicates that low-voltage Ca 2+ channel activation poses a risk for noise-induced synaptic damage.

          "abstract": "Phytophagous mites, including Tetranychus cinnabarinus , are arthropods known for their wide infestation of host plants and pesticide resistance. We found that fenpropathrin-resistant female mites (YN-FeR, with target resistance: F1538I kdr mutation) exhibited significantly enhanced adaptability to various stress conditions, including exposure to different acaricides and high-temperature (34°C) and low-humidity environments (40% relative humidity). This evolution was attributed to cuticle thickening in resistant female mites. Cuticle protein CPR25 was identified as a critical gene mediating cuticle thickening. CPR25 regulated its own overexpression by producing a circular RNA, named circCPR25 , which acted as a decoy to selectively sequester and bind to the miR-34~317 cluster. This study revealed a distinctive mechanism underlying the evolution of stress resistance in spider mites. Specifically, a cuticle protein in spider mites regulates its own overexpression by producing a decoy circRNA, thereby promoting cuticle thickening and facilitating rapid adaptation to adverse conditions.",

While remarkable progress has been made in catalysts, solution design, and system engineering, recent breakthroughs reveal that nitrogen-containing molecules—specifically sp 2 -hybridized structures (e.g., pyridine) and sp 3 -hybridized moieties (e.g., ethanolamine) —hold untapped potential to revolutionize both CO 2 capture and conversion. These structures have been demonstrated as the Holy Grail in facilitating CO 2 activation, stabilizing key intermediates, and streamlining reaction pathways—capabilities rarely achievable with conventional strategies. However, limited mechanistic understanding of their physicochemical properties and interactions with CO 2 hampers broader application. This review highlights recent advances in leveraging sp 2 /sp 3 -hybridized nitrogen structures, unpacks their molecular roles in electrochemical CO 2 management, and offers a unifying framework for their dual-functionality across capture and conversion. By illuminating these nitrogen-based motifs, we uncover practical design principles and open avenues for integrating expanded N-containing compounds into energy technologies—paving the way for next-generation carbon management strategies.",

Dust exported by the northeasterly trade (Harmattan) winds creates marine sedimentary records that have been long interpreted to show that northern African climate became drier and more variable across the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary [2.58 million years ago (Ma)], when global climate cooled and high-latitude glacial-interglacial cycles intensified. However, questions about the impact of summer rainfall on winter dust fluxes and thus the history of the African summer monsoons remain. We present a leaf wax hydrogen isotope record from offshore northwestern Africa that demonstrates that rainfall regimes remained stable and varied solely in response to 21,000-year cycles in summer insolation from 3.5 to 2.5 Ma. We infer that the summer rains and winter winds respond to different climate forcings, with summer rainfall driven by solar radiation over the northern African landmass and the winter trades affected by high-latitude climate and meridional temperature gradients.",

The ability to arbitrarily and nonthermally increase the magnon frequencies with laser pulses could enable this progress. However, this effect has not been reported to date. To achieve it, here, we explore the optical resonant excitation of high-momentum magnons, which experimentally are observed to couple to low-momentum magnons, modifying the frequencies and amplitudes thereof. This evidence, not caused by laser heating, is explained with a resonant light-scattering mechanism coupling high- and low-momentum eigenmodes across momentum space.

These SPEs exhibit room temperature operation with polarized emission, achieving a g (2) (0) value of 0.015, which is among the lowest reported for room temperature SPEs and the lowest achieved for h-BN SPEs. It also exhibits high brightness (~0.5 million counts per second), remarkable stability during continuous operation (&gt;15 min), and a Debye-Waller factor of 45%. First-principles calculations reveal unique carbon defects responsible for these properties, enabled by PLD’s low-temperature synthesis and in situ doping.

Our experimental results reveal the pressure-temperature conditions for amorphization, decomposition, and melting of labradorite and anorthite. The boundary between amorphous plagioclase and crystalline high-pressure phases in our phase diagram indicate diaplectic glass can form at 1300 to 1500 kelvin, and the melting line suggests that maskelynite can be generated above 3000 kelvin at high pressures.

An optimized chemical synthesis enabled preparation of diverse IAPP glycoforms with complex glycan structures, allowing systematic evaluation of their effects on aggregation, cytotoxicity, and solubility. Sialylated glycans at Thr 30 completely inhibited IAPP aggregation, eliminated cytotoxicity toward pancreatic β cells, and enhanced solubility by up to 280-fold. Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations revealed that glycosylation impedes adoption of a four-stranded β-sheet conformation in IAPP dimers. These findings advance the understanding of the role of natural glycosylation in aggregation and highlight its potential as an evolutionarily inspired strategy to enhance the therapeutic utility of IAPP.",

Here, we present an on-chip, all-silicon implementation of deformed VPCs that enable robust transmission along arbitrary shapes and bends. Although the lattice is amorphous and lacks long-range periodicity, the topological protection is sustained by short-range order. Furthermore, we show an amorphous lattice functioning as a frequency-dependent router, splitting input signals into two perpendicular output ports. We also demonstrate on-chip terahertz communication, achieving data rates of up to 72 Gbps.

CfEC92 interacted with MdNDPK2, a negative immune regulator in apple. The CfEC92-ATP complex altered the conformation of MdNDPK2, enhancing its affinity for ATP, and further increasing its autophosphorylation and kinase activity. The activated MdNDPK2 phosphorylated MdMPK3 to suppress host immunity.

The Drosophila testis-nascent-myotube system allows dissection of contact-dependent migration in vivo at high resolution. Here, we describe a role for the axon guidance factor Plexin A in collective cell migration: maintaining cell-cell interfaces at a precise point on the mesenchymal-to-epithelial continuum. This is crucial for testis myotubes to migrate as a continuous sheet, allowing normal sculpting-morphogenesis. Cells must maintain filopodial N-cadherin–based junctions and remain ECM-tethered near cell-cell contacts to spread while collectively moving. Our data further suggest Semaphorin 1b is a Plexin A antagonist, fine-tuning activation. This reveals a contact-dependent mechanism to maintain sheet integrity during migration, driving organ morphogenesis. This is relevant for mesenchymal organ sculpting in other migratory contexts such as angiogenesis.",

We identify spermidine as a key polyamine for Babesia duncani and Plasmodium falciparum for intraerythrocytic development. We demonstrate that spermidine is indispensable for regulating protein translation through hypusination of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF5A, and its depletion leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species. Disruption of spermidine biosynthesis or its conversion from spermine results in parasite death. We also show that B. duncani and other Babesia species use an ancestral spermidine synthase–like enzyme, highlighting a distinct evolutionary adaptation from P. falciparum . Our results reveal the spermidine’s dual role in oxidative stress defense and translation regulation, positioning spermidine biosynthesis as a critical vulnerability and a promising therapeutic target.",

Here, we aimed to elucidate the temporal and spatial pathological changes induced by two distinct α-syn pathogenic structures, having large or small sizes. To unravel the underlying molecular pathways, we conducted a proteomic analysis of the putamen and the entorhinal cortex, two brain regions carrying notable α-syn pathology. We demonstrate that distinct assemblies of α-syn aggregates drive unique pathogenic changes that ultimately result in a comparable extent of nigrostriatal degeneration at the level of nigral dopaminergic neuron cell bodies and striatal dopaminergic terminals.

Inspired by human cortical neurons that perform XOR through dendritic calcium spikes, the d-OECN leverages ion-tunable antiambipolarity in mixed ionic-electronic conducting polymers to mimic voltage-gated dendritic calcium dynamics. By integrating this dendritic component with a tunable spiking circuit representing the soma, the d-OECN achieves XOR classification through its inherent nonlinear activation profile, with decision boundaries that are both ionically and electrically tunable. Moreover, we demonstrate the d-OECN’s ability to perform edge detection using XOR in a tactile sensing system, showcasing its potential for event-based sensing and processing.

The MSRM’s rotatable tip design enhances accessibility and navigation speed through a rotation-assisted active steering strategy. Improved blood clot treatment efficiency is achieved through the MSRM’s multifunctionality: It can accelerate drug-blood clot interactions, mechanically break down blood clots, and retrieve clot debris. The low invasiveness is attributed to the soft material design and conservative actuation strategy. The performance of the MSRM is validated in both in vitro phantom studies and in vivo rabbit models, and the invasiveness is evaluated using a human placenta model.",

To overcome these challenges, we use interfacial molecular forces, such as charge and hydrogen bonds, between nucleic acid variants and a positively charged synthetic microporous membrane to purify ss-mRNA, a desirable therapeutic, from an undesirable impurity, immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Membranes achieved high binding capacities (1.28 mg/m 2 ) and up to 100% ss-mRNA recovery at ~pH 9.0, with optimized surface density (4000 to 10,000 nmol/m 2 ).

We show that at the peak of acute inflammatory pain, superficial medullary dorsal horn projection neurons (PNs) that relay nociceptive information to the parabrachial nucleus reduce their intrinsic excitability and, consequently, action potential firing. When pain resolves, the excitability of these neurons returns to baseline. Using electrophysiological and computational approaches, we found that an increase in potassium A-current ( I A ) underlies the decrease in the excitability of medullary dorsal horn PNs in acute pain conditions. In chronic pain conditions, no changes of I A were observed, and medullary dorsal horn PNs exhibit increased intrinsic excitability and firing. Our results reveal a differential modulation of the excitability of medullary dorsal horn projection neurons in acute and chronic pain conditions, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that, in acute pain conditions, tunes the output of the dorsal horn and, if lacking, could facilitate pain chronification.",

Here, we apply ultrafast infrared nanospectroscopic imaging to probe local electron-hole dynamics in both isolated and bundled carbon nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition. This approach unravels heterogeneity in electron-hole pair creation and annihilation, arising from disordered stress within a tube and/or interactions with neighboring tubes.

We found that, compared to control fish, predation-selected fish produced larger offspring and larger broods early in life. However, other life history parameters, such as interbrood interval and total number of offspring, showed no response. We also found that predation selected for smaller and lighter females and for shorter tails and gonopodia in males, with no effect on body coloration. Our results show that while several traits evolve fast under selection on adult predation, several “classic” predation-dependent traits seem unaffected by predation selection.

GI tumors from mice bearing heterozygous mutations in Stk11 (which encodes LKB1) display signatures of pathogenic IL-17–producing CD4 + T helper 17 (T H 17) cells. LKB1 constrains T cell inflammatory potential, as Stk11 /LKB1 haploinsufficiency promotes T cell differentiation toward pathogenic IL-17–producing T cell lineages (CD4 + T H 17 and CD8 + T c 17) in vitro and following intestinal infection. Mechanistically, aberrant CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2)–dependent signaling drives pathogenic T H 17 cell programs downstream of LKB1 haploinsufficiency. Targeting this circuit via CRTC2 deletion or IL-17 blockade antagonizes GI polyp growth in mouse models of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

We demonstrate that the RNA demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) drives glutamine reprogramming to support ccRCC growth and survival. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of FTO in ccRCC cells impaired glutamine-derived reductive carboxylation, depleted pyrimidines, and increased reactive oxygen species. This led to increased DNA damage and reduced survival, which could be rescued by pyrimidine nucleobases or the antioxidant N -acetylcysteine. Mechanistically, FTO demethylates the glutamine transporter solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5) messenger RNA to promote its expression. Restoration of SLC1A5 expression in FTO-knockdown cells rescued metabolic and survival defects. FTO inhibition reduced ccRCC tumor xenograft and PDX growth under the renal capsule.

Further, we demonstrate that multiple dynein motors tethered to rigid cargoes, such as HIV-1 capsids, display reduced motility, distinct from the behavior of multiple motors on membranous cargoes.

Furthermore, PXN serves as a platform for recruiting other proteins that together control the dynamic changes needed for cell migration and survival. Here, we show that the PXN N-domain undergoes significant compaction upon FAT binding, forming a 48-kilodalton multimodal complex with four major interconverting states. Although the complex is flexible, each state has unique sets of contacts involving disordered regions that are both highly represented in ensembles and conserved.

          "abstract": "Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is required for repairing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) generated by the RAG endonuclease during lymphocyte antigen receptor gene assembly by V(D)J recombination. The ataxia telangiectasia–mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) kinases regulate functionally redundant pathways required for NHEJ. Here, we report that loss of the senataxin helicase leads to a strong defect in RAG DSB repair upon inactivation of DNA-PKcs. The NHEJ function of senataxin is redundant with the RECQL5 helicase and the HLTF translocase and is epistatic with ATM. Co-inactivation of ATM, RECQL5, and HLTF results in an NHEJ defect similar to that from the combined deficiency of DNA-PKcs and senataxin or losing senataxin, RECQL5, and HLTF. These data suggest that ATM and DNA-PKcs regulate the functions of senataxin and RECQL5/HLTF, respectively, to provide redundant support for NHEJ.",

          "abstract": "Bovine pericardium is the tissue of choice for replacing heart valves of human patients in minimally invasive surgery. The tissue has an extraordinarily high toughness of ~100 kilojoules per square meter. Here, we investigate the origin of the toughness through mechanical tests and microscopic observations. In the tissue, crimped, long, strong collagen fibers are embedded in a soft matrix. As a crack grows in the matrix, the fibers decrimp, reorient, slip, and bridge the crack. These microscopic processes enable the fibers to transmit high tension over a long distance. Using two types of experiments, we measure the bridging traction as a function of crack separation, σ(δ). The peak traction is σ 0  ~ 60 megapascals. The maximum separation is δ 0  ~ 6 millimeters, two to four orders of magnitude higher than that of hard tissues. Both the high traction and large separation of the bovine pericardium contribute to its high toughness.",

However, random data access usually requires additional noncoding primer DNA as indexes, which substantially reduce the physical data density. Here, we propose an alternative strategy to overcome this barrier by loading different data-encoding DNA files into porous microspheres, each distinguished by unique photonic bandgaps and diameters, allowing for 10 5 types of indexing. With the two features as the addressing indexes, the physical separation of subsets from a diverse pool of DNA files is achieved, thereby facilitating the selective retrieval of stored data. The interconnected nanopore arrays and uniformly distributed positive charges within the microspheres enhance DNA enrichment, achieving a storage density of up to 22.6 exabytes per gram, far exceeding that of previous random access storage methods. This work outlines a simple and scalable method for creating nonfading photonic indexes, enabling long-term random access while maintaining high storage capacity.",

          "abstract": "The circadian system provides a temporal framework for animals to anticipate environmental events, including threats. However, the effects of stressors on the circadian system remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that, in mice, stressors shift the phase of the central pacemaker, housed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), through glutamatergic inputs from the anterior paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT). Unlike light, which can phase delay or advance the central pacemaker, stressors consistently induce delays, effects attenuated by inhibiting aPVT neurons. Stressors robustly activate AVP-expressing neurons within the SCN and are associated with inhibition of VIP-expressing neurons, whereas light strongly activates VIP-expressing neurons with minimal effects on AVP-expressing neurons. Pairing stressors with light reveals distinct time-dependent interactions, enhancing phase delays at early night but abolishing phase advances at late night. Our findings uncover distinct SCN microcircuits that differentially encode light and stressors, providing insights into how environmental cues modulate circadian timing.",

Using supercomputing and artificial intelligence algorithms, we analyzed a high-resolution global dataset of fusuline foraminifera—the most diverse marine fossil group from the Carboniferous to the Permian (~340 to 252 million years ago)—at an unprecedented temporal resolution of &lt;45 thousand years. Our unbinned diversity reconstruction reveals unexpectedly simple diversity dynamics in this exceptionally well-preserved clade. We identify two (and likely a third) truncated exponential diversifications and four major diversity declines. During this interval, long-term cooling consistently promoted biodiversification, whereas warming events were closely linked to extinctions.

Using x-ray correlation spectroscopy, we find that near the phase boundary between the two nematic phases, fluctuations coexist on multiple disparate timescales.

Water wave isolation occurs by effectively creating a negative water depth, which fills a major gap in the field of manipulating water waves using metamaterial concept. We demonstrate the water wave isolation of PGAs through analytical methods, simulations, and experiments, proving that effective negative water depth is key to achieving the isolation of water waves.

Herein, peptides fibrillization is reported to present inherent bio-piezoelectricity. Upon forming double-network framework with silk fibroin, fibrous peptide piezogels of innate biocompatibility and biodegradability are achieved, showing a programmable piezoelectricity. In particular, the bioinspired supramolecular piezogel can linearly respond to external compression and stretching in large force regions, extensively expanding the application potential bio-piezoelectricity. Upon designing a “W”-shaped structural conformation, a peptide fibrous piezogel–based piezoelectric sensor is shown to be used for detection of limb movements and subcutaneous implantation of the bioinspired piezoelectric electronics, realizing in situ and real-time monitoring of stimuli responses.

By using ion gel gating in Au-molecule-graphene junction, the channel conductance could be modulated notably according to a clear transition from direct tunneling to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling regime. The mixed SAM molecular transistors also showed a superior gating efficiency due to the suppressed field screening effect by the net molecular dipole.

Experimentally, ZC3H4 deficiency led to increased DNA damage, abnormal mitosis, and cellular senescence. Biochemical analysis and super-resolution microscopy revealed that the loss of ZC3H4 increased replication stress (RS)—a major driver of genome instability—by inducing a hypertranscription state that promoted R loop formation and transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), both of which drive RS. Further bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that ZC3H4 preferentially binds to genomic regions prone to TRCs and R loops, where it suppresses ncRNA bursts, functioning as part of the Restrictor complex. Our findings identify ZC3H4 as a crucial factor in maintaining genome integrity, strategically positioned at the critical intersection of DNA and RNA synthesis.",

When combined, collagen networks rigidify via synergistic mechanical interactions and stiffen only with higher mechanical loads. However, how cells respond to the nonlinear elasticity of collagen in hybrid networks remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that when collagen rigidifies by the interpenetration of a second polymer, the amount of force that initially stiffens the network (onset of stiffening, σ c ) increases and is sufficient to stimulate an increase in intracellular tension. We investigated this effect by precisely controlling the nonlinear elasticity of collagen with the synthetic semiflexible polymer, polyisocyanopeptides. We find that small increases in σ c induce a biphasic response in cell-matrix interactions, influencing how cells migrate, proliferate, and generate contractile force. Our results suggest that cells adaptively respond to changes in the nonlinear mechanics of collagen, which may be a mechanistic behavior used during tissue homeostasis or when collagen rigidifies during pathological conditions.",

We demonstrated that FAM50A forms a complex with chromosome 9 open reading frame 78 (C9ORF78), specifically at the S121 residue, to enhance ASNS transcription. This interaction accelerates the rate of ASNS-mediated asparagine synthesis, which is essential in facilitating metastatic cascades to the brain.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a bioadhesive interface to realize the adhering fixation of e-PTFE implants. We integrate a hydrophilic and bioadhesive hydrogel layer on the hydrophobic and bioinert e-PTFE by designing a facile approach of freezing-induced micromechanical interlocking. The integration is robust enough as pulling hydrogel out of the interlocked pores on e-PTFE requires large energy dissipation. This bioadhesive interface enables instant (operating time &lt; 10 seconds) and secure (adhesion energy &gt;200 joules per square meter) adhering fixation of e-PTFE implants to wet tissue.

Here, we show that an emergent biophysical mechanism—spontaneous fluid flows arising from metabolically generated density gradients—can alleviate constraints on nutrient transport, enabling exponential growth in nascent multicellular clusters of yeast lacking any multicellular adaptations for nutrient transport or fluid flow. Beyond a threshold size, the metabolic activity of experimentally evolved snowflake yeast clusters drives large-scale fluid flows that transport nutrients throughout the cluster at speeds comparable to those generated by ciliary actuation in extant multicellular organisms. These flows support exponential growth at macroscopic sizes that theory predicts should be diffusion limited. This demonstrates how simple physical mechanisms can act as a “biophysical scaffold” to support the evolution of multicellularity by opening up phenotypic possibilities before genetically encoded innovations.",

          "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system that represent a major source of morbidity in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A substantial proportion of patients do not respond to current therapies or experience intolerable side effects. Transcriptomic characterization of murine and human PNF at bulk and single-cell resolution identified transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling as a key upstream regulator, driving aberrant basement membrane (BM) protein production by neoplastic Schwann cells and Fbs. Conditional TGFβ1 overexpression in Nf1 -deficient Schwann cells driven by Hoxb7- Cre promoted PNF growth and malignant transformation in vivo. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of the type I TGFβ receptor (TGFβRI) reduced PNF tumor burden in Nf1 mutant mice. Proteomic characterization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) showed reduced BM proteins upon TGFβRI inhibition. These findings implicate TGFβ as a potential therapeutic target in PNF and provide insights into the role of TGFβ signaling in orchestrating ECM dynamics in the PNF microenvironment.",

          "abstract": "The Argonaute CSR-1 is essential for germline development in C. elegans . Loss of CSR-1 leads to the down-regulation of thousands of germline-expressed genes, supporting a model in which CSR-1 “licenses” gene expression via a poorly understood mechanism. In contrast, a small subset of genes is up-regulated in csr-1 mutants, including morc-1 , which encodes a conserved GHKL-type ATPase. We show that morc-1 is overexpressed in csr-1 mutants and accumulates over CSR-1 licensed targets, coinciding with aberrant gain of H3K9me3, reduced H3K36me3, and transcriptional repression. Notably, loss of morc-1 fully rescues these chromatin defects and partially restores gene expression and fertility in csr-1 mutants. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of MORC-1 in the wild-type germ line is sufficient to repress CSR-1 licensed targets and severely compromise fertility. These findings support a model in which CSR-1 prevents MORC-1 overexpression and consequent misregulation of CSR-1 licensed genes.",
