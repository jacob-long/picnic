          "abstract": "Time-dependent drives hold promise for realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems1,2,3. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems4,5, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives6,7. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Here, using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by n-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is ‘doubly tunable’: one way by driving frequency, the other way by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent 2n + 1. Using quantum-state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a two-dimensional configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.",

          "abstract": "Galaxy clusters, the Universe’s largest halo structures, are filled with an X-ray-emitting gas with a temperature between 10 million and 100 million degrees. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures1,2,3. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematics remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of energy conversion within clusters4. High-resolution spectral mapping with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observatory5 offers a way forward6,7. Here we present XRISM kinematic measurements of the Perseus cluster, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner approximately 60 kpc, probably associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, SMBH feedback drives gas motions, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could have a substantial role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources to robustly characterize the velocity fields and their role in the evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for SMBH feedback models.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of high-transition-temperature ( T c ) superconductivity in strongly correlated materials remains the main unsolved problem in physics. High- T c materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model—a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice—is believed to capture the essential physics of high- T c materials 1–5 , obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging 6 . The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moiré WSe 2 (refs. 7,8 ), in which low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable 9–11 , presents a new platform for studying the high- T c problem. Here we tune moiré WSe 2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moiré unit cell ( ν = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high- T c phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at ν = 1, superconducting domes on electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states such as strange metals 12–14 . Twist-angle dependence studies further show that the highest T c always occurs adjacent to the Mott transition 3,15 . Our results indicate strong correlation as the key to superconductivity in moiré WSe 2 and establish a new material system for studying high- T c superconductivity in a controllable manner.",

          "abstract": "Gene expression is dynamically regulated by gene regulatory networks comprising multiple regulatory components to mediate cellular functions1. An ideal tool for analyzing these processes would track multiple-component dynamics with both spatiotemporal resolution and scalability within the same cells, a capability not yet achieved. Here, we present CytoTape, a genetically encoded, modular protein tape recorder for multiplexed and spatiotemporally scalable recording of gene regulation dynamics continuously for up to three weeks, physiologically compatible, with single-cell, minutes-scale resolution. CytoTape employs a flexible, thread-like, elongating intracellular protein self-assembly engineered via computationally assisted rational design, built on earlier XRI technology2. We demonstrated its utility across multiple mammalian cell types, achieving simultaneous recording of five transcription factor activities and gene transcriptional activities. CytoTape reveals that divergent transcriptional trajectories correlate with transcriptional history and signal integration, and that distinct immediate early genes (IEGs) exhibit complex temporal correlations within single cells. We further extended CytoTape into CytoTape-vivo for scalable, spatiotemporally resolved single-cell recording in the living brain, enabling simultaneous weeks-long recording of doxycycline- and IEG promoter-dependent gene expression histories across up to 14,123 neurons spanning multiple brain regions per mouse. Together, the CytoTape toolkit establishes a versatile platform for scalable and multiplexed analysis of cell physiological processes in vitro and in vivo.",

          "abstract": "Our experiences contain countless details that may be important in the future, yet we rarely know which will matter and which will not. This uncertainty poses a difficult challenge for adaptive decision-making, as failing to preserve relevant information can prevent us from making good choices later on. One solution to this challenge is to store detailed memories of individual experiences that can be flexibly accessed whenever their details become relevant. By allowing us to store and recall specific events in vivid detail, the human episodic memory system provides exactly this capacity. Yet, whether and how this ability supports adaptive behaviour is poorly understood. Here we aimed to determine whether people use detailed episodic memories to make decisions when future task demands are uncertain. We hypothesized that the episodic memory system’s ability to store events in great detail allows us to reference any of these details if they later become relevant. We tested this hypothesis using a novel decision-making task in which participants encoded individual events with multiple features and later made decisions based on these features to maximize their earnings. Across 5 experiments (total n = 535), we found that participants referenced episodic memories during decisions in feature-rich environments and that they did so specifically when it was unclear at encoding which features would be needed in the future. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental adaptive function of episodic memory, showing how its rich representational capacity enables flexible decision-making under uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Although the distinction between episodic and semantic memory is supported by numerous neuropsychological studies, neuroimaging data have shown considerable overlap between regions that are activated during semantic and episodic remembering. This might indicate similar or shared mechanisms but might also result from inadequate task designs or poor functional magnetic resonance imaging signal coverage. Here we compared neural activations and representations associated with successful retrieval of episodic and semantic memories, using tasks that are more closely matched. A total of n = 40 participants recalled pairings between logos and brand names, where the pairings corresponded to real-world knowledge (semantic task) or were learned in an initial study phase (episodic task). Neither a priori-defined networks nor clusters generally activated by our task provided evidence for any difference between successful semantic and episodic retrieval, with the Bayes factor for the a priori networks supporting the null hypothesis of no difference.

Here, to characterize mammalian information-processing architecture, we combine functional neuroimaging and anaesthesia in humans, macaques, marmosets and mice. We show that breakdown of information integration is a convergent effect of diverse anaesthetics across mammalian species. As the system disintegrates, brain dynamics become more difficult to control. Both effects are reversed upon re-awakening induced by thalamic deep-brain stimulation in the macaque. Regional breakdown of integrated information coincides with the species-specific spatial topography of PVALB/Pvalb gene expression. To provide mechanistic insight beyond correlation, we develop computational models for humans, macaques and mice that integrate species-specific connectivity and transcriptomic gradients, demonstrating their respective roles for controlling brain dynamics and information integration. We reveal evolutionarily conserved controllers of information integration in the mammalian brain.",

          "authors": "Armin Granulo, Andreas Raff, Christoph Fuchs",
          "abstract": "AI is expected to reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Large-scale survey data ( N = 37,079; 38 European countries) indicate that the public tends to view AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for technology-related, political, and sociodemographic factors, these data further show that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Two preregistered, nationally representative experiments ( N = 1,202, United Kingdom; replication study N = 1,200, United States) provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democracy and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may decrease democratic legitimacy and public engagement in shaping the future of AI.",

Using a sample that resembles the US voting-age population, the study directly measures each individual’s ad exposure through a user-level real-time ad tracking tool, which is merged with the same individual’s survey responses to identify voter suppression content and its targeting patterns. By further matching individual-level exposure to voter suppression ads with the same individual’s verified voter turnout records, the study estimates the effects of voter suppression on actual turnout. The study findings from the 2016 US Presidential Election reveal clear geo-racial targeting patterns in voter suppression: non-Whites residing in the racial minority counties of battleground states were exposed to substantially more voter suppression ads than their counterparts. Moreover, exposure to voter suppression ads was associated with decreases in voter turnout at the population level, albeit small. The sharpest declines were observed among non-Whites residing in minority counties of battleground states, suggesting that the intensified turnout suppression among the targeted segments of the electorate may have played a role in shaping turnout.",

          "abstract": "Civil society has long been a catalyst for social change by reshaping structures, influencing values, and challenging power dynamics; however, its role in driving transformative change for biodiversity remains underexplored. To address this gap, we analyze 2,801 socio-environmental mobilizations documented in the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas). These mobilizations produce diverse outcomes that reveal distinct spatial, temporal, and sectoral patterns and proactively and reactively respond to environmental impacts across the globe. Notably, about 40% of these mobilizations occur within the top 30% of global priority lands for species conservation and their actions contribute to the achievement of key Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework targets focused on ecosystem protection, restoration, sustainable use, and inclusive spatial planning. Yet, one-third of mobilizations face repression, criminalization, or violence—pressures that are even more common in high-priority conservation areas. Moreover, mobilizations facing repressive outcomes contest environmental threats relevant for the KMGBF targets more extensively than those with progressive outcomes, underscoring the risks faced by movements driving biodiversity protection in critical regions. To amplify the transformative potential of socio-environmental mobilizations, we emphasize the importance of recognizing, strengthening, and protecting them through coordinated action among diverse social actors. By fostering collaboration and targeted resource allocation, these efforts can empower socio-environmental mobilizations to catalyze meaningful and lasting change for biodiversity conservation.",

          "abstract": "After widespread extirpation, conservation efforts have restored large carnivores to portions of their former range. Substantial research has since focused on their ability to alter ecological communities through effects on herbivores and mesocarnivores, but the principles governing competition among multiple apex carnivores remain unclear. While mesocarnivore scavenging of apex carnivore kills drive “enemies with benefits” dynamics, subordinate apex carnivores seldom rely on scavenging. Instead, they proficiently hunt prey themselves that dominant apex carnivores can steal, fundamentally altering the dynamics of their interactions. We used 9 y of contemporaneous GPS telemetry and 3,929 potential kill site investigations from a reconstituted community of sympatric wolves and cougars in Yellowstone National Park to test whether such apex–apex dynamics instead follow an “enemies without benefits” framework. Wolf movement and resource selection were strongly linked to cougar kills, resulting in carcass theft (i.e., kleptoparasitism) that drove their interactions and led to cougar mortalities. In contrast, cougars avoided wolf kills, were tied to escape terrain, and did not kill wolves, producing an asymmetric dynamic that persisted across distinct seasonal contexts. However, as elk (the shared primary prey) declined longitudinally, cougars shifted their diets to smaller-bodied deer that were kleptoparasitized by wolves at one-sixth the rate of elk kills. Our findings demonstrate that prey diversity and landscape structure are critical for subordinate apex carnivores who experience severe interference competition from their dominant counterparts. This dynamic extends trophic theory and provides a framework for predicting the coexistence outcomes of carnivore restoration and the ongoing recolonization of wolves.",

Here, we demonstrate that sAC orthologs in echinoderms and fish, species whose sperm fertilize eggs in aquatic environments with low HCO 3 − , are activated by alkaline pH rather than HCO 3 − . In human sAC, two charged residues coordinate HCO 3 − and are essential for HCO 3 − -mediated activation. In contrast, pH-regulated sACs and orthologs from 13 phyla have these residues replaced by neutral ones. These substitutions abolish the enzyme’s responsiveness to HCO 3 − and suggest that pH regulation of sAC is widespread in nonmammalian metazoans. Furthermore, we show that in sea urchin sperm, a rise of pH during spawning stimulates cAMP synthesis, a key step in the activation of motility. An evolutionarily significant pattern is emerging: Across phyla, sAC regulation by pH or HCO 3 − represents an adaptation to environments with low or high HCO 3 − , respectively.",

          "abstract": "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is characterized by a variety of specific genetic alterations that impact signaling pathway dependencies and therapeutic outcomes. Among the recurrently mutated genes, we identified RHOA , a member of the small GTPase family, as a selective dependency in DLBCL. Here, we show that RHOA function is essential for the survival of ABC DLBCL cells because it sustains oncogenic B cell receptor (BCR) signaling through maintaining a signaling-permissive conformation of the cortical actin network. This enables the formation of active BCR microclusters at the cell surface, ultimately resulting in constitutive, BCR-driven NF-κB survival signaling. Moreover, we found that RHOA controlled endocytosis of the BCR and thereby the assembly of the endolysosomal My–T–BCR multiprotein complex, a central activator of NF-κB consisting of MYD88, Toll-like receptor 9, and the internalized BCR. The recurrent DLBCL-associated RHOA R5W mutation rendered RHOA constitutively active in its GTP-bound state and changed the conformation of the actin network from primarily filamentous actin to globular actin. This altered actin state led to an increase in BCR microcluster formation, amplification of NF-κB signaling, and resistance to inhibitors targeting chronic active BCR signaling. Hence, our study establishes RHOA and its mutant isoforms as critical regulators of oncogenic BCR signaling in DLBCL.",

          "abstract": "The global transition to sustainable energy demands efficient lithium extraction from brines. While electrochemical lithium extraction using LiMn 2 O 4 (LMO) holds great promise, its practical application is hindered by mechanical degradation caused by anisotropic volume changes and stress accumulation during cycling. Herein, we present an entropy-driven amphiphilic self-assembly strategy that engineers stress-homogenized multilayer core–shell architectures, which innovatively mitigates stress accumulation by tuning the internal geometric structure to optimize stress–strain behavior, thereby synergistically enhancing ion distribution, transport kinetics, and electrochemical stability. This hierarchical interlayer architecture ensures uniform Li + distribution and redistributes internal stresses, mitigating localized stress concentrations and lattice expansion to preserve structural integrity throughout cycling. The optimized LMO establishes a dual benchmark for both capacity and cycling stability in hybrid capacitive deionization, achieving a remarkable lithium extraction capacity of 4.78 mmol g −1 with 96% retention over 100 cycles, outperforming both its unoptimized counterpart and other reported materials of the same type. Finite element simulations further elucidate a 48% reduction in maximum stress compared to disordered counterparts, underscoring the critical coupling between ion diffusion and stress evolution. This paradigm provides a pathway for developing advanced materials with intrinsically stable architectures for sustainable lithium extraction.",

In this work, we introduce near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) to investigate dopamine dynamics in meadow voles, a rodent species that exhibits distinct changes in social behavior and neurobiology across photoperiods. We observe increased dopamine release and release site density in voles housed in short photoperiods (which induce a social phenotype), suggesting adaptations linked to environmental changes. Moreover, pharmacological and extracellular manipulations demonstrate that short photoperiod/social voles exhibit heightened responsiveness to dopamine-increasing interventions and resilience against suppressive conditions. These findings highlight a significant association between dopamine signaling and photoperiod-driven changes in social behavior and establish nIRCats as an effective tool for expanding our understanding of dopamine dynamics across nonmodel organisms.",

          "abstract": "The spatial coordination between cellular organelles and metabolic enzyme assemblies represents a fundamental mechanism for maintaining metabolic efficiency under stress. While previous work has shown that membrane-bound organelles regulate metabolic activities and that membrane-less condensates conduct metabolic reactions, the coordination between these two organizations remains unaddressed. By using a combination of proximity labeling, superresolution fluorescence microscopy, and metabolite analyses using isotopic tracing, we investigated the relationships between these metabolic hotspots. Here, we show that nutrient deficiency elongates mitochondria and transforms the ER from a tubular to sheet-like morphology, coinciding with increased mitochondrial respiration and inosine 5′-monophosphate levels. These structural changes promote the colocalization of purinosomes with these organelles, enhancing metabolic channeling. Disruption of ER sheet formation via MTM1 knockout destabilizes purinosomes, impairs substrate channeling, and reduces intracellular purine nucleotide pools without altering enzyme expression. Our findings reveal that organelle morphology and interorganelle contacts dynamically regulate the assembly and function of metabolic condensates, providing a structural basis for coordinated metabolic control in response to nutrient availability.",

However, how the high diversity of bumblebees in the QTP evolved and contributed to their diversification in adjacent and far-reaching regions remains unclear. Here, we explored this question using a widespread bumblebee species, Bombus pyrosoma . Phylogenomic analysis revealed a history of dispersal out of the QTP and distinct lineage divergence along elevations within the species. Four major chromosomal inversion variants were identified, and shifts in their frequency with altitude were consistent with patterns of lineage divergence. The highland bumblebees showed stronger metabolic robustness and better flight performance under cold environments, whereas lowland ones excelled under warm conditions. Forty-one percent of the positively selected genes were located in the inversion regions and were mostly associated with fatty acid metabolism and information processing. Mutation with a strong candidate gene, elovl6 , possibly modulated long-chain fatty acid elongation, which facilitated bumblebee flight under thermal stress. Finally, genomic inversion analyses across 22 bumblebee species–17 native to the QTP–corroborate the widespread involvement of inversions in the elevational diversification of bumblebees. Overall, our findings revealed that chromosomal inversions play a pivotal role in facilitating local adaptation and dispersal out of the QTP in a bumblebee, providing insights into the genomic underpinnings of bumblebees’ diversification.",

During the maturation process, specific regions of the FUS-LC sequence-core-1, core-2, and core-3-become structured, giving rise to nonpolymorphic fibrils. Coarse-grained simulations predict that kinetically the least stable fibril-like core-3 forms first while the most stable core-1 appears last, in accord with Ostwald’s rule of stages. The fibril structure of the C-terminal core-3, predicted using AlphaFold, shows that a β -strand appears in this region early during droplet formation and triggers FUS-LC assembly. Multichain simulations, which ensure the equality of the chemical potentials between the phases, show that the dense phase forms through nucleation and coarsening, resembling Ostwald ripening.

          "abstract": "Bacteriophages have applications in biotechnology, including human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety, and biosecurity. One example of resurging importance is phage therapy, the use of phages to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Phage therapy currently requires screening of environmental phages against the infecting strains for each individual patient, a laborious process that limits the development of standardized treatments. To overcome limitations of narrow host range inherent to many native phages, a robust genomic engineering platform is required which permits rapid and dependable genome production and engineering for nonmodel phage. Here, we describe an engineering platform for a phiKMV-like Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage, 41S1 that builds on previous work in the rapid assembly of small genomes through one-pot, High Complexity Golden Gate assembly (HC-GGA). This system divides the 41S1 genome into DNA fragments small enough to be conveniently synthesized and to avoid toxicity during DNA propagation, with all but one maintained in Escherichia coli . These fragments are readily assembled in a high accuracy, one-pot reaction; phages can be rescued by direct transformation into P. aeruginosa PAO1 or E. coli 10-beta cells. We demonstrate the precise generation of point mutations, DNA insertions, deletions, and the addition of fluorescence reporter genes that are expressed during phage replication. All viable genotypes could be generated with near 100% success rate with minimal screening. This system demonstrates the potential of HC-GGA for the rapid production and engineering of phages and provides a chassis for the development of phages that broadly target the opportunistic human pathogen P. aeruginosa .",

However, rapid growth and biomass production in algae have not always translated into high product yields, partly because central metabolism is context specific, with metabolic fluxes being influenced by nutrient conditions and other environmental factors. In the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas), mixotrophic cultures (acetate + light) grow far faster than phototrophic (light only) or heterotrophic (acetate + dark) cultures, even though acetate partially suppresses photosynthesis. Here, an isotopic dilution strategy with unlabeled acetate was combined with 13 CO 2 transient labeling to perform isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA) and to directly compare autotrophic and mixotrophic metabolism in Chlamydomonas supported by data from transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. INST-MFA indicated that acetate induces a synergistic rewiring of metabolism, conserving carbon by using the glyoxylate cycle and suppressing gluconeogenesis, the latter of which was discordant with omics results and prior models. Additionally, our data provide a plausible rationale for the well-known suppression of photosynthesis by acetate. We propose that reduced total protein content in mixotrophic versus phototrophic cells, much of which is attributed to reduced levels of photosynthetic proteins, decreases the costly metabolic burden of protein synthesis and represents a growth rate optimization strategy.",

Metabolic changes, including disruptions in mitochondrial function and dynamics, characterize these disorders and are believed to contribute to organismal toxicity. To investigate how toxic RNA repeats affect mitochondria, we used a Caenorhabditis elegans model that expresses expanded CUG repeat RNAs in muscle cells and recapitulates muscle dysfunction. We found that the RNA-binding protein Muscleblind-like 1 (MBL-1) is essential for normal mitochondrial function and regulates organelle morphology. In animals expressing expanded CUG repeats, where MBL-1 function is impaired, we identified two distinct mechanisms of mitochondrial disruption: altered mitochondrial morphology regulated by MBL-1, and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) dysfunction occurring independently of MBL-1. Our data further show that changes in mitochondrial morphology are specifically linked to nuclear MBL-1 dysfunction, which affects cpt-3 expression, a gene encoding carnitine palmitoyltransferase—an enzyme required for fatty acid transport into mitochondria. This mechanism is conserved, with similar disruptions observed in patients with Myotonic Dystrophy type 1. Importantly, our findings indicate that increased organelle fragmentation is not central to cellular pathogenesis. Instead, OxPhos dysfunction appears to be a primary contributor to organismal toxicity.",

The first, a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway, is a major mediator of developmental axon degeneration triggered by loss of trophic support. The second, a caspase-independent pathway mediated by the sterile alpha and HEAT/Armadillo motif containing 1 (SARM1) NADase, was found in studies of injury-induced Wallerian degeneration; it is also implicated in degeneration associated with traumatic brain injury, as well as some neurodegenerative diseases and neuropathies. Recent studies suggest that SARM1 functions as a metabolic sensor for the cellular nicotinamide mononucleotide/NAD+ ratio through its autoinhibitory armadillo repeats (ARM) domain. Here, we show a tight link between apoptotic and SARM1-dependent degeneration by demonstrating that SARM1 is activated during and contributes to apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, macrophages, and T cells. Mechanistically, the key apoptotic protease caspase-3 cleaves SARM1 within its ARM domain, relieving its autoinhibition and activating its NAD+ hydrolase activity. Using a knock-in (KI) mouse model with a SARM1 mutation that prevents caspase-3 cleavage, we show that apoptosis promotion by SARM1 in macrophages and T cells requires its cleavage, whereas in neurons deprived of trophic support, activation of SARM1 occurs both with and without cleavage. Our study identifies a central role for SARM1 in apoptosis in some cells that is mediated by SARM1 activation through caspase-3 cleavage; it provides a model for dissecting the contributions of the two modes of SARM1 activation in different cellular contexts; and it has implications for the selection of ortho- versus allosteric SARM1 inhibitors for treating neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "Liquid water can be supercooled up to about 50 K below the melting point before undergoing homogeneous ice nucleation. Based on experimental thermodynamic observations and computer simulations, it was hypothesized that below this temperature and at pressures of several kbar, water undergoes a liquid–liquid phase transition (LLPT) and the transition line ends at a second critical point. However, challenges in experiments and simulations at such deep cooling leave doubts about the nature of the LLPT and the existence of the critical point. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations with a highly accurate and computationally efficient polarizable water model to establish the character of the LLPT and identify the location of the second critical point. Our microsecond-long simulations provide direct evidence of a well-defined moving interface between low-density and high-density water at conditions near the phase boundary. This provides decisive proof of a first-order transition between two liquid phases with distinct free energy basins separated by a barrier, taking a major step toward resolving this long-standing debate. These results offer new perspectives on supercooled water under pressure simulated with an accurate and realistic model suitable for studies of water in confined geological and biological environments.",

          "abstract": "Granular materials densify under repeated mechanical perturbations, nonequilibrium dynamics that underlies many natural and industrial processes. Because granular relaxation is governed by frictional contacts and energy dissipation, this aging behavior fundamentally differs from that of thermal glasses despite their apparent similarities. Here, we uncover how friction controls the compaction dynamics of granular packings subjected to quasistatic cyclic shear. Using discrete element simulations, we construct a dynamic state diagram as a function of strain amplitude and friction, revealing a rich interplay among jamming marginality, stabilization, and fluidization. We identify a friction-dependent crossover strain that separates aging and fluidized regimes, showing reentrant, nonmonotonic behavior: Increasing friction first suppresses fluidization but then promotes it through smooth, creep-like rearrangements. This transition is marked by a shift from intermittent, avalanche-like rearrangements to continuous, diffusive motion. Our findings demonstrate that friction exerts a dual role in granular aging—both stabilizing and fluidizing—thereby uncovering the fundamental nonequilibrium mechanisms that govern compaction, rheology, and aging in athermal disordered systems. More broadly, our results reveal a general principle for how friction governs metastability and flow in athermal matter—from granular and frictional colloids to soils and seismic faults—linking microscopic contact mechanics to macroscopic dynamics.",

Here, we investigated interactions between Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , coinfecting opportunistic pathogens found in pneumonia and chronic lung infections, such as in cystic fibrosis. We found that S. maltophilia forms large protective multicellular aggregates upon exposure to P. aeruginosa secreted factors. Experimental evolution for lack of aggregation selected for fimbrial mutations and we found that fimbriae are required on both interacting S. maltophilia cells for aggregation. Untargeted metabolomics and targeted validations revealed that the quorum-sensing molecule Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) directly induced S. maltophilia aggregation, and colocalized with the aggregates. Further, in coculture with P. aeruginosa , wild-type S. maltophilia formed aggregates, resulting in up to 75-fold increased survival from P. aeruginosa competition compared to fimbrial mutants. Finally, multiple other bacterial species similarly aggregated upon exposure to P. aeruginosa PQS, indicating a more general response. Collectively, our work identifies a multispecies interaction where a quorum-sensing molecule from a coinfecting pathogen is sensed as a “danger” signal, thereby inducing a protective multicellular response.",

From ~200 pg of HeLa digest—approximately 80% of a cell—the technology identified 1,035 proteins with high reproducibility in quantification (coefficient of variation &lt;15% across technical triplicates). With microprobe sampling in vivo, we quantified 808–1,022 proteins from opposite poles of the dorsal–animal (D1) blastomere before division, and we traced how these spatial distributions are retained or remodeled in the descendant D1.1 (neural-fated) and D1.2 (epidermal-destined) cells. To decouple subcellular distributions from dorsal–ventral axis cues, we perturbed patterning by ultraviolet ventralization. These results establish microprobe CE–MS for deep subcellular proteomics in intact embryos and reveal spatially distinct protein distributions during early fate specification. These spatial proteome differences appear consistent with early lineage tendencies yet precede and likely bias, rather than fix, later fate decisions that depend on gastrula-stage inductive signals.",

Despite some promising preclinical evidence, this combination therapy has shown limited efficacy in patients with homologous recombination (HR)–proficient tumors. To investigate this discrepancy between preclinical and clinical results, we profiled the effects of PARP inhibition in prostate cancer models in the presence or absence of AR inhibition. Surprisingly, AR inhibition impaired response to PARP inhibitors in castration-sensitive cells and had no effect on response in castration-resistant cells. AR inhibition also did not regulate DNA repair in either the castration-resistant or castration-sensitive setting.

          "abstract": "Intracellular transport of macromolecules is crucial for the proper functioning of most cellular processes. Although intracellular crowding is known to strongly alter macromolecule mobility, how cytoplasmic structures physically modulate diffusion remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic crowding controls diffusivity using live-cell experiments and porous media modeling approaches. Confocal microscopy combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements revealed an anticorrelation between free-green fluorescent protein diffusivity and the heterogeneous cytoplasmic structure abundance in live mammalian cells. This motivated the development of a multiscale model, where the cytoplasm is treated as a hierarchical porous medium with nanometric and micrometric obstacles. Numerically solving the model allowed us to predict the effective cytoplasmic diffusion coefficient for various obstacle volume fractions, and to identify tortuous and porous hydrodynamic hindrances as key diffusion reduction mechanisms. Comparison with our experimental results highlighted the importance of hydrodynamic interactions between diffusing molecules and nanometric obstacles. Importantly, we found that the effective cytoplasmic diffusivity was not dependent on specific intracellular regions but rather on the local intracellular obstacle volume fraction. Finally, the model was extended to predict the diffusivity of larger macromolecules, showing excellent agreement with literature data for several macromolecules and cell lines. This study provides insights into the physical mechanisms impeding intracellular diffusion, demonstrating the potential of porous media modeling approaches to predict transport mechanisms in dynamic or heterogeneous intracellular structures, as in cell motility, blebbing, and apoptosis.",

          "abstract": "Nitrate serves both as an essential nutrient and a key signaling molecule that shapes plant growth. In legumes, high nitrate concentrations suppress symbiotic nitrogen fixation, a process mediated by MtNLP1 (NIN-like protein1). Although nitrate minimally affects NLP transcript levels, it strongly controls their nuclear localization. How posttranslational modifications regulate MtNLP1 function, however, has remained unclear. Here, we show that nitrate induces SUMOylation of MtNLP1 at lysine 589 and 795 and that this modification is essential for its biological activity. Loss of these SUMO sites compromises nitrate-mediated inhibition of nodulation and weakens MtNLP1 interactions with MtNIN and itself. Components of the SUMOylation machinery in Medicago truncatula physically interact and are essential for both nodulation and nitrate responsiveness, indicating broader roles for SUMOylation in symbiosis. A SUMO-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana AtNLP7 3KR mutant fails to complement the Atnlp7-1 phenotype, demonstrating that SUMOylation is a conserved regulatory mechanism among NLPs. Together, our findings reveal SUMOylation as a previously unrecognized layer of regulation that integrates nutrient signaling with root nodule symbiosis.",

To investigate the mechanism of StopGo, we determined the cryo-EM structure of a mammalian ribosome positioned at the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A (F2A) site. The structure shows how interactions between the F2A nascent chain (NC) and the ribosomal exit tunnel induce a conformational change in the peptidyl transferase center that precludes further translation elongation but instead pre-exposes the P-tRNA:F2A-NC ester bond for hydrolysis and NC release. Additionally, we bioinformatically characterized variation and host association across nearly 10,000 StopGo sequences identified in virus genomes. We expanded the canonical core motif to (D/G/C/N)(V/I)ExNPGP and identified additional rare but functional variants. We also revealed several distinct upstream motifs that we showed biochemically to be important for StopGo activity. Interestingly, although StopGo is known to be functionally active in plants, we found no evidence for natural utilization of StopGo by plant viruses. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights into a unique translation recoding mechanism, and lay foundations for further optimization of multigene expression in biotechnology.",

Despite this, direct evidence for early wooden tool use remains exceptionally rare. Here, we present the earliest handheld wooden tools, identified from secure contexts at the site of Marathousa 1, Greece, dated to ca. 430 ka (MIS12). Through a systematic morphological, microscopic, taphonomic, and taxonomic analysis of the sampled wood macroremains, two specimens were securely identified as modified by hominins: one small alder ( Alnus sp.) trunk fragment bears clear working and use-wear traces consistent with a multifunctional stick likely used in digging at the paleolakeshore; and one very small willow/poplar ( Salix sp./ Populus sp.) artifact exhibits signs of shaping and potential use-wear. A third specimen, a large alder trunk segment, shows deep, nonanthropogenic striations interpreted here as claw marks from a large carnivoran. The wooden tools were excavated together with butchered elephant remains, small lithic artifacts and debitage, and worked bone, underscoring the diversity of engagement with a variety of different raw materials for technological purposes at Marathousa 1. These finds extend the temporal range of early wooden tools. They represent both the use of expedient larger handheld tools as well as a much smaller, likely finger-held wooden tool, which is uniquely small for the Pleistocene, expanding known functional purposes of early wood technologies. Moreover, they highlight the Megalopolis Basin’s exceptional preservation conditions and its role in understanding the evolution of hominin behavior.",

Here, we investigated the role of single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) in stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in modulating immune evasion and pathogenicity spectrum of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV). The ISKNV-encoded protein VP012R targets mandarin fish STING ( sc STING) for ubiquitination at residues C196 and K315, promoting its degradation to suppress interferon responses. Importantly, the K315/R315 polymorphism acts as a molecular switch: Susceptible species with the K315 residue exhibit STING degradation and viral immune evasion, whereas resistant species with the R315 residue maintain STING stability and antiviral defenses. Phylogenetic analysis linked K315 to high-mortality hosts (≥50% lethality) vs. R315 in resistant species (≤25% lethality).

Mic-628-treated mice re-entrain to phase-advanced light–dark cycles significantly faster. The direct interaction between Mic-628 and CRYPTOCHROME1 (CRY1) does not simply inhibit CRY1 repressor activity. Instead, the interaction facilitates the CLOCK-BMAL1 assembly, ensuring highly specific induction via a tandem E-box motif upstream of the Per1 promoter. Importantly, Mic-628-driven Per1 induction is repressed by PER1 itself. Mathematical modeling indicates that both the CRY1- and PER1-mediated transcriptional regulation fix the phase of Per1 induction irrespective of intake time, thereby predominantly advancing the clock phase.

These bacteria rapidly spread through the water-transporting xylem where they grow prolifically and produce abundant biofilm that clogs xylem vessels. To understand RSSC biofilm behavior in planta, we examined their complex fluid mechanics. Rheological analyses revealed that unlike all previously analyzed microbial biofilms, RSSC biofilms are shear-thinning, viscoelastic fluids at physiologically relevant shear forces. To determine which factors confer these unique mechanics, we analyzed biofilms of bacterial mutants with altered biofilm components. Genetic analysis demonstrated that development of the viscous-dominant biofilms required production of EPS-I, an amphiphilic exopolysaccharide that is a major virulence factor for all RSSC pathogens. We show that EPS-I confers “biofilm mobility”, which allows wild-type RSSC colonies to passively expand when deformed. Despite its high metabolic cost, bioassays demonstrated that EPS-I production conferred a net fitness benefit where biofilm mobility allowed the pathogen to spread and access more nutrients in complex environments like xylem vessels. The RSSC are a monophyletic lineage of aggressive plant wilt pathogens, and our evolutionary hypothesis testing suggests the origin of the eps biosynthetic gene cluster coincides with the emergence of wilt pathogenesis in the RSSC ancestor. Furthermore, comparative physiological assays demonstrated that biofilm mobility is unique to the RSSC within the genus Ralstonia . In summary, EPS-I production is a key evolutionary innovation that enables RSSC dispersal and virulence by conferring unique biofilm mechanics.",

Although several brain structures exhibit masculine or feminine characteristics, strictly binary anatomical feature, comparable to those observed in genitalia, has been rarely identified. In this study, we identified a dense, sexually dimorphic cluster of neurons in the posterodorsal medial amygdala (MeApd), which we named DIMPLE (Dimorphic IEGs Medial Posterodorsal amygdala Labeled Ensemble) that exhibited a remarkable binary pattern of c-fos promoter activation. Using the TRAP2 (Targeted Recombination in Active Populations) transgenic mouse model, we found that it was consistently labeled in all females, regardless of age or sexual experience. In contrast, DIMPLE labeling was absent in adult virgin males but present both prior to weaning and following mating. Surgical removal of gonads (ovariectomy or orchiectomy) did not alter the labeling pattern of DIMPLE in either sex. Interestingly, a single intraperitoneal injection of prolactin, a hormone that increases in males after mating, induced DIMPLE labeling in virgin males. However, treatment with cabergoline, a potent inhibitor of prolactin secretion, did not prevent DIMPLE labeling in females or in postmating males. Given the established role of the MeApd in social and reproductive behaviors, we hypothesize that DIMPLE may support neural mechanisms underlying female-typical behavior and potentially contribute to postmating behavioral shifts in males.",

Using mitochondrial and nuclear genome hybridization capture and sequencing, paleoproteomics, Bayesian molecular dating, and radiocarbon dating, we found that all ancient Japanese “tiger” remains yielding molecular data were, unexpectedly, cave lions ( Panthera spelaea ). One specimen from Yamaguchi Prefecture, western Japan, was radiocarbon dated to 36,000-34,891 cal. BP.

          "abstract": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) can be either temporary or permanent, depending on the intensity and duration of noise exposure. Excessive noise exposure activates various cellular mechanisms in the cochlea, including oxidative stress, immune responses, and apoptosis. Still, the mechanisms underlying hearing recovery after transient threshold shift (TTS) and lack of recovery after permanent threshold shift (PTS), as well as their therapeutic implications for NIHL, remain unknown. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of longitudinal changes in the cochlear transcriptome of TTS and PTS mouse models. Our analysis revealed that noise-induced ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). Notably, the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) branch of the UPR returned to baseline levels following TTS but showed sustained activation following PTS. In addition, the proapoptotic factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was selectively induced in hair cells following PTS. Administering a PERK inhibitor prior to and following noise exposure hindered hearing restoration after TTS, indicating a requirement for PERK activation in hearing recovery. Inhibition of sustained PERK activation via a PERK inhibitor or reduction of CHOP expression via pharmacological chaperones facilitated partial hearing recovery following PTS. Together, these findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying NIHL and its prevention, highlighting UPR modulation as a promising therapeutic strategy.",

          "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria have long been thought to confine primary glycerophospholipid synthesis to the inner membrane (IM). Here, we challenge this paradigm by identifying ClsO, an outer membrane (OM) lipoprotein from Acinetobacter baumannii that functions as a cardiolipin synthase. In contrast to canonical cardiolipin synthases, which are restricted to the IM, ClsO is surface-exposed and deposits cardiolipin into the outer leaflet of the OM, colocalizing with Acinetobacter lipooligosaccharide. Loss of ClsO sensitizes cells to membrane disrupting agents, such as bile salts, and key antibiotics, implicating ClsO in OM barrier integrity. ClsO activity increases when mislocalized glycerophospholipids accumulate at the cell surface, such as in cells lacking Mla (maintenance of lipid asymmetry) system, consistent with a surface-active site mechanism. Engineering mutations in ClsO that prevent its trafficking to the OM was found to abolish nearly all enzymatic activity. Remarkably, we found that ClsO homologs are widespread across Proteobacteria and confirmed several to be functional cardiolipin synthases, indicating a conserved strategy of surface lipid remodeling. These findings redefine the spatial organization of lipid metabolism in Gram-negative bacteria and reveal an adaptive mechanism to maintain OM integrity when membrane asymmetry is compromised.",

          "abstract": "Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death, is characterized by massive cell swelling and plasma membrane rupture. Although swelling was recently shown to occur in two steps, the molecular and biophysical mechanisms driving this process remained unclear. Using fast quantitative microscopy, we reveal that between the two swelling phases, cell volume transiently stabilizes despite sustained plasma membrane permeability to ions and small molecules. From a biophysical perspective, the existence of such a plateau is puzzling, as ion pumps should not be able to regulate cell volume under these conditions. To address this, we developed a physical model based on an ion pump and leak framework that incorporates the dynamics of nonselective pore formation. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the plateau phase is controlled by the dynamics of the gasdermin D (GSDMD) pore enlargement, which is modulated by ninjurin-1 (Ninj1) activation, possibly through intracellular calcium. Ninj1-mediated lesions are also required for the second swelling phase. We further show that fully opened GSDMD pores display an effective hydrodynamic radius slightly above 1.9 nm, providing an in situ upper bound for pore size. Together, our findings demonstrate that pyroptotic volume dysregulation emerges from the successive and interdependent actions of GSDMD and Ninj1, each imparting distinct permeability regimes associated with increased water filtration and decreased ion selectivity due to pore opening. These insights bridge molecular and biophysical perspectives on lytic cell death and may inform the broader understanding of membrane rupture in inflammatory and pathological contexts.",

In the current conceptual framework, the initial stone nidus is thought to include the aggregation of inorganic crystallites, the formation of which is favored by elevated concentrations of dissolved constituents. Here, we show that this highly prevalent stone type comprises a form of organic–inorganic polycrystalline biocomposite with integrated bacterial biofilms. Evidence from electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy reveal the unanticipated internal structure of kidney stones from human patients, where bacterial biofilms are intercalated between polycrystalline mineral layers, even in stones identified as “noninfectious” clinically, including those in patients without underlying urinary tract infections. We observe similar bacterial biofilm architectures on the surfaces of stone fragments obtained due to lithotripsy, suggesting that bacteria are intrinsic to the process of nephrolithiasis. Crystallites proximal to biofilm layers exhibit significantly smaller grain sizes, which indicate a larger local concentration of nucleation sites. Staining reveals that biofilm areas of these stones are enriched with bacterial DNA. That bacteria are now observed so broadly in kidney stones (including even in less prevalent struvite stones) may be conceptually salient: Based on the evidence adduced here, we propose a model in which the urine-rich environment of the kidney can impinge on bacterial calcium homeostasis and amplify bacterial production of nucleation templates such as extracellular DNA. The resultant counterion condensation intrinsic to polyelectrolytes charged beyond the Manning criterion (such as DNA) drastically enhances the probability of heterogeneous nucleation, thereby amplifying calcium oxalate stone formation.",

While their steady-state flow behavior is reasonably well understood, their response to complex flow histories, as encountered in operations like pumping or mixing, remains poorly known. Using a custom multiaxis shear apparatus that enables arbitrary changes in flow direction, we investigate how shear history influences the mechanical behavior of a model soft glassy system. We uncover a transient shear response orthogonal to the applied shear direction, together with an anisotropic yield surface. These effects point to an underlying anisotropic distribution of internal stresses imprinted by previous deformation. To rationalize this behavior, we use a mesoscopic elastoplastic model, demonstrating that local mechanical disorder governs the emergence of macroscopic stress–flow misalignment. Our findings offer a route to experimentally probe the distribution of local yield stresses in soft glassy materials.",

          "abstract": "Compacting chromatin within the cellular nucleus presents a significant challenge for biology. Chromosomes must be both condensed and spatially organized to enable essential processes such as transcription and replication. Chromosome conformation capture experiments (e.g., Hi-C) provide valuable information about the spatial organization and, therefore, the connectivity between different genomic regions. These experiments inspired polymer models that describe the physical mechanism of the chromosomal energy landscape. The Full-Inversion Chromatin model (FI-Chrom), a data-driven approach for modeling genome organization, uses Hi-C contact maps to infer pairwise interaction potentials between all chromosomal loci. It combines Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-accelerated simulations with efficient training of tens of millions of parameters derived from the maximum-entropy principle to determine 3D structures of chromosomes that accurately reproduce Hi-C-like data. FI-Chrom does not make any a priori assumptions regarding chromosome architecture, making it applicable to any chromosome conformation capture experiment. Its derived structural ensembles capture all essential features from the short- and long-range interactions of typical chromosome organization, such as segregated compartments, chromosome territories, and fully or partially formed loops. Although Hi-C contains only structural information, FI-Chrom extends these data by revealing an emergent dynamical mechanism encoded in the inferred energy landscape. For example, simulations show that chromatin loops are not static architectural features but rather transient structural elements. Statistical analyses further indicate that loops confined within a single compartment occur more frequently than those spanning multiple compartments, highlighting the dynamic and compartment-dependent nature of chromatin organization.",

Our simulations suggest that agonist binding promotes a twisting motion in the S6 segment, enabling critical interactions with residues K330, K331, and F223.

          "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation induces pyrimidine dimers in DNA, which block replication, but are efficiently removed by excision, allowing replication restart. Interestingly, soon after restart, the cells become capable of inducible stable DNA replication (iSDR) without new origin-initiations—suggesting unusual replication topology. The original idea was that the preexisting forks remain dormant even after UV-lesion removal, and when the new origin-initiated forks arrive, they rear-end the dormant forks, creating potential for iSDR. While there is origin-overinitiation after UV, the current idea is that preexisting forks are restarted—making the iSDR potential unclear. We used replication profiling of post-UV cells to investigate reactivation of UV-blocked forks. To compare profile time-sequences, we developed indexation procedure generating nested profile sets. Wild type nested set shows: 1) no replication during the first 30 min post-UV; 2) overinitiation from the origin combined with restart of preexisting forks during the next 30 min post-UV. The restart required RecBCD enzyme to repair double-strand breaks, confirming that the UV-stalled forks disintegrate and need recombinational repair to restart. Preexisting fork restart is separate from new origin-initiations by DnaA, as the dnaA (Ts) mutant at 42 °C restarts preexisting forks normally. Remarkably, the absence of powerful replication wave from origin-initiations in the dnaA mutant reveals a restart-initiated replication wave toward the origin, indicating that the restart mechanism causes fork triplication—potentially explaining the SDR phenomenon. There is no post-UV replication in the dnaA recBC double mutant, consistent with only two pathways of replication resumption in post-UV cells: restart or new origin-initiation.",

While polarons have been investigated for almost a century, whether these quasiparticles exhibit topological properties and why remain open questions. Here, we establish the universal symmetry principles governing the topology of polar textures in large polarons. Using a group-theoretic analysis, we identify four distinct classes of polar textures in time-reversal-invariant systems, and we show that they carry integer topological charges. We validate this classification by performing state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of materials representative of each class. For these materials, we compute the fingerprints of polaron topology in Huang diffuse scattering and propose ultrafast electron and X-ray scattering experiments to detect these quasiparticles.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions in land plant fertilization from zooidogamy to siphonogamy were characterized by transformations of male reproductive cells. Basal land plants such as bryophytes and pteridophytes have motile sperm, whereas most seed plants have nonmotile sperm, delivered by a pollen tube. Despite being seed plants, gymnosperm cycads and ginkgo uniquely form highly multiflagellated and large motile sperm within pollen tubes. However, the evolutionary state of these male reproductive cells remains unknown. We clarified the gene expression profiles of Cycas revoluta pollen tubes and motile sperm swimming toward female reproductive cells. Male cycad cells expressed fewer genes associated with transcription, translation, and related processes, which is consistent across land plants. We compared the distinctive orthologous groups (OGs) of the genes specifically expressed in sperm and pollen tubes with those in other plants. Cycad pollen tubes shared several OGs with angiosperms but possessed significantly fewer gene copies and lacked cell wall remodeling and plasma membrane-localized receptor genes that contribute to rapid and guided growth. The growth mechanism of cycad pollen tubes might be largely different from angiosperm pollen tubes. In contrast, despite their morphological uniqueness, cycad sperm shared representative OGs with angiosperm sperm cells to the same extent as egg cells. In addition, a sperm-specific histone variant may contribute to transcriptional regulation via chromatin condensation like other male gametes. As an extant gymnosperm that retains zooidogamy with pollen tubes, the cycad represents a molecular intermediate state in the transition from zooidogamy to siphonogamy, providing insight into the evolution of land plant fertilization.",

On the other hand, human replication protein A (hRPA) plays a central role in stabilizing single-stranded DNA and resolution of secondary structures. Understanding how hRPA interacts with TNR hairpins has become crucial to uncovering the mechanisms that regulate TNR stability. Here, we employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to investigate the interaction between hRPA and CTG repeat hairpins of varying lengths. We found that blunt-end hairpins impede hRPA resolution, while the presence of a short overhang facilitates initial binding followed by invasion. At higher repeat lengths, hRPA binding induces partial hairpin resolution, followed by conformational slippage that restores blunt-end hairpin structures and hinders further progression. Hairpin resolution is coordinated by the interplay of the multiple dynamic binding modes of hRPA and the slippage reconfiguration of the TNR hairpins. Moreover, our results reveal a concentration- and stoichiometry-dependent resolution process, herein full resolution of TNR hairpins with pathologically relevant repeat lengths requires protein concentrations exceeding physiological levels, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis.",

Existing methods in paleontology, however, require supervision and a priori labeling of training data by researchers, which can lead to bias. We employ an unsupervised machine learning technique for recognizing inherent patterns in shape data, using a disentangled variational autoencoder network, to a database of 1,974 footprints, spanning a diversity of dinosaurs across their evolutionary history, including modern birds. Our neural network identified eight features of shape variation that most differentiate these tracks: overall load and shape (amount of ground contact area), digit spread, digit attachment, heel load, digit and heel emphasis, loading position, heel position, and left–right load. With the unsupervised process finished, we a posteriori labeled each track based on published expert judgments, plotted them into morphospace, and applied distance metrics to group means and nearest neighbors, which showed 80 to 93% agreement with expert identifications. Controversial Late Triassic-Early Jurassic bird-like tracks group with fossil and modern birds and some Middle Jurassic three-toed tracks with ornithopods, supporting an older origin for these groups than recorded by body fossils. We provide an app, DinoTracker, to make this process accessible, and source code that can be adapted to other cases where paleontologists or biologists are studying patterns of shape variation.",

Here, we identified a strikingly conspicuous polarization signal used specifically during courtship in the cuttlefish Doratosepion andreanum and investigated the underlying optical mechanism. The signal consists of a pattern of adjacent horizontally and vertically polarized areas, optimizing signal detectability for cephalopod polarization vision. This pattern is generated by reflective cells called iridophores and transparent muscle: light becomes horizontally polarized when reflected by iridophores, and its angle of polarization is then rotated to vertical when transmitted through a birefringent muscle layer. Our findings show the significant contribution of polarization of light to animal communication and reveal that polarization signals—like colorful sexual ornaments—can achieve high conspicuousness through fundamentally different optical mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Lineages undergoing rapid evolutionary diversification may evolve a set of mixed traits as a result of hybrid speciation, gene flow, or incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). However, how best to quantify these alternative processes impacting phenotypic variation remains unclear. Here, we examined trait evolution in two sister genera of endangered Asian primates, Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus . By assembling a de novo genome of the Trachypithecus pileatus group, which is geographically located in a transitional zone between these two genera, our integrated phylogenomic analyses clarified the evolutionary relationship of the T. pileatus group with other Trachypithecus species. We also identified that morphological similarities shared between this species group and Semnopithecus are the result of ILS, rather than gene flow or hybrid speciation. Across all chromosomes of the T. pileatus group, ILS contributed 8.9% of whole genome segments. Across these segments, we distinguished 77 genes such as FGFBP1 and FOXO1 that are involved in pathways of bone development and osteoblast differentiation. Functional experiments indicate that FGFBP1 genotypes shared by species of the T. pileatus group and Semnopithecus appear to enhance osteogenic capability and mineralization, possibly resulting in larger body size and similarities in skull morphology compared with other species of Trachypithecus . The study reveals that ILS has shaped the evolution of mixed traits within gene-regulatory networks, driving phenotypic diversity during periods of rapid species divergence in this highly successful primate radiation. ILS appears to be more common than previously thought and represents a critical step in accurately assessing the phylogeny of closely related taxa.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for the global optimization of a possibly multimodal continuous function in a bounded rectangular domain. We first show that global optimization is equivalent to an optimal (sampling) strategy formation in a two-armed decision model with known distributions, based on the strategic law of large numbers we establish. There are many optimal strategies in general. We show that a concrete strategy using the sign of the partial gradient of the unique solution to a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) is asymptotically optimal. Motivated by these results, we propose a class of Strategic Monte Carlo Optimization (SMCO) algorithms, which uses a simple strategy that makes coordinate-wise two-armed decisions based on the signs of the partial gradient (or practically the first difference) of the objective function, without the need of solving PDEs. Under some sufficient conditions, we establish that our SMCO algorithm converges to a local optimizer from a single starting point, and to a global optimizer under a growing set of starting points. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate the suitability of our SMCO algorithms for global optimization well beyond the theoretical guarantees established herein. For a wide range of deterministic and random test functions with challenging landscapes (multimodal, nondifferentiable, discontinuous), our SMCO algorithms perform robustly well, even in high-dimensional ( d = 200 ∼ 1 , 000 ) settings. In fact, our algorithms outperform many state-of-the-art global optimizers, as well as local algorithms (with the same set of starting points as ours).",

Here, we investigated how olfactory signals reach two subsets of appetite-linked (“appetite”) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus: Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, which stimulate appetite, and POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) neurons, which suppress it. Using polysynaptic viral tracing, we show that AgRP and POMC neurons receive indirect input from partially overlapping but distinct areas of the olfactory cortex, indicating that they process different sets of olfactory information. We also identify different complements of neurons more directly upstream of AgRP and POMC neurons that could relay olfactory cortical signals to the appetite neurons. Single-cell transcriptomics shows heterogeneous expression of neuromodulator receptors among AgRP neurons, suggesting variations in the signals they receive. Integrated viral tracing and RNA localization further reveals selected brain areas where upstream neurons express cognate receptor ligands. Together, these findings outline multiple pathways by which distinct olfactory and modulatory signals are differentially routed to neurons that promote versus inhibit appetite.",

This method enables the simultaneous analysis of cellular transcriptomes and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires within their native spatial context. We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated subanatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs. Overall, our study demonstrates how AIR-SPACE can be used to gain insight into the spatial dynamics of infection responses within lymphoid organs.",

          "abstract": "Whiteflies pose a major threat to crops worldwide, primarily because they transmit begomoviruses with which they have evolved intricate mutualistic relationships. The mutualisms are known to exacerbate whitefly invasions and drive widespread plant virus pandemics. Yet, certain plant genotypes are able to resist both the whiteflies and the viruses and a good understanding of the underlying mechanisms could help to develop more resistant varieties. Here, we show that the viruliferous whitefly Bemisia tabaci induces an early and strong release of the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene in cultivated tomato plants. This volatile functions as an airborne signal that primes neighboring conspecifics for enhanced resistance to begomoviruses, including Tomato yellow leaf curl virus and Papaya leaf curl China virus. These results challenge the view that whitefly-induced volatile emissions primarily benefit the insect vector, suggesting instead that the plant prioritizes antiviral defense over antiherbivore resistance. β-Caryophyllene exposure was also found to enhance the emission of β-Caryophyllene, methyl salicylate and β-myrcene upon whitefly attack, increasing plant attractiveness to the parasitoid Encarsia formosa . Using a β-caryophyllene overproducing transgenic tomato line and synthetic β-caryophyllene dispensers, we confirmed that β-caryophyllene exposure primes antipathogen defenses in tomato plants and confers improved plant fitness under sustained infestation by viruliferous whiteflies. Importantly, this defense priming is genotype-specific and limited to certain tomato cultivars, suggesting that β-caryophyllene-mediated resistance can be harnessed through selective breeding. Our findings reveal a volatile-based mechanism by which tomato plants may counteract the virus–vector mutualism, offering promising avenues for integrated pest and disease management.",

During infection, viral egress from midgut cells and subsequent behavior changes lead to terminally infected insects migrating to higher elevations on plant branches or tree limbs. However, the neural mechanisms driving this hyperactivity remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the climbing behavior of Helicoverpa armigera larvae enhances the dispersal of Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV). Our findings reveal that HearNPV triggers a calcium response in enteroendocrine cells, leading to the release of midgut-derived tachykinin (TK). Released TK activates its receptor (TKR) in the brain, thereby promoting phototaxis and climbing behavior. Additionally, HaTTD14 functions as a downstream regulator of the TK–TKR signaling pathway. These results provide insights into the neural and molecular mechanisms driving baculovirus-induced hyperactivity, which aids in viral transmission.",

Due to the external mechanical cues and the nucleo-cytoskeletal dynamics, the nesprins are physiologically under forces. However, the dynamics of nesprins within physiological forces and loading rates remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ magnetic-tweezers-based single-molecule manipulation alongside molecular dynamic simulations and AlphaFold structural predictions to comprehensively investigate the dynamics of force-bearing spectrin repeat (SR) domains of the giant nesprin-2 protein. Through direct quantification, we unveil that the numerous SRs undergo mechanical unfolding and refolding dynamics with distinct transition rates within several pN scale. Furthermore, we show that the giant nesprin-2 could act as an effective molecular absorber adeptly maintaining forces on the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton linkage within a few pN across displacement spans exceeding one μm. Notably, our findings imply that subtle pN-level mechanical forces intricately modulate nesprin–protein interactions via the dynamics of domain folding and unfolding. Collectively, our study offers a comprehensive understanding of the mechanical characteristics of nesprin-2 giant, shedding light on its pivotal role in nucleoskeleton–cytoskeleton mechanotransduction.",

Current protein deep learning models are predominantly trained on sequence and/or static structure data, which often fail to capture the dynamic nature of proteins. To address this, we introduce SeqDance and ESMDance, two protein language models trained on dynamic biophysical properties derived from molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses of over 64,000 proteins. Both models can be directly applied to predict dynamic properties of unseen ordered and disordered proteins. SeqDance, trained from scratch, has attentions that capture dynamic interaction and comovement between residues, and its embeddings encode rich representations of protein dynamics that can be further utilized to predict conformational properties beyond the training tasks via transfer learning. SeqDance predicted dynamic property changes reflect mutation effect on protein folding stability. ESMDance, built upon ESM2 (Evolutionary Scale Model II) outputs, substantially outperforms ESM2 in zero-shot prediction of mutation effects for designed and viral proteins which lack evolutionary information. Together, SeqDance and ESMDance offer a framework for integrating protein dynamics into language models, enabling more generalizable predictions of protein behavior and mutation effects.",

          "abstract": "Biological polymers often face a trade-off between stiffness, strength, and extensibility: Materials that are strong and stiff tend to be brittle, while those that are elastic and extensible usually lack strength. Here, we show that netcasting spiders (Deinopidae) overcome this trade-off by forming mixed-silk metastructures, which enable both high elastic deformation and load resistance. These spiders have evolved a unique predatory strategy, casting a sticky silk web over prey, which subjects the web radii to extreme strains far exceeding those sustained by typical spider silk fibers. The radii consist of a compound filament with an elastomeric core surrounded by looped bundles of thin fibers. This architecture results in an unusual mechanical profile: The threads are initially compliant and highly extensible, but they stiffen as the fiber loops straighten, enhancing load-bearing capacity. Notably, spiders control this compound architecture through a reel-spinning technique, controlling loop formation and fiber mixture to establish an elasticity gradient across the web—stiff and strong in the main frame lines, yet soft and hyperelastic in the lower radii that undergo the greatest deformation during prey capture. These findings represent a unique case of behavioral modulation of silk processing to circumvent biomaterial trade-offs, enabling extraordinary dynamics and specialization of web architecture. The herein described principle of looped fiber-reinforced elastomers may also be transferred to the design of artificial materials for applications that require both high elasticity and strength.",

          "abstract": "The quadratic bound (QB) principle proposed by Böhning and Lindsay in 1988 is an important special case of the majorization–minimization or minorization-maximization optimization principle. The quadratic upper-bound (QUB) principle is pertinent to minimization; the analogous quadratic lower-bound principle is pertinent to maximization. Unfortunately, in minimizing a loss f ( θ ) , the QUB principle is limited by the difficulty of finding a constant positive definite matrix B such that B − d 2 f ( θ ) is positive semidefinite for all θ . This paper proposes a generalization of the QB principle that avoids this limitation. In particular, we construct QUB algorithms by replacing the matrix B by a continuous matrix-valued function B n ( θ ) that dominates the Hessian d 2 f ( θ ) and depends on the both the current iterate θ n and the next potential iterate θ . In practice, we require B n ( θ ) to be diagonal with its diagonal entries separated in θ . In other words, the i th diagonal entry of B n ( θ ) depends on θ only through its i th entry θ i . Theoretical analysis confirms that this class of generalized QB algorithms enjoys global convergence in favorable circumstances. For the scalar case, the tangency condition that the second derivative equals the bound function at the current point promotes superlinear convergence. Several numerical experiments implemented in Julia illustrate the power of the generalized QB principle.",

          "abstract": "The ocean is thought to be the terminal sink for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), persistent organofluorine chemicals used widely in modern commerce for decades. Industry and stewardship programs phased out the most abundantly produced legacy PFAS in the early 2000s due to toxicity concerns. However, they have since been replaced by shorter carbon chain and “novel” chemistries, and past work hypothesized likely increases in these replacement PFAS that were not previously quantifiable. To address this gap, we measured bulk extractable organofluorine (EOF) in archived liver and muscle tissues from pelagic Subarctic pilot whales over the last several decades. Results show EOF concentrations peaked in 2011 and declined by over 60% by 2023. Among a broad suite of targeted and suspect PFAS measured using high-resolution mass spectrometry, only one was consistently increasing through 2023. Tissue concentrations of four main legacy PFAS that accounted for over 75% of EOF were all decreasing by 2023. The timing of peak concentrations depended primarily on whether they were transported to the subarctic by ocean circulation or atmospheric deposition, with the latter declining much faster. Oceanic transport and bioaccumulation modeling suggests that decadal-scale lags between production and food web bioaccumulation are primarily driven by marine transport processes. Large declines in tissue concentrations in this study reinforce the effectiveness of phase-outs in chemical production. However, other work showing stable or increasing EOF in human serum suggests many emerging PFAS with more neutral physicochemical properties may be preferentially accumulating in terrestrial and nearshore environments compared to legacy PFAS.",

However, molecular pathways that safeguard mitochondrial homeostasis in the aging heart remain poorly understood. Here, we identify MTFR1L as a regulator of mitophagy that binds p-S65-Ub, a key signal amplifying the PINK1/Parkin axis. We find that MTFR1L is enriched in metabolically active tissues, particularly in the heart, where it regulates Parkin signaling. Genetic deletion of Mtfr1l in mice impairs stress-induced mitophagy and Parkin activation, leading to accumulation of damaged mitochondria, increased inflammation and senescence, and accelerated age-related cardiac dysfunction. Strikingly, cardiac expression of MTFR1L progressively decreases along with aging in mice, primates, and humans, coinciding with cardiomyocyte senescence and lipofuscin accumulation. Together, these findings uncover a role for MTFR1L in regulation of the p-S65-Ub/Parkin mitophagy axis and maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis during cardiac aging and suggest that age-associated loss of MTFR1L may contribute to age-related cardiac dysfunction. Based on these findings, we propose a therapeutic paradigm for the prevention of heart aging by restoring MTFR1L function.",

Here, utilizing in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy, we find a dense liquid layer mediated deposition of AuNPs at the pyrite–water interface in parts per billion-level gold-bearing solutions, a concentration that resembles crustal abundances. Real-time imaging reveals that a dense liquid layer forms at the pyrite–water interface, and it is proposed that AuNPs nucleate and grow in this layer. Results from in situ atomic force microscopy and ex situ transmission electron microscopy indicate that the growth kinetic process of AuNPs involves monomer-to-cluster aggregation, further enriching gold at the pyrite–water interface. Thermodynamic modeling demonstrates that precipitation of AuNPs is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity decrease in the dense liquid layer due to pyrite dissolution. These findings reveal a localized gold concentration mechanism to interpret adsorption and nucleation of AuNPs on pyrite during its dissolution–precipitation cycles, which significantly enhances our understanding of the highly effective gold scavenging from fluid by pyrite. The mechanism of nanoparticle formation in the dense liquid layer at dissolving mineral–fluid interfaces represents a fundamental process that could be common in nature.",

          "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which sustain lifelong blood cell production, emerge from hemogenic endothelium during embryonic development through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways. However, generating functional HSCs in vitro remains challenging, underscoring gaps in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, we identify GPR171, a P2Y-family G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), as a critical regulator of vertebrate embryonic HSC specification. Gpr171 is highly expressed in hemogenic endothelium and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. A deficiency in Gpr171 results in severe embryonic HSC deficits but does not impair vasculogenesis and primitive hematopoiesis. We further find that its endogenous ligand, coded by pcsk1nl , cooperates with Gpr171 to enhance HSC generation. Mechanistically, Gpr171 activates ERK1/2 and Notch signaling pathways independently and synergistically to promote HSC generation. Pharmacological treatment of zebrafish embryos with the human GPR171 ligand BigLEN significantly increases HSC numbers. Moreover, GPR171 signaling is evolutionarily conserved, as GPR171-deficient murine embryos also exhibit a significant reduction in functional HSCs. Overall, our findings reveal GPR171 as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of embryonic HSC specification and suggest its potential for translational applications in stem cell–based therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that spread by horizontal transfer and shape bacterial evolution. Plasmids are typically present at multiple copies per bacterial cell, and these extra copies increase the supply of plasmid mutations, potentially accelerating their evolution. However, the segregation of plasmid copies to daughter cells is random, introducing an additional layer of genetic drift, termed segregational drift, that might delay plasmid evolution. The interplay between plasmid mutational supply and segregational drift determines the evolutionary rate of plasmid-encoded genes, yet the relative contribution of these opposite forces in plasmid evolution remains unclear. Here, we develop a population genetics framework to predict the rate of plasmid mutations in bacterial populations and validate these predictions using computational, experimental, and bioinformatic approaches. Our findings show that plasmid mutation rates scale logarithmically with copy number and that the supply of new mutations consistently surpasses the impact of segregational drift across all copy numbers. These results underscore plasmids as powerful drivers of bacterial evolvability, where they can potentiate the evolution of critical traits such as antibiotic resistance.",

However, aging is also associated with diminished tissue oxygenation. Here, we report that erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) from aged mice exhibit reduced responsiveness to low oxygen tension (PO 2 ) and release O 2 slower than those from young mice. In vivo, sensory stimulation evoked a smaller and delayed capillary RBC flow in aged mice. Although activity-evoked PO 2 dips were diminished in aged mice; experimentally reducing PO 2 to comparable levels did not restore capillary flow in aged mice, consistent with diminished RBC O 2 responsiveness observed ex vivo. Notably, RBCs from aged mice in heterochronic parabiosis pairs (young-aged) displayed faster responses to low PO 2 compared to those from aged mice in isochronic pairs (aged-aged). Together, these findings across multiple levels of analysis demonstrate that aging impairs RBC responsiveness to O 2 and suggest that improved RBC-mediated O 2 delivery contributes to the rejuvenating effects of parabiosis.",

          "abstract": "Agile and efficient modern flyers like birds and insects rely on complex aerodynamics to increase performance such as leading edge vortices, tip vortices, rapid pitch rotations as well as wing–wake and wing–wing interactions. However, their evolutionary origins are poorly understood. Early birds and their closest relatives like Microraptor had a multiwinged configuration featuring long pennaceous feathers on their arms, legs, and tail, a configuration not seen today. The skill of these early flyers has been debated, centering around what was driving the evolution of this multiwing configuration and its loss in favor of the modern two-winged configuration. In this context, the aerodynamics and wing–wing interactions of Microraptor during gliding flight are investigated. The gliding flight mechanics of Microraptor exhibit flow patterns consistent with those observed and quantitatively assessed in volant living animal species. We analyze leading edge vortices on the forewing and hindwing including beneficial wake interactions between them as well as tip vortices on the distinct distally flared hindwing. The latter is unique in Microraptor as the hindwing’s characteristic outer span flare provides the necessary surface for the tip vortex to be bound to and thus contribute additional lift. These findings suggest that Microraptor evolved toward utilizing leading edge and tip vortices and their aerodynamic interactions. This implies that such utilization was also being exploited by other early multiwinged theropods to differing extents as part of a crucial milestone in early flight evolution.",

Protein folding has been one of the strongest constraints in sequence evolution. The method we propose compares the perturbations caused by local sequence variants to the energetics of the protein folding process and to the corresponding change to the apparent selection landscape of sequences over the evolutionary time scale. The difference between the physical folding free energies and the evolutionary free energies can be called a “dark energy.” We analyze various protein sets and thereby show that dark energy is largely localized at functional sites, which are also often energetically frustrated from the point of view of folding. Overall, we find that about 25% of the positions of the folded globular proteins display some significant dark energy. When a function relies on a free energy that can be thermodynamically quantified, such as the binding energy to a partner, the relationship of this physical free energy with dark energy can be used to define a functional selection temperature, just as there is a selection temperature for folding. We show that selection for folding and binding functions bear similar weights in specific protein–protein interactions.",

Ligands acting on its neurotransmitter binding site and on the channel domain of α7 have been extensively developed, yielding a wide range of orthosteric effectors and allosteric positive modulators. Here, we present the functional and structural characterization of two camelid antibody fragments, or nanobodies, F1 and E6, that inhibit α7 activity by acting as negative allosteric modulators, an underrepresented class of ligands. Cryo-EM structures of the nanobodies in complex with α7 show that both nanobodies form a pentameric bundle at the apex of the receptor, each nanobody interacting through a conserved set of residues at α7 subunit interfaces. Electrophysiological experiments suggest that E6 inhibits the activity of α7 by stabilizing its resting conformation, and that internanobodies interactions are key to its activity. Those two nanobodies expand the toolbox for human α7 modulation, opening new possibilities for its pharmacological control with far reaching potentialities in clinics.",

          "abstract": "There hardly is a fluid mechanics phenomenon attracting more attention than the impact of a droplet, due to its undeniable beauty, many applications, and the numerous challenges it poses. One of the crucial factors turns out to be the cushioning effect of the gas surrounding the droplet. This fact, together with the observation that almost all of the relevant literature was done in air, triggers the question what would happen when the liquid was a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid in thermal equilibrium with its own vapor, as is the case during transport of cryogenic liquids such as liquid hydrogen. To investigate precisely this question, we experimentally generate droplets in thermodynamical equilibrium with their own vapor, even before impact, such that minute energy exchanges of the droplet with its surroundings can trigger phase change. Using a frustrated total internal reflection setup, we make the exciting observation that depending on the impact speed and vapor conditions, the entrapment of vapor can be completely suppressed under boiling liquid conditions. We create a simplified model based on scaling arguments and perform numerical simulations considering both the compressible and condensable properties of the vapor layer that are in very good agreement with our experimental findings. Our results can be of great consequence to the pressures exerted during droplet impact and on an industrial scale may help better understand the loads experienced during sloshing wave impact inside cryogenic liquid containers.",

However, the action of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on the molecular behavior of F508del-CFTR is unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on individual human F508del-CFTR Cl − channels using the patch-clamp technique and cells heterologously expressing F508del-CFTR. Chronic treatment of F508del-CFTR-expressing cells with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, but not pairs of CFTR modulators, stabilized F508del-CFTR, preventing channel deactivation in cell-free membrane patches and conferring upon it the current amplitude of wild-type CFTR with channel activity sustained at a level one-third that of wild-type CFTR. By incubating cells with different drug concentrations, we demonstrated that elexacaftor stabilizes the open-channel conformation of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR, while acute treatment of wild-type CFTR with elexacaftor increased current flow through the channel and potentiated channel gating. Of note, acute treatment of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR Cl − channels with elexacaftor and ivacaftor restored wild-type levels of channel activity to the CFTR variant, albeit its gating pattern was distinct from that of wild-type CFTR and characterized by infrequent prolonged bursts of channel openings. In conclusion, chronic treatment with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor plus acute treatment with elexacaftor and ivacaftor robustly corrects the processing, stability, and gating defects of F508del-CFTR. Our results reveal that elexacaftor is a triple-acting CFTR modulator with corrector, potentiator, and conduction activities, making it a valuable therapeutic to rescue CFTR variants with distinct molecular mechanisms of CFTR dysfunction.",

In the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS, the regulatory protein InvE (SctW) enforces this order. Here, we show that InvE assembles into tetramers and higher-order oligomers and that oligomerization is essential for function. A 2.4 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals a tetramer built as a dimer of antiparallel dimers. Photocrosslinking maps one set of residues to the interdimer seams in this tetramer, while crosslinks from additional sites suggest lateral docking between dimers in alternative registries in vivo. Blue-native electrophoresis and SEC–MALS detect native high-molecular-weight species consistent with such assemblies. DNA-PAINT superresolution microscopy confirms the presence of higher-order InvE oligomers in vivo. Charge-reversal mutations that disrupt oligomerization collapse InvE to monomers and abolish secretion, effector translocation, invasion, and virulence. Together, these data define an oligomerization-based switch in which InvE reuses the dimeric face to form higher-order contacts that govern the transition from translocase to effector secretion.",

          "abstract": "Canopy shade environments can negatively impact plant growth and survival. Phytochrome A (phyA) is essential for seedling adaptation to deep shade, yet its role under moderate natural canopy conditions remains unclear. By expressing a phyA-nanoLUC reporter in Arabidopsis thaliana , we quantify diurnal fluctuations in phyA and its induction by low red to far-red (R:FR) ratio, simulating canopy shade. We uncover a key regulatory function for phyB, which increases phyA stability postdawn in unshaded conditions and modulates expression of PHYA in low R:FR. Further, we demonstrate that beyond its role as a deep shade sensor, phyA is an adept sensor of canopy shade, capable of detecting a range of R:FR ratios across light intensities. Mathematical modeling demonstrates that this property arises from the dynamic features of the phyA High Irradiance Response (HIR) mode of action. Interestingly, phyA synthesis is strongly induced by subtle reductions in R:FR ratio, and is robust to light perturbation, suggesting the phyA-sensory module is configured to detect modest shade. Spectral data from natural shade habitats provide ecological context for our laboratory findings. Physiological analysis indicates that under canopy shade phyA promotes seedling de-etiolation, organizes resource management, and accelerates reproductive development. We propose that this suite of responses, termed the “canopy adaptation strategy,” enhances survival chances under conditions where shade avoidance strategies are maladaptive.",

Here, we investigated the flow of working memory information across the cortex using time-resolved fMRI decoding. Across multiple regions in visual and parietal cortex, we found that decoded working memory content drifted over time from the memoranda toward the later errors in memory reports, consistent with the dynamics of memory drift predicted by attractor models. These behaviorally predictive neural memory errors emerged earliest in higher-order dorsal visual area (V3AB) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS0) and then later in early visual cortex (V1), suggesting a propagation of mnemonic information originated in higher-level visual area. Interareal correlation analyses revealed that during memory maintenance, information flowed predominantly in a top–down manner—from higher to lower visual areas, whereas during passive viewing, feedforward dynamics prevailed. Together, our findings demonstrate that working memory maintenance involves temporally structured drift dynamics and feedback-dominated information flow across the cortical hierarchy, providing a mechanistic link between neural population dynamics and the formation of memory errors.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive changes in organ size and function occur in most animals, but how these changes are regulated is not well understood. Previous research found that mating in Drosophila females promotes intestinal stem cell proliferation and increases the overall size of the endodermal portion of the intestine (the “midgut”). Other studies reported mating-dependent changes in feeding behavior, midgut gene expression, and whole-body lipid storage, suggesting altered metabolism. Here, we show that mating dramatically alters female midgut metabolism and digestive function. Mating increased relative levels of TCA cycle intermediates, fatty acids, and ceramides in the gut, increased total midgut lipids and protein, and reduced relative carbohydrate levels. Mating also enhanced the efficiency of protein digestion relative to carbohydrate digestion. Corroborating a previous report [M. A. White, A. Bonfini, M. F. Wolfner, N. Buchon, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118 , e2018112118 (2021)], we found that the expression of genes that mediate protein and carbohydrate and metabolism was similarly altered. In addition, we noted a mating-dependent downregulation of oxidative stress response and autophagy genes. Mating-dependent increases in ecdysone receptor (EcR) signaling were important for increasing TCA cycle intermediates, protein, and ceramides in the female midgut, but had minimal effects on bulk lipid accumulation.

Human topoisomerase IIIα is a Type 1A topoisomerase that exists as a complex with RMI1 and RMI2, known as TRR. The TRR complex can unlink entwined DNA strands and is known to be important for resolving DNA replication and recombination intermediates. It has recently been proposed that TRR can also relax transient negatively supercoiled loops of DNA generated by the translocase PICH and that this activity may help to facilitate the resolution of ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs) between segregating sister chromatids. However, the mechanism by which TRR interacts with, and processes, negatively supercoiled DNA is not well understood. Here, we establish a single-molecule strategy to simultaneously measure real-time changes in supercoiling density and visualize the interactions of TRR with underwound DNA using a combination of optical tweezers and fluorescence imaging. We demonstrate that TRR relaxes highly negatively supercoiled DNA in a processive manner and that the timescale for relaxation is less than the expected lifetime of the negatively supercoiled loops generated by PICH. We also show that in the absence of free protein in solution, TRR remains bound to the DNA for long time periods after the torsional stress has been released. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for how TRR can relax negative supercoils, consistent with its proposed role in UFB resolution. Moreover, our assay could also be widely applied to study the interactions of other families of topoisomerases with negatively supercoiled DNA.",

In humans, IAPP forms a toxic oligomer with a parallel β-sheet across residues 23 FGAIL 28 S. Using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, we monitor the structure of IAPP from seven different mammals, five of which are from species that can develop type 2 diabetes (ferret, raccoon, cat, baboon, and human) and three from those that do not (hamster, rat, and pig). G24 is isotope labeled to monitor for the presence of the oligomeric β-sheet previously found in human IAPP. For the species that develop type 2 diabetes, their IAPP is cytotoxic, and a β-sheet at G24 is observed during the lag phase prior to fibril formation. In contrast, the species that do not develop type 2 diabetes have nontoxic IAPP, and their IAPP does not form this β-sheet structure. Pig IAPP forms oligomers, but with a different structure that is nontoxic. Thus, an oligomer with a parallel β-sheet at G24 that resembles that of the known human IAPP oligomer correlates with cytotoxicity and propensity for type 2 diabetes. These results indicate that the sequence within the 20 to 29 region of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), long known to correlate with type 2 diabetes in mammals, determines the structure and toxicity of an oligomer, supporting the oligomer hypothesis for type 2 diabetes and providing an explanation other than plaque formation for why some mammals develop insulin deficiency in late-stage type 2 diabetes, and others do not.",

We identified focal RAD54B amplifications in 15 tumors (18.8%), leading to elevated RAD54B expression and significantly shorter survival. This establishes RAD54B as an oncogenic driver in ESS. Known tumor suppressors (PTEN, TP53) were frequently mutated in HG-ESS but rare in LG-ESS, highlighting distinct grade-specific drivers of malignancy. HG-ESS exhibited widespread chromosomal gains, frequent loss of cell-cycle regulators (RB1, CDKN2A), and numerous private gene fusions arising from complex DNA rearrangements. In contrast, LG-ESS were defined by canonical fusions (e.g., JAZF1–SUZ12 ) and co-occurring deletions in metabolic regulator genes (TSC2, STK11). Finally, in an activating NRAS-mutant (p.Q61R) HG-ESS xenograft, the combination of MEK and FAK inhibition dramatically suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival, highlighting a promising targeted treatment strategy. Overall, our comprehensive analysis defines the molecular basis of ESS and provides a strong preclinical rationale for precision therapies in this aggressive cancer.",

          "abstract": "Paleoclimates provide examples of past climate change that inform estimates of modern warming from greenhouse-gas emissions, known as Earth’s climate sensitivity. However, differences between past and present climate change must be accounted for when inferring climate sensitivity from paleoclimate evidence. The closest paleoclimate analog to near-term warming from greenhouse-gas emissions is the Pliocene (5.3 to 2.6 Ma), a warm epoch with atmospheric CO 2 concentrations similar to today. Recent reconstructions indicate the Pliocene was 1 °C warmer than previously thought, implying higher climate sensitivity, which is also supported by recent reconstructions showing more cooling with reduced CO 2 at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 19 to 23 thousand years ago). However, large-scale patterns of paleoclimate temperature change differ strongly from modern projections. Climate feedbacks and sensitivity depend on temperature patterns, and such “pattern effects” must be accounted for when using paleoclimates to constrain modern climate sensitivity. Here we combine data-assimilation reconstructions with atmospheric general circulation models to show Earth’s climate is more sensitive to Pliocene forcing than modern CO 2 forcing. Pliocene ice sheets, topography, and vegetation alter patterns of ocean warming and excite destabilizing cloud feedbacks, and LGM feedbacks are similarly amplified by the North American ice sheets. Accounting for paleoclimate pattern effects produces a best estimate (median) for modern climate sensitivity of 2.8 °C and 66% CI of 2.4 to 3.4 °C (90% CI: 2.1 to 4.0 °C), substantially reducing uncertainty in projections of 21st-century warming.",

          "abstract": "Functional neural circuits are sculpted by strengthening frequently used synapses and removing unnecessary connections. At birth, cerebellar Purkinje cells receive inputs with similar synaptic strengths from multiple climbing fibers (CFs). During postnatal development, a single “winner” CF is selectively strengthened and expands its dendritic innervation territory, while somatic “loser” synapses are eliminated. Here, we report that deleting metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) or protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ) in mice disrupts this selective strengthening and territory expansion of “winner” CFs during early development. This impairment leads to weaker synaptic transmission and diminished dendritic innervation territory of “winner” CFs at later stages. Notably, “winner” CF synapses in these mutants exhibit impaired long-term potentiation, reduced AMPA receptor expression, and simpler postsynaptic organizations. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for mGluR1–PKCγ signaling, besides its established role in eliminating “loser” CFs, in promoting the functional and structural maturation of “winner” CF synapses.",

Here, we show that time evolution responds strongly to details of the dynamics by changing the speed of time flow: It has time-reparameterization softness. This finding reconciles both views: While local constraints reparameterize the flow of time, the global landscape determines relationships between different correlations at the same times. We show that modern algorithms developed to accelerate the relaxation to equilibrium act by changing the time reparameterization. Their success thus relies on their ability to exploit reparameterization softness. We conjecture that these results extend beyond the realm of glasses to the optimization of more general constraint satisfaction problems and to broader classes of algorithms.",

Today, US academic researchers are again “beset by flagging morale, diminishing expectations, and constricting horizons.” According to data from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the share of US basic and applied research funded by the federal government dropped from nearly 48% in 2009 to just over 34% in 2023. As that decline is likely to continue, some state governments are responding by boosting their research spending.

PITTs remained anchored to leukocytes or endothelial cells, whereas the partially αIIbβ3-deficient platelet body detached. Although still responsive to stimuli, αIIbβ3-deficient platelets did not support thrombus formation. PITTs promoted leukocyte activation and vascular inflammation in mouse models of infection and endotoxemia, and αIIbβ3 blockade reduced immune-mediated tissue damage. In patients with sepsis, COVID-19, or severe infections, PITT formation and platelet αIIbβ3 loss correlated with disease severity and adverse outcomes.

We tested this methodology on open-source data from the 2024 reentry of Shenzhou-15, deriving a location significantly south of the predicted track.

However, existing methods to construct these scaffolds are limited, often relying on arene saturation or annulations that require lengthy de novo syntheses. Herein, we describe a unified and highly modular couple-close strategy for the synthesis of semisaturated scaffolds. This approach installs bifunctional linkers onto aromatic rings through a range of bond-forming reactions, and subsequent cyclization furnishes semisaturated bicyclic adducts. Key to this approach is a mechanistically distinct cobalt-catalyzed dehydrogenative radical cyclization that proceeds efficiently even on electronically unbiased arenes, enabling a broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions.",

This loop comprises the determinacy-promoting pioneer transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) and the indeterminacy-promoting transcriptional co-repressor TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1). At the transition to the flower-producing reproductive phase, LFY directly and quantitatively up-regulates expression of TFL1 . TFL1 in turn negatively feeds back on LFY to prevent LFY overaccumulation. This blocks inflorescence termination even under strong florally inductive signals.

          "abstract": "Bose-Fermi mixtures can be realized in semiconductor heterostructures, with bosons as excitons and fermions as dopant charges. However, the complexity of these hybrid systems challenges understanding of the mechanisms that determine properties such as mobility. We investigated interlayer exciton diffusion in tungsten diselenide–tungsten disulfide heterobilayers at ultralow exciton density and low temperatures to examine how charges affect exciton mobility. Near the electronic Mott insulator phase, we observed a giant thousand-fold enhancement of exciton diffusion relative to charge neutrality. We attribute this to mobile valence holes, which experienced a suppressed moiré potential due to charge order and recombined nonmonogamously with conduction electrons. Our results show exciton diffusion as a probe of correlated electron states and Bose-Fermi interplay.",

          "abstract": "The Main Marmara fault (MMF) in northwestern Türkiye poses the highest seismic risk in broader Europe. The 2025 moment magnitude ( M W ) 6.2 event was the largest earthquake along the MMF in &gt;60 years. We integrated observations from multiple temporal scales including the decade-long evolution of M &gt; 5 earthquakes, their rupture dynamics, and aftershock patterns. We show a series of eastward-propagating M &gt; 5 events and a gradual eastward partial rupture of the MMF over the past ~15 years. The seismically active portion of the fault includes creeping and transitional segments with some of the most recent seismicity located near the presumably locked Princes’ Islands segment south of Istanbul that has the potential to generate a M ~7 earthquake. Our analysis highlights the necessity of real-time monitoring of this part of the MMF.",

Such collisions are rarely observed, but their debris can appear in direct imaging. We report Hubble Space Telescope observations that show the appearance in 2023 of a second point source around Fomalhaut, resembling the appearance of Fomalhaut b 20 years earlier. We interpret this additional source as a dust cloud produced by a recent impact between two planetesimals. The positions and motion of two impact-generated dust clouds over 20 years provide constraints on the collisional dynamics in the debris belt.",

For thermoelectric devices, researchers principally focused on chemical reactivity and mechanical properties of material components, whereas precise control of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) remains elusive. Here, we propose an innovative strategy using negative-thermal-expansion (NTE) particles to regulate CTE and resolve interfacial incompatibility. Incorporating predesigned interface reaction–free NTE particles into Bi 2 Te 3 -based, Mg 3 Sb 2 -based, and PbTe-based materials effectively improves thermoelectric performance, alleviates thermal stress, and enhances interfacial stability across a broad temperature range (300 to 800 kelvin). Notably, the NTE-modified Mg 3 (Sb,Bi) 2 /Bi 0.4 Sb 1.6 Te 3 two-pair module achieves a record-high conversion efficiency (η) of 8.4% at Δ T  = 350 K with a 71% interfacial thermal stress reduction, maintaining a stable interface and unchanged η throughout 1000-hour (42 days) thermal cycling. Our strategy establishes a universal approach for improving interfacial compatibility in high-temperature functional modules including thermal-barrier coatings and solar thermophotovoltaic devices.",

          "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) transcribes and replicates its segmented RNA genome in the host nucleus within viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), which are exported for virion assembly. The nuclear export protein (NEP) is essential for this process and also regulates viral RNA synthesis, implicating a direct interaction with the viral RNA polymerase. Here, we present a 2.5-Å cryogenic electron microscopy structure of NEP bound to the IAV polymerase and demonstrate that NEP alone is sufficient to promote vRNP export, with the viral matrix protein 1 enhancing export efficiency. NEP forms a four-helix bundle that binds at the interface of the PA C-terminal domain and PB1 N terminus of the polymerase. The NEP binding site at this interface overlaps with those for the host ANP32 and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, indicating that it functions as a regulatory hotspot coordinating transitions of the viral polymerase between RNA synthesis and nuclear export, revealing a critical layer of control in the IAV replication cycle.",

          "abstract": "Randomness certification is a foundational and practical aspect of quantum information science, essential for securing quantum communication protocols. Traditionally, these protocols have been implemented and validated with a single entanglement source, as in the paradigmatic Bell scenario. However, advancing these protocols to support more complex configurations involving multiple entanglement sources is key to building robust architectures and realizing large-scale quantum networks. Here, we show how to certify randomness in an entanglement-teleportation experiment, the building block of a quantum repeater displaying two independent sources of entanglement. Using the scalar extension method, we address the challenge posed by the nonconvexity of the correlation set, providing effective bounds on an eavesdropper’s knowledge of the shared secret bits. Our theoretical model characterizes the certifiable randomness within the network and is validated through the analysis of experimental data from a photonic quantum network.",

          "abstract": "Steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, such as dexamethasone, are routinely used to manage brain tumor–associated edema, yet their impact on brain tumor metabolism remains understudied. Here, a metabolomic screen in naïve glioblastoma cells treated with dexamethasone revealed the accumulation of N 1 -methylnicotinamide, a nicotinamide N -methyltransferase (NNMT) product, through glucocorticoid receptor activation. Using stable isotope-assisted metabolomics in patients with glioblastoma, we showed that nicotinamide conversion into N 1 -methylnicotinamide exceeds that into NAD + , leading to a ~7-fold accumulation of N 1 -methylnicotinamide in tumor compared to surrounding brain tissue. In orthotopic models, NNMT activity was enhanced by dexamethasone selectively in glioblastoma tumors but not in contralateral brain. Leveraging the tumor-specific activity of NNMT, we developed a novel 11 C-nicotinamide–based positron emission tomography (PET) approach to visualizing glioblastoma tumors. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the dexamethasone-induced methionine-dependent nicotinamide methylation becomes detrimental for glioblastoma when combined with a methionine-restricted diet. These results show that steroids rewire methionine and nicotinamide metabolism, enabling the development of innovative PET imaging and metabolic therapies for glioblastoma.",

          "abstract": "Residential wood combustion (RWC) is a primary heating fuel in just 2% of US homes. However, the 2023 release of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emissions Inventory (NEI) found that RWC contributes ~28% of total wintertime fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) emissions, suggesting that ambient PM 2.5 concentrations could be substantially reduced if RWC were curtailed. Despite its contribution to PM 2.5 emissions, an assessment of the air quality, health, and distributional impacts of RWC using the updated NEI has not been performed. Here, we use a high-resolution (4 kilometers) air quality model and the updated NEI to evaluate wintertime RWC impacts over the contiguous United States. We find that RWC contributes 2.43 micrograms per cubic meter (21.9%) of winter population-weighted mean PM 2.5 concentrations, leading to ~8600 (confidence interval: 6500 to 9600) premature deaths annually. Moreover, nonwhite communities are disproportionately affected by RWC-related PM 2.5 and associated mortality, especially in urban areas. We suggest that policies targeting RWC could substantially reduce air pollution, improve health, and address distributional disparities.",

Here, we present MAcro Plant Projection Imaging (MAPPI), an open-source, low-cost, and modular fluorescence imaging platform for soil-grown plants beyond the model organism or seedling stage. MAPPI enables wide field-of-view, dual-projection imaging of fluorescent reporters, supporting real-time visualization of systemic signals under near-physiological conditions. We validate MAPPI by tracking calcium and l -glutamate dynamics in adult Nicotiana benthamiana plants, revealing developmentally regulated long-distance calcium waves triggered by wounding, burning, or submergence, including bidirectional shoot-to-root and root-to-shoot signaling. By democratizing access to whole-plant functional imaging, MAPPI provides a scalable tool for dissecting signal propagation, stress adaptation, and systemic communication in both model and nonmodel species.",

Here, selective expression of CD318 on a subset of activated human CD8 + T cells, but not CD4 + T cells, is shown, defining suppressor function of this cell population. CD318 + CD8 T cells exhibited reduced PD-1 and KLRG-1 expression, diminished interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor–α production, and potent suppression of autologous CD4 and CD8 T cell activation in vitro.

The ubiquitous trans-translation system and several alternative rescue factors rescue the stalled ribosomes caused by truncated mRNAs lacking the stop codons. On the other hand, protein release factor homolog (PrfH) is the only known factor to rescue the stalled ribosome damaged by ribotoxins. Here, we show that a subfamily of PrfH, exemplified by PrfH from Capnocytophaga gingivalis ( Cg PrfH), rescues both types of stalled ribosomes. Biochemical assays demonstrate that Cg PrfH hydrolyzes the peptides attached to P-site transfer RNAs when in complex with both the damaged and intact ribosomes. Cryo-EM structures revealed that Cg PrfH uses distinct regions to recognize two stalled ribosomes to orient the GGQ motif for peptide hydrolysis. Thus, using a combination of bioinformatic, biochemical, and structural characterization, we have uncovered a family of ribosome rescue factors that have dual activities to resolve two distinct stalled protein translation events in bacteria.",

Using paleographically constrained global mantle convection models, we reproduce the present-day location of the Hawaiian hot spot and the associated spatiotemporal geochemical evolution. The composition of the plume conduit shows conventional concentric zoning prior to the Hawaiian-Emperor Bend and gradually evolves to a north-south bilateral zoning pattern afterward, corresponding to the subparallel Loa-Kea trends. Further analysis suggests that the plume originates from ridges of large low-velocity province (LLVP) induced by the push of slabs. Upwelling at the intersections of ridges is more energetic than at the middle of the ridge, causing bottom-up splitting of plume conduit in the lower mantle that propagates upward, forming bilateral zoning and eventually two independent plumes. This process suggests that bilateral zoning is transient and more common in the Pacific than Africa due to the circum-Pacific subduction.",

These immune systems are easily gained and lost, allowing adaptation to threats. However, the mechanism of mobilization of chromosomally encoded defense genes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that phage- and phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI)–mediated lateral transduction (LT), a highly efficient horizontal gene transfer mechanism, facilitates the transfer of these defense genes between bacteria. Using several bacterial models, we demonstrate that defense systems are often positioned near phage or PICI attachment sites, allowing them to exploit LT for their mobility. In addition, LT diversifies defense genes carried by prophages and PICIs, driving immune system evolution and turnover. These processes provide phage resistance to new bacterial hosts and profoundly affect population genomics. Our findings reveal LT as a crucial mechanism shaping bacterial evolution and influencing the trajectory of pathogenic clones in nature.",

To dissect its tissue-specific functions, we generated a humanized floxed Gpr75 mouse model with conditional deletions in the brain and adipose tissue. Mice with brain-specific Gpr75 deletion using Nestin-Cre were resistant to diet-induced obesity, primarily through suppressed food intake and modest increases in energy expenditure. In contrast, adipocyte-specific deletion of Gpr75 had minimal effects on systemic metabolism but modestly enhanced mitochondrial oxygen consumption in brown adipose tissue under cold exposure. Gpr75 expression was up-regulated in key brain regions and down-regulated in white adipose tissue under high-fat diet conditions, supporting a predominant central role in metabolic adaptation. Histological and transcriptomic analyses further revealed depot-specific effects on adipocyte morphology and hepatic lipid accumulation in global knockouts. These findings position GPR75 as a critical regulator of central energy balance and provide a mechanistic framework for developing brain-targeted therapies against obesity.",

However, the increasing severity of fungicide resistance necessitates urgent clarification of its evolutionary mechanisms to optimize disease management and delay resistance development. The DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs)–mediated base editing in oomycetes confirmed that the PsCytb S33L mutation is sufficient to confer ametoctradin resistance in Phytophthora sojae . We clarified that low-resistant and medium-resistant mutants serve as transitional populations during the resistance evolution process, with high-resistant mutants eventually becoming the dominant population. We revealed the dynamic changes in mitochondrial heterogeneity under fungicide selection, proving that the gradual increase of mutated mitochondria drives resistance evolution. There is a trade-off between ametoctradin resistance and fitness. While the PsCytb S33L mutation confers this resistance, it impairs mitochondrial function and thereby reduces fitness. Up-regulation of TFAM1 , however, can partially offset this fitness cost. Resistance evolution in plant pathogens involves not only standing variation but also de novo mutations, providing unique insights into the “chicken-and-egg” dilemma.",

However, the impact of disrupting antiferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1 /Aifm2 ) is critically required for regulatory T cell (T reg cell) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4 and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or T reg cells specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting T reg cell immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses. These results reveal an opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells but also simultaneously enhance anticancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity.",

Here, we demonstrate that RSV orchestrates the temporal and sequential regulation of distinct PCD pathways in human macrophages to optimize replication and dissemination. During early stages of infection, RSV activates the PI3K-Akt pathway to induce cFLIP expression, effectively suppressing TNF-driven extrinsic apoptosis. Simultaneously, viral degradation of ZDHHC9 prevents GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis downstream of NLRP3 activation, thereby sustaining an intracellular environment permissive to viral propagation. In contrast, following the completion of replication, RSV subverts caspase-1 signaling to trigger the intrinsic apoptotic cascade via the Casp-1–BID–APAF1–Casp-9 axis, and subsequently promotes GSDME-mediated secondary pyroptosis. This late-stage PCD reprogramming enables synchronized release of virions and pro-inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating pulmonary pathology. These findings delineate a temporally resolved strategy by which RSV balances early immune evasion with subsequent viral dissemination and immunopathology, and identify discrete stage-specific molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in RSV-induced lung disease.",

Studying these diseases in human retinas has been hindered by the rapid loss of neuronal activity after death. While some CNS activity has been restored postmortem, synchronized neuronal transmission beyond 30 min has remained elusive. We overcome this barrier by reviving and sustaining light signal transmission in human retinas recovered up to 4 hours after death and stored for up to 48 hours. We also introduce infrared-based ex vivo imaging for precise sampling, a closed perfusion system for drug testing, and an ex vivo ischemia-reperfusion model in mouse and human retina. This platform enables testing of neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of drugs targeting oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity. Our advances question the irreversibility of ischemic injury, support preclinical studies in vision restoration, offer insights into treating CNS ischemia, and pave the way for human donor eye transplantation.",

          "abstract": "Evasion of programmed cell death is a critical hallmark of cancer. However, the contribution of inflammatory forms of cell death in lung carcinogenesis and their effects on the composition of the tumor-immune microenvironment remain unclear. Our multi-omics analyses of samples from patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma revealed that necrosome signaling is repressed because of reduced expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 ( RIPK3 ). Distinct methylation signatures, both in the RIPK3 promoter and nonpromoter regions, correlated with lower transcription levels of RIPK3 . This resulted in limited expression of inflammatory genes, advanced histologic features, reduced immune cell invasion, and decreased patient survival. Mechanistically, we confirmed the tumor-suppressive role of necrosome signaling through the genetic deletion of Ripk3 in two independent, clinically relevant mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. Functionally, RIPK3 shaped a diverse immune environment by promoting the invasion of innate and adaptive immune cells in patient samples and experimental mice. Thus, RIPK3-mediated inflammatory signaling enhances a diverse immune microenvironment and hinders progression in lung adenocarcinoma.",

Two-dimensional (2D) material-based membrane technology provides an energy-efficient approach; however, the existing 2D lamellar membranes and nanoporous membranes struggle with low permeability and complex preparation procedures. Here, we constructed 2D lamellar nanosheet membranes with intrinsic size-sieving nanopores by assembling nanoporous polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) nanosheets into a lamellar membrane. These membranes exhibit high selectivity and permeance and ease of preparation. By applying MXene as the strong interaction patch for covering and repairing defects on PCN nanosheets, the resultant membranes demonstrated an ultrahigh H 2 permeance of 870 to 8046 GPU, considerable selectivity, and superior long-term stability, outperforming most current state-of-the-art membranes. Economic analysis revealed that MXene/PCN membranes achieved ultralow energy consumption and minimal membrane area demands for practical applications. This study inspires the construction of 2D lamellar membranes with intrinsic nanopores and provides a simple and scalable approach to preparing high-performance 2D nanosheet membranes for hydrogen separation.",

COBRA models analyze steady-state fluxes using linear constraints but lack kinetic detail. Kinetic models offer mechanistic descriptions via differential equations but require (often unknown) kinetic parameters and enzyme concentrations. To bridge this gap, we introduce COBRA-k, a framework integrating nonlinear kinetic rate laws into COBRA models to consistently constrain metabolic fluxes, enzyme abundances, and metabolite concentrations. COBRA-k enables flexible exploration of metabolic steady states with optimization techniques, even with incomplete parametrization. COBRA-k models require solving computationally demanding mixed-integer nonlinear programs. We therefore developed a dedicated iterative algorithm, implemented in an open-source Python package. We applied COBRA-k to a large-scale Escherichia coli model, demonstrating its effectiveness and revealing holistic metabolic insights. For example, it accurately predicts and explains the phenomenon of high intracellular glutamate concentration. COBRA-k combines the flexibility of COBRA with kinetic precision, offering a powerful tool for predictive metabolic modeling and engineering.",

Here, a capacitively coupled electrode with an adaptable coupling layer is developed for noninvasive, month-long electrophysiological monitoring on diverse plants. The adaptable coupling layer is formed by in situ sol-gel transition, followed by dehydration of thermoresponsive hydrogel on plants, achieving high conformability to complex surfaces and stable electrical coupling. For 1 month on trichome-covered plant surfaces, the electrode maintains a high signal-to-noise ratio comparable to a gold-standard noninvasive electrode, which typically lasts a few hours. Long-term monitoring reveals drought-specific signal features that correlate with plant water status.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a piezoelectric surface acoustic wave (SAW) memristor that integrates an Ag/SiO 2 /Au memristor with an acoustoelectric phase shifter. Operating at shorter wavelengths than EM waves, it offers a compact footprint and encodes tunable neural network parameters via nonvolatile programmability and the acoustoelectric effect. A proof-of-concept SAW memristor neural network was experimentally demonstrated on a vector classification task, achieving 91.7% accuracy on par with software while reducing footprint by 10 5 times versus EM systems and energy consumption by 37 times versus digital systems.

Oncogenic EGFR mutants are ligand-independent and more stable, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that EGFR mutants selectively leverage cellular stabilizers to evade degradation. Genome-wide RNA interference screens identified genes (encoding for stabilizers) responsible for mutant EGFR stability, with P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2) emerging as a bona fide stabilizer. Mechanistically, high extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels transactivate EGFR mutants via P2Y2 activation, previously shown to signal through Src kinase–dependent EGFR phosphorylation. Our study reveals that ATP-driven P2Y2 activation stabilizes EGFR mutants by forming a P2Y2-integrin β1-EGFR complex enriched in endosomes. Targeting this axis destabilizes EGFR mutants and offers a strategy against drug resistance. Elevated P2Y2 and integrin β1 expression in patients with NSCLC implies clinical relevance. Our results provide previously unidentified insight that EGFR mutants enhance extracellular ATP levels to activate P2Y2-integrin for enhanced stability of EGFR mutants to drive the oncogenic program.",

Here, we used maps of DSBs identified through sBLISS (in-suspension break labeling in situ and sequencing) with transcription stress markers to delineate the transcription stress landscape in cancer. We found that transcription stress sites are shaped by the superenhancer regulatory landscape. Notably, γH2AX is enriched at transcription stress sites; however, not all DSB-enriched genes show similar γH2AX marking. Instead, genes with DSBs tied to transcription stress are distinctly marked. Genes with high DSBs marked by γH2AX exhibited substantially higher DSB turnover and repair than those with low γH2AX, and are associated with vulnerability to mutagenesis. These findings underscore superenhancer activity as a determinant of the transcription stress landscape in cancer, posing a threat to the genomic stability of oncogenes.",

This evidence is limited to indirect inferences based on shared cultural traits, “art” styles, and symbolic items, while lithic raw material movements are mostly local and regional, with few cases exceeding 300 kilometers. We provide geochemical evidence for the largest confirmed distance between the source and discard location of a knapped lithic object in Palaeolithic Europe. Solutrean artifacts discarded at Peña Capón, Central Iberia, were sourced in Southwest France, 600 to 700 kilometers away. This demonstrates social networks of unprecedented geographic scale maintained during ∼1400 years during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Although TCR-T cells were more sensitive at detecting low-density pHLA, TCR-T cells exerted only transient in vivo antitumor efficacy followed by tumor relapse due to deficient TCR-T cell proliferation and persistence that was associated with a more differentiated and dysfunctional phenotype.

An additional challenge of real-world vision is that it is dynamic, causing the appearance of objects (e.g., their size and orientation) to change as we move. Notably, however, these changes are predictable from the three-dimensional structure of the surrounding scene. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, we find that the visual cortex dynamically updates object representations using this predictive contextual information. First, visual cortical representations of objects were enhanced when they rotated congruently (versus incongruently) with the surrounding scene. Second, the inferred orientation of the object could be decoded from visual cortex activity even when the object was fully occluded. These findings indicate that predictive processes in the visual cortex follow the geometric structure of the environment, providing a mechanism to support object perception in dynamic natural vision.",

Here, we studied primary patient tumors and cell line models to identify molecular drivers of this hybrid state. Our data reveal that hybrid EwS cells are induced and maintained by a transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling positive feedback loop. Hybrid cells derepress TGFBR2 and up-regulate expression and secretion of TGFβ2 to sustain pathway activation and ECM deposition. Although TGFβ ligands can potently induce growth arrest in cells of epithelial origin, we show that TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 promote cell invasion of EwS cells without affecting proliferation.

We use ocean redox, iron isotope (δ 56 Fe), and phosphorus phase partitioning records from shelf and deep-ocean settings to evaluate the drivers behind this major reshaping of the pelagic marine ecosystem. A marked decrease in mesopelagic graptolites coincided with a stepwise negative δ 56 Fe shift on the shelf, driven by partial seawater Fe drawdown resulting from episodic intensification of mid-depth euxinia. Subsequently, a positive δ 56 Fe shift in both deep-ocean and shelf sediments reflects extensive seawater Fe removal during the development of more widespread euxinia. This led to enhanced sedimentary phosphorus recycling from sediments, which ultimately fueled the radiation of epipelagic graptolites. Thus, wide-scale changes in Fe cycling, linking the global oceanic redox state to phosphorus cycling, were ultimately responsible for the initial demise and subsequent radiation of select graptolite species.",

          "abstract": "Mycobacterial granulomas lie at the center of tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis and represent a unique niche where infecting bacteria survive under nutrient-restricted conditions and in the face of a host immune response. The granuloma’s necrotic core, where bacteria reside extracellularly in humans, is difficult to assess in many experimentally tractable models. Here, using necrotic mycobacterial granulomas in adult zebrafish, we develop dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) across different host genotypes to identify the transcriptional alterations that enable bacteria to survive within this key microenvironment. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we find that neutrophils within mature, necrotic granulomas promote bacterial growth, in part through up-regulation of the bacterial devR regulon. We identify conserved suites of bacterial transcriptional programs induced only in the context of this unique necrotic extracellular niche, including bacterial modules related to K + transport and rpf genes. Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains across diverse lineages and human populations suggests that granuloma-specific transcriptional modules are targets for bacterial genetic adaptation in the context of human infection.",

          "abstract": "Nanowires have served as a transformative platform for advanced neural and tissue interfaces. While their photovoltaic properties hold exceptional promise for neural modulation, existing photostimulation approaches predominantly rely on visible light–activated photoelectrochemical mechanisms. Here, we present a solution-processed photovoltaic nanoassembly comprising a ZnO nanowire array sensitized with AgBiS 2 nanocrystals that enables efficient near-infrared (NIR) neural stimulation through capacitive photocurrents. By optimizing nanowire morphology and nanocrystal interdigitation, the platform achieves high charge injection densities (tens of microcoulombs per square centimeter) at low NIR intensities (&lt;1 milliwatt per square millimeter). The nanoassembly was subretinally placed in an ex vivo blind rat retina, where it elicited repeatable and robust responses in retinal ganglion cells under NIR pulses. Notably, these responses were achieved at light intensities substantially below established ocular safety limits. The nexus of neuronal systems and nanoassemblies offers potential for enabling unconventional visual prosthetics and advanced neuromodulation therapies.",

          "authors": "Ashika Capirala, Stephanie L. Olson",
          "abstract": "Marine habitability for complex life on Earth and Earth-like planets requires bioavailable nutrients and dissolved oxygen. The cycling of nutrients and oxygen is controlled by physical ocean circulation. However, our understanding of how circulation has varied through time and space is incomplete for Earth and unconstrained for Earth-like exoplanets. Earth’s rotation has slowed over time, affecting ocean circulation by modifying the Coriolis effect. We use a three-dimensional Earth system model to explore how slowing planetary rotation influences ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. We show that slower rotation enhances wind-driven upwelling and global circulation. Nutrient recycling is consequently more efficient, increasing photosynthetic productivity. Additionally, enhanced ocean oxygenation improves habitability for aerobic life under a well-oxygenated atmosphere. However, under a poorly oxygenated atmosphere, slowing rotation increases oxygen fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere. Therefore, Earth’s rotational history may have been a long-term background control on surface oxygenation and the evolution of animals.",

          "abstract": "DNA nanotechnology has created nanostructures with astonishing complexity. However, with nanostructures becoming increasingly larger and more intricate, they have become more difficult to obtain in high yields and quality. Expanding the alphabet beyond the canonical base pairs can therefore be the key to push the technology to the next level. Here, we describe examples of DNA nanostructures built from an “anthropogenic evolvable genetic information system (AEGIS).” Because AEGIS uses the same backbone as DNA, the existing rules for designing DNA nanostructures can be readily applied to AEGIS nanostructures, which also show greater stability, both thermal and enzymatic, greater control over autonomous assembly, and good phase separation. AEGIS can have as many as 12 different units and six different pairs with Watson-Crick-Franklin geometry. Thus, if further developed, then these nanostructures may represent a previously unexplored frontier in DNA nanoscience and nanotechnology, expanding the space of “soft” biomaterial design.",
