          "authors": "Amanda Hollis-Brusky",
          "abstract": "Donald Trump and Trumpism have transformed the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, two institutions at the heart of the conservative legal movement. In this article, I use the conservative philosophy of fusionism as a lens for understanding the causes and consequences of the transformation. The original fusionism of William F. Buckley and Frank S. Meyer brought disparate factions of conservatives together under the mantle of libertarian means to conservative ends. Here, I show that Trump and Trumpism have transmogrified that original concept into a “new fusionism” of authoritarian means to Christian nationalist ends . I investigate the extent to which this “new fusionism” has been embraced or endorsed by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society and what the consequences might be for the respectability and efficacy of the conservative legal movement after Trump.",

          "abstract": "I examine the tension between Donald Trump’s perception of the judiciary—marked by a form of legal realism—and the Supreme Court’s stated commitment to judicial bipartisanship and independence. I analyze Trump’s public criticisms of judicial rulings that counter his personal interests and his criticism of his own appointees and other Republican-appointed justices who do not always rule in his favor to highlight how the court’s claim of independence is complicated by political science data showing that judges often align with the ideological leanings of the party whose president appointed them. This analysis ultimately reveals a growing disconnect between the judiciary’s stated ideals and the political pressures present in an increasingly polarized environment.",

          "authors": "Jonathan H. Adler",
          "abstract": "The Roberts court has long been characterized as a “probusiness” court, given the ostensible orientation of the court’s Republican-appointed majority and assumptions that President Trump’s appointments have magnified that orientation. But there are reasons to question this characterization. Quantitative analyses often fail to account for the relative importance of individual decisions, the broader legal context in which the court’s decisions are made, or the ways in which decisions can alter or depart from preexisting legal baselines. I show that President Trump’s appointments to the court have fairly consistently voted to restrain the power of administrative agencies, but they have not consistently supported outcomes that are beneficial to business. In cases involving state laws that may fragment or burden national markets, the Roberts court may actually be less sympathetic to business interests than it was prior to Trump’s appointments.",

          "abstract": "The articles in this volume, written by leading law professors, political scientists, and journalists, center on the impact of President Donald Trump on the U.S. Supreme Court and the impact of the court on the second Trump administration and on all Americans. President Trump has already appointed a third of the current court and may appoint more than half. Considering that the second Trump administration has sought to “flood the zone” with executive actions during its first 100 days, the court’s rulings have become massively significant for American governance and for the lives of people in our nation and around the world. The four sections of the volume consider the rise of the “Trump court,” the court’s recent rulings on judicial and executive power and on a range of basic rights, its standing in the public’s eyes, and how it stacks up against high courts in other democracies.",

          "abstract": "The politics of appointments have transformed the U.S. Supreme Court in recent years. We examine why and how the current conservative supermajority on the court came to be, with a particular focus on how this court stands apart from earlier ones. We trace the factors that allowed President Donald Trump to reshape the court with his three appointments in his first term and evaluate the importance of the conservative supermajority by connecting it to theories of the court’s collective decision-making. We show that the current court is the culmination of a “partisan sort” in appointments—a strict correlation between party and ideology—that began a few decades ago but did not fully crystallize until the 2010s. Finally, we summarize simulations that show why conservatives are likely to control the court for several decades.",

Harvard realizes conceptions about race and the post–Civil War amendments present in the Roberts court’s jurisprudence for several years including, notably, deep skepticism about the continuing need for civil rights remedies and a reading of colorblindness as the core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. Conservative litigation groups and the Trump administration are now using the SFFA decision to challenge race-conscious affirmative action programs and fundamental racial justice and civil rights laws and policies. While the Supreme Court has so far declined to adopt the farthest-reaching colorblindness arguments and has even expanded the reach of civil rights statutes in certain contexts, the next few years will likely be consequential for racial justice and antidiscrimination law. The court will almost certainly take up cases challenging the constitutionality of long-standing civil rights laws and recent racially reparative efforts.",

Although generally taking an expansive view of presidential power, it often seeks to narrow the authority of executive branch administrative agencies, especially those engaged in regulation. This contrast creates an appearance of inconsistency: At the same time that the court is expanding presidential power, it is pulling back on administrative action and thereby denying the presidency one of its most important sources of authority. But the court’s approach is more coherent if it is understood as aimed at implementation of a conservative legal and political agenda. Moreover, by both expanding presidential powers and limiting administrative authority, the court’s decisions aggrandize judicial power at the expense of the political branches.",

Jackson Women’s Health Organization was highly predictable, the decision nonetheless came as a shock to the political and legal systems—and, based on the justices’ first encounters with the post- Dobbs world during the 2023–2024 term, it was perhaps even a shock to the court itself. Women played little more than a walk-on role both in the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion (a decision essentially about doctors) and in the repudiation of that right (a decision essentially about fetuses). But now, in the half of the country where even medically necessary abortion is unavailable after Dobbs , concerns for pregnant women and their fate dominate, and the justices appear no longer so certain that they are finished with abortion. Their work, in fact, may be just beginning.",

I compare the apex courts of 38 Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, finding that the power and role of the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) makes it unique among them. SCOTUS’s appointment process, lifelong judicial terms, agenda-setting powers, consensus norms, and constitutional framework make it an exceptionally powerful and exceptionally partisan court. Further, several factors that encourage a tendency toward the protection of rights in other apex courts are less relevant to SCOTUS. This comparison highlights that SCOTUS is the most partisan of the OECD apex courts, among the most powerful, and relatively less likely than other courts to uphold core democratic principles.",

This description is true only to a limited extent. The historical institutionalist analysis presented here shows that Roberts’s priority is to advance his version of the modern conservative legal movement’s vision of the Constitution, and that he protects the judiciary as an institution in the service of that cause. But because many Americans do not share that vision of constitutionalism, and because its endorsement of executive power may undermine judicial authority, the decisions of the Roberts court may only compound the difficulties facing both the court and the country today. I also discuss implications of the Chief Justice’s disposition, both for the court and for the nation’s evolving conception of constitutionalism.",

Donald Trump has embraced this mission and escalated the assault on America’s electoral processes in new and dangerous ways. Has the Supreme Court supported or opposed this contemptible project? Its recent election law decisions offer a mixed verdict, though its performance mostly leans in an antidemocratic direction. The court’s decisions safeguarding democracy are fewer than those that undermine voting rights and elections, are typically handed down over the objections of Trump’s appointees, and often include doctrinal provisions that enable it to restrict democratic participation in the future. Whether the Supreme Court will abet or discourage the erosion of American democracy in the future is an open question.",

          "abstract": "The U.S. Supreme Court’s embrace of originalism, and particularly the “history and tradition” method of interpreting constitutional text, is often justified by its defenders as constraining judges from making up the law to match their preferences. This is a testable hypothesis. With the Bruen case in 2022, the Supreme Court moved away from a contemporary means-ends method of interpreting the Second Amendment to an originalist, “history and tradition” one. In this article, we analyze data on gun rights decisions handed down by lower federal courts from 2000 to 2023, finding that the Supreme Court’s switch to an originalist jurisprudence did not, in fact, constrain judges—rather, it corresponds with an increase in judicial discretion. Personal factors like partisan identity, gender, race, and careerist considerations shape judicial behavior in the post- Bruen era in ways they did not under the prior regime.",

The data analyzed here reinforce evidence from earlier studies that the Dobbs ruling produced a substantial hit to the court’s institutional legitimacy. Why and how did this occur? A dominant model of attitude change posits that short-term evaluations of the court’s performance are informed by individual rulings and readily evolve but that institutional loyalty originates from different sources and is resistant to change. Loyalty is not entirely impervious to change, however: This research suggests that controversial decisions can cause a realignment of both types of court attitudes and that this seems to have happened with Dobbs . But, as I show via an experiment, evaluations typically change first, and under some (but perhaps extraordinary) circumstances, changed evaluations can undermine institutional loyalty.",

Concerning the Free Exercise Clause, the court’s conservatives have dismissed history by disregarding historical practices that do not conform to their approach to the text.

As a result, the protection of immigrants’ rights increasingly has become a matter of executive grace. Discretion plays a crucial role in the execution of immigration law, and through its use, the executive can promote humanitarian objectives. But even when protective discretionary acts receive the imprimatur of courts, they do not provide lasting security because they are only as good as the policy preferences of the president in power. Indeed, discretion can also perpetuate overly aggressive enforcement in pursuit of those preferences. The checks the Roberts court has imposed on the operation of the enforcement system tend to reflect a skepticism of government, rather than a meaningful regard for the rights and interests of immigrants, leaving Congress as the only meaningful source of stability for the system and for immigrants themselves.",

Here we demonstrate a brain-to-voice neuroprosthesis that instantaneously synthesizes voice with closed-loop audio feedback by decoding neural activity from 256 microelectrodes implanted into the ventral precentral gyrus of a man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and severe dysarthria. We overcame the challenge of lacking ground-truth speech for training the neural decoder and were able to accurately synthesize his voice. Along with phonemic content, we were also able to decode paralinguistic features from intracortical activity, enabling the participant to modulate his BCI-synthesized voice in real time to change intonation and sing short melodies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of enabling people with paralysis to speak intelligibly and expressively through a BCI.",

          "abstract": "Long (>200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in diverse aspects of life. Over 20 classes of lncRNAs have been identified in bacteria and bacteriophages through comparative genomics analyses, but their biological functions remain largely unexplored1-3. Due to the large sizes, the structural determinants of most lncRNAs also remain uncharacterized. Here we report the structures of two natural RNA nanocages formed by the lncRNA ROOL (rumen-originating, ornate, large) found in bacterial and phage genomes. ~2.9 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures reveal that ROOL RNAs form an octameric nanocage with a 28-nm diameter and 20-nm axial length, whose hollow inside features poorly ordered regions. The octamer is stabilized by numerous tertiary and quaternary interactions, including triple-strand A-minors that we propose to name “A-minor staples”. The structure of an isolated ROOL monomer at ~3.2-Å resolution indicates that nanocage assembly involves a strand-swapping mechanism resulting in quaternary kissing loops. Finally, we show that ROOL RNA fused to an RNA aptamer, tRNA, or microRNA retains its structure forming a nanocage with radially displayed cargos. Our findings therefore may enable the engineering of novel RNA nanocages as delivery vehicles for research and therapeutic applications.",

          "title": "How your brain controls ageing — and why zombie cells could be key",
          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "There might be a paradox in the biology of ageing. As humans grow older, their metabolisms tend to slow, they lose muscle mass and they burn many fewer calories. But certain cells in older people appear to do the exact opposite — they consume more energy than when they were young.\n\nThese potential energy hogs are senescent cells, older cells that have stopped dividing and no longer perform the essential functions that they used to. Because they seem idle, biologists had assumed that zombie-like senescent cells use less energy than their younger, actively replicating counterparts, says Martin Picard, a psychobiologist at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nHow to kill the ‘zombie’ cells that make you age\n\nBut in 2022, Gabriel Sturm, a former graduate student of Picard’s, painstakingly observed the life course of human skin cells cultured in a dish1 and, in findings that have not yet been published in full, found that cells that had stopped dividing had a metabolic rate about double that of younger cells.\n\nFor Picard and his colleagues, the energetic mismatch wasn’t a paradox at all: ageing cells accumulate energetically costly forms of damage, such as alterations in DNA, and they initiate pro-inflammatory signalling. How that corresponds with the relatively low energy expenditure for ageing organisms is still unclear, but the researchers hypothesize that this tension might be an important driver of many of the negative effects of growing old, and that the brain might be playing a key part as mediator2. As some cells get older and require more energy, the brain reacts by stripping resources from other biological processes, which ultimately results in outward signs of ageing, such as greying hair or a reduction in muscle mass (see ‘Energy management and ageing’).\n\nSource: Ref. 2\n\nPicard and his colleagues call this concept the ‘brain–body energy-conservation model’. And although many parts of the hypothesis are still untested, scientists are working to decipher the precise mechanisms that connect the brain to processes associated with ageing, such as senescence, inflammation and the shortening of telomeres — the stretches of repetitive DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes and protect them. This work, some researchers say, is also beginning to illuminate how psychological stress can accelerate ageing at a molecular level. Although once at the fringes of ageing research, this idea is now becoming mainstream, says Alessandro Bartolomucci, a biologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “The science speaks for itself. The field cannot dismiss it.”\n\nWear and tear\n\nSome of the earliest pieces of evidence pointing to the brain’s role in ageing came from studies that revealed the effects of psychological stress on individual cells.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Elissa Epel, who was then a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), set out with her colleagues to examine whether chronic stress could leave behind a cellular signature. At the time, there was already a “very impressive literature” linking long-term stress to poor health, says Epel, who is now a health psychologist at UCSF. “But we didn’t know as much about what was happening at the cellular level.”\n\nSo, the researchers decided to look at telomere length. Telomeres progressively shorten over the lifespan of an organism, and this process has been linked to senescence and other forms of age-related changes in cells.\n\nHow quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks’ can tell you about your health\n\nThe team recruited a group of 58 healthy women: 19 of whom had a healthy child; and 39 of whom had a child with a chronic illness. The researchers reasoned that the latter group often experienced increased levels of stress compared with the women who had healthy children3. Epel’s team found that the women with a chronically ill child had shorter telomeres than those who did not — and that telomere length correlated with the number of years spent as a carer. These findings suggested that exposure to chronic stress can introduce molecular changes that are important for ageing, says biologist Noah Synder-Mackler at Arizona State University in Tempe.\n\nSince then, teams have also found evidence of telomere shortening in people exposed to other stressors, such as adverse experiences in childhood and work-related exhaustion4. Although some of the results have been mixed when it comes to telomere length, researchers have also amassed evidence linking stress to other molecular markers of ageing.\n\nFor example, Anthony Zannas, a physician–scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and his colleagues have shown, through studies of large cohorts of people, that high levels of stress throughout life were associated with signs of accelerated ageing in the epigenome, the patterns of chemical modifications to the genome, such as DNA methylation, that help to regulate what genes are expressed. These changes might be mediated by stress hormones such as cortisol. Zannas’s team found that, in women, higher levels of cortisol were linked to lower levels of DNA methylation, as well as an increase in the expression of the gene coding for tumour necrosis factor (TNF), a signalling molecule associated with inflammation5.\n\nExercise can help to mitigate some of the effects of stress on ageing. Credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty\n\nOthers have been studying these processes in animals. Although animal models of stress have their limitations — for one, humans stressors are much more complex and can include a variety of social, psychological and biological factors — this work has provided mechanistic insights that are difficult to obtain in human studies. Bartolomucci and his team have discovered that chronic social stress in rodents, such as being subjected to aggressive behaviour from a dominant animal, can damage heart health and lead to a shorter lifespan6. They’ve also found that exposure to this type of adversity is linked to an increase in age-related molecular changes, such as a build-up of signals associated with senescence.\n\nFor example, in one 2024 study of male mice, Bartolomucci’s team demonstrated that social stress during a relatively brief period in early life led to an increase in levels of a key marker of cellular senescence, called p16, in the brain, fat tissue and immune cells7. These changes occurred only in response to social stress: animals exposed to stress in the form of physical restraint, which involved placing them in small tubes for three hours per day for a month, did not experience a build-up of p16.\n\nHacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how\n\nSynder-Mackler’s team have been conducting similar studies in rhesus macaques. These animals tend to form hierarchies within groups, with newcomers dropping to lower social ranks. So, by sequentially introducing animals into groups, the researchers were able to examine the effects of social status on health. They found that social stress affects the immune system in multiple ways. In the immune cells of monkeys with lower social status, it led to an increase in the expression of inflammation-associated genes8. These effects were at least partially reversible: when the animals’ social rankings were rearranged, the gene expression patterns in their immune cells also changed to match their standings. The team has yet to look at how these alterations affect lifespan — macaques can live for around 30 years, which makes it difficult to address this issue, Synder-Mackler says.",

          "abstract": "As the ferry pulled into the dock at the North Sea island of Heligoland, I wondered: did German wunderkind Werner Heisenberg — who famously formulated the mathematics behind quantum physics here in 1925 — also arrive wanting to throw up?\n\nThe choppy four-hour journey from Hamburg, Germany, was unpleasant, but perhaps a small price to pay for an invitation to the physics event of the year. I am one of some 300 people, including at least four Nobel laureates, who have descended on the remote island (with a population of 1,253) for a conference dubbed by one of its organizers the birthday party of quantum mechanics.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nOne hundred years ago this week, 23-year-old Heisenberg came to the island to escape his debilitating hay fever (some sources say the island hosted just one tree – I can report that I have seen at least four). Legend has it that, unable to sleep, he sketched out his ideas late into the night before reaching an epiphany. He is said to have then roamed the island, shaken, before watching the sunrise from the top of a rock.\n\nHeisenberg’s insight was that electrons around an atom — whose orbits had puzzled physicists with conflicting predictions and measurements — should be defined not by their trajectories, but by only observables: their leaps and transitions. This required developing a kind of mathematics, called matrix mechanics, that helped to shepherd in a new, quantum, era in physics.\n\nRetracing Heisenberg’s steps\n\nThe young physicist’s revelation on this remote island is a beautiful and somewhat mythical image. As highlighted by science writer Philip Ball at the conference dinner, Heisenberg himself was unsure of the magnitude of what he had done, writing to his father on his return that “my own work is not going at the moment especially well”. Only after Heisenberg’s collaborators Max Born and Pascual Jordan built on his work did it become a complete formulation of quantum mechanics.\n\nBut people who want a birthday party need to pick a date. And now that I am here, I can see that Heligoland’s stark red cliffs and stiff breeze makes it a perfect place to roam, contemplate and hope that some of Heisenberg’s genius rubs off.\n\nA memorial stone on the island honours Heisenberg and his achievements.Credit: Elizabeth Gibney for Nature\n\nDown every street and in every cafe sit physicists, their conference lanyards swinging, huddled in conversation. My server asks me what we’re all doing here. “Quantum physics!” I say with glee. A local man who studies wildlife at the Biological Institute Helgoland told me he could spot fellow scientists among the islanders.\n\nTo encourage conversation and revelation, the conference schedule is bizarre. After the morning session, talks adjourn until 7 p.m., to give ample time to explore the tiny island. Heligoland’s fame goes well beyond quantum mechanics. Over the centuries, the island has swapped between British, Danish and German rule, and it is a haven for seals and rare seabirds. In 1947, it was half obliterated by one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history, when the British Royal Navy blew it up to prevent it being used as a German military base.",

But it is so far unclear whether Earth’s magnetism plays direct a role in keeping oxygen levels high — and sustaining animal life — or whether both are influenced by a third, unidentified mechanism.\n\nSource: Ref. 1Source: Ref. 1\n\n“We don’t really have a good explanation for it,” says Benjamin Mills, a biogeochemist at the University of Leeds, UK, and co-author of the study, published in Science Advances on 13 June1. But the study suggests “some potential causes that are exciting and potentially testable”, says Aubrey Zerkle, a biogeochemist at the University of St Andrews, UK.\n\nKnowing how Earth's deep interior could influence the evolution of the atmosphere is “critical to understanding what makes our planet habitable”, says Richard Bono, a geophysicist at Florida State University in Tallahassee who has helped to compile long-term records of geomagnetism.\n\nGeological clues\n\nOxygen is the main component of Earth’s crust and mantle. But molecular oxygen only began to slowly accumulate in the atmosphere after organisms that produce oxygen through photosynthesis began to evolve, around 2.5 billion years ago. And only in the current aeon, covering the last 540 million years or so, has it reached concentrations that are breathable by most animals.\n\nIs Earth’s core leaking? Volcanic rocks provide strongest evidence yet\n\nThere is no direct way to measure the composition of the atmosphere in the deep past, but geochemists can use indirect clues2 to reconstruct oxygen levels starting in the Cambrian period, which began around 540 million years ago. For example, oxygen concentration “has a strong relationship with how easy it is to start and maintain wildfires,” says Mills, and the frequency of large wildfires can be worked out by looking at ancient charcoal deposits, among other factors.\n\nGeophysicists can also reconstruct how the strength and direction of the geomagnetic field has varied across even longer stretches of Earth’s history, by studying rocks produced by ancient volcanic eruptions3. That’s because magnetic crystals that form in the solidifying lava align themselves with the field, acting like tiny compasses frozen in time.\n\nTo put these two long records side-by-side and compare them, Mills teamed up with geophysicists Weijia Kuang and Ravi Kopparapu, both at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, and with exobiologist Joshua Krissansen-Totton at the University of Washington in Seattle. The authors found a strong correlation — both oxygen levels and geomagnetic intensity have increased over the past million years, and some of the major spikes or drops in both measures occur in the same geological eras (see ‘Long-term trends’).\n\nPossible explanations\n\nThe paper discusses some possible reasons for the correlation. Earth’s magnetic field is known to have a protective effect on the upper atmosphere because it deflects solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the Sun that would otherwise cause oxygen and other gases to slowly escape into space. But the team calculated that the loss of oxygen caused by a drastic weakening of the field would still be small compared to the amounts generated by photosynthesis — or to those consumed by other organisms and by geological cycles in which elements are exchanged between the atmosphere, crust and the mantle.",

          "title": "Could a novelty indicator improve science?",
          "authors": "Benjamin Steyn",
          "abstract": "Novelty is often espoused as a virtue in science. But what does it mean, and how valuable is it, really? A manuscript written in gobbledegook might be considered novel, despite being useless. And studies that try to replicate previous work can be valuable without being novel.\n\nSome scientists argue that the current research system, driven by citation-based metrics, incentivizes researchers to play it safe. It’s easier to get citations for incremental work in established fields than to break out of silos. Others counter that the existing system demands novelty at the expense of depth and replication, and that what’s considered novel can be subjective.\n\n‘Disruptive’ science has declined — and no one knows why\n\nAs the co-leader of the UK Metascience Unit, I’ve grappled with this debate. It’s important to consider whether more novelty would make research more impactful. But I’ve been stumped by the fact that there are no good ways to measure novelty. Without good indicators, researchers can’t assess the prevalence of original papers or their value in scientific progress.\n\nMetascientists have tried to assign novelty scores to academic papers — and their authors — in various ways, none of which are foolproof. One identifies early users of certain key words, so we can see retrospectively who were pioneers of ideas. Another looks at how scientific papers cite each other; novel research often cites combinations of papers that had not been drawn together previously.\n\nIn the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have emerged that analyse the textual similarity between a paper and the existing research corpus. By ingesting large amounts of text from online manuscripts, these models have the potential to be better than previous models at detecting how original a paper is, even in cases in which the study hasn’t cited the work it resembles. Because these models analyse the meanings of words and sentences, rather than word frequencies, they would not score a paper more highly simply for use of varied language — for instance, ‘dough’ instead of ‘money’.\n\nPay researchers to spot errors in published papers\n\nBut these AI-based novelty indicators, and, to an extent, their predecessors, are yet to be robustly validated. Do they cohere with human judgements of what novel science is? Would they single out work that went on to win Nobel prizes or to be funded by novelty-focused programmes such as those by DARPA and ARIA, say? Without testing them at scale across multiple fields, we cannot trust them.\n\nThat’s why the UK Metascience Unit has partnered with the non-profit organization RAND Europe; the Sussex Science Policy Research Unit; and the publisher Elsevier, to launch MetaNIC (see go.nature.com/3hhsdp3) — a competition to produce and validate indicators for scientific novelty in academic papers. Running until November, MetaNIC is open to researchers all around the world.\n\nParticipants will design novelty assessments and test them over a set of 50,000 research papers, drawn from many fields. We will compare the algorithms’ scores against a huge ‘ground truth’ data set, gathered by asking more than 10,000 researchers to assess the novelty of the same set of papers, each being assigned only studies in their own field to judge. The team behind the indicator that best aligns with the human judgements will be awarded £300,000 (US$407, 000) to further develop their work.\n\nOnce we have an indicator that reliably matches human judgements, metascientists will be able to study the role of originality in scientific progress.",

          "authors": "Anna Bull",
          "abstract": "Postgraduate students are vulnerable in academic settings. Roughly 6% of 160 PhD-level respondents to a 2023 survey in England reported having experienced unwanted behaviours of a sexual nature in the previous year (see go.nature.com/4ke6pv9). One-third of those were not sure how to report their experience to the university, or where to seek support. Similar, or higher, rates were found in studies in Australia (some 30,000 participants) and the United States (more than 180,000 participants).\n\nAs a scholar and activist working to address sexual harassment in higher education, I have seen how devastating it is for students when faculty members abuse their power. In 2016, the resignation of feminist scholar Sara Ahmed from Goldsmiths College, University of London, in protest at the lack of action against sexual harassment rocked the UK higher-education community. I co-founded a campaigning organization, The 1752 Group, dedicated to redressing the situation. The group’s name reflects the meagre amount of money that Goldsmiths invested in our first conference on tackling the issue — £1,752 (US$2,380). This stopgap approach is emblematic of academia’s reluctance to engage with the problem.\n\nThe huge toll of PhDs on mental health: data reveal stark effects\n\nAt last, nearly ten years on, England is taking action. From 1 August, England’s national regulator for higher education, the Office for Students, will require institutions to protect students from harassment or sexual misconduct.\n\nThis is a welcome step. But the guidelines must include specific protective measures for PhD students. As researchers, they work in environments distinct from those of students in taught programmes. They are more likely to be targeted by staff members, both at their institution and outside it. This is partly because of their close relationship with advisers and mentors, and partly because of academia’s deeply hierarchical, gender-unequal culture.\n\nAny form of harassment can disrupt people’s lives, careers, professional networks, and physical and mental health. Some people report experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder or a loss of confidence. Those targeted sometimes change fields or leave academia altogether.\n\nMy research has shown that the main reason students report sexual harassment by a member of staff is to keep themselves and others safe. But too often, they receive little to no commitment from universities that they and others will be shielded from perpetrators.\n\nHow PhD students and other academics are fighting the mental-health crisis in science\n\nMany institutions are still building systems and expertise to address sexual harassment. A change in attitude is crucial. Even now, I hear that such misconduct is rare, or not that serious. Other barriers persist. In Europe, data privacy regulations can hinder efforts to keep people safe. Distinct disclosures about the same alleged perpetrator, for example, aren’t usually linked.",

          "abstract": "On 16 June at the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston, a judge ruled that the Trump administration’s slashing of some research grants is illegal.Credit: Sean Pavone/Alamy\n\nA US judge has ordered hundreds of terminated research projects at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to be reinstated, calling the processes that led to their cancellation “bereft of reasoning — virtually, in their entirety”.\n\nCan NIH-funded research on racism and health survive Trump’s cuts?\n\nThe ruling came about two hours after a tense hearing in which lawyers representing US researchers and a coalition of 16 states presented arguments for the first time that the NIH’s massive cuts to research are illegal. Since Republican President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the agency has cancelled funding for a long list of research projects, including those on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), sexual and gender minorities (LGBT+) and COVID-19.\n\nIn an blistering 15-minute sidebar after issuing his ruling, Judge William Young of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston angrily excoriated the Trump administration for its targeting of research about the health of LGBT+ people and racial minorities.\n\n“This represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community. I would be blind not to call it out,” said Young, who was appointed by former US president Ronald Reagan, a Republican. “I’ve been on the bench for 40 years — I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this.”\n\n‘We were ready for this’: meet the scientists suing the Trump administration to reinstate terminated grants\n\nThis ruling, which the Trump administration is likely to appeal, means that the NIH will have to begin to disburse billions of dollars of funding that it had cancelled. “I’m thrilled and overjoyed,” Katie Edwards, an interdisciplinary public-health specialist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, told Nature. Edwards had six NIH grants cancelled and was one of the researchers who sued the agency. “What the judge said today was spot on — and it highlights the crisis we’re facing right now, where racial and ethnic minorities are being erased,” she said.\n\nThe judge’s order will restore funding only to the scientists named in the lawsuits and in the 16 states that sued the government — or about 800 of the more than 2,400 projects that have been cut at the NIH. These lawsuits also did not touch on wholesale grant cuts at institutions such as Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that the Trump administration has alleged did not protect their students from discrimination, including antisemitism, on campus.\n\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the NIH’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), says the agency “stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people” and that it is “exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal”. Neither the HHS nor the NIH, which is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, responded to Nature’s query about whether and when they would follow the court’s order to restore funding to the affected projects.\n\nA question of procedure\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the NIH began to terminate research grants in late February because they no longer met “agency priorities”. (The agency typically cancels only a handful of projects each year in response to serious concerns about research misconduct or fraud — and does so only as a last resort, after taking other actions such as suspension.)\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is slashing NIH-backed research — in charts\n\nLawsuits challenging these cuts were filed in early April, arguing that they were unlawful because the NIH did not follow proper procedures and did not give adequate reasoning for their cancellation.\n\nRepresentatives of the HHS and billionaire Elon Musk’s US Department of Government Efficiency issued directives to NIH staff members to slash grants on disfavoured topics, and they provided boilerplate language for the employees to use in termination letters to scientists, Nature previously reported. It is these directives that the judge ruled today to be “arbitrary and capricious” and, thus, illegal.\n\nTermination letters sent to some scientists called their projects “often unscientific” or deemed them as supporting “unlawful discrimination”, without backing up the claims. At today’s hearing, Young asked the government’s lawyers if they could provide any examples of grants that supported these claims. “There’s nothing I can point the court to,” the lawyer responded.",

          "title": "Freeze frame: cracking molecular motion",
          "authors": "Michael Eisenstein",
          "abstract": "‘Blink and you’ll miss it’ is an understatement in the world of protein biology. A blink lasts hundreds of milliseconds. Proteins operate on a much shorter timescale — on the order of a millisecond, or even faster. “To capture many of the domain motions of proteins that are linked to function, you would have to be able to go down to a microsecond timescale,” says Ulrich Lorenz, a chemist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.\n\nWorking on that timescale has long stymied biologists, but the rapid evolution of time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (TR cryo-EM) over the past several years has made it possible to reconstruct dynamic processes with near-atomic detail.\n\nHow protein-slayer drugs could beat some of the cruellest cancers\n\nBeyond fundamental biological insights, a deeper understanding of protein dynamics could guide the development of more effective medicines and boost protein-engineering efforts. “Time-resolved cryo-EM could be the natural choice — or only option — to capture [protein] conformations that could be potentially better targeted by drugs,” says Youdong Mao, a physicist at Peking University in Beijing, China.\n\nBut the technique is niche: these methods require considerable expertise and specialized equipment, and researchers are still working out how to interpret the resulting data. “Nature is under no obligation to be simple,” cautions Radoslav Enchev, a biochemist at the Francis Crick Institute in London. And until more laboratories get the tools needed to perform TR cryo-EM, progress in this exciting field will continue to be sporadic.\n\nFrom stills to cinematography\n\nThe basics of cryo-EM are straightforward: researchers apply protein solutions to a ‘grid’ substrate and flash-freeze them into a glassy structure known as vitreous ice. Using a transmission electron microscope, they then image individual molecules in many orientations — imagine chunks of fruit embedded in jelly. Given enough examples, these 2D ‘projections’ can be reconstructed into a high-resolution 3D structure.\n\nSkilled users can produce structures sharp enough to resolve individual hydrogen atoms. But most experiments image just a single, relatively stable conformation. Structural biologist Stephen Muench at the University of Leeds, UK, struggled for years with the limitations of his cryo-EM studies of a protein known as vacuolar ATPase, a molecular motor that spins as it pumps protons across lipid membranes. “There were a lot of questions we just couldn’t answer with static structures,” says Muench.\n\nMore generally, says Lorenz, biologists have had to choose whether to achieve high resolution in time or in space. Live-cell ‘super-resolution’ experiments can visualize single proteins at millisecond timescales but cannot discern detailed structural features. Nuclear magnetic resonance can record relatively fast transitions between protein conformations with high resolution, but is limited to small targets. And although time-resolved X-ray crystallography can distinguish both atomic detail and incredibly rapid, femtosecond-scale movement, it does so in a highly constrained setting. “Protein dynamics don’t naturally occur in a crystal,” explains Lorenz.\n\nThese ‘movies’ of proteins in action are revealing the hidden biology of cells\n\nIn principle, cryo-EM provides an excellent fit for time-resolved experiments. Given enough particles, researchers could theoretically reconstruct every conformational state that a protein can assume. The trick is to get these dynamic processes to unfold in lockstep, such that the 3D reconstructions can be assembled into a molecular movie. This can be achieved by taking a sample of protein at equilibrium, introducing a ligand or other molecular trigger that initiates movement, and then rapidly freezing the sample at various times after the reaction starts.\n\nIn 1995, for instance, Nigel Unwin, a structural biologist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, prepared a grid with the receptor for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and sprayed it with a solution containing acetylcholine1. By quickly freezing the mixture, Unwin captured changes that occurred in the receptor within five milliseconds of acetylcholine binding. Cryo-EM spatial resolution was poor in those days, but other groups have subsequently leveraged similar ‘spray-and-mix’ approaches to produce detailed dynamic reconstructions with modern, high-resolution instruments.\n\nHowever, spray-and-mix methods can also introduce considerable uncertainty owing to inefficient mixing between protein and ligand. “Diffusion is happening, so nothing is really under control,” says Joachim Frank, a biophysicist at Columbia University in New York City, who shared the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pivotal role in advancing cryo-EM for structural biology. “We wanted to develop a method in which we have control of everything.”\n\nAs an alternative, Frank’s group began working on polymer-based microfluidic chips containing tiny channels, within which a protein and its ligand can be precisely mixed before being sprayed onto a grid and frozen. They described their first-generation instrument in 20152, and several other groups have subsequently devised alternative ‘mix-and-spray’ systems.\n\nA microfluidic chip comprising three parts: a micromixer, a microreactor and a microsprayer.Credit: S. Bhattacharjee et al./Cell\n\nContemporary chips incorporate precisely engineered, zigzagging channels for rapid, efficient sample mixing and smooth fluid flow, and mix-and-spray has become the method of choice for many TR cryo-EM practitioners. Last year, for example, Frank and his colleagues used their latest-generation microfluidic design to study how ribosomes are recycled after protein synthesis to begin translation of a new polypeptide chain3. “We can see how the ribosome is opened up like a clam-shell upon the interaction with a particular molecule that pries the whole thing open,” says Frank. In April, Muench and his collaborators employed their own mix-and-spray system to study actomyosin complexes from muscle fibres, revealing crucial details about how the myosin protein stores and subsequently releases the energy that powers muscle contraction over the course of 120 milliseconds4.\n\nStill, there’s plenty of room for improvement. For one thing, microfluidics-based sample preparation requires a lot of material. “In freezing one time point, you consume several microlitres of sample, which normally is all the protein you can purify over several months,” says Mao. His team pursued an alternative approach to study the protein-degrading proteasome complex, using reaction conditions that slowed proteasome activity to a crawl so that time-resolved data could be collected using more conventional cryo-EM methods.\n\nAn evolving landscape\n\nResearchers led by Rouslan Efremov, a structural biologist at the VIB-VUB Center for Structural Biology in Brussels, have devised a mix-and-spray system that reduces sample-size requirements by an order of magnitude. Their microfluidic device mixes a protein and a ligand in tiny droplets, allowing them to rapidly react in a confined space before they are launched onto the grid using a laser-based mechanism5. “The main advantage is that this consumes only about 100 nanolitres per grid,” says Efremov, who has used this approach to study complexes that are responsible for protein folding and bacterial metabolism.\n\nFaster frame rates are also in demand. Existing microfluidic approaches have a ‘speed limit’ of around 5 milliseconds, and although many conformational changes occur in this time frame, others do not. Furthermore, millisecond-scale resolution preferentially captures major intermediates and endpoints for a protein conformational change but misses shorter-lived transition states that are essential for understanding the events leading up to that change.\n\nCatching proteins at play: the method revealing the cell’s inner mysteries\n\nLorenz’s group took a gamble in its bid to break the millisecond barrier6. First, the researchers freeze their protein sample on a grid in the presence of an inactive, chemically ‘caged’ ligand or activator. The frozen sample is then illuminated with a laser to release the activator compound, after which a second beam is used to quickly melt the ice. After an appropriate interval, the sample is rapidly refrozen, capturing conformational changes occurring in as few as 5 microseconds.\n\nRemarkably, this melting and revitrification strategy does not seem to negatively affect proteins, and Lorenz notes that it can even improve the resolution of the 3D reconstruction by knocking the protein particles into a wider range of orientations. His team is currently using this method to study a variety of viruses and investigate how rapid conformational changes by viral proteins aid host-cell infection. And even faster snapshots might be in reach. “I think 10 nanoseconds or so should be easily possible,” says Lorenz, adding that such resolution could capture ultra-fast events, such as the folding of protein structural domains.\n\nWhen it comes to TR cryo-EM, even minor details matter. For example, the ice layer on the grid needs to be thick enough to protect the proteins from air, which can damage molecules and render them uninterpretable, but also thin enough to maximize image contrast. In a preprint published in April, Enchev and his colleagues presented a platform called Chronobot to tackle this problem7. Here, samples are mixed in a reusable glass microfluidic chip and then sprayed onto the grid, which is imaged with a high-speed camera immediately before freezing. A deep-learning algorithm then assesses the ice quality in each sector of the grid while also optimizing future sample-preparation conditions on the basis of those results. This helps the team to avoid wasting valuable instrument time on bad samples. “This rapid iteration away from the expensive microscope allows us to make sure that we would get a high-resolution data set of any grid that passes this quality control,” says Enchev.\n\nGetting things in order",

What’s more, they found that these patterns can be correlated with body-mass index (BMI) and signs of depression and anxiety.\n\n“In a way, we’re reading the mind through the nose,” says co-author Noam Sobel, a neurobiologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. “This could be a very powerful diagnostic tool.” The team published its study today in Current Biology1.\n\nTaking a breath\n\nBreathing is deeply connected to the brain. Every inhalation and exhalation is coordinated to supply the oxygen needed for the brain to manage the body’s systems. Sobel and his team wondered: if every brain functions differently, shouldn’t every person’s breathing be unique, too?\n\nTo test this, the researchers developed a custom, wearable device that records airflow through each of a person’s nostrils. Mounted on the back of the neck, the device, which has tubes fitted under the nose, tracks people’s breathing during their everyday routines, both while they are awake and while they are asleep.\n\nResearchers measured study participants’ breathing patterns over 24 hours, using a custom device that sits on the back of the neck.Credit: Soroka et al., Current Biology\n\nTo characterize a person’s breath pattern, the team extracted 24 parameters from the airflow data, including duration of inhalation and exhalation and airflow asymmetry between nostrils. They separated the periods when participants were awake and asleep, and trained a machine-learning algorithm with the data.\n\nWhen 42 of the participants came back to the laboratory weeks, months and even two years later, to take part in another 24-hour measurement, the trained algorithm could identify them from their breath patterns. Data from periods when the participants were awake gave more accurate results than did those from sleeping periods, but when the researchers used a 100-parameter characterization of a full data set instead of one using 24 parameters, they could pick individuals out with 96.8% accuracy.\n\nGiven this success, Sobel and his colleagues began wondering whether they could learn more from the breath patterns.\n\nHealthy breathing\n\nThe researchers collected data on the participants’ BMIs, and from questionnaires that assess levels of depression and anxiety. An analysis found correlations between this information and the breathing patterns, even though most participants had low-level scores on the questionnaires.\n\nFor instance, the breathing profiles during sleep of people with higher BMIs were different from those of people with lower BMIs. And those who scored higher on the questionnaires for anxiety or depression had distinct patterns in how they inhaled and exhaled.",

In Iran, at least 224 people have been killed; in Israel, 24 have been killed, according to media reports.\n\nIsrael launched strikes against several Iranian cities early on 13 June, targeting nuclear facilities and killing several Iranian commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran — which is in talks with the United States about its nuclear programme — retaliated later that day, launching drone and missile attacks at sites across Israel. Both countries have since continued strikes.\n\nBiologist Jacob Hanna was about to give a talk on a new technique for developing stem-cell-based mouse embryos at a conference in Hong Kong when his phone pinged with the news that Israel had attacked Iran.\n\n“That threw me off balance a little,” says Hanna. Hours earlier, he had been informed by his university, the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, to evacuate all facilities, while his students scrambled to finish an experiment requested during the review process for a paper.\n\nFlights to Israel had been canceled, so Hanna travelled to London to stay with a friend until he could work out how to get home. On that flight, he learnt from students that his lab had been damaged by a missile strike in retaliatory attacks launched by Iran. The Weizmann Institute is considered by Iran to be a military target.\n\nExtensive damage\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the strike, there was shattered glass everywhere, the computers weren’t turning on, incubators fell and the power went out. In one lab, the ceiling had collapsed, and the staircase had detached, Hanna was told. His students managed to save hundreds of frozen mouse and human cell lines by transferring them to back-up liquid-nitrogen tanks that Hanna had stored in the basement. “I was always worried that if a war actually happens, I don’t want to lose these.”\n\nHe now plans to fly to Jordan and then drive to Israel from there. The damage to the lab has probably set his research back about six months, he says.\n\nIn a message to researchers seen by Nature, the Weizmann Institute said the strike had caused “substantial damage” and affected most buildings. It advised that only authorized people are allowed on campus until further notice.\n\nA spokesperson for the institute says that it is “in contact with the relevant security and emergency agencies, and is taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety of employees and the campus”.\n\nSerious restrictions\n\nResearchers in Iran have also been affected by the escalating conflict. They are avoiding in-person meetings at universities and have taken their work online, out of fear that their universities and research institutes could become military targets, says Abbas Edalat, a British–Iranian computer scientist and mathematician at Imperial College London. “It is a serious restriction” because researchers won’t be able to continue their lab experiments, he says. The disruption comes on the back of years of on-and-off international economic sanctions that have hindered academics’ ability to do research and travel to conferences, says Edalat. Iranian science is “paying a high price”, says Encieh Erfani, an Iranian cosmologist now at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada.",

The city of Taizhou in Zhejiang province will pay university graduates up to 100,000 yuan to resettle to the coastal locale. And Hunan province will provide a sum of up to 1 million yuan to doctoral students who move there from abroad.\n\nAcross China, cities and provinces are seeking researchers, students and innovators — both home-grown and from abroad. In return, they’re offering large sums of money, as well as housing, health care, work for their spouses and other benefits. That’s on top of the generous salaries being offered by universities, and research funding from the central government.\n\n“The competition for talent is intense both across China and within different districts of the same city,” says Yanbo Wang, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nThese efforts could soon benefit from the recent tightening of US immigration rules, particularly those targeting Chinese nationals, say researchers. On 28 May, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, announced that the country would start revoking visas of Chinese students and enhance scrutiny of all visa applications from China.\n\nSome US researchers with ties to China might have been debating whether to return there. “The Trump administration has made that decision much, much easier than ever before,” says Wang.\n\nLocal and global\n\nRecruiting researchers and highly skilled workers is central to China’s push for economic and social development and self-reliance. At an event last week to celebrate science and technology workers, China’s President Xi Jinping said: “A country’s technological innovation capacity depends on talent.”\n\nIn the past, China had a few central-government policies designed to recruit talent from abroad. One was the Thousand Talents Plan, which aimed to attract elite international scientists to make the country a global leader in science and technology. But the United States and other governments began to worry that the programme could be a vessel for China to steal intellectual property or trade secrets. Although this was proved only in rare cases, Chinese talent programmes are still viewed with suspicion by US government agencies.\n\nThere are now hundreds of talent-recruitment policies at the central, provincial and city levels, says Wang. The initiatives are tiered, from highly competitive programmes seeking to attract elite researchers and innovators to those encouraging skilled workers to move to specific cities or regions.\n\nSome programmes mainly target international researchers, including a continuation of the Thousand Talents Plan and the Overseas Young Elite Recruitment Program, which have essentially been reorganized under the High-End Foreign Talents Plan.\n\nBut most initiatives are open to talent based anywhere, including in China, reflecting the changing dynamics in the country, says Wang.\n\nTwo decades ago, overseas talent would have been considered the cream of the crop, says Wang. “However, these days, the talent pool inside China is pretty deep.” He notes the success of technology start-up DeepSeek, which has released large-language models that impressed the world, built by a team made up largely of graduates and PhD students at top Chinese universities.\n\nThis “broader policy shift underscores a growing emphasis on indigenous innovation and technological self-sufficiency,” says Marina Zhang, who studies innovation with a focus on China at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia.",

          "abstract": "Looking for greater real-world impact as a circular-economy researcher, Julian Kirchherr now works across management consultancy and academia.Credit: Jacobs Stock Photography/Getty\n\nWhen I was growing up, many teenagers dreamed of becoming a chief executive, but I always wanted to be a professor. I imagined writing papers that would shape how businesses operate and how governments think. But roughly a decade later, as a 28-year-old assistant professor of business sustainability, I found myself standing for too long in the shower one day, feeling beaten down and generally out of control. I was caught in a system that demanded ever more grant applications and highly cited papers.\n\nIt was September 2017, nine months into my tenure-track position at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, and I had just published an analysis of many of the ways in which the circular economy has been conceptualized1. The circular-economy model is broadly about using resources more efficiently to support sustainable development, although interpretations vary. Many praised my article as the most nuanced analysis of the concept so far. Yet, to me, it encapsulated everything I found frustrating about academia: scholars were applauding conceptual work, but I wanted to have real-world impact. There had to be a better way.\n\nCareers advice from scientists in industry\n\nEarlier in my career, I had worked as a management consultant at the Berlin office of a firm called McKinsey, which had helped to fund the PhD I needed for a career in academia. Despite some initial scepticism, I came to admire the company’s results-driven culture. Consultants, despite all the jokes, have to deliver impact, or they are not hired again. So, in early 2018, 14 months into my tenure-track post, I resigned and returned to McKinsey.\n\nBut my resignation from academia was only partial. I had secured research funding, which gave me the flexibility to negotiate a 10% academic role at Utrecht. And that is how my life as a ‘pracademic’ began.\n\nA foot in both camps\n\nA pracademic is someone with one foot in academia and the other in practice, and I stumbled across the term one day while procrastinating on LinkedIn. Although new to me then, the term has been around for at least 25 years.\n\nWhen I rejoined McKinsey, I started in a relatively junior role. At first, I kept my academic work mostly quiet. Consulting has an all-in culture, and I worried that a side gig might raise doubts about my commitment. Only in late 2022, after being elected a partner who holds equity in the firm, did I begin to speak openly about my dual path.\n\nThat shift helped to unlock synergies between my roles. Some ideas I explored at the university started to shape my consulting work — and vice versa. However, it did not start out this way. Originally, I had imagined carving out Fridays for research, hoping that insights from those days would inform my consulting work in the week that followed. But that plan quickly unravelled. Consulting is unpredictable, and Fridays rarely stayed free for research.\n\nAnd few clients were interested in my circular-economy work, so I developed expertise in a very different area. One of my first projects after returning to McKinsey involved helping a government to rethink how to attract and retain talent in the public sector — including how to design career paths. Unsurprisingly, I advocated greater flexibility. These topics stuck with me, and today I mostly specialize in what McKinsey calls ‘people and organizational performance’.\n\nBuilding a circular economy\n\nAlthough most of my consulting work has little to do with my academic research, I value being a pracademic. Above all, I appreciate the freedom to follow ideas that genuinely interest me — and I feel most alive as a scholar when writing about them. Some of my work is highly applied. For example, I have collaborated with the European Commission on making the hydrogen ‘value chain’ more circular2, which is integral for Europe’s decarbonization goals. The value chain covers everything involved in hydrogen production, including the equipment used along the way. The project explored measures such as setting recycling targets for rare metals — including iridium, which is essential for hydrogen production.\n\nLiving in two professional worlds also sparks fresh ideas for my research. At McKinsey, I frequently help organizations to develop skill taxonomies — frameworks that define the essential workplace competencies that employees need to perform effectively in their roles. That work inspired a research paper on skill taxonomies for businesses transitioning to a circular economy3. Several companies now use it to shape job ads and training programmes.\n\nTaking a prod at ‘productivity’\n\nBeing a pracademic has also allowed me to be more controversial. My most-read paper — titled Bullshit in the Sustainability and Transitions Literature: A Provocation4 — mocks the tendency of many scholars to chase citations over genuine insight. Numerous academics praised it, but some found it too harsh. Had I stayed on the conventional academic path, I might have been too wary of that criticism to write the article at all.\n\nPerhaps because of this freedom, I’ve also had academic success: my Google Scholar profile is approaching 20,000 citations, and Stanford University’s database ranks me in the top 1% of scientists globally in terms of citation impact. More meaningfully, my research has been featured in more than 200 policy reports by institutions including the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nI maintain that my academic work offers a strong return on investment for any university that keeps me on the payroll. At McKinsey, the value might be less obvious at times, given my content focus, although from time to time I develop consulting work that’s rooted in my research. For instance, some months ago, I proposed to the governing body of a large city a project to transform it into a ‘circular city’ — an idea that those involved have now agreed to pursue. The work will focus on reducing the use of resources and improving reuse and recycling, drawing on insights from a research project that I continue to lead.",

Pig embryos with human heart cells have survived for 21 days.Credit: Daniel Sambraus/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers have reported growing hearts containing human cells in pig embryos for the first time. The embryos survived for 21 days, and in that time their tiny hearts started beating. The findings were presented this week at the annual meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research in Hong Kong.\n\nScientists developing human–animal chimaeras grow human cells in animal embryos, with the aim of one day generating animals with human organs that can be transplanted into people. This could provide a way to address the global shortage of organs for transplantation.\n\nOne approach to developing chimaeras involves creating animal embryos that lack some of the genes needed to produce a specific organ, such as the heart. Human stem cells are then injected into the embryos, with the hope that the human cells — rather than those of the animal – will form that organ. Several groups have used this method to grow human muscle and blood-vessel cells in pig embryos.\n\nPigs are a suitable donor species because the size and anatomy of their organs are comparable with those of humans, says Lai Liangxue, a developmental biologist at the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who led the latest work. Lai’s team has previously grown early-stage human kidneys in pig embryos that survived for up to a month in pregnant sows. He wanted to see whether similar results were possible for the heart.\n\nBeating heart\n\nIn their study, which has not been peer reviewed, Lai and his team reprogrammed human stem cells to bolster their ability to survive in a pig, by introducing genes that prevent cell death and enhance cell growth. They then generated pig embryos in which two specific genes that have key roles in heart development were knocked out. A handful of human stem cells were introduced into the pig embryos at the morula stage, soon after fertilization — a point at which the embryo consists of a ball of about a dozen cells that are rapidly dividing. The embryos were then transferred to surrogate pigs.\n\nThe team found that the embryos grew for up to 21 days, after which they did not survive. Lai says it’s possible the human cells disrupted the function of the pig hearts.\n\nWhen the researchers took a closer look at the embryonic hearts, they found that they had grown to a size equivalent to that of a human heart at the same stage of development — the size of a fingertip — and were beating, says Lai. The human cells could be identified because they had been tagged with a luminescent biomarker and were glowing, he adds.",

          "authors": "Jack Leeming",
          "abstract": "In early May, European politicians and university leaders gathered in Paris at Sorbonne University to deliver a message to US researchers affected by cuts made by the administration of US President Donald Trump: move here instead.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and French President Emmanuel Macron announced a 2-year funding package worth €500 million (US$571 million) to support researchers who want to move to the continent, as part of a scheme named Choose Europe.\n\nAlthough von der Leyen didn’t name the United States or its president explicitly at the 5 May gathering, she said that parts of the world were questioning “free and open research”, describing that attitude as a “gigantic miscalculation”.\n\nIn April, the French government announced that money from the country’s €54-billion France 2030 strategic investment initiative had been set aside to fund international researchers who would like to work in France. Macron confirmed at the Sorbonne meeting that the separate €100-million cash boost would fund half of the costs of scientific projects involving international researchers moving to France.\n\nUS brain drain: the scientists seeking jobs abroad amid Trump’s assault on research\n\nThese announcements are the results of intense lobbying both in the French parliament and at the European level. A French-led conference, held in Brussels on 15 April and attended by French academic leaders and European policymakers, discussed issues around researcher mobility, partnerships and research programmes to help European scientific diplomacy get to grips with the changing global landscape.\n\nEconomist Jean-François Huchet, who is vice-president of France Universités, an association of higher-education organizations based in Paris and Brussels, hopes that coordinating the response at the European rather than country level will help to convince US researchers of Europe’s seriousness, and enable the region to accommodate more of those who want to move. On 19 March, a letter signed by research ministers from 13 European Union member states was sent to Ekaterina Zaharieva, the EU’s commissioner for startups, research and innovation. It asked for dedicated funding (subsequently granted by the €500 million for Choose Europe) and a dedicated immigration framework to “seize this historical moment”.\n\n“All those researchers want to find a new country, a new possibility to continue their work. It’s really important for them to continue working. That’s the reason why I pushed with Commissioner Zaharieva to add [these funds] to Choose Europe. We want to help researchers coming from all parts of the world, especially the United States,” says Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament (MEP) who sits on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Grudler initiated a separate lobbying letter that was sent on 24 March and addressed to both Zaharieva and von der Leyen.\n\n“We can offer a lot of things: world-class universities, academic freedom, research ecosystems focused on excellence, and freedom and support to scientists,” he says.\n\nJānis Paiders, the deputy state secretary for the Ministry of Education and Science of Latvia, adds that his country was among those to endorse the 19 March letter “because academic freedom is under threat across the world”. He also notes there is “an ever-increasing need for Europe’s competitiveness as a whole”. Paiders calls for an “activity boom” to “welcome brilliant talents from abroad”, saying the policy aligns with both European and Latvian priorities.\n\nGrudler’s 24 March letter, signed by 50 MEPs, stated: “In response to this crisis, the European Union must act swiftly to establish itself as a safe haven for these scientific talents. We have the tools and levers to do so, but we must accelerate and expand our response.” The letter also called for an accelerated visa strategy.\n\nPush–pull effects\n\nThere is growing evidence that many US researchers are considering moving abroad. An analysis of Nature Careers jobs-board data showed that US applications for European vacancies increased by 32% in March, compared with the same month in 2024. And a self-selected poll of Nature readers in March found that 75% of respondents were keen to leave the country.\n\nBut some question whether these trends will manifest as a large-scale exodus of talent. For one thing, whereas early-career researchers might be mobile, senior academics, who are likely to be more attractive strategically for European policymakers, could find it harder to leave. “I would expect US politics to have the strongest effects on PhD applicants, finishing PhD students and postdocs. These people are not as deeply attached to the US academic system yet,” says Robert Basedow, who researches international political economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\nUS epidemiologist Scott Delaney is one academic who would struggle to leave. “I have two kids in grade school, ageing parents and a partner who loves her job here in the States.” Delaney runs a laboratory at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant has been cancelled. “Relocating abroad would be a major disruption for all of them.”\n\nOn top of that, there is a big difference in the salary a scientist might expect in Europe compared with that in the United States. In France, for instance, a mid-career researcher might earn around €3,600 a month before taxes. A postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in California, by contrast, would stand to earn the equivalent of around €6,000 a month, according to an analysis by The New York Times.\n\nTrump gutted two landmark environmental reports — can researchers save them?\n\n“It has to be a competitive situation to be able to attract researchers to come out” of the United States, says Thomas Kimbis, chief executive of the US National Postdoctoral Association in Bethesda, Maryland. However, he says, “it depends what happens over the coming months. I think the more time postdocs are sitting without a position, the more attractive just having a position, any position, becomes.”\n\nThere are differences, too, in expenses: Europe is generally cheaper to live in. “You have a huge difference in salary, but of course once you integrate the fees for US education, social security and health care, it’s not as big as the headline figure,” says Huchet.\n\nAnd some think that any single fund won’t achieve large structural changes. “Although ultimately, top US universities have enormous funds, making it quite difficult for many European and other institutions to offer comparable salaries and research conditions, I do not think that a new EU fund can structurally change this situation,” adds Basedow. “Ironically, only Trump can do this, by taxing and eroding the funding and endowments of top US schools and thus undermining the material situation for academics in these places,” he concludes.\n\nChoose Europe’s €500-million funding pledge is also dwarfed by the scale of the cuts the Trump administration is seeking — and has already made — to US science. In May, for example, it proposed cuts of around $5 billion to the country’s National Science Foundation (NSF) budget for 2026, and a $93-million cut to the NSF’s internal expenses. The NIH, the country’s main biomedical and public-health research funder, reportedly faces cuts of almost $18 billion next year. And the value of cancelled NIH grants already totals $8 billion (see ‘Matters of scale’). The EU’s research fund, Horizon Europe, is the largest pot of scientific funding in the world, with a budget of €93.5 billion to be spent until 2027.\n\nSources: Cancelled grants: Grant-watch.us (go.nature.com/4keqthj); NIH/NSF: Nature https://doi.org/prfr (2025)\n\n“Half-a-billion euros and governments that don’t openly sneer at scientists sounds really attractive right now,” says Delaney. But, he adds, “While the €500-million investment is huge, it’s still only a fraction of what the US government spends on health research every year.”\n\nPan-European plans\n\nIndividual universities and organizations in the EU have also announced separate support packages to lure US researchers. In March, Aix-Marseille University in France announced a €15-million programme to attract researchers.\n\nIts announcement was followed by one from the Free University of Brussels (VUB), which funded 12 postdoctoral positions. The Netherlands has also said it plans to open a fund to attract international researchers.\n\nSpain has moved its international-competitiveness budget forward to spend more in this funding window, and is offering an additional €200,000 for each project for US researchers joining institutions in the country.\n\nIn April, the research council of Norway, the country’s main government research funder, pledged 100 million kroner (US$9.9 million) to attract researchers from abroad.\n\n“This is a strategic opportunity that Europe wants to exploit and hopefully will be able to exploit,” says Marianne Riddervold, who researches transatlantic relations at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs in Oslo.",

Credit: Salah Obayya\nChangemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates individuals who have fought racism in science and who champion inclusion. The series often highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nWhen Salah Obayya quit his job at the University of Glamorgan (now part of the University of South Wales) in Pontypridd, UK, in 2012 to lead a new venture at Zewail City of Science and Technology, an Egyptian research and technology park now in Giza, it was a risky career move. He had been recruited to start up the Center for Photonics and Smart Materials (CPSM), with a mission to conduct advanced nanophotonics research. He took on the challenge in the hope that it would give him an opportunity to help shape the future of higher-education institutions in Africa.\n\nWhy Africans should be telling the story of human origins\n\nHe became director-general of research institutes at Zewail City in 2015, a role that allowed him to help broker partnerships between research centres and universities in North and sub-Saharan Africa. Now, as the director of CPSM, Obayya leads teams of researchers based at various Egyptian universities, and conducts in-person and virtual training in photonics — the study of light waves. He also lectures at Zewail City’s University of Science and Technology.\n\nIn 2019, the United Nations science organization UNESCO named Obayya as chair on innovative technologies for sustainable development in Africa. And in 2023, the scientific society Optica, Advancing Optics and Photonics Worldwide, which is headquartered in Washington DC, awarded him its Diversity and Inclusion Advocacy Recognition prize for his work to promote equality, inclusion and diversity in photonics research, and his efforts to empower individuals, especially women, from diverse African backgrounds to pursue research in the field.\n\nObayya’s research focuses on developing nanophotonic devices and creating computational modelling techniques using artificial intelligence. In particular, he works on the development of green nanophotonic technology in an effort to enhance the efficiency of solar cells, which is key to boosting sustainable-energy efforts. Through the Advanced Training Programme in Photonics for African Graduate Students, he trained female researchers, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, and helped them to develop their research capabilities in photonics. Since 2019, he has provided free courses and workshops to students from all African backgrounds.\n\nObayya explains to Nature how his passion for promoting science in Africa led directly to his supporting gender equality in photonics, and why development can move forward only if barriers to women’s career advancement are removed.\n\nWhy is diversity and inclusion in science important to you?\n\nDuring my time in the United Kingdom, where I interacted with colleagues from different backgrounds, I was impressed by how that environment fostered good performance. I realized the importance of diversity, and became aware that my home country of Egypt was missing out on the full power of diversity. The lack of highly trained women in nanotechnology research in Africa means a 50% shortage of the creativity and research expertise that diversity can provide.\n\nI want to ensure that Africans take part in the AI revolution\nAfrica needs a scientific renaissance that not only provides opportunities and roles for researchers of different genders and from different ethnic backgrounds, but also unites these efforts through mentorship and continuous support. After I returned home, promoting diversity among my students and in my team for all African races and genders became one of my most important goals.\n\nFunded by UNESCO, my team and I ran the African graduate training programme to provide African university graduates, especially women, with the opportunity to receive free training in advanced technological applications and to develop their skills and research capabilities to improve their access to master’s, PhD and postdoctoral programmes and the international job market.\n\nWhat made you realize that you wanted to work to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in science?\n\nI returned home with a passion for promoting photonics research in Africa. As director of the CPSM, I was shocked to find that the vast majority of applicants for master’s degrees were women, but that there was a severe shortage of female PhD and postdoc scientists.",

          "abstract": "Eight new members have been appointed to the powerful Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which plays a large part in deciding which vaccines are administered to US children and adults. Credit: Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty\n\nAn emergency physician, critics of COVID-19 vaccines and an obstetrician who once advised a supplement company are among the eight advisers hand-picked by vaccine sceptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the head of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to provide advice on vaccines to the federal government.\n\nKennedy announced his roster for the influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on 11 June — just two days after he fired all 17 existing members of the committee, which he accused of “malevolent malpractice”. The ACIP advises US public-health officials as to who should receive approved vaccines, and when. Those recommendations are often used to guide whether public and private health-insurance programmes will pay for the vaccines.\n\nKennedy has pledged that the ACIP will re-evaluate the US vaccine schedule for children — the list of which vaccines children should get and when they should get them. The shake-up of the committee is “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines”, Kennedy said in a post on the social-media platform X.\n\nWill RFK Jr’s vaccine agenda make America contagious again?\n\nSeveral of the new ACIP members have expressed public support for vaccines. But a number have also expressed scepticism: one serves on the board of an anti-vaccination organization, and a second has been a prominent sceptic of COVID-19 vaccines on social media. As first reported by the biomedical news outlet STAT, Kennedy included four of the new committee members in the dedication to his 2021 book The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health.\n\n“This is a disaster for public health,” says Adam Ratner, a paediatric infectious-diseases physician in New York City. “It has the potential to set us back decades.” The HHS did not respond to a request for comment before this article was published.\n\nFar-reaching implications\n\nInfectious-disease specialists worry about the implications if the ACIP were to vote to recommend fewer vaccines or fewer doses than are currently advised. Paul Offit — an infectious-diseases paediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania who co-invented a rotavirus vaccine and served on the ACIP from 1998 to 2003 — says insurers don’t have to cover vaccines that aren’t recommended by the committee. And “doctors or pharmacists who give vaccines may feel that they would be liable for giving that vaccine”, he adds.\n\nEven people who can pay for vaccines out of pocket might find them harder to get without an ACIP recommendation, says Arthur Reingold, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley, because overall demand would decrease, potentially leading some pharmacies to stop stocking them.\n\nOffit notes that at the ACIP’s next meeting, which starts on 25 June, the panel is scheduled to discuss whether to recommend vaccines for COVID-19, human papillomavirus, meningococcal disease and respiratory syncytial virus. “These are established vaccines, and we’re voting on them?” Offit says. “The entire childhood and adult immunization schedule is on the table.”\n\nHow to speak to a vaccine sceptic: research reveals what works\n\nKennedy has criticized the previous ACIP line-up for what he calls rampant conflicts of interest. On 12 June, the biopharma news outlet Endpoints News reported that two members of Kennedy’s ACIP roster, Robert Malone and Martin Kulldorff, have received payments for serving as expert witnesses in lawsuits against US pharmaceutical company Merck concerning two of its vaccines. Malone said on X that this work ended six years ago.\n\nKennedy has also said that past committee members did not demand safety trials that he considers to be adequate, with control groups that received a placebo, before recommending vaccines.\n\nBut many vaccine studies do include placebo controls, Ratner says, unless doing so is unethical. And Reingold, who has previously served on the ACIP, says that the committee has strict policies regarding conflicts of interest and that members must recuse themselves from any vote that might pose a conflict. “The issue of potential conflicts of interest has been radically overblown and unfairly called into question the objectivity of this panel,” he says.\n\nOffit says several independent groups have reviewed previous ACIP members and found no conflicts of interest. “Now, the conflict of interest is real, because these folks are indebted to RFK Jr, who just gave them this position,” he says.\n\nVetting process\n\nResearchers are also concerned about a loss of expertise on the panel. With a dearth of vaccine specialists, the committee’s new line-up is “disturbing”, says Nancy Bennett, a public-health specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\n\nIn the past, members were nominated and then vetted by staff at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before their names were sent to the head of the CDC and, finally, the head of the HHS for approval. Bennett says the vetting process sometimes took years. “The ACIP was meant to be composed of people with deep expertise in the area,” Ratner says. “That’s what we have lost.”\n\nHere, Nature takes a look at all eight new members of the panel.\n\nJoseph Hibbeln\n\nJoseph Hibbeln is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist who once worked as a researcher at the US National Institutes of Health. In the past few years, his papers1 have focused on the connection between nutrition and various disorders, including mental-health conditions, and his LinkedIn profile states that twenty-first-century diets provide “inadequate brain nutrients and are likely contributing to the high burden of mental illnesses worldwide”. A search of PubMed, a database of biomedical papers, did not bring up any papers he has authored about vaccines or infectious disease. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMartin Kulldorff\n\nMartin Kulldorff is a Swedish epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Brownstone Institute, a think tank based in West Hartford, Connecticut, that formed “to provide an independent voice for personal liberty” and to oppose lockdown policies instituted by public officials during the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with Jayanta Bhattacharya, the current head of the US National Institutes of Health, Kulldorff was among the writers of the 2020 Great Barrington Declaration, which advocated against COVID-19 lockdowns except for members of vulnerable populations and drew much pushback from the medical community.\n\nLast year, Kulldorff wrote in the policy magazine City Journal that he had been fired from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for refusing a COVID-19 vaccine, even though he already had immunity as a result of being infected. He also wrote that “vaccines are a vital medical invention, allowing people to obtain immunity without the risk that comes from getting sick”, but said that trials of COVID-19 vaccines early in the pandemic were not properly designed. Kulldorff did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nRetsef Levi\n\nRetsef Levi is a researcher focusing on operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. He has published several papers on COVID-19, including one2 expressing concerns about side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. In a post on X in 2023, Levi said: “The evidence is mounting and indisputable that MRNA vaccines cause serious harm including death, especially among young people. We have to stop giving them immediately!” He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRobert Malone",

          "abstract": "Rao Yi is a leading reformer of science and education in China. Rao began his career in the United States in the 1980s. After he returned to China in 2007, he introduced practices that have revitalized life-sciences research in the country, including the use of tenure and of peer review to evaluate academics’ merits. Now based at Peking University in Beijing, he runs a leading brain-research laboratory, and holds other leadership positions.\n\nHe’s also famously outspoken. In 2008, Rao renounced his US passport to protest against policies brought in by former president George W. Bush after the terror attacks of 11 September 2001. Rao criticized US policies during the COVID-19 pandemic after his uncle died in New York, and vehemently rejected the lab-leak theory. And he is an energetic advocate for China’s talent-recruitment schemes.\n\nNature asked Rao how he sees China’s role in the life sciences — and what could make China into a biotechnology superpower.\n\nAccording to the Nature Index, China is less strong in life sciences than in physical sciences. Why is that?\n\nIn mathematics, physics and chemistry, Chinese funding has caught up with that of the United States, or almost. But the number of biomedical scientists supported by research funding in China is lower than in the United States, because the latter has the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest source of medical-research funding in the world. The lag in papers is almost proportional to the funding difference.\n\nHow China is vying to attract the world’s top scientific talent\n\nChina will remain behind the United States as long as it does not have an NIH equivalent. If the administration of US President Donald Trump keeps cutting funds for the NIH and NIH-supported institutions, including Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Columbia University in New York City, then China will catch up or surpass the United States soon.\n\nIn plant biology, China is now ahead of the United States, according to the Nature Index, again because of funding levels — in this case, much larger in China. The nation has long been worried about food security and has invested more in plant-related research than any other country has.\n\nHow can China become a leader in biotechnology innovation?\n\nIt will take both funding and real reform for China to surpass the United States in biomedical sciences. The main problem hindering Chinese science is that competing influences such as personal relationships go against merit, rigour and excellence. A system selecting and supporting the best scientists who are willing to work for Chinese development is key. If China allows mediocrity to prevail, then it might overtake the United States in quantity of papers, but not in quality.\n\nA researcher in Rao Yi’s brain lab at Peking University in Beijing.Credit: Andrea Verdelli\n\nFor example, in 1950, when the People’s Republic of China was new and internationally trained Chinese doctoral scholars were few, many of those in scientific and educational leadership positions — from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to Peking and Tsinghua Universities in Beijing — had doctorates from other countries. After the Cultural Revolution in 1976, this remained the case.\n\nIf you look at the same leadership layer now, the number who obtained their PhDs abroad is low. At the CAS, the president and vice-presidents all have PhDs from Chinese institutes. Yet China is trying hard to get the best scientists, especially those with doctorates from top international universities.\n\nWhich biotech fields might China excel in by 2050?\n\nIf allowed to speculate, I would predict that Chinese biotech will take off in agriculture, with new kinds of seed. As for the biomedical sphere, my predictions would be gene therapy, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases and cancer, helped by artificial intelligence (AI) and Chinese omics databanks.\n\nChina is lagging behind the United States in precision medicine because China is weak in human-genetics research, although overly abundant in less-meaningful DNA sequencing.

That’s the subject of a thought experiment published by researchers today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1.\n\nEarth shattered heat records in 2023 and 2024: is global warming speeding up?\n\nThe answer: “As early as 1885,” says study co-author Benjamin Santer, an independent climate scientist based in Los Angeles, California. That’s when researchers could have “confidently disentangled” a human-caused signal of climate change from natural variations, or noise, in the data, he says.\n\nScientists Eunice Newton Foote and John Tyndall first discovered the heat-absorbing effects of carbon dioxide in experiments they ran independently in the 1850s. But it wasn’t until more than a century later that the scientific community agreed it was clear that rising emissions of CO2 and other gases were causing Earth to warm.\n\nSanter and his colleagues, however, now say that unmistakable signs of human-caused, or anthropogenic, climate change would already have been around before the end of the nineteenth century — a time when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were starting to rise because of the Industrial Revolution in Europe, but were still much lower than today. And such signs would have been detectable, if modern technology were available then.\n\nModelling the past\n\nWater vapour, CO2 and other greenhouse gases trap infrared radiation emitted by Earth’s surface. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels pump these gases into the air, warming the lower layer of the atmosphere. But greenhouse gases have the opposite effect on the layer above this one, which is called the stratosphere and starts around 7 kilometres above Earth’s surface. As the lower layer holds in Earth’s warmth, less infrared radiation reaches the stratosphere, and it cools.\n\nTo carry out their thought experiment, the authors decided to focus on the predicted cooling of the mid-to-upper stratosphere, which is less affected by fluctuations from weather patterns than the warming of the lower atmosphere. Temperatures in the stratosphere are typically measured using Earth-sensing satellites, such as those operated by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nThree ways to cool Earth by pulling carbon from the sky",

Scientists are developing mice with human cells.Credit: Arthur Chien/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers have developed mice with organs containing human cells, using a convenient and surprising approach — injecting the cells directly into the amniotic fluid of pregnant mice. The method resulted in baby mice with a sprinkling of human cells in their intestines, liver and brain. But researchers say that, for the technique to be useful, more work needs to be done to increase the proportion of human cells that grow in the organs.\n\nHuman–animal chimaeras are an exciting yet challenging area of research. Human cells are coaxed to grow in animal embryos, allowing researchers to study human tissue development. But the long-term goal of the work is to grow human organs that can be harvested for transplantation.\n\nThe latest technique, presented at the International Society for Stem Cell Research meeting in Hong Kong on 12 June, could be “game-changing” for the field, says Hideki Masaki, a stem-cell scientist at the Institute of Science Tokyo, who attended the session. The data have not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nTo create chimaeras, researchers typically introduce human stem cells into embryos of another species, often pigs or mice, growing in a dish. But one of the challenges with this technique is that not many human cells survive, and those that do, do not endure for long. And the injected cells are pluripotent, meaning that they could theoretically develop into any cell type in the body — a process that researchers have to find ways of controlling.\n\nXiling Shen, a biomedical engineer at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, wanted to look for ways of improving these techniques to ensure that more human cells survive the procedure, and that they target specific organs. He and Qiang Huang, a developmental biologist at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation in Los Angeles, California, and their colleagues thought that the human cells might be more resilient if they were allowed to mature into 3D human-tissue models, known as organoids, before injection.\n\n‘Crazy’ experiment\n\nThe team used reprogrammed stem cells to grow human organoids of the gut, liver and brain in a dish. Shen says the researchers then injected the organoids into the amniotic fluid of female mice carrying early-stage embryos. “We didn’t even break the embryonic wall” to introduce the cells to the embryos, says Shen. The female mice carried the embryos to term.\n\n“It’s a crazy experiment; I didn’t expect anything,” says Shen.\n\nWithin days of being injected into the mouse amniotic fluid, the human cells begin to infiltrate the growing embryos and multiply, but only in the organ they belonged to: gut organoids in the intestines; liver organoids in the liver; and cerebral organoids in the cortex region of the brain. One month after the mouse pups were born, the researchers found that roughly 10% of them contained human cells in their intestines — making up about 1% of intestinal cells. “You get sections of the intestine that originate from injected human organoids,” says Shen. The proportion of human cells was lower in the liver and brain. Overall, success rates were low, says Shen, who is seeking ways to boost them.\n\nThe human cells seemed to be functioning. For example, the human liver cells produced human albumin, a common liver protein. And the cells were still present two months after birth, says Shen. “These cells are pretty stable.”",

The poachers, who are usually armed, could target me or follow me to the sanctuary. Only my parents know what I do.\n\nPangolins are worth a lot of money on the black market for their scales, which are believed to bring luck and are used in traditional medicine in Africa and Asia. The poachers use sharp tools, and some of the animals are missing legs or their tails. Others are very young and have to be hand-reared.\n\nThere are two types of pangolin in Zambia, the ground pangolin (Smutsia temminckii) and the tree pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis). In the picture, taken in March this year, I’m holding a ground pangolin; it’s less than two years old and was in poor condition when it arrived.\n\nI’ve been doing this job for two years, living in the sanctuary for seven days at a time with a few days’ rest in between. Pangolins in captivity will often starve themselves if they’re in pain or stressed. They’re picky eaters, so I have to work out what each individual likes. I need to monitor that they’re putting on weight. It’s hard work.",

But how can non-experts achieve understanding from explanations that, by definition, they are ill-equipped to assess? Across 9 experiments with 6,698 participants (Study 1A = 737; 1B = 734; 1C = 733; 2A = 1,014; 2B = 509; 2C = 1,012; 3A = 1,026; 3B = 512; 4 = 421), we address this puzzle by focusing on scientific explanations with jargon. We identify ‘when’ and ‘why’ the inclusion of jargon makes explanations more satisfying, despite decreasing their comprehensibility. We find that jargon increases satisfaction because laypeople assume the jargon fills gaps in explanations that are otherwise incomplete. We also identify strategies for debiasing these judgements: when people attempt to generate their own explanations, inflated judgements of poor explanations with jargon are reduced, and people become better calibrated in their assessments of their own ability to explain.",

The current focus by practitioners on ‘social listening’ as the primary mechanism for detecting these harms is flawed, and we argue that mechanisms that effectively integrate and contextualize both offline and online data streams are required. We therefore outline a blueprint for a new model, the Community-Centered Exploration, Engagement, and Evaluation system. It draws on lessons learned from integrated epidemiological surveillance systems that merge multiple data streams. Such an approach can help detect and mitigate potential information harms, integrating community participation and response at its core. This community-driven model is designed to counteract the growing public distrust across a range of issues including public health, election integrity and climate.",

Observers were less able to accurately judge ties across different religions or wealth. Individuals in villages that cultivate coffee, requiring coordinated effort, demonstrated greater bias to view networks as connected.

However, this model has not been adequately tested with regionally specific, high-resolution archaeological data. Here we report excavation results from a high-altitude (1,073 m) cave, Dargan Shelter, in the upper Blue Mountains, which indicate that occupation first occurred ~20,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum, making this the highest elevation Pleistocene site identified in Australia so far. Findings include multiple in situ hearths and 693 stone artefacts, several of which were sourced from sites along the mountain range, providing evidence for previously undetected interactions to the north and south and the repeated use of this cold-climate landscape during the Late Pleistocene. Our results align the Australian continent with global sequences, which indicate that cold climates were not necessarily natural barriers to human mobility and occupation.",

          "abstract": "Assessing model uncertainty is crucial to quantitative political science. Yet, most available sensitivity analyses focus only on a few modeling choices, most notably the covariate space, while neglecting to jointly consider several equally important modeling choices simultaneously. In this article, we combine the exhaustive and systematic method of the Extreme Bounds Analysis with the more multidimensional logic underpinning the multiverse approach to develop an approach to sensitivity analyses. This allows us to systematically assess the degree and sources of model uncertainty across multiple dimensions, including the control set, fixed effect structures, SE types, sample selection, and dependent variable operationalization. We then apply this method to four prominent topics in political science: democratization, institutional trust, public good provision, and welfare state generosity. Results from over 3.6 bn estimates reveal widespread model uncertainty, not just in terms of the statistical significance of the effects, but also their direction, with most independent variables yielding a substantive share of statistically significant positive and negative coefficients depending on model specification. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of three distinct approaches to estimating the relative importance of different model specification choices: nearest 1-neighbor; logistic; and deep learning. All three approaches reveal that the impact of the covariate space is relatively modest compared to the impact of sample selection and dependent variable operationalization. We conclude that model uncertainty stems more from sampling and measurement than conditioning and discuss the methodological implications for how to assess model uncertainty in the social sciences.",

          "abstract": "Evolution of complexity in human languages has been vigorously debated, including the proposal that complexity can build in small, isolated populations but is often lost in situations of language contact. If it is generally true that small, isolated languages can build morphological complexity over time, but complexity tends to be lost in situations of language contact, then we should find that forms of language complexity that have evolved multiple times will tend to be associated with population size, isolation, and language age. We test this hypothesis by focusing on one particular form of morphological complexity, polysynthesis, where words built from many parts embody complex phrases. By assembling a global database of polysynthetic languages and conducting phylospatial analyses, we show that languages with highly complex word morphology are more likely to have small population sizes, less likely to occur with many other languages in direct contact, and have a greater tendency to be on long phylogenetically isolated lineages. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that languages that evolve in isolation for long periods may be more likely to accrue morphological complexity. Polysynthetic languages also tend to have higher levels of endangerment. Our results provide phylogenetically informed evidence that one particular form of complex language morphology is more likely to occur in small, isolated languages and is prone to loss in contact.",

          "abstract": "Choosing social partners is a potentially demanding task which involves paying attention to the right information while disregarding salient but possibly irrelevant features. The resultant trade-off between cost of evaluation and quality of decisions can lead to undesired bias. Information-processing abilities mediate this trade-off, where individuals with higher ability choose better partners leading to higher performance. By altering the salience of features, technology can modulate the effect of information-processing limits, potentially increasing or decreasing undesired biases. Here, we use game theory and multiagent reinforcement learning to investigate how undesired biases emerge, and how a technological layer (in the form of a perceptual intervention) between individuals and their environment can ameliorate such biases. Our results show that a perceptual intervention designed to increase the salience of outcome-relevant features can reduce bias in agents making partner choice decisions. Individuals learning with a perceptual intervention showed less bias due to decreased reliance on features that only spuriously correlate with behavior. Mechanistically, the perceptual intervention effectively increased the information-processing abilities of the individuals. Our results highlight the benefit of using multiagent reinforcement learning to model theoretically grounded social behaviors, particularly when real-world complexity prohibits fully analytical approaches.",

These results are not base rate artifacts, as we find no meaningful overrepresentation of Republicans among X users.

We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. The causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, safeguarding, and more.

          "abstract": "In an era increasingly influenced by autonomous machines, it is only a matter of time before strategic individual decisions that impact collective goods will also be made virtually through the use of artificial delegates. Through a series of behavioral experiments that combine delegation to autonomous agents and different choice architectures, we pinpoint what may get lost in translation when humans delegate to algorithms. We focus on the collective-risk dilemma, a game where participants must decide whether or not to contribute to a public good, where the latter must reach a target in order for them to keep their personal endowments. To test the effect of delegation beyond its functionality as a commitment device, participants are asked to play the game a second time, with the same group, where they are given the chance to reprogram their agents. As our main result we find that, when the action space is constrained, people who delegate contribute more to the public good, even if they have experienced more failure and inequality than people who do not delegate. However, they are not more successful. Failing to reach the target, after getting close to it, can be attributed to precision errors in the agent’s algorithm that cannot be corrected amid the game. Thus, with the digitization and subsequent limitation of our interactions, artificial delegates appear to be a solution to help preserving public goods over many iterations of risky situations. But actual success can only be achieved if humans learn to adjust their agents’ algorithms.",

Vimentin, a type of intermediate filament expressed in mesenchymal cells and involved in migration, forms a dense network in the cytoplasm that is constantly remodeling through filament transport, elongation/shortening, and subunit exchange. While it is known that filament elongation involves end-to-end annealing, the reverse process of filament shortening by fragmentation remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of in vitro reconstitution, probed by fluorescence imaging and atomic force microscopy, with theoretical modeling to uncover the molecular mechanism involved in filament breakage. We first show that vimentin filaments are composed of two populations of subunits, half of which are exchangeable and half immobile. We also show that the exchangeable subunits are tetramers. Furthermore, we reveal a mechanism of continuous filament self-repair, where a soluble pool of vimentin tetramers in equilibrium with the filaments is essential to maintain filament integrity. Filaments break due to local fluctuations in the number of tetramers per cross-section, induced by the constant subunit exchange. We determine that a filament tends to break if approximately four tetramers are removed from the same filament cross-section. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of association/dissociation and fragmentation to estimate the binding energy of a tetramer to a complete versus a partially disassembled filament. Our results provide a comprehensive description of vimentin turnover and reveal the link between subunit exchange and fragmentation.",

Our findings elucidate the interactions within the ADAM17–iRhom2 complex, the inhibitory mechanisms of the therapeutic MEDI3622 antibody and ADAM17 prodomain, and the previously unknown role of a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic reentry loop of iRhom2 involved in the mechanism of activation.

          "abstract": "Positive-strand RNA viruses are important pathogens of humans and plants. These viruses built viral replication organelles (VROs) with the help of co-opted host proteins and intracellular membranes to support robust virus replication in infected cells. Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a model (+)RNA virus, assembles membranous VROs, which are associated with vir-condensate substructures driven by TBSV p33 replication-associated protein. In this work, we provide evidence that the peroxisome-associated TBSV and the mitochondria-associated carnation Italian ringspot virus hijack the host small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) machinery in yeast model host and plants. Based on knockdown of components of the SUMO pathway, we show that SUMO machinery acts as a cellular proviral dependency factor during TBSV replication. The sumoylation machinery was found to be partially retargeted from the nucleus into vir-condensate associated with membranous VROs through direct interactions with TBSV p33. We developed a yeast-based sumoylation assay that demonstrated p33 sumoylation. Absence of sumoylation or mutations in SIM SUMO-interacting motif in p33 replication protein reduced the ability of p33 to form droplets in vitro via phase separation. We demonstrate that p33 sumoylation and its intrinsically disordered region play noncomplementary roles in droplet formation. Mutations in p33 sumoylation sites and p33-SIM sequence resulted in reduced-sized VROs, which showed diminished protection of TBSV p33 and the viral RNA from degradation and also reduced viral RNA recombination. Altogether, the co-opted host sumoylation machinery promotes viral replication and RNA recombination. This finding could provide opportunities for antiviral interventions via targeting protein posttranslational modifications.",

The drivers of plague seasonality remain poorly understood. Using a deterministic compartmental model, calibrated to rat and flea capture data, serological data collected in active rural foci, and human plague surveillance data, we analyzed the effects of seasonal rat and flea population dynamics on plague transmission. The models that incorporated seasonal fluctuations in rat and flea populations provided better predictive performances than those that did not. We found that a simpler mass-action model also performed well. Driven by these seasonal changes, the effective reproduction number (R e ) between rats peaks at 1.45 [95% credible interval (CI): 1.41, 1.48] in October and falls to 0.6 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.63) in March. We estimated that 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.9%) of rats are infected annually, indicating that plague is not the main driver of rat population changes. Using our model, we evaluated intervention strategies and found that targeting both rats and their fleas at the start of the epidemic season (July–September) was the most effective approach for reducing human plague cases. Such an approach contrasts with the reactive strategy currently employed in Madagascar. Our findings highlight the role of flea and rat populations in plague seasonality and identify strategies that could be deployed in Madagascar to better control plague epidemics.",

          "abstract": "Cancer therapy is limited by resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapeutic and/or by treatment-associated toxicity. Identifying molecular mechanisms that modulate cellular toxicity is crucial for enhancing treatment efficacy. We characterize CDADC1, a vertebrate-specific orphan enzyme, as an unprecedented eukaryotic dCTP deaminase. CDADC1 catalyzes the conversion of dCTP into dUTP. While bacteria use this activity to sustain proliferation, CDADC1 evolved independently and is not required for mammalian cell proliferation, as demonstrated in cell lines and by the normal growth and standard lifespan of Cdadc1-deficient mice. However, we uncover a role of CDADC1 in metabolizing nucleotide analogs gemcitabine and decitabine. Gain- and loss-of-function assays in cancer cell lines, along with ectopic mouse models of pancreatic cancer, show that CDADC1 reduces these drugs’ efficacy. By the same token, Cdadc1 −/− mice are hypersensitive to gemcitabine. Mechanistically, CDADC1 deaminates the active triphosphate form of gemcitabine and decitabine, rendering them susceptible to inactivation by deoxyuridine triphosphatase. In contrast, the dCMP deaminase DCTD contributes to cell proliferation and promotes gemcitabine and decitabine toxicity. Thus, CDADC1 underpins a previously unrecognized mechanism of intrinsic chemoresistance in cancer cells and has a nonredundant role in protecting from gemcitabine toxicity. CDADC1 reveals a clinically relevant metabolic pathway that might be exploited to enhance the efficacy of deoxycytidine analogs but calls for assessing CDADC1 status to avoid lethal toxicities.",

Experimental and simulation evidence shows that this simplistic view is untrue. We demonstrate that the failure of the classical mean curvature flow description of grain growth mainly originates from the shear deformation naturally coupled with GB motion (i.e., shear coupling). Our findings are built on large-scale microstructure evolution simulations incorporating the fundamental (crystallography-respecting) microscopic mechanism of GB migration. The nature of the deviations from curvature flow revealed in our simulations is consistent with observations in recent experimental studies on different materials. This work also demonstrates how to incorporate the mechanical effects that are essential to the accurate prediction of microstructure evolution.",

Using high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy, we determined the structures of Sus scrofa and Xenopus laevis GnRHRs bound to mammal GnRH, uncovering conserved and species-specific mechanisms of receptor activation and G protein coupling. The conserved “U”-shaped GnRH conformation mediates high-affinity binding through key interactions with residues such as K 3.32 , Y 6.51 , and Y 6.52 . Species-specific variations in extracellular loops and receptor–ligand contacts fine-tune receptor function, while ligand binding induces structural rearrangements, including N terminus displacement and TM6 rotation, critical for signaling. Structure–activity relationship analysis demonstrates how D-amino acid substitutions in GnRH analogs enhance stability and receptor affinity. Distinct binding modes of agonists and antagonists elucidate mechanisms of ligand-dependent activation and inactivation.

We identify 1,733 splice-disrupting mutations, with the most extreme variants likely being deleterious. We report that these variants are not distributed evenly across exons but are mostly concentrated in the ~8% of exons that are most susceptible to splicing mutations (i.e., hotspot exons). We demonstrate how multiple, splice-disrupting mutations in these exons can be reverted by the same ASOs targeting the splice sites of either their upstream or downstream flanking exons.

Although CD18 (LFA-1) has been implicated as a receptor on myeloid cells, the mechanisms underlying HlyA cytotoxicity to epithelial cells are poorly defined. Here, we show that HlyA secretion by UPEC markedly intensifies renal tubular epithelial injury in a murine model of ascending pyelonephritis. A CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen in renal collecting duct cells revealed an unexpected requirement for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in HlyA-induced cytotoxicity. Following internalization, HlyA triggered lysosomal permeabilization, resulting in protease leakage, cytoplasmic acidification, and mitochondrial impairment, culminating in rapid epithelial cell death—a pathway distinct from canonical membrane-disrupting mechanisms of other PFTs. Moreover, we identify the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) as a critical epithelial receptor for HlyA; genetic ablation or competitive inhibition of the HlyA–LDLR interaction fully abrogated cytotoxicity. Our findings detail a paradigm for HlyA function in which epithelial toxicity relies on LDLR-mediated endocytic uptake rather than plasma membrane poration. These mechanistic insights illuminate potential therapeutic strategies to attenuate HlyA-mediated tissue damage during UPEC infections.",

We find that Earth’s present-day convecting upper mantle has variable δ 13 C value from ~−10 to −4‰, significantly different from the δ 13 C value of peridotitic diamonds and with the highest values being restricted to the Atlantic. Evidence for significant mantle heterogeneity contrasts with previous assumptions and its origin remains puzzling being uncorrelated with geochemical markers associated with either subduction and surficial recycling processes or lower mantle contributions.

Legume crops like soybean were thought to have evolutionarily lost isoprene synthase (ISPS) and are typically considered nonemitters. Here, we report that damage to soybean leaves by wounding or burning triggered a burst of isoprene emission from the undamaged part of the leaves. In silico analysis identified intact ISPS genes in the soybean genome, with features similar to known ISPSs. Protein made from these gene sequences catalyzed isoprene production in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate. Isoprene emission in soybeans was linked to reduced photosynthesis rates and stomatal conductance.

          "abstract": "Theories on group-bias often posit an internal preparedness to bias one’s cognition to favor the in-group (often envisioned as a product of evolution). In contrast, other theories suggest that group-biases can emerge from nonspecialized cognitive processes. These perspectives have historically been difficult to disambiguate given that observed behavior can often be attributed to innate processes, even when groups are experimentally assigned. Here, we use modern techniques from the field of AI that allow us to ask what group biases can be expected from a learning agent that is a pure blank slate without any intrinsic social biases, and whose lifetime of experiences can be tightly controlled. This is possible because deep reinforcement-learning agents learn to convert raw sensory input (i.e. pixels) to reward-driven action, a unique feature among cognitive models. We find that blank slate agents do develop group biases based on arbitrary group differences (i.e. color). We show that the bias develops as a result of familiarity of experience and depends on the visual patterns becoming associated with reward through interaction. The bias artificial agents display is not a static reflection of the bias in their stream of experiences. In this minimal environment, the bias can be overcome given enough positive experiences, although unlearning the bias takes longer than acquiring it. Further, we show how this style of tabula rasa group behavior model can be used to test fine-grained predictions of psychological theories.",

These congestion games, a well-studied class of potential games, are characterized by individual agents having negligible effects on system performance, strongly aligned incentives, and well-understood advantageous properties of Nash equilibria. Despite the presence of static Nash equilibria, we demonstrate that MARL dynamics with heterogeneous learning rates can deviate from these equilibria, exhibiting instability and even chaotic behavior and resulting in increased social costs. Remarkably, even within these chaotic regimes, we show that the time-averaged macroscopic behavior converges to exact Nash equilibria, thus linking the microscopic dynamic complexity with traditional equilibrium concepts. By employing dynamical systems techniques, we analyze the interaction between individual-level adaptation and population-level outcomes, paving the way for studying heterogeneous learning dynamics in discrete time across more complex game scenarios.",

The most prominent theories of reciprocity, such as tit-for-tat or win-stay-lose-shift, are inflexible automata that lack a theory of mind—the human ability to infer the hidden mental states in others’ minds. Here, we develop a model of reciprocity with a theory of mind, the Bayesian Reciprocator. When making decisions, this model does not simply seek to maximize its own payoff. Instead, it also values the payoffs of others—but only to the extent it believes that those others are also cooperating in the same way. To compute its beliefs about others, the Bayesian Reciprocator uses a probabilistic and generative approach to infer the latent preferences, beliefs, and strategies of others through interaction and observation. We evaluate the Bayesian Reciprocator using a generator over games where every interaction is unique, as well as in classic environments such as the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. The Bayesian Reciprocator enables the emergence of both direct-reciprocity when games are repeated and indirect-reciprocity when interactions are one-shot but observable to others. In an evolutionary competition, the Bayesian Reciprocator outcompetes existing automata strategies and sustains cooperation across a larger range of environments and noise settings than prior approaches. This work quantifies the advantage of a theory of mind for cooperation in an evolutionary game theoretic framework and suggests avenues for building artificially intelligent agents with more human-like learning mechanisms that can cooperate across many environments.",

In analogy to unavoidable energy losses in conventional particle accelerators due to electromagnetic radiation and inelastic collisions, the system displays undesired water-wave dampening, which we address through the synchronized action of underwater wavemakers. Our analogies extend the resonance mechanisms of synchrotrons to generate and sustain gravity waves in closed waveguides efficiently.

Besides quantifying the performance of wave generation, our findings offer a framework for both industrial and computational applications, opening up unexplored possibilities in hydraulics, coastal science, and engineering.

          "abstract": "Biological microswimmers exhibit intricate taxis behaviors in response to environmental stimuli and swim in complex trajectories to navigate their environment. How microswimmers respond to stimulus instantaneously, and how adaptation to stimulus influences their long-term behavioral changes, remains largely unclear. Here, we report an oscillatory phototaxis observed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii at intermediate light intensities, where cells swim back-and-forth under a constant, unidirectional light stimulus due to alternation between positive and negative phototaxis. The phototaxis switching can be captured by the change in phase relationship between eyespot and helical swimming. Oscillatory phototaxis of individual cells leads to a global pattern of millimeter-scale propagating density bands that persists for ∼ 30 min. High-speed imaging and long-time tracking experiments at single-cell level verify a unified phototaxis mechanism that couples light detection, light adaptation, flagella responses, and behavioral switching. By experimentally tracking steady swimming and transient turning states, we verify that phototaxis transition is achieved via the modulation of flagella waveforms and flagella phase difference, which can be captured by a hydrodynamic model accounting for photoresponses. Adaptation acts effectively as an oscillator damper to mediate multipurpose tasking across multiple system levels (subcellular flagella beats, oscillatory phototaxis, colonial pattern formation) and timescales (from milliseconds to over 30 min). This adaptive phototaxis mechanism provides a comprehensive understanding of how microswimmers achieve complex behavioral changes across multiple temporal scales with a single sensor–actuator circuit featuring relatively simple adaptive feedback responses.",

Live animal incubations with 13 C-labeled methane and methanol, followed by nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry, confirmed that carbon derived from both compounds was actively incorporated into the tissues within five days.

          "abstract": "Adaptation to novel environments requires genetic variation, but whether adaptation typically acts upon preexisting genetic variation or must wait for new mutations remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Selection during domestication has been long used as a model to understand evolutionary processes, providing information not only on the phenotypes selected but also, in many cases, an understanding of the causal loci. For each of the causal loci that have been identified in maize, the selected allele can be found segregating in natural populations, consistent with their origin as standing genetic variation. The sole exception to this pattern is the well-characterized domestication locus tga1 ( teosinte glume architecture1 ), which has long been thought to be an example of selection on a de novo mutation. Here, we use a large dataset of maize and teosinte genomes to reconstruct the origin and evolutionary history of tga1 . We first estimated the age of tga1-maize using a genealogy-based method, finding that the allele arose approximately 42,000 to 49,000 y ago, predating the beginning of maize domestication. We also identify tga1-maize in teosinte populations, indicating that the allele can survive in the wild. Finally, we compare observed patterns of haplotype structure and mutational age distributions near tga1 with simulations, finding that patterns near tga1 in maize better resemble those generated under simulated selective sweeps on standing variation. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that maize domestication likely drew upon standing genetic variation at tga1 and cement the importance of standing variation in driving adaptation during domestication.",

Millions of individuals carry pathogenic genetic variants in PKD2 that cause a life-threatening condition called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Although ADPKD is a common monogenetic disorder, there is no drug cure or available therapeutics which address the underlying channel dysregulation. Furthermore, the structural and mechanistic impacts of most disease-causing variants are uncharacterized. Using direct cilia electrophysiology, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and superresolution imaging, we have found mechanistic differences in channel dysregulation caused by three germline missense variants located in PKD2’s pore helix 1. Variant C632R reduces protein thermal stability, resulting in impaired channel assembly and abolishes primary cilia trafficking. In contrast, variants F629S and R638C retain native cilia trafficking but exhibit gating defects. Cryo-EM structures (2.7 to 2.8 Å resolution) indicate loss of critical pore helix interactions which precipitate allosteric collapse of the channels inner gate. Results demonstrate how ADPKD-causing mutations cause mechanistically divergent and ranging impacts on PKD2 function, despite their shared structural proximity. These unexpected findings highlight the need for structural and biophysical characterization of polycystin variants, which will guide rational drug development of ADPKD therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Many dynamical systems can exist in alternative regimes for which small changes in an environmental driver can cause sudden jumps between regimes. In ecology, predicting the regime of population fluctuations under unobserved levels of an environmental driver has remained an unsolved challenge with important implications for conservation and management. Here, we show that integrating time-series data and information on a putative driver into a Gaussian Process regression model for the system’s dynamics allows us to predict dynamical regimes without the need to specify the equations of motion of the system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict fixed-point, cyclic, or chaotic dynamics under unseen levels of a control parameter for a range of simulated population dynamics models. For a model with an abrupt population collapse, we show that our approach goes beyond an early warning signal by characterizing the regime that follows the tipping point. We then apply our approach to data from an experimental microbial food web and from a lake planktonic food web. We find that we can reconstruct transitions away from chaos in the microbial food web and anticipate the dynamics of the oligotrophic regime in the planktonic food web. These results lay the groundwork for making rational decisions about preventing, or preparing for, regime shifts in natural ecosystems and other dynamical systems.",

          "abstract": "AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being employed in high-stakes decisions that impact both individuals and society at large, often without adequate safeguards to ensure safety, quality, and equity. Yet LLMs hallucinate, lack common sense, and are biased—shortcomings that may reflect LLMs’ inherent limitations and thus may not be remedied by more sophisticated architectures, more data, or more human feedback. Relying solely on LLMs for complex, high-stakes decisions is therefore problematic. Here, we present a hybrid collective intelligence system that mitigates these risks by leveraging the complementary strengths of human experience and the vast information processed by LLMs. We apply our method to open-ended medical diagnostics, combining 40,762 differential diagnoses made by physicians with the diagnoses of five state-of-the art LLMs across 2,133 text-based medical case vignettes. We show that hybrid collectives of physicians and LLMs outperform both single physicians and physician collectives, as well as single LLMs and LLM ensembles. This result holds across a range of medical specialties and professional experience and can be attributed to humans’ and LLMs’ complementary contributions that lead to different kinds of errors. Our approach highlights the potential for collective human and machine intelligence to improve accuracy in complex, open-ended domains like medical diagnostics.",

While most previous studies have focused on a few variables in isolation, here we investigated associations between a broad range of pregnancy- and birth-related variables and multivariate cortical brain MRI features. Our sample consisted of 8,396 children aged 8.9 to 11.1 y from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Through multiple correspondence analysis and factor analysis of mixed data, we distilled numerous pregnancy and birth variables into four overarching dimensions; maternal pregnancy complications, maternal substance use, low birth weight and prematurity, and newborn birth complications. Vertex-wise measures of cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), and curvature were fused using linked independent component analysis. Linear mixed-effects models showed that maternal pregnancy complications and low birth weight and prematurity were associated with smaller global SA. Additionally, low birth weight and prematurity was associated with complex regional cortical patterns reflecting bidirectional variations in both SA and CT. Newborn birth complications showed multivariate patterns reflecting smaller occipital- and larger temporal area, bidirectional frontal area variations, and reduced CT across the cortex. Maternal substance use showed no associations with child cortical structure. By employing a multifactorial and multivariate morphometric fusion approach, we connected complications during pregnancy and fetal size and prematurity to global SA and specific regional signatures across child cortical MRI features.",

          "abstract": "Herpesviruses, including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) – a human oncogenic virus and essential trigger of multiple sclerosis – must bypass host DNA-sensing mechanisms to establish lifelong, latent infection. Therefore, herpesviruses encode viral proteins to disrupt key host factors involved in DNA sensing and viral restriction. The first viral latency protein expressed, EBNA-LP, is essential for transformation of naïve B cells and establishment of viral gene expression, yet its role in evading host defenses remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of EBNA-LP Knockout (LPKO)-infected B cells, we reveal an antiviral response landscape implicating the “speckled proteins” as key cellular restriction factors countered by EBNA-LP. Specifically, loss of Sp100 or the primate-specific Sp140L reverses the restriction of LPKO, suppresses a subset of canonically interferon-stimulated genes, and restores transcription of essential latent viral genes and cellular proliferation. Notably, we also identify Sp140L as a restriction target of the herpesvirus saimiri ORF3 protein, implying a role for Sp140L in immunity to other diverse DNA viruses. This study reveals Sp140L as a restriction factor that we propose links sensing and transcriptional suppression of viral DNA to an Interferon-independent innate immune response, likely relevant to all nuclear DNA viruses.",

Similar pathologies have been observed in the mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This study hypothesized that inflammatory demyelination of the cerebellum alters overall mitochondrial function and is a contributor to axon degeneration and PC loss. Postmortem cerebellar tissue from MS patients, particularly those with secondary progressive MS, showed decreased mitochondrial complex IV (COXIV) activity and significant PC loss. Inflammation, PC axon demyelination, axon degeneration, and parallel fiber loss were also evident. These findings were mirrored in late-stage EAE mice, which also showed increased inflammation and demyelination, reduced PC COXIV activity, and overall PC loss. Further analysis of EAE mice revealed altered mitochondrial structure, modified mitochondrial respiration, and reduced levels of mitochondrial genes involved in energy production. These findings indicate that both human MS and mouse EAE share similar cerebellar changes linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, late-stage EAE is a valuable model for studying MS-related cerebellar pathology, and mitochondria may be a potential therapeutic target for MS treatment.",

This malignancy usually develops resistance to conventional chemotherapy, underscoring the need for robust preclinical models to guide the development of novel therapies. Here, we introduce an HGSC mouse model generated via Ovgp1 -driven Cre recombinase effecting CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Trp53, Rb1 , and Nf1 tumor suppressors in mouse oviductal epithelium ( m-sgPRN model). Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) inactivation—frequently observed in human HGSC—is associated with poorer outcomes, DNA damage accumulation (including tandem duplications), and increased tumor immunogenicity. In our system, coablation of Cdk12 ( m-sgPRN;Cdk12KO ) recapitulated hallmark features of HGSC, while accelerating tumor progression and reducing survival. In a conventional (Cre-lox-mediated) Trp53/Nf1/Rb1 triple knockout model with concurrent Cdk12 ablation ( PRN ; Cdk12KO mice), we observed T cell–rich immune infiltrates mirroring those seen clinically. We established both models as subcutaneous or intraperitoneal syngeneic allografts of CDK12 -inactivated HGSC that exhibited sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, a CRISPR/Cas9 synthetic lethality screen in PRN;Cdk12KO -derived cell lines identified CDK13—an essential paralog of CDK12—as the most depleted candidate, confirming a previously reported synthetic lethal interaction. Pharmacologic CDK13/12 degradation (employing YJ1206) demonstrated enhanced efficacy in cell lines derived from both m-sgPRN;Cdk12KO and PRN ; Cdk12KO models. Our results define CDK12 as a key tumor suppressor in tubo-ovarian HGSC and highlight CDK13 targeting as a promising therapeutic approach in CDK12 -inactive disease. Additionally, we have established valuable in vivo resources to facilitate further investigation and drug development in this challenging malignancy.",

During reflection and refraction, the directrons maintain nearly constant structure and velocity, ensuring energy conservation and information integrity. Microscopic analyses of the director field and macroscopic evaluations of effective potential are employed to elucidate the dependence of reflection and refraction probabilities on the directron’s incident angle and the orientation difference across the interface.

We use one of these models, the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model, to investigate how transient calibration impacts historical and projection simulations. Transient calibration is an emerging capability in ice flow models; it uses time series of surface observations and time-dependent physics to constrain uncertain model parameters—in this case, the basal friction coefficient in the sliding law. With more constraints than the common snapshot inversion method, transient calibration has been shown to better capture trends in ice dynamics. Here, we apply both methods to northwestern Greenland, a region undergoing rapid changes. For simulations initialized with the snapshot inversion, we find that subsequent modeled velocities are generally too slow, leading to an underestimation of the mass loss. With transient calibration, however, our simulation better matches a time series of observed velocities, bringing it within observational error for mass loss; however, the fit to observed surface elevation is slightly reduced. Together with the ISMIP results, our simulations show that reproducing the high rates of historical mass loss leads to greater projected sea-level contribution from this region over the coming century. Finally, we suggest a path forward for making transient calibration scalable to the entire Greenland Ice Sheet.",

The infant skull of the first African early hominin discovered at Taungs by Raymond Dart included a natural brain endocast. Natural endocasts as well-preserved as that of the Taungs infant are rare, but Holloway reasoned that if a way could be found to reproduce the endocranial morphology of early hominin crania then he would be able to track brain evolution within the human clade. Holloway realized that if liquid latex was introduced into the cranial cavity and left to cure, it could be extracted via the foramen magnum and then be used to make a facsimile of that individual’s brain. Modern imaging methods have made Holloway’s technique redundant, but for many years, it was the only way to access the endocranial morphology of fossil hominins.",

          "abstract": "A brief global warming event known as the Pre-Onset Excursion (POE) occurred just before the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 56 Mya). The deconvolution of the evolutionary consequences of these two hyperthermal events is puzzling because of their close temporal proximity and the lack of comprehensive, well-calibrated paleontological records, especially in terrestrial environments. As a consequence, the impact of the POE on mammalian evolution and its role in shaping PETM faunas remains unclear. Here, we report from France a mammalian fauna, named Albas, which is interpreted to postdate the POE and predate the PETM. The absence of artiodactyls, perissodactyls, and euprimates at Albas lends support to the controversial hypothesis that these “modern” mammal groups appeared in the European fossil record during the PETM. In contrast, Albas yielded the European first definitive Paleocene record of metatherians, paromomyid primates, “creodonts,” and rodents, challenging the assumption that these groups migrated into Europe during the PETM. Because the majority of them originated from North American pre-POE species, we tentatively suggest that these “precursor” dispersers entered Europe during the POE. Similar to the modern orders during the PETM, these “precursor” dispersers likely entered Europe through corridors in the continuous evergreen forest belt at high latitudes. Our findings highlight how a brief warming event in the Arctic during the latest Paleocene, such as the POE (which could result in a release of carbon into the atmosphere similar to cumulative ongoing anthropogenic emissions), significantly influenced the evolutionary dynamics of European mammals.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory (EGT) has been pivotal in the study of cooperation, offering formal models that account for how cooperation may arise in groups of selfish, but simple agents. This is done by inspecting the complex dynamics arising from simple interactions between a few strategies in a large population. As such, the strategies at stake are typically hand-picked by the modeler, resulting in a system with many more individuals in the population than strategies available to them. In the presence of noise and with multiple equilibria, the choice of strategies can considerably alter the emergent dynamics. As a result, model outcomes may not be robust to how the strategy set is chosen, sometimes misrepresenting the conditions required for cooperation to emerge. We propose three principles that can lead to a more systematic choice of the strategies in EGT models of cooperation. These are the inclusion of all computationally equivalent strategies; explicit microeconomic models of interactions, and a connection between stylized facts and model assumptions. Further, we argue that new methods arising in AI may offer a promising path toward richer models. These richer models can push the field of cooperation forward together with the principles described above. At the same time, AI may benefit from connecting to the more abstract models of EGT. We provide and discuss examples to substantiate these claims.",

Recent advancements in evolutionary game theory have identified a class of “zero-determinant” strategies, which confer an agent with significant unilateral control over outcomes in repeated games. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive generalization of zero-determinant strategies to stochastic games, encompassing dynamic environments. We propose an algorithm that allows an agent to discover strategies enforcing predetermined linear (or approximately linear) payoff relationships. Of particular interest is the relationship in which both payoffs are equal, which serves as a proxy for fairness in symmetric games. We demonstrate that an agent can discover strategies enforcing such relationships through experience alone, without coordinating with an opponent. In finding and using such a strategy, an agent (“enforcer”) can incentivize optimal and equitable outcomes, circumventing potential exploitation. In particular, from the opponent’s viewpoint, the enforcer transforms a mixed-motivation problem into a cooperative problem, paving the way for more collaboration and fairness in multiagent systems.",

          "abstract": "Mass-independent isotope fractionation (MIF) enables powerful geochemical tracers for various geological and planetary problems, yet the mechanisms driving MIF for tin (Sn) remain ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that distinct Sn isotope fractionation signatures were produced during photolysis of organic Sn species (i.e., methyltin) under laboratory UV irradiation and natural sunlight. UV irradiation of methyltin induced pronounced Sn-MIF in all odd Sn isotopes (Δ 115 Sn up to 21.82‰, Δ 117 Sn up to 23.16‰, Δ 119 Sn up to 24.01‰), with their ratios (Δ 117 Sn/Δ 115 Sn = 1.069; Δ 119 Sn/Δ 115 Sn = 1.099; Δ 119 Sn/Δ 117 Sn = 1.028) strongly correlating with nuclear magnetic moments. This unambiguously identifies the magnetic isotope effect (MIE) as the driving mechanism, ruling out other causes such as the nuclear volume effect (NVE). Methyl radicals (•CH 3 ) were detectable during the methyltin photolysis experiments, and the magnitude of MIF for Sn was suppressed by the presence of electron spin trapping agent (DMPO) for radicals, supporting that the pronounced Sn-MIF originated from radical-mediated singlet-triplet state transitions of Sn species. Furthermore, the magnitude of Sn-MIF depended nonmonotonically on external magnetic fields (peak suppression at 100 to 180 G), implying competition between hyperfine coupling and Zeeman interactions. Notably, Sn-MIF was absent during photolysis of methyltin by natural sunlight despite significant mass-dependent Sn isotope fractionation (e.g., &gt;3‰ in δ 122/116 Sn), attributed to atmospheric ozone shielding of short-wavelength UV (&lt;290 nm) required for radical generation. Our results register Sn-MIF as a sensitive tracer of UV-driven photochemistry in low-oxygen environments, underlining the potential of Sn isotopes in studies of early Earth’s atmosphere and planetary environments.",

The most common CS mutation, L205R, lies at the P + 1 loop. Understanding how this mutation alters the internal allosteric network within PKA-C and changes nucleotide and substrate cooperativity is a major goal. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and protein residue networks based on local spatial pattern (LSP) method, we compare crystal structures of wild-type PKA-C and L205R. Our findings indicate that L205R not only locally disrupts the P + 1 hydrophobic pocket, leading to the displacement of the P + 1-residue and altered substrate specificity, but also has long-range effects in the linker connecting the A helix to β strand 1. The MD simulations and LSP analyses also reveal critical changes at the phosphoryl transfer site. Some of these changes are captured in the L205R crystal structure while others are not.

          "abstract": "Antarctic krill is a keystone species in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and the target of a growing fishery. Given the ecological importance of krill, concerns have been raised about potential negative impacts of fishing on the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Resource-efficient approaches to fisheries monitoring are particularly valuable in this context due to the high costs associated with data collection in Antarctica. In this study, we trained a segmentation model (U-Net) to extract dives of air-breathing krill predators from more than 30,000 h of active acoustic data collected by three krill fishing vessels over six years. We were able to characterize the temporal and spatial dynamics of predator-vessel co-occurrences, which aligned well with the findings from more costly tracking studies. For example, we found that encounters with whales consistently peaked in autumn around the Antarctic Peninsula, when whales are building up fat reserves for their migration to breeding grounds. We also demonstrated that protection measures, introduced to protect breeding penguins at the Antarctic Peninsula, have simply shifted penguin-vessel encounters to the South Orkney Islands, where the affected colonies are not currently monitored. Our approach, results, and application example demonstrate how acoustic data from fishing vessels can provide important information to support fisheries management. As a by-product of fishing operations, these data are cost-effective, offering unique temporal and spatial coverage and providing a useful basis for rapid, low-level assessments of the fishery’s interaction with the wider ecosystem. This is particularly important given the unpredictable dynamics of krill fishery management decision-making.",

We propose that xanthine derivatives and analogs that enhance RyRs activity could be used for lead optimization and eventually for the treatment of the diseases that exhibit decreased muscle contraction and reduced RyRs activity, such as RyR1-related diseases, sarcopenia, and heart failure.

Given the established role of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in binding lipoproteins, our laboratory sought to determine the role of GAGs in AMD BrM. In this study, BrM GAG content in AMD pathobiology was analyzed in human postmortem tissue. Strikingly, increased levels of highly sulfated heparan sulfate were present in AMD Bruch’s membrane as compared to non-AMD samples. In addition, using scanning electron microscopy of postmortem AMD tissue, we show aggregates of lipoprotein-like particles on the retinal pigmented epithelium side of Bruch’s membrane adjacent to heparan sulfate. We also show that heparin displaces lipoproteins rich in apolipoprotein A1 from human BrM, suggesting their identity as high-density lipoproteins. Using human BrM immobilized to quartz crystal microbalance biosensor (QCM) chips, we show that heparan sulfate is required for lipoprotein binding to BrM and soluble heparan sulfate can remove lipoproteins bound to BrM. Thus, our data establish that heparan sulfate regulates lipoprotein deposition in AMD BrM. These findings provide a foundation for targeted therapies capable of either preventing lipoprotein accumulation or removing drusen in the early and intermediate stages of AMD prior to vision loss.",

          "abstract": "The discovery of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and the unraveling of its molecular mechanisms are currently solving previously puzzling challenges that Mendelian genetics based solely on DNA could not explain, leading to significant paradigm shifts across various fields of biology. There has been a long-standing controversy over the factors determining the caste fate of individuals in social insects. Increasing evidence supports heritable influences on division of labor. Here, we provide evidence that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance influences caste determination in a termite. We demonstrate that the age of the king influences the caste fate of offspring, with young kings’ progeny showing a higher tendency for reproductive differentiation compared to offspring from older kings (under controlled conditions). Then, we conducted a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly for the Japanese subterranean termite Reticulitermes speratus . Genome-wide methylome analysis of kings’ sperm reveals a drastic change in DNA methylation patterns with aging. Among 39,399,411 CpG sites, 21,611 sites showed significant age differences in methylation levels. We identified 13 genes whose methylation levels are significantly different between young and old kings and suggestively correlated with the offspring’s differentiation into the reproductive pathway. Our results suggest that sperm DNA methylation, which changes with the age of kings, is a potential transgenerational epigenetic factor involved in offspring caste differentiation in a termite. These findings may have broad applicability to caste differentiation in social insects and to phenotypic plasticity more generally.",

Using representational interaction measures that link facial features with MEG activity and categorization behavior, we identified within each participant a functional social pathway extending from the occipital cortex to the superior temporal gyrus. This pathway selectively represents, communicates, and integrates facial movements that are essential for the behavioral categorization of emotion, while task-irrelevant identity features are filtered out in the occipital cortex.

Here, we compare human behavioral annotations, functional MRI (fMRI) measurements, and deep neural network (DNN) activations to both indoor and outdoor real-world images to demonstrate that the human visual cortex represents locomotive action affordances in complex visual scenes. Hierarchical clustering of behavioral annotations of six possible locomotive actions show that humans group environments into distinct affordance clusters using at least three separate dimensions. Representational similarity analysis of multivoxel fMRI responses in the scene-selective visual cortex shows that perceived locomotive affordances are represented independently from other scene properties such as objects, surface materials, scene category, or global properties and independent of the task performed in the scanner. Visual feature activations from DNNs trained on object or scene classification as well as a range of other visual understanding tasks correlate comparatively lower with behavioral and neural representations of locomotive affordances than with object representations. Training DNNs directly on affordance labels or using affordance-centered language embeddings increases alignment with human behavior, but none of the tested models fully captures locomotive action affordance perception.

We further show how this partitioning of the statistical moments of the resource distribution provides a unified framework for explaining coexistence in variable resource environments. The multiplicity of niches we find in a single fluctuating resource highlights the potential for anthropogenic changes in resource regimes to drive cascading biodiversity losses.",

          "abstract": "Symbioses with microorganisms expand the genetic and metabolic repertoire of many insects. The lac insect Kerria lacca (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha) is a phloem-feeding scale insect that is brightly colored due to the presence of natural polyhydroxy-anthraquinone pigments called laccaic acids. The deep red pigments possibly provide defense against pathogens and predators and are commercially important as dyes in textiles, lacquerware, and cosmetics. Laccaic acids are categorized as polyketides comprising an anthraquinone backbone decorated with tyrosine or its derivatives. However, the genetic basis of these pigments remains unknown, as insects are not known to produce aromatic polyketides or tyrosine de novo. Here, we sequence the genome of the lac insect and its two endosymbionts— Wolbachia and a hitherto unidentified, transovarially transmitted yeast-like symbiont (YLS). We found no evidence for the host or Wolbachia to be able to synthesize the pigments. The pigments and their precursors were also not detected in the host plant. Genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses combined with fluorescence microscopy identified and characterized YLS as the sole producer of the pigment’s polyketide backbone and tyrosine moiety, demonstrating an endosymbiotic origin of the lac pigments. A nonreducing polyketide synthase gene cluster encoding the laccaic acid backbone was identified. Furthermore, the YLS genome encoded essential amino acids and vitamins that are deficient in the insect’s phloem diet. Experimental fungicide-treated insects exhibited reduced concentrations of laccaic acids and tyrosine, along with decreased body size and weight, indicating a mutualistic association between the lac insect and its YLS.",

Receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is a versatile adaptor protein that regulates multiple signaling pathways. Whether RACK1 is implicated in AM alterations remains elusive. Alveolar type 2 cells-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and autocrine transforming growth factor-β1 drive the transcription of Pparg , the gene encoding AM signature transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). The regulation of PPARγ stability during AM development and maintenance remains unexplored. Here, we report that myeloid RACK1 deficiency results in the scarcity of mature AMs and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. A mixed bone marrow chimera approach reveals a cell-intrinsic role of RACK1 in AM differentiation. Bulk RNA-sequencing indicates a considerable loss of AM identity, impaired PPAR signaling, but a largely unchanged Pparg messenger RNA (mRNA) level in the absence of RACK1. Indeed, myeloid deletion of Rack1 halts AM differentiation in vivo and blocks the ability of PPARγ agonist to induce AM-like cells in vitro. Mechanistically, RACK1 directly binds to and stabilizes PPARγ by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, myeloid RACK1 deficiency renders mice susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection.",

In many molecules, fluorine is incorporated to enhance the half-life and improve bioavailability. Fluorinated compounds enter the human body through food, water, and xenobiotics including pharmaceuticals, exposing gut microbes to these substances. The human gut microbiota is known for its xenobiotic biotransformation capabilities, but it was not previously known whether gut microbial enzymes could break carbon–fluorine bonds, potentially altering the toxicity of these compounds. Here, through the development of a rapid, miniaturized fluoride detection assay for whole-cell screening, we identified active gut microbial defluorinases. We biochemically characterized enzymes from diverse human gut microbial classes including Clostridia, Bacilli, and Coriobacteriia, with the capacity to hydrolyze (di)fluorinated organic acids and a fluorinated amino acid. Whole-protein alanine scanning, molecular dynamics simulations, and chimeric protein design enabled the identification of a disordered C-terminal protein segment involved in defluorination activity. Domain swapping exclusively of the C-terminus conferred defluorination activity to a nondefluorinating dehalogenase. To advance our understanding of the structural and sequence differences between defluorinating and nondefluorinating dehalogenases, we trained machine learning models which identified protein termini as important features. Models trained on 41-amino acid segments from protein C termini alone predicted defluorination activity with 83% accuracy (compared to 95% accuracy based on full-length protein features).

Through the cascading effects of their ecological role, scavengers can also alleviate the burden of zoonotic diseases on people. This importance to human health fuels a growing need to understand how vertebrate scavengers and their ecosystem services are faring globally in the Anthropocene. We reviewed the conservation status of 1,376 vertebrate scavenging species and examined the implications for human health. We uncovered that 36% of these species are threatened or decreasing in population abundance and that apex (large-bodied or obligate) scavengers are disproportionately imperiled. In contrast, mesoscavengers (small-bodied or facultative) are thriving from anthropogenic food subsidies and ecological release. We posit that this global shift in scavenger community structure increases carrion persistence enabling zoonotic pathogens to propagate. Our analysis also indicates that the release of mesoscavengers is associated with reservoir host proliferation, potentially further exacerbating human disease burdens. Urgently tackling the key threats to scavengers—intensive livestock production, land use change, wildlife trade, and the interactions among them—is critical to securing the long-term public health benefits of the world’s diverse scavenger communities.",

Comparatively less is known about pathogen interactions within the tick. Here, we report that Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with either Anaplasma phagocytophilum (causative agent of anaplasmosis) or Borrelia burgdorferi (causative agent of Lyme disease) show activation of the ATF6 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Disabling ATF6 functionally restricts pathogen survival in ticks. When stimulated, ATF6 functions as a transcription factor, but is the least understood out of the three UPR pathways. To interrogate the Ixodes ATF6 transcriptional network, we developed a custom R script to query tick promoter sequences. This revealed stomatin as a potential gene target, which has roles in lipid homeostasis and vesical transport. Ixodes stomatin was experimentally validated as a bona fide ATF6-regulated gene through luciferase reporter assays, pharmacological activators, RNA interference transcriptional repression, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Silencing stomatin decreased A. phagocytophilum colonization in Ixodes and disrupted cholesterol dynamics in tick cells. Furthermore, blocking stomatin restricted cholesterol availability to the bacterium, thereby inhibiting growth and survival. Taken together, we have identified the Ixodes ATF6 pathway as a contributor to vector competence through Stomatin-regulated cholesterol homeostasis. Moreover, our custom, web-based transcription factor binding site search tool “ArthroQuest” revealed that the ATF6-regulated nature of stomatin is unique to blood-feeding arthropods.

With the advent of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), rare and de novo variants can now be detected at scale, presenting new opportunities to enhance PRS performance. Additionally, regulatory mechanisms that govern gene expression play a critical role in disease manifestation, suggesting further potential for improvement. However, most existing PRS methods are not well-equipped to incorporate nonlinear variant effects, rare variant contributions, or regulatory context. To address these limitations, we developed Epi-PRS, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to impute cell-type-specific epigenomic signals from personal diploid genotypes. These imputed signals act as informative intermediates between genotype and phenotype, allowing for more accurate modeling of variant impact. Our simulation studies demonstrate that Epi-PRS improves predictive accuracy by incorporating nonlinear relationships, rare variant effects, and regulatory information across large genomic regions. When applied to real data from the UK Biobank, Epi-PRS significantly outperforms existing PRS approaches in predicting risk for both breast cancer and type 2 diabetes. These results underscore the advantages of integrating WGS data, epigenomic context, and advanced LLMs framework to enhance both the predictive power and interpretability of PRS. Overall, Epi-PRS represents a promising step toward more precise and biologically informed disease risk prediction, with broad implications for advancing personalized medicine and understanding complex genetic architectures.",

          "abstract": "The nucleobase queuine (q) and its nucleoside queuosine (Q) are micronutrients derived from bacteria that are acquired from the gut microbiome and/or diet in humans. Following cellular uptake, Q is incorporated at the wobble base (position 34) of tRNAs that decode histidine, tyrosine, aspartate, and asparagine codons, which is important for efficient translation. Early studies suggested that cytosolic uptake of queuine is mediated by a selective transporter that is regulated by mitogenic signals, but the identity of this transporter has remained elusive. Here, through a cross-species bioinformatic search and genetic validation, we have identified the solute carrier family member SLC35F2 as a unique transporter for both queuine and queuosine in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Trypanosoma brucei . Furthermore, gene disruption in human HeLa cells revealed that SLC35F2 is the sole transporter for queuosine (K m 174 nM) and a high-affinity transporter for the queuine nucleobase (K m 67 nM), with the additional presence of second low-affinity queuine transporter (K m 259 nM). Ectopic expression of labeled SLC35F2 reveals localization to the cell membrane and Golgi apparatus via immunofluorescence. Competition uptake studies show that SLC35F2 is not a general transporter for other canonical ribonucleobases or ribonucleosides but selectively imports q and Q. The identification of SLC35F2, an oncogene, as the transporter of both q and Q advances our understanding of how intracellular levels of queuine and queuosine are regulated and how their deficiency contributes to a variety of pathophysiological conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between genotype and phenotype remains an outstanding question for organism-level traits because these traits are generally complex . The challenge arises from complex traits being determined by a combination of multiple genes (or loci), which leads to an explosion of possible genotype–phenotype mappings. The primary techniques to resolve these mappings are genome/transcriptome-wide association studies, which are limited by their lack of causal inference and statistical power. Here, we develop an approach that combines transcriptional data endowed with causal information and a generative machine learning model designed to strengthen statistical power. Our implementation of the approach—dubbed transcriptome-wide conditional variational autoencoder (TWAVE)—includes a variational autoencoder trained on human transcriptional data, which is incorporated into an optimization framework. Given a trait phenotype, TWAVE generates expression profiles, which we dimensionally reduce by identifying independently varying generalized pathways (eigengenes). We then conduct constrained optimization to find causal gene sets that are the gene perturbations whose measured transcriptomic responses best explain trait phenotype differences. By considering several complex traits, we show that the approach identifies causal genes that cannot be detected by the primary existing techniques. Moreover, the approach identifies complex diseases caused by distinct sets of genes, meaning that the disease is polygenic and exhibits distinct subtypes driven by different genotype–phenotype mappings. We suggest that the approach will enable the design of tailored experiments to identify multigenic targets to address complex diseases.",

          "abstract": "Characterizing the feedback linking human behavior and the transmission of infectious diseases (i.e., behavioral changes) remains a significant challenge in computational and mathematical epidemiology. Existing behavioral epidemic models often lack real-world data calibration and cross-model performance evaluation in both retrospective analysis and forecasting. In this study, we systematically compare the performance of three mechanistic behavioral epidemic models across nine geographies and two modeling tasks during the first wave of COVID-19, using various metrics. The first model, a Data-Driven Behavioral Feedback Model, incorporates behavioral changes by leveraging mobility data to capture variations in contact patterns. The second and third models are Analytical Behavioral Feedback Models, which simulate the feedback loop either through the explicit representation of different behavioral compartments within the population or by utilizing an effective nonlinear force of infection. Our results do not identify a single best model overall, as performance varies based on factors such as data availability, data quality, and the choice of performance metrics. While the Data-Driven Behavioral Feedback Model incorporates substantial real-time behavioral information, the Analytical Compartmental Behavioral Feedback Model often demonstrates superior or equivalent performance in both retrospective fitting and out-of-sample forecasts. Overall, our work offers guidance for future approaches and methodologies to better integrate behavioral changes into the modeling and projection of epidemic dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The FeMo cofactor (FeMoco), the key active site in the Mo-based nitrogenase, is one of the most complicated metalloenzyme molecules. Synthesis of the FeMoco model cluster ([MoFe 7 S 9 C]) is essential to understanding its function in dinitrogen binding, activation, and conversion. However, the complex framework of the FeMoco cluster, which features a unique trigonal prismatic [Fe 6 C] moiety comprising a µ 6 -bridging carbide, has made the synthesis of the cluster a persistent challenge. In this work, two analogous mimics of FeMoco have been synthesized, using a cluster-coupling synthetic strategy facilitated by the fabrication of unsaturated ligand/metal coordination. The incorporation of a µ 6 -X (X = C 4− or N 3− ) to construct the characteristic triangular prismatic [Fe 6 ( µ 6 -X)] moiety, replicating that in FeMoco, has been achieved synthetically. The two mimics have similar key structural parameters to FeMoco in natural nitrogenase, but differ from the FeMoco structure in two major aspects: the µ 2 -bridging ligands and the metal atoms capping the [Fe 6 S 9 C] cores (Mo/Fe in FeMoco vs. Mo/Mo or W/W in the synthetic models). Quantum chemical studies indicate that the electronic ground states of these clusters resemble those observed for FeMoco, with maximized antiferromagnetic coupling among the iron centers. A future systematic study on the physical and chemical properties of a family of mimics with programmed variations of key structural elements can provide a valuable comparison and facilitate a better understanding of the structure and function of FeMoco.",

Here, we show that internal nutrient storage connects past thermal experience to current growth in phytoplankton. We develop a mechanistic model showing that delays in the response of nutrient stores to changing temperatures produces phenotypic memory. By testing this model against experimental data of phytoplankton growth rates following temperature perturbations, we find general patterns in the population consequences of phenotypic memory: Prior exposure to warm temperatures depletes nutrient stores, and, in doing so, slows growth during subsequent temperature exposure and restricts the breadth of the thermal niche (i.e., the range of acute temperature exposures yielding a positive growth rate). Our model reveals how phenotypic memory produces temporal variation in critical thermal minima and maxima and predicts that the thermal niche is constricted by long-term exposure to warm temperatures (e.g., during summer months), but that high frequency temperature fluctuations can expand a population’s thermal niche. This work provides a mechanistic framework for considering the ecological implications of phenotypic memory.",

          "abstract": "Many eukaryotic species undergo programmed elimination of specific chromosomes during embryogenesis, typically retaining these chromosomes only in their germ cells. In some species, programmatic elimination of GRCs, or sex chromosomes, also occurs in a sex-specific manner, with specific chromosomes being transmitted or eliminated by only one sex. As such, these chromosomes provide a unique perspective on the evolution of gene functions that are advantageous to the germline and genetic tradeoffs between somatic vs germline or oocyte vs sperm biology. While GRCs have been extensively characterized in male sea lampreys ( Petromyzon marinus ), the status of GRCs in females has not yet been resolved, though it has been hypothesized that male-specific expression/transmission of these chromosomes might provide a solution to resolving the long-standing mystery of lamprey sex determining mechanisms. To gain insight into the roles of GRCs in female lampreys, we performed several karyological, transcriptomic, and genomic analyses, which demonstrate that GRCs are present in the female lamprey germline, transmitted by oocytes and somatically eliminated in both sexes. These analyses also show that GRCs play important roles in the maintenance and development of female germline but provide no evidence for sex-specific variation in the elimination and transmission of lamprey GRCs. These findings underscore the diversity of germline functions that are carried out by GRCs in both male and female lampreys and highlight the fact that sex-specific transmission/retention of GRCs likely follows no universal rules across the diverse lineages that have independently evolved to undergo developmentally programmed DNA elimination.",

          "abstract": "Removing CO 2 from the atmosphere is emerging as a viable strategy to mitigate global warming, yet the responses of the climate system to CO 2 reduction remain uncertain. One of the most uncertain aspects of El Niño behavior is the change in periodicity in response to CO 2 forcing [O. Alizadeh, Earth-Sci. Rev. 235 , 104246 (2022)]. In this study, we show that climate models consistently project an abrupt shortening of El Niño periodicity once CO 2 reductions commence in ramp-up and ramp-down CO 2 experiments. Besides the contribution of slow mean state changes, this phenomenon is shown to be driven by a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) [J.-S. Kug, et al. , Nat. Clim. Chang. 12 , 47–53 (2022)] and the consequent narrowing of El Niño’s spatial pattern, which enhances the effectiveness of ocean heat recharge/discharge processes, thereby shortening its periodicity. This suggests that the abrupt shift in El Niño periodicity results from a cascading reaction involving ITCZ dynamics and El Niño’s spatial configuration. These findings highlight the critical role of the global energy balance in shaping El Niño characteristics.",

          "abstract": "The physics of the heat-trapping properties of CO 2 were established in the mid-19th century, as fossil fuel burning rapidly increased atmospheric CO 2 levels. To date, however, research has not probed when climate change could have been detected if scientists in the 19th century had the current models and observing network. We consider this question in a thought experiment with state-of-the-art climate models. We assume that the capability to make accurate measurements of atmospheric temperature changes existed in 1860, and then apply a standard “fingerprint” method to determine the time at which a human-caused climate change signal was first detectable. Pronounced cooling of the mid- to upper stratosphere, mainly driven by anthropogenic increases in carbon dioxide, would have been identifiable with high confidence by approximately 1885, before the advent of gas-powered cars. These results arise from the favorable signal-to-noise characteristics of the mid- to upper stratosphere, where the signal of human-caused cooling is large and the pattern of this cooling differs markedly from patterns of intrinsic variability. Even if our monitoring capability in 1860 had not been global, and high-quality stratospheric temperature measurements existed for Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes only, it still would have been feasible to detect human-caused stratospheric cooling by 1894, only 34 y after the assumed start of climate monitoring. Our study provides strong evidence that a discernible human influence on atmospheric temperature has likely existed for over 130 y.",

Yet, we do not know whether the consistent phenotypic changes that are associated with polyploidization translate into predictable changes in ecological preferences. Niche modeling studies in mixed-ploidy species provide an opportunity to compare recently originated polyploids with their lower-ploidy ancestors. However, the available isolated studies provide contrasting results and the diverse methodologies used limit generalization. Based on 25,857 georeferenced ploidy-verified occurrence data for 129 mixed-ploidy flowering plant species, we tested in a unified statistical framework whether WGD is associated with consistent changes in climatic niche and in past, current, and predicted future range size. We found that 74% of species exhibited significant niche shifts associated with ploidy transition. However, there was no consistent environmental parameter underlying ploidy differentiation across species, nor was there consistent support for polyploid range or niche expansion in a subset of 75 densely sampled species with sufficient data for modeling. Our results demonstrate that polyploidization is an important factor affecting niche evolution of a species, but the environmental parameters underlying the ploidy-related niche shifts vary from species to species, demonstrating limited predictability of the outcomes of WGD in ecological space.",

          "abstract": "The host–microbiome interface is rich in metabolite exchanges and exquisitely sensitive to diet. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is present at high concentrations at this interface and is a product of both microbial and host metabolism. The mitochondrial enzyme, sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), couples H 2 S detoxification to oxidative phosphorylation; its inherited deficiency presents as Leigh disease. Since an estimated two-thirds of systemic H 2 S metabolism originates in the gut, it raises questions as to whether impaired sulfide clearance in this compartment contributes to disease and whether it can be modulated by dietary sulfur content. In this study, we report that SQOR deficiency confined to murine intestinal epithelial cells perturbs colon bioenergetics that is reversed by antibiotics, revealing a significant local contribution of microbial H 2 S to host physiology. We also find that a 2.5-fold higher methionine intake, mimicking the difference between animal and plant proteins, synergizes with intestinal SQOR deficiency to adversely impact colon architecture and alter microbiome composition. In serum, increased thiosulfate, a biomarker of H 2 S oxidation, reveals that intestinal SQOR deficiency combined with higher dietary methionine affects sulfide metabolism globally and perturbs energy metabolism as indicated by higher ketone bodies. The mice exhibit lower exploratory locomotor activity while brain MRI reveals an atypical reduction in ventricular volume, which is associated with lower aquaporin 1 that is important for cerebrospinal fluid secretion. Our study reveals the dynamic interaction between dietary sulfur intake and sulfide metabolism at the host–microbe interface, impacting gut health, and the potential for lower dietary methionine intake to modulate pathology.",

We provide evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15) enhances viral virulence by suppressing the production of viral double-stranded (dsRNA), a potent inducer of antiviral signaling. The viral variants lacking nsp15 endoribonuclease activity elicited higher innate immune responses and exhibited reduced replication in human stem cell–derived lung alveolar type II epithelial cells, as well as in the lungs of infected hamsters. Consistently, these variants caused significantly less weight loss and mortality compared to wild-type (WT) virus in K18-hACE2 mice. Mechanistically, the cells infected with nsp15 mutants accumulated more viral dsRNA, causing enhanced stimulation of the interferon pathway. Chemical inhibition of interferon signaling dampened immune responses to nsp15 mutants and restored their replication to levels similar to the WT virus. These findings indicate that the endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 contributes to viral virulence by limiting the accumulation of viral dsRNA, thereby allowing robust replication with reduced activation of the host innate immune response.",

However, achieving controllable locomotion of such robots on terrestrial surfaces remains challenging because fluctuating adhesion on nonideal surfaces disrupts the necessary asymmetry for propulsion. Here, we present a microscopic robot composed of three-dimensional nanomembranes, which navigate diverse terrestrial surfaces with omnidirectional motion. We propose a general mechanism employing nonreciprocal shape morphing to generate stable asymmetric forces on surfaces. This nonreciprocal shape morphing is realized through a laser-actuated vanadium dioxide nanomembrane, leveraging the material's inherent hysteresis properties. We demonstrate that these robots can be fabricated in various shapes, ranging from simple square structures to bioinspired \"bipedal\" helical designs, enabling them to directionally navigate challenging surfaces such as paper, leaves, sand, and vertical walls. Furthermore, their omnidirectional motion facilitates applications in microassembly and microelectronic circuit integration. Additionally, we developed an artificial intelligence control algorithm based on reinforcement learning, enabling these robots to autonomously follow complex trajectories, such as tracing the phrase \"hello world\".

          "abstract": "We demonstrate a tripling in the frequency of planetary wave resonance events over the past halfcentury, coinciding with the rise in persistent boreal summer weather extremes. This increase aligns with changes in the underlying climate conditions favoring these events, including amplified Arctic warming and land–sea thermal contrast. We also observe increased prevalence of resonant amplification events following the mature phase of strong El Niño events, suggesting that such events may precondition the mean state conditions in ways that favor large-scale quasi-stationary wave patterns and quasi-resonant wave amplification. Since the impact of anthropogenic warming on quasi-resonant amplification is not well captured by current-generation climate models, it is likely that models are underpredicting the potential increase, indicating even greater risk of persistent extreme summer weather events with ongoing warming.",

          "abstract": "Circulating monocytes are recruited to the tumor microenvironment, where they can differentiate into macrophages that mediate tumor progression. To reach the tumor microenvironment, monocytes must first extravasate and migrate through the type-1 collagen rich stromal matrix. The viscoelastic stromal matrix around tumors not only stiffens relative to normal stromal matrix, but often exhibits enhanced viscous characteristics, as indicated by a higher loss tangent or faster stress relaxation rate. Here, we studied how changes in matrix stiffness and viscoelasticity impact the three-dimensional (3D) migration of monocytes through stromal-like matrices. Interpenetrating networks of type-1 collagen and alginate, which enable independent tunability of stiffness and stress relaxation over physiologically relevant ranges, were used as confining matrices for 3D culture of monocytes. Increased stiffness and faster stress relaxation independently enhanced the 3D migration of monocytes. Migrating monocytes have an ellipsoidal or rounded wedge-like morphology, reminiscent of amoeboid migration, with accumulation of actin at the trailing edge. Matrix adhesions were dispensable for monocyte migration in 3D, but migration did require actin polymerization and myosin contractility. Mechanistic studies indicate that actin polymerization at the leading edge generates protrusive forces that open a path for the monocytes to migrate through in the confining viscoelastic matrices. Taken together, our findings implicate matrix stiffness and stress relaxation as key mediators of monocyte migration and reveal how monocytes use pushing forces at the leading edge mediated by actin polymerization to generate migration paths in confining viscoelastic matrices.",

          "abstract": "Although it is widely recognized that nutritional symbionts can manipulate host reproduction, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are largely unclear. The facultative symbiont Hamiltonella in bacteriocyte induces female-biased sex ratio of whiteflies. Here, we demonstrate that a maternal gene tudor ( tud ) and its encoded protein have lower expression levels in ovaries of Hamiltonella- cured whiteflies. Tud family proteins can interlink the various stages of biosynthesis of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA), a class of small noncoding RNAs. We find that Hamiltonella affects the abundance of a piRNA through the maternal gene tud , thereby regulating the expression of the vacuolar ( H+ ) -ATPase H subunit ( VATPH ), which is the switch of activity of the vacuolar (H+)-ATPase that plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of intracellular energy and supporting mitochondrial respiration. This regulation adjusts the ATP level in ovaries of whiteflies. The ATP level shapes the F-actin pattern in ovaries and eggs of whiteflies, ultimately manipulating whitefly fertilization. Silencing tud inhibited whitefly fertilization by impairing ATP levels and F-actin patterns in ovaries and eggs. This study reveals that symbiont and maternal protein associations can regulate host fertilization by piRNA biosynthesis.",

          "abstract": "Cooperation at scale is critical for achieving a sustainable future for humanity. However, achieving collective, cooperative behavior—in which intelligent actors in complex environments jointly improve their well-being—remains poorly understood. Complex systems science (CSS) provides a rich understanding of collective phenomena, the evolution of cooperation, and the institutions that can sustain both. Yet, much of the theory in this area fails to fully consider individual-level complexity and environmental context—largely for the sake of tractability and because it has not been clear how to do so rigorously. These elements are well captured in multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), which has recently put focus on cooperative (artificial) intelligence. However, typical MARL simulations can be computationally expensive and challenging to interpret. In this perspective, we propose that bridging CSS and MARL affords new directions forward. Both fields can complement each other in their goals, methods, and scope. MARL offers CSS concrete ways to formalize cognitive processes in dynamic environments. CSS offers MARL improved qualitative insight into emergent collective phenomena. We see this approach as providing the necessary foundations for a proper science of collective, cooperative intelligence. We highlight work that is already heading in this direction and discuss concrete steps for future research.",

          "authors": "Kaushik Mitra, Lauren A. Malesky, Michael T. Thorpe, Ana Stevanovic",
          "abstract": "Pure siderite [Fe II CO 3 ] was recently discovered in abundant quantities (4.8 to 10.5 wt.%) by the Curiosity rover at Gale crater, Mars. Diagenetic alteration of siderite likely caused the carbonate-sequestered CO 2 to be released back into the atmosphere and consequently produced ferric [Fe(III)] oxyhydr(oxide) minerals. Here, using laboratory experimentation, we demonstrate that while closed system acid diagenesis—as proposed for Gale crater—is incapable of effective siderite alteration in Mars-relevant fluids, oxyhalogen compounds (chlorate and bromate) can weather siderite not only at acidic pH but also in near-neutral Mars-relevant solutions. The ferric oxyhydroxide minerals produced as a consequence are controlled by the diagenetic fluid composition. While photooxidation is possible, the mutually exclusive products of alteration—magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) during ultraviolet irradiation and ferric oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) by oxyhalogens—demonstrate that siderite at Gale crater underwent chemical weathering by chlorate and bromate brines owing to the complete absence of magnetite in drill samples containing siderite. We propose a top–down oxyhalogen brine percolation model to explain the iron mineralogy of the sulfate-rich unit at Gale crater. We conclude that siderite alteration by acidic fluids alone cannot explain the redox disequilibrium witnessed in Gale crater sediments as promulgated before and siderite weathering by oxyhalogen brines is the most likely explanation. It is highly likely that the halogen cycle on Mars is interlinked to the iron and the carbon cycle on early and current Mars.",

          "abstract": "Antlers, a male deer secondary sex characteristic, are unique mammalian appendages that fully regenerate annually, under androgen regulation. Stem cells located in the antlerogenic periosteum (AP), a tissue overlaying the frontal crest of both male and female deer, play a crucial role in antlerogenesis. Nonetheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms as to how antlerogenesis is regulated by androgens remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that androgens regulate antler growth via macrophages. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a significant enrichment of immune-related factors in the androgen-activated antlerogenic periosteum (AAP), and single-cell RNA sequencing identified a cluster of AAP cells overexpressing macrophage chemokine CCL2. Additionally, the presence of a substantial number of monocytes/macrophages was detected in the skin overlying the AAP. Histological examination confirmed macrophage accumulation in the AAP. Removal of macrophages with clodronate effectively inhibited antler generation in male sika deer as well as in nude mice engrafted with the AP. Furthermore, testosterone up-regulated CCL2 expression in the AP cells (APCs), thus enhancing their chemotactic effect on recruitment of macrophages. Remarkably, female sika deer developed antlers following local injection of CCL2, autologous macrophages, or even immune response inducer lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Therefore, macrophages play an essential role in deer antler generation.",

Predictive models for hydrogen-induced material failure are still lacking, largely due to an incomplete understanding of hydrogen’s effects on deformation behavior, especially in multiphase alloys with complex compositions and microstructures. Here, we demonstrate a synergistic hydrogen embrittlement (SHE) phenomenon in high-strength martensitic steels, where hydrogen interacts with carbon in solution to activate hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP). Microcantilever bending tests revealed greater hydrogen susceptibility with higher carbon content, evidenced by a significant reduction in work-hardening capacity, promoting slip localization and reduced ductility. First-principles calculations and theoretical modeling revealed that carbon intensifies hydrogen–dislocation interactions and amplifies hydrogen redistribution around screw dislocations, inhibiting cross-slip. This work integrates experimental and modeling approaches to elucidate the synergistic interactions between hydrogen and solute elements, providing critical insights for designing high-strength, hydrogen-tolerant structural materials.",

Currently, the sulfur analogs are almost exclusively prepared by de novo synthesis; the existing approach to swap carbon with sulfur is inefficient and involves stoichiometric mercury reagents. In this study, we report a two-step carbonyl-to-sulfur (CO-to-S) atom swap approach, enabled by a rationally designed N ′-alkyl-hydrazonamide (NAHA) reagent that promotes forming pre-aromatic intermediates twice sequentially by different mechanisms, thereby achieving homolytic cleavage of both α-C−C bonds of the ketone substrates. A Ts-S-Ts (Ts, p -toluenesulfonyl) reagent mediates this process through successive intermolecular and intramolecular alkyl radical trapping by the central sulfur. This method shows a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity, providing a streamlined route to sulfur-containing scaffolds from readily available ketones.",

Mutations in specific cysteine residues of IAA3 disrupt redox-mediated multimerization and interaction with co-repressor TPL, thereby attenuating IAA3 mediated target gene repression.

Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal asymmetric nucleoprotein complexes comprising a reverse transcriptase (RT), msDNA (a hybrid of msdDNA and msrRNA), and two PtuAB copies. msdDNA and msrRNA are essential for assembling this complex, with msrRNA adopting a conserved lariat-like structure that regulates reverse transcription. Notably, the assembled Retron-Septu complex is inactive, with msdDNA occupying the PtuA DNA-binding site. Activation occurs upon disassembly, releasing PtuAB, which degrades single-stranded DNA to restrict phage replication. This “arrest-and-release” mechanism underscores the dynamic regulatory roles of msDNA, advancing our understanding of antiphage defense strategies.",

Here, we present a suite of 230 Th ages for fossil corals in the Seychelles within a detailed sedimentary and stratigraphic context to evaluate the evolution of sea level during this past warm period. The rise to peak sea level at ~122 to 123 ka was punctuated by two abrupt stratigraphic discontinuities, defining three distinct generations of reef growth. We attribute the evidence of episodic reef growth and ephemeral sea-level fall to the competing influence of Northern Hemisphere ice melt and Antarctic ice regrowth.

NF-κB activation stabilizes PLAC8 in the cytosol, disrupting autophagy by allowing PLAC8 to colocalize with LC3B instead of LAMP1. Silencing NF-κB down-regulates PLAC8 and its survival function while inhibiting NF-κB or PLAC8, which restores autophagy and decreases tumor growth in xenograft models.

Two asymmetric molecules, Z12 and Z13, were synthesized by substituting the terminal group with different fluorine atoms compared with the symmetrical molecule, Z11. Z12 showed enhanced molecular interactions, promoting to more compact and ordered stacking, which in turn promotes the DSE formation, benefiting the synergistic enhancement of V OC and J SC . The D18:Z12-based device achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.5%, notably outperforming the other two devices.

          "abstract": "Widespread application of bacterial-based cancer therapy is limited because of the need to increase therapeutic bacteria specificity to the tumor to improve treatment safety and efficacy. Here, we harness the altered tumor metabolism and specifically elevated kynurenine accumulation to target engineered bacteria to the cancer site. We cloned and leveraged kynurenine-responsive transcriptional regulator (KynR) with its cognate promoter in Escherichia coli . Optimizing KynR expression coupled with overexpressing kynurenine transporter and amplifying the response through plasmid copy number–based signal amplification enabled the response to kynurenine at the low micromolar levels. Knocking out genes essential for cell wall synthesis and supplying these genes via kynurenine-controlled circuits allowed tuning Salmonella enterica growth in response to kynurenine. Our kynurenine-controlled S. enterica (hereafter named AD95+) showed superior tumor specificity in breast and ovarian cancer murine models compared to S. enterica VNP20009, one of the best characterized tumor-specific strains. Last, AD95+ showed anticancer properties compared to vehicle controls, demonstrating the potential as an anticancer therapeutic.",

While these phases have been observed in isolation, the interface-driven phenomena emerging from their interaction have never been realized previously. Here, we report on the discovery of interfacial electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a heterostructure consisting of the Weyl semimetal Eu 2 Ir 2 O 7 and spin ice Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 . Subjected to magnetic fields, we unveil a sixfold anisotropic transport response that is theoretically accounted by a Kondo-coupled heterointerface, where the spin ice’s field-tuned magnetism induces electron scattering in the Weyl semimetal’s topological Fermi-arc states. Furthermore, at elevated magnetic fields, we reveal a twofold anisotropic response indicative of the emergence of a symmetry-broken many-body state. This discovery showcases the potential of pyrochlore frustrated magnet/topological semimetal heterostructures in search of emergent interfacial phenomena.",

We extend the tuning of language models with reinforcement learning to the chemistry domain, training a transformer model for chemical reaction prediction. Our approach is evaluated using both a rigorously controlled dataset and a realistic high-throughput dataset comprising extensive reaction screenings across diverse catalysts sets and experimental conditions. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging information from as few as 20 positive data points in the controlled dataset, supported by a negative dataset at least 40 times larger. Consistent results on both datasets demonstrate that, with an appropriate optimization strategy and the inclusion of unsuccessful experimental data, models can be effectively trained even when successful reactions are underrepresented.",

Collective snapshots of the electrified interface at controlled time intervals quantifies early-stage growth kinetics of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a passivation film that governs electron and ion transport. Unexpectedly, the diffusivity of charged species of the two SEI films with differing chemistry and performance are estimated to be within 10% of the other, indicated by the slope of their diffusion-limited SEI growth regimes. Instead, the slope of the reaction-limited SEI growth regimes differs by a factor of 3, suggesting that lowered reactivity of the high-performance electrolyte is largely responsible for its high coulombic efficiency.",

We find that both exhibit strong linearly increasing trends, coupled with a large surge in magnitude between 330 and 220 million years ago. Our time series analysis and statistical tests show that both are highly correlated, with the maximum correlation reached when there is no time lag between the two.

However, its function in plant DNA damage tolerance remains unclear. In this study, we showed that ABA supplementation significantly enhances plant tolerance to DNA-damaging treatments. SnRK2.2 and SnRK2.3 kinases in the ABA signaling pathway are pivotal in this process. These kinases interact with clathrin light chain 2 (CLC2), facilitating its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in response to Zeocin and ABA treatment. In the nucleus, CLC2 interacts with ADA2b, an adaptor protein crucial for recruiting SMC5/6 complex to the double-strand break (DSB) sites. The enhanced nuclear localization of CLC2 is essential for the accurate localization of ADA2b at DSB sites. Collectively, our study uncovers that ABA enhances plant DNA damage tolerance with a distinct function of CLC2 in genomic stability maintaining, thereby improving our understanding of DNA damage tolerance mechanisms in plants.",

This method converts deeply penetrating NIR light into localized electrical stimuli, enabling immediate and precise modulation in deep brain. In vitro patch-clamp experiments confirm neuronal activation upon HUP application. In vivo, we achieve remote NIR neuromodulation in the medial septum and ventral tegmental area 7 days postinjection, effectively modulating neuronal activity, suppressing seizures, and triggering dopamine release.

Arabidopsis ABCB19 was recently shown to transport brassinosteroid, shaping hormone dynamics and plant architecture. However, the conformational cycle and inhibitor mechanism of ABCB transporters remain elusive. We reconstituted ABCB19 into lipid nanodiscs, where activity was drastically higher than in detergents, and determined its cryo–electron microscopy structures in substrate-free, substrate-bound, vanadate-trapped, and inhibitor-bound states. Inward-facing ABCB19 moved inward upon substrate binding and fully closed with vanadate trapping, unexpectedly temperature dependent. Two inhibitor molecules locked ABCB19 in the inward-facing conformation. Mutagenesis identified key residues for substrate and inhibitor binding, revealing differential contributions to transporter function and inhibition. These results deepen knowledge of plant ABCB transporters, laying a foundation for targeted manipulation to enhance plant resilience and productivity.",

          "abstract": "Maintaining reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis is essential for balancing growth-defense trade-offs in plants. Although the transcription factors (TFs) that regulate ROS production and scavenging genes have been studied, the regulation of these TFs to control ROS accumulation remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that during N nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat–mediated immunity, Alfin-like 7 (AL7) is ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 7 (UBR7). UBR7 interacts with AL7 and acts as a molecular brake to mediate the ubiquitination of AL7 at lysine-20, leading to its subsequent proteasomal degradation. UBR7 functions upstream of AL7 to reduce AL7-induced ROS accumulation during N -mediated defense. The phosphorylation of AL7 at serine-174 enhances its interaction with UBR7, thereby increasing AL7 ubiquitination and reducing AL7 stability. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which ROS accumulation is regulated through the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of a TF during the immune response. This ensures precise switching of ROS signaling to prevent excessive defense responses.",

Here, we address these challenges using an orthogonal two-color (OTC) scheme, which combines different photon energies and polarizations of the laser fields to produce characteristic photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) that vary with the laser phase. By analyzing the phase-dependent PADs, the partial waves, including their individual amplitudes and phases, involved in the nondissociative and dissociative single ionization of H 2 are unambiguously resolved. In addition, the interaction phases accumulated during the absorption of multiple photons of different polarizations are revealed. The OTC scheme works as a powerful tool to achieve a partial-wave decomposition of the photoelectron wave packet launched via multiphoton ionization and explore attosecond electron dynamics in strong laser fields.",

Key to success is the precise recognition between electron-deficient alkenes and electron-rich alkenes and streamlined alkyl-alkyl bond forming with the control of chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity. This strategy requires alkenes as sole precursors for asymmetric alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling, circumventing the use of stoichiometric amounts of alkyl electrophiles or alkyl nucleophiles as coupling partners.

However, Nematostella Chordin might be a local inhibitor of BMP rather than a shuttle. To choose between these options, we tested whether extracellular mobility of Chordin, a hallmark of shuttling but dispensable for local inhibition, is required for patterning in Nematostella . By generating localized Chordin sources in the Chordin morphant background, we showed that mobile Chordin is necessary and sufficient to establish a peak of BMP signaling opposite to Chordin source. These results provide evidence for BMP shuttling in a bilaterally symmetric cnidarian and suggest that BMP shuttling may have been functional in the potentially bilaterally symmetric cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor.",

During learning, neural selectivity in place- and, to a lesser extent, face-selective regions was greater for subsequently remembered than forgotten events; positively scaled with variability in dorsal attention network activity, within and across individuals; and negatively related to AD pathology, evidenced by elevated plasma phosphorylated Tau 181 (pTau 181 ). Path analysis revealed that neural selectivity mediated the effects of age, attention, and pTau 181 on memory.

When a flux quantum Φ 0 threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip CPR structure and nonreciprocal supercurrent flow. We show that these arise from a nonuniform supercurrent distribution that also leads to a robust and tunable Josephson diode effect.

It has been hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal (EcM) in contrast to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can reduce tree species diversity in local communities, which remains to be tested at the global scale. To address this gap, we analyzed global forest inventory data and revealed that the relationship between tree species richness and EcM tree proportion varied along environmental gradients. Specifically, the relationship is more negative at low latitudes and in moist conditions but is unimodal at high latitudes and in arid conditions. The negative association of EcM tree proportion on species diversity at low latitudes and in humid conditions is likely due to more negative plant-soil microbial interactions in these regions.

          "abstract": "PIEZOs form trimeric calcium-permeable nonselective cationic channels that serve mechanical sensing needs across eukaryotic biology. Forces act on the channels by causing their curved blades to flatten and decompact, leading to an activated state, but it is unclear how this is regulated to enable the channels to adapt to different contexts. To identify potential mechanisms, we performed coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on human PIEZO1. We observed an interblade handshake interaction mediated by basic amino acid residues in two flexible helices coordinated with regulated anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The interaction determined the resting configuration of the channel, blade curvature, compactness, and ion pore structure. In experiments, disruption of the handshake by neutralization of helix amino acids or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate depletion increased the channel’s sensitivity to membrane tension. Structural and amino acid sequence analysis for multiple PIEZOs predicted helix amino acid arrangements for varied handshaking intensity. We suggest a dynamic interaction in PIEZO channels that regulates force sensitivity.",

          "abstract": "The proper assembly of light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) is critical for photosynthesis and requires the biogenesis of light-harvesting chlorophyll a , b -binding proteins (LHCPs) to be coordinated with chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis. The mechanism underlying this coordination is not well understood. Here, we show that a conserved molecular chaperone, chloroplast signal recognition particle 43-kDa protein (cpSRP43), provides a molecular thermostat that helps maintain this coordination. cpSRP43 undergoes a conformational rearrangement between a well-folded closed state and a partially disordered open state. Closed cpSRP43 is dedicated to the biogenesis of LHCPs, whereas open cpSRP43 protects multiple Chl biosynthesis enzymes from heat-induced destabilization. Rising temperature shifts cpSRP43 to the open state, enabling it to protect heat-destabilized Chl biosynthesis enzymes. Our results reveal the molecular basis of a posttranslational mechanism for the thermoadaptation of LHC biogenesis. They also demonstrate how an adenosine triphosphate–independent chaperone uses conformational dynamics to switch its activity and client selectivity, thereby adapting to different proteostatic demands under shifting environmental conditions.",

However, their inherent bandgaps limiting the photoabsorption below 1000 nanometers greatly constrain the further development of these materials and their optoelectronic devices. Here, we reported a straightforward strategy to achieving visible-to-infrared photoabsorption covering 630 to 2000 nanometers in inorganic perovskites by incorporating supramolecular crown ethers. Crown ethers enable supramolecular host-guest complexation and the formation of self-organizing Turing structures composed of original perovskites and supramolecular hybrid crystals. The visible-to-infrared photoabsorption is attributed to the interphase electron transitions in the Turing-structured perovskite hybrid matter system. Such visible-to-infrared photoabsorption is successfully translated into a photoelectronic response in an interdigitated photodetector. Our research extends the light absorption and detection capabilities of the perovskite hybrid semiconductors into the infrared region.",

Observations of spin polarization and magnetization associated with electron transport through chiral molecules, known collectively as the chiral induced spin selectivity effect, suggest that chirality improves electron transfer. Using reconfigurable nanoscale control over conductivity at the LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interface, we create chiral electron potentials that explicitly lack mirror symmetry. Quantum transport measurements on these chiral nanowires reveal enhanced electron pairing persisting to high magnetic fields (up to 18 tesla) and oscillatory transmission resonances as functions of both magnetic field and chemical potential. We interpret these resonances as arising from an engineered axial spin-orbit interaction within the chiral region. The ability to create one-dimensional electron waveguides with this specificity creates opportunities to test, via analog quantum simulation, theories about chirality and spin-polarized electron transport in one-dimensional geometries.",

To create “hybrid” CAR T reg cells with T r 1 cell-like properties, we examined whether the PDCD1 locus could be exploited to endow T reg cells with CAR-regulated IL-10 expression. CRISPR-mediated PD1 deletion increased CAR T reg cell activation, and knock-in of IL10 under control of the PD1 promoter resulted in CAR-induced IL-10 secretion. IL10 knock-in improved CAR T reg cell function, as determined by increased suppression of dendritic cells and alloantigen- and islet autoantigen–specific T cells. In vivo, IL10 knock-in CAR T reg cells were stable, safe, and suppressed dendritic cells and xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. CRISPR-mediated engineering to simultaneously remove an inhibitory signal and enhance a suppressive mechanism is a previously unexplored approach to improve CAR T reg cell potency.",

Existing MAOC is thought to preclude additional C storage on minerals, but this perspective is difficult to reconcile with observations that MAOC stacks in multilayers, suggesting that existing MAOC could promote greater C retention. Here, in a manipulative experiment using 118 soils from 15 agricultural sites across the United States, we show that MAOC formation is promoted by both existing MAOC and its counterpart—MAOC saturation deficit. The positive effect of existing MAOC on the formation of new MAOC persists after accounting for soil physicochemical properties that covary with MAOC. In contrast with current theory, we found that MAOC formation was not clearly influenced by microbial carbon-use efficiency (CUE). Our findings demonstrate that existing MAOC and saturation deficit, not microbial CUE, are key to determining new MAOC formation in agricultural soils.",

A critical yet poorly constrained parameter is whether crustal carbon can “survive” devolatilization processes that accompany slab subduction and therefore influence deep carbon budgets. Carbonatites provide a key record to address this important topic. Here, we present high-precision potassium isotope data for a large set of carbonatite samples from both continental and oceanic settings, spanning from 2 billion years ago to the present. Modeling suggests that the heavy potassium isotopic compositions of carbonatites are inherited from their mantle sources, rather than resulting from magmatic and postmagmatic processes. Our results demonstrate a strong link between the subduction of oceanic crust and the recycling of carbonates into the mantle sources of carbonatites. These findings support the hypothesis that subduction of carbonate-bearing altered oceanic crust has been a critical mechanism for transferring carbon into the deep Earth through time.",

By contrast, zircon water contents of the adjoining coeval TTGs in the Trans-North China Orogen, formed in a supra-subduction zone setting, are notably higher. These results support a two-stage mantle plume-sagduction process for TTG formation.

Here, we demonstrate a strategy for FDW engineering by tailoring the interfacial electrostatic profile. Using SrRuO 3 islands as “nano-masks,” we spatially modulate the interfacial atomic termination to generate alternating positive and negative built-in electric fields. The boundaries where the electric field switches polarity drive the formation of 180° FDWs in BiFeO 3 thin films. This mechanism is validated through theoretical calculations and direct experimental observations. Furthermore, atomic-scale analysis reveals localized lattice distortions, structural chirality of the FDWs, as well as the edge effect of SrRuO 3 islands on the position precision of FDW nucleation.

Beginning our investigation in brown adipose tissue (BAT), we identified a mechanism to explain enhanced glucose utilization in cold-adapted BAT. This was characterized by select remodeling of upper glycolysis and pentose cycling to increase oxygen consumption, likely by increasing uncoupling protein 1 activity through the production of reactive oxygen species. Cold-induced remodeling of the plasma proteome appeared to underpin the ability of BAT to modify its fuel preference, stimulating lipolysis in white adipose tissue and glucose production in the liver.

Here, we mapped eosinophils across evolutional hepatic granulomas in a mouse model and in a primary wild reservoir for human schistosomiasis in Brazil (water rat Nectomys squamipes ). With in-depth quantitative image analysis and three-dimensional histological reconstructions of entire granulomas, we find that eosinophils are spatially organized and occupy a major, peripheral niche conserved across space and time in all granuloma stages and both experimental and natural infections. Within this niche, immature and mature eosinophils coinhabit, compartmentalize their major basic protein-1 content, robustly interact with other immune cells, and secrete through piecemeal degranulation. This unveiled niche, unrelated to parasite eggs, challenges the concept of eosinophil as a “helminth killer” cell and invigorates its view as an immunoregulatory cell of the tissue microenvironment in Schistosoma granulomas.",

Yet, for systems that interact through a network, symmetry breaking can lead to scenarios in which this expectation does not hold. Prominent examples are chimera states in multistable phase-oscillator networks. Here, we show that for a broad class of such networks, asynchronous states can be converted into frequency-synchronized states when identical oscillators are detuned to have different intrinsic frequencies. We show that frequency synchronization is achieved over a range of intrinsic frequency detuning and is thus a robust effect. These results, which are supported by theory, simulations, and electrochemical oscillator experiments, reveal a counterintuitive opportunity to use parameter heterogeneity to promote synchronization.",

Incorporating these data into PK-PD simulations of antibiotic treatment, we find that higher mutation supply increases the probability of resistance, and early adherence to the drug regimen is critical.

We show that AOM coupled with denitrification markedly reduces soil N 2 O emissions, with the type I methanotroph Methylobacter species collaborating with the Methylophilaceae and Gemmatimonadaceae families to perform key roles. The suppression of N 2 O emissions by AOM primarily stems from its role in supplying electrons and carbon sources, fueling complete denitrification by associated bacteria. In addition, we uncovered distinct microbial interaction strategies for AOM-coupled nitrate and nitrite reduction. While nitrite reduction necessitates both bacterial cooperation and extracellular electron transfer during its initial stages, nitrate reduction predominantly depends on methanotrophic bacteria alone at the outset. These findings advance our understanding of carbon-nitrogen cycle coupling and underscore AOM’s potential to simultaneously mitigate both CH 4 and N 2 O emissions.",

However, optical imaging and spectroscopy of atomic-scale structures remain a substantial challenge. Here, we developed ultralow tip oscillation amplitude s-SNOM (ULA-SNOM), where the ultraconfined field localized at a 1-nm-scale gap between a plasmonic tip and sample is combined with frequency-modulation (noncontact) AFM in a stable cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum environment. Using a silver tip under visible laser illumination with a constant 1-nm amplitude oscillation, we obtain a material-contrast image of silicon islands on a silver surface with 1-nm lateral resolution, which surpasses the conventional limits of s-SNOM.

These misoriented signal sequences are subsequently dislocated by the P5A-ATPase ATP13A1 and delivered to SEC61 for further translocation. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structures of human ATP13A1 in multiple conformations (3.40- to 3.87-angstrom resolution), revealing key residues within its substrate-binding pocket that engage signal sequences through polar interactions.

Here, we reveal a mechanism in which light chain 3 proteins (LC3s) and pericentrin (PCNT) form an adaptor complex that is required for vRNPs binding to the dynein 1 and IAV uncoating at endosomes. This function of LC3s and PCNT is independent from their established role in autophagy and centrosome assembly, respectively. LC3s or PCNT depletion severely impairs IAV cytoplasm entry and infection, which can be further inhibited by additional silencing of histone deacetylase 6, an APM component.

This thermal preference increases wasp mortality and enhances host survival. We find that behavioral fever is mediated by up-regulation of Heat shock protein 70 ( Hsp70 ) genes in infected hosts as Hsp70 loss abolishes behavioral fever, whereas its overexpression induces heat-seeking behavior. We further find that behavioral fever up-regulates immune genes in infected hosts, including 12 antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) genes, which disrupt the gut microbiota homeostasis of parasitoid wasps and, in turn, lead to substantial wasp mortality.

Our reconstructions indicate remarkable stability of water table depth in a Pacific Northwest aquifer throughout the LGT despite increasing precipitation, closely matching independent Earth system model (ESM) simulations. In the American Southwest, ESM simulations and noble gas isotopes both suggest a pronounced LGT decline in water table depth in in response to decreasing precipitation, indicating distinct regional groundwater responses to climate.

Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed transcriptomic heterogeneity of vascular endothelial cells in CLEC5A-deficient lungs following CLP. Endothelial-specific knockdown of CLEC5A improved survival of CLP-challenged mice, which was completely ineffective with reexpression of endothelial CLEC5A. The survival benefits were attributed to alleviated inflammatory storm and vascular leakage. Furthermore, endothelial CLEC5A deficiency protected mice against Escherichia coli –induced pneumonia. In vitro, CLEC5A deletion maintained trans-endothelial electrical resistance, and inhibited adhesion and trans-endothelial migration of monocytes/neutrophils under LPS stimulation.

By analyzing &gt;2000 canyons, we show that canyon occurrence correlates with the inclination of continental slopes. Onshore orogeny and associated surface processes, long considered key controls on canyon formation, play a subordinate role. Instead, our results suggest slope inclination as the primary control on submarine canyon density. Because continental slope morphology is fundamentally shaped by marine tectonic and thermal processes, these large-scale forces indirectly govern canyon formation and distribution globally. As a result, they influence the presence of pathways that facilitate the transfer of sediments, carbon, and nutrients to the deep ocean, with implications for biogeochemical cycles over geological timescales.",

By irradiating with a single shot of a spatially shaped ultrashort laser pulse, the optical properties are momentarily changed on the picosecond scale, making the material considerably easier to machine by a successive laser pulse. The selective absorption of laser energy in regions with excited electrons leads to the rapid heating and evaporation of material at an extraordinarily high speed. Furthermore, the machining is achieved using a low-power light source, four orders of magnitude lower than conventional femtosecond lasers. The concept of transiently altering material properties is expected to usher in a paradigm shift in research and development for manufacturing.",

Caspase-1–dependent tumor pyroptosis releases several inflammatory chemokines, converting αSMA + CAF into iCAFs in a CCR6-dependent manner. This is clinically relevant, as a fibroblast gene signature driven by iCAF markers and collagen type III is enriched in patients with chemoresistant bladder cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Contrary to the current notion, iCAFs, rather than myCAFs, produce collagen III in response to chemotherapy, supporting the expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs).

          "abstract": "Edholm’s law predicts exponential growth in data rate and spectrum bandwidth for communications. Owing to exponentially increasing deep neural network computing demands and the slowing of Moore’s law, new computing paradigms are required for future advanced communications like 6G. Optical neural networks (ONNs) are promising accelerators but struggle with scalability and system overhead. Here, we introduce our multiplicative analog frequency transform optical neural network (MAFT-ONN), an artificial intelligence hardware accelerator that experimentally computes fully analog deep learning on raw radio frequency (RF) signals, performing modulation classification that quickly converges to 95% accuracy. MAFT-ONN also exhibits scalability with nearly 4 million fully analog operations for MNIST digit classification. Because of the Shannon capacity–limited analog data movement, MAFT-ONN is also hundreds of times faster than traditional RF receivers.",

          "abstract": "Pacinian corpuscles are among the most sensitive mechanoreceptors found in vertebrates, and they are tuned to vibrations in the highest perceptible frequency range (100 to 2000 Hz). One of their anatomical hallmarks is the onion-like cell layers surrounding the central axon. The innermost layers consist of ~60 densely packed lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs), whose function remains largely unknown. Using high-resolution three-dimensional electron microscopy, we found that LSCs do not form concentric rings, but complex, multilayered, and intertwining assemblies that are connected via a high density of desmosomes and gap junctions. LSCs make multiple converging contacts with the afferent axon via desmosomes. Using optogenetic manipulations of LSCs, we demonstrate not only that their activation drives reliable time-locked spiking in the axon but also that their inactivation significantly elevates the thresholds in situ and increases perceptual thresholds behaviorally. Together, these findings provide evidence that LSCs are a key element of somatosensory processing, actively potentiating mechanosensitivity in Pacinian corpuscles.",

          "abstract": "Mercury compounds are potent neurotoxins that pose threats to human health, primarily through fish consumption. Rivers, critical for drinking water and food supply, have seen rapid increases in mercury concentrations and export to coastal margins since the Industrial Revolution (~1850). However, patterns of these changes remain understudied, limiting assessments of environmental policies. Here, we develop a global model to simulate preindustrial riverine total mercury and assess human perturbations by comparing it to present-day conditions. We find that global rivers transported ~390 megagrams annually of mercury to the oceans in the preindustrial era, with spatial variability. Human activities have elevated riverine mercury budgets by two to three times in the present day. Establishing a baseline riverine mercury level, our findings reveal rapid responses of riverine mercury to human perturbations and could be used to inform targets for global riverine mercury restoration. Total riverine mercury concentrations could also be used as indicators to comprehensively understand the effectiveness of mercury pollution governance.",

          "abstract": "Tissue atlases provide foundational knowledge on the cellular organization and molecular distributions across molecular classes and spatial scales. Here, we construct a comprehensive spatiomolecular lipid atlas of the human kidney from 29 donor tissues using integrated multimodal molecular imaging. Our approach leverages high-spatial-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry for untargeted lipid mapping, stained microscopy for histopathological assessment, and tissue segmentation using autofluorescence microscopy. With a combination of unsupervised, supervised, and interpretable machine learning, the atlas provides multivariate lipid profiles of specific multicellular functional tissue units (FTUs) of the nephron, including the glomerulus, proximal tubules, thick ascending limb, distal tubules, and collecting ducts. In total, the atlas consists of tens of thousands of FTUs and millions of mass spectrometry measurements. Detailed patient, clinical, and histopathologic information allowed molecular data to be mined on the basis of these features. As examples, we highlight the discovery of how lipid profiles are altered with sex and differences in body mass index.",

          "abstract": "Oceanic mesoscale eddies play a crucial but underexplored role in regulating carbon fluxes and climate change. While they redistribute heat, salt, nutrients, and other tracers, their effects on CO 2 uptake remain uncertain. Using observation-based machine learning to estimate CO 2 fluxes throughout the lifetimes of thousands of eddies, we show that anticyclonic eddies substantially enhance CO 2 uptake on average, while cyclonic eddies marginally diminish it. This asymmetry yields an overall net increase in CO 2 absorption by 9.98 ± 2.28 and 13.82 ± 9.94% in the Kuroshio Extension and Gulf Stream, respectively, major carbon sequestration regions. The primary driver of this enhanced uptake is the downward pumping of dissolved inorganic carbon within anticyclonic eddies. Asymmetric biological responses between anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies contribute to the overall eddy-induced CO 2 flux imbalance. The finding suggests a potential underestimation of the ocean’s capacity for carbon sequestration because of insufficient incorporation of eddies in current observations, emphasizing the need for expanded monitoring in eddy-rich, undersampled regions.",
