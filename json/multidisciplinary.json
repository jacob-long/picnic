          "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations are widespread in normal human tissues1. Similarly, in murine chimeras, cells carrying an oncogenic lesion contribute normal cells to adult tissues without causing cancer2,3,4. How lineages that escape cancer via normal development differ from the minority that succumb is unclear. Tumours exhibit characteristic cancer hallmarks; we therefore searched for hallmarks that differentiate cancer-prone lineages from resistant lineages. Here we show that total cell cycle duration (Tc) predicts transformation susceptibility across multiple tumour types. Cancer-prone Rb- and p107-deficient retina (Rb is also known as Rb1 and p107 is also known as Rbl1) exhibited defects in apoptosis, senescence, immune surveillance, angiogenesis, DNA repair, polarity and proliferation. Perturbing the SKP2–p27–CDK2/CDK1 axis could block cancer without affecting these hallmarks. Thus, cancer requires more than the presence of its hallmarks. Notably, every tumour-suppressive mutation that we tested increased Tc, and the Tc of the cell of origin of retinoblastoma cells was half that of resistant lineages. Tc also differentiated the cell of origin in Rb−/− pituitary cancer. In lung, loss of Rb and p53 (also known as Trp53) transforms neuroendocrine cells, whereas KrasG12D or BrafV600E mutations transform alveolar type 2 cells5,6,7. The shortest Tc consistently identified the cell of origin, regardless of mutation timing. Thus, relative Tc is a hallmark of initiation that distinguishes cancer-prone from cancer-resistant lineages in several settings, explaining how mutated cells escape transformation without inducing apoptosis, senescence or immune surveillance.",

          "abstract": "Volcanic hotspots are thought to form by melting in an upwelling mantle plume head followed by melting of the plume tail. Plate motion then generates an age-progressive volcanic track originating from a large igneous province to a currently active hotspot. The most voluminous large igneous province, the approximately 120-million-year-old Ontong Java Nui Plateau (OJP-Nui) in the mid-Pacific, however, lacks an obvious volcanic track. Although the Louisville hotspot track was originally proposed as a candidate, limited constraints for Pacific absolute plate and plume motion before 80 million years ago (Ma) suggest a mismatch1. Existing Pacific models rely on age–distance data from the continuous Hawai‘i–Emperor and Louisville tracks, but their tracks older than approximately 80 Ma are subducted. Elsewhere on the Pacific Plate, only discontinuous seamount tracks that formed before 80 Ma are documented2,3,4,5,6,7. Currently, models require approximately 1,200 kilometres of latitudinal motion to link the Louisville plume to the OJP-Nui1, but palaeolatitude estimates from about 70 Ma to today remain within error of its present location8,9, suggesting that any substantial Louisville plume motion occurred earlier. Here, through a combination of geochemistry and geochronology9,10,11,12,13,14, we demonstrate that Samoa and Rurutu–Arago are the longest-lived Pacific hotspots, traceable to more than 100 Ma before subducting into the Mariana Trench. These tracks better constrain plate rotation between 80 Ma and 100 Ma, allowing us to update Pacific absolute plate motion models and link the Louisville volcanic track to OJP-Nui without requiring major plume motion.",

          "abstract": "The targeted delivery of therapeutics to internal organs to, for example, promote healing or apoptosis holds promise in the treatment of numerous diseases1,2,3,4. Currently, the prevailing delivery modality relies on the circulation; however, this modality has substantial efficiency, safety and/or controllability limitations5,6,7,8,9. Here we report a battery-free, chipless, soft nanofluidic intracellular delivery (NanoFLUID) patch that provides enhanced and customized delivery of payloads in targeted internal organs. The chipless architecture and the flexible nature of thin functional layers facilitate integration with internal organs. The nanopore–microchannel–microelectrode structure enables safe, efficient and precise electroperforation of the cell membrane, which in turn accelerates intracellular payload transport by approximately 105 times compared with conventional diffusion methods while operating under relatively low-amplitude pulses (20 V). Through evaluations of the NanoFLUID patch in multiple in vivo scenarios, including treatment of breast tumours and acute injury in the liver and modelling tumour development, we validated its efficiency, safety and controllability for organ-targeted delivery. NanoFLUID-mediated in vivo transfection of a gene library also enabled efficient screening of essential drivers of breast cancer metastasis in the lung and liver. Through this approach, DUS2 was identified as a lung-specific metastasis driver. Thus, NanoFLUID represents an innovative bioelectronic platform for the targeted delivery of payloads to internal organs to treat various diseases and to uncover new insights in biology.",

          "abstract": "Different theories explain how subjective experience arises from brain activity 1,2 . These theories have independently accrued evidence, but have not been directly compared 3 . Here we present an open science adversarial collaboration directly juxtaposing integrated information theory (IIT) 4,5 and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT) 6–10 via a theory-neutral consortium 11–13 . The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes and interpretation thereof 12 . Human participants ( n = 256) viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography. We found information about conscious content in visual, ventrotemporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results align with some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging key tenets of both theories. For IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within the posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in the prefrontal cortex. These challenges extend to other theories of consciousness that share some of the predictions tested here 14–17 . Beyond challenging the theories, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through principled, theory-driven, collaborative research and highlight the need for a quantitative framework for systematic theory testing and building.",

          "abstract": "Indigenous groups often encounter significant challenges when asserting ancestral claims and cultural affiliations based on oral histories, particularly in the USA where such narratives have historically been undervalued. Although ancient DNA offers a tool to complement traditional knowledge and address gaps in oral history, longstanding disregard for Indigenous sovereignty and beliefs has understandably led many Indigenous communities to distrust DNA studies 1–4 . Earlier research often focused on repatriation claims 5–7 , whereas more recent work has increasingly moved towards enhancing Tribal histories 8,9 . Here we present a collaborative study initiated by a federally recognized Native American tribe, the sovereign nation of Picuris Pueblo in the Northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico, USA, to address gaps in traditional knowledge and further their understanding of their population history and ancestry. We generated genomes from 16 ancient Picuris individuals and 13 present-day members of Picuris Pueblo, providing genomic data spanning the last millennium. We show genetic continuity between ancient and present-day Picuris, and more broadly with Ancestral Puebloans from Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon 10 , 275 km to the west. This suggests a firm spatiotemporal link among these Puebloan populations of the North American Southwest. Furthermore, we see no evidence of population decline before European arrival 11–13 , and no Athabascan ancestry in individuals predating 1500 ce , challenging earlier migration hypotheses 14–16 . This work prioritizes Indigenous control of genetic data and brings together oral tradition, archaeology, ethnography and genetics.",

          "abstract": "Nuclear fission leads to the splitting of a nucleus into two fragments1,2. Studying the distribution of the masses and charges of the fragments is essential for establishing the fission mechanisms and refining the theoretical models3,4. It has value for our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis5,6, in which the fission of nuclei with extreme neutron-to-proton ratios is pivotal for determining astrophysical abundances and understanding the origin of the elements7 and for energy applications8,9. Although the asymmetric distribution of fragments is well understood for actinides (elements in the periodic table with atomic numbers from 89 to 103) based on shell effects10, symmetric fission governs the scission process for lighter elements. However, unexpected asymmetric splits have been observed in neutron-deficient exotic nuclei11, prompting extensive further investigations. Here we present measurements of the charge distributions of fission fragments for 100 exotic fissioning systems, 75 of which have never been measured, and establish a connection between the neutron-deficient sub-lead region and the well-understood actinide region. These new data comprehensively map the asymmetric fission island and provide clear evidence for the role played by the deformed Z = 36 proton shell of the light fragment in the fission of sub-lead nuclei. Our dataset will help constrain the fission models used to estimate the fission properties of nuclei with extreme neutron-to-proton ratios for which experimental data are unavailable.",

In bacteria and plants, TIR-domain proteins recognize pathogen invasion and then produce immune signalling molecules exclusively comprising nucleotide moieties2,3,4,5. Here we show that the TIR-domain protein of the type II Thoeris defence system in bacteria produces a unique signalling molecule comprising the amino acid histidine conjugated to ADP-ribose (His-ADPR). His-ADPR is generated in response to phage infection and activates the cognate Thoeris effector by binding a Macro domain located at the C terminus of the effector protein. By determining the crystal structure of a ligand-bound Macro domain, we describe the structural basis for His-ADPR and its recognition and show its role by biochemical and mutational analyses. Our analyses furthermore reveal a family of phage proteins that bind and sequester His-ADPR signalling molecules, enabling phages to evade TIR-mediated immunity. These data demonstrate diversity in bacterial TIR signalling and reveal a new class of TIR-derived immune signalling molecules that combine nucleotide and amino acid moieties.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal activity must be regulated in a narrow permissive band for the proper operation of neural networks. Changes in synaptic connectivity and network activity—for example, during learning—might disturb this balance, eliciting compensatory mechanisms to maintain network function 1–3 . In the neocortex, excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons exhibit robust forms of stabilizing plasticity. However, although neuronal plasticity has been thoroughly studied in pyramidal cells 4–8 , little is known about how interneurons adapt to persistent changes in their activity. Here we describe a critical cellular process through which cortical parvalbumin-expressing (PV + ) interneurons adapt to changes in their activity levels. We found that changes in the activity of individual PV + interneurons drive bidirectional compensatory adjustments of the number and strength of inhibitory synapses received by these cells, specifically from other PV + interneurons. High-throughput profiling of ribosome-associated mRNA revealed that increasing the activity of a PV + interneuron leads to upregulation of two genes encoding multiple secreted neuropeptides: Vgf and Scg2 . Functional experiments demonstrated that VGF is critically required for the activity-dependent scaling of inhibitory PV + synapses onto PV + interneurons. Our findings reveal an instructive role for neuropeptide-encoding genes in regulating synaptic connections among PV + interneurons in the adult mouse neocortex.",

          "abstract": "Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) impairs the durability of aluminium (Al) alloys and hinders their use in a hydrogen economy1,2,3. Intermetallic compound particles in Al alloys can trap hydrogen and mitigate HE4, but these particles usually form in a low number density compared with conventional strengthening nanoprecipitates. Here we report a size-sieved complex precipitation in Sc-added Al–Mg alloys to achieve a high-density dispersion of both fine Al3Sc nanoprecipitates and in situ formed core-shell Al3(Mg, Sc)2/Al3Sc nanophases with high hydrogen-trapping ability. The two-step heat treatment induces heterogeneous nucleation of the Samson-phase Al3(Mg, Sc)2 on the surface of Al3Sc nanoprecipitates that are only above 10 nm in size. The size dependence is associated with Al3Sc nanoprecipitate incoherency, which leads to local segregation of magnesium and triggers the formation of Al3(Mg, Sc)2. The tailored distribution of dual nanoprecipitates in our Al–Mg–Sc alloy provides about a 40% increase in strength and nearly five times improved HE resistance compared with the Sc-free alloy, reaching a record tensile uniform elongation in Al alloys charged with H up to 7 ppmw. We apply this strategy to other Al–Mg-based alloys, such as Al–Mg–Ti–Zr, Al–Mg–Cu–Sc and Al–Mg–Zn–Sc alloys. Our work showcases a possible route to increase hydrogen resistance in high-strength Al alloys and could be readily adapted to large-scale industrial production.",

          "abstract": "Nickel is a critical element in the shift to sustainable energy systems, with the demand for nickel projected to exceed 6 million tons annually by 2040 1–4 , largely driven by the electrification of the transport sector. Primary nickel production uses acids and carbon-based reductants, emitting about 20 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of nickel produced 5–7 . Here we present a method using fossil-free hydrogen-plasma-based reduction to extract nickel from low-grade ore variants known as laterites. We bypass the traditional multistep process and combine calcination, smelting, reduction and refining into a single metallurgical step conducted in one furnace. This approach produces high-grade ferronickel alloys at fast reduction kinetics. Thermodynamic control of the atmosphere of the furnace enables selective nickel reduction, yielding an alloy with minimal impurities (&lt;0.04 wt% silicon, approximately 0.01 wt% phosphorus and &lt;0.09 wt% calcium), eliminating the need for further refining. The proposed method has the potential to be up to about 18% more energy efficient while cutting direct carbon dioxide emissions by up to 84% compared with current practice. Our work thus shows a sustainable approach to help resolve the contradiction between the beneficial use of nickel in sustainable energy technologies and the environmental harm caused by its production.",

Here we demonstrate across multiple scales that inhibition of matrix mechanosensing in persistently activated cardiac fibroblasts potentiates—in concert with soluble regulators of the TGFβ pathway—a robust transcriptomic, morphological and metabolic shift towards quiescence. By conducting a meta-analysis of public human and mouse single-cell sequencing datasets, we identify the focal-adhesion-associated tyrosine kinase SRC as a fibroblast-enriched mechanosensor that can be targeted selectively in stromal cells to mimic the effects of matrix softening in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of SRC by saracatinib, coupled with TGFβ suppression, induces synergistic repression of key profibrotic gene programs in fibroblasts, characterized by a marked inhibition of the MRTF–SRF pathway, which is not seen after treatment with either drug alone. Importantly, the dual treatment alleviates contractile dysfunction in fibrotic engineered heart tissues and in a mouse model of heart failure. Our findings point to joint inhibition of SRC-mediated stromal mechanosensing and TGFβ signalling as a potential mechanotherapeutic strategy for treating cardiovascular fibrosis.",

          "abstract": "The discovery of ferrocene1 heralded the advent of modern organometallic chemistry. Characterized by the π-coordination of a metal by one or two planar annulene anions, ferrocenes and their analogues2,3,4 exemplify the archetype of out-of-plane annulene metal complexes. By contrast, the integration of metal within the annulene core to form in-plane annulene metal complexes featuring metal–carbon σ bonds has been obstructed not only by the synthetic difficulty and the non-planarity of annulenes with appropriate internal dimensions, but also by the difficulty of embedding the metal. These challenges have prevented the isolation of such in-plane annulene metal complexes. Here we report the preparation of three metal-centred planar [15]annulene frameworks. The most symmetrical fragment has D5h symmetry, with the metal centre shared by five identical five-membered rings. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that metal d orbitals participate in conjugation with these five-membered rings, rendering all of them aromatic. The overall framework bears a loose structural and spectroscopic analogy to metallo-expanded porphyrins with multiple aza donors5, which thus provides a nexus between annulene chemistry and classic heteroatom-based coordination chemistry. The present systems display high stability and are easily functionalized. We thus suggest that metal-centred planar annulenes could emerge as promising building blocks for materials science.",

          "abstract": "A chain of quantum dots (QDs) in semiconductor–superconductor hybrid systems can form an artificial Kitaev chain hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs)1,2,3. These zero-energy states are expected to be localized on the edges of the chain4, at the outermost QDs. The remaining QDs, comprising the bulk, are predicted to host an excitation gap that protects the MBSs at the edges from local on-site perturbations. Here we demonstrate this connection between the bulk and edges in a minimal system, by engineering a three-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas. Through direct tunnelling spectroscopy on each site, we show that the appearance of stable zero-bias conductance peaks at the outer QDs is correlated with the presence of an excitation gap in the middle QD. Furthermore, we show that this gap can be controlled by applying a superconducting phase difference between the two hybrid segments and that the MBSs are robust only when the excitation gap is present. We find a close agreement between experiments and the original Kitaev model, thus confirming key predictions for MBSs in a three-site chain.",

          "abstract": "During the twentieth century, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered a disease of early industrialized regions in North America, Europe and Oceania1. At the turn of the twenty-first century, IBD incidence increased in newly industrialized and emerging regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America, while the prevalence in early industrialized regions continued to grow steadily2,3,4. Changes in the incidence and prevalence denote the evolution of IBD across four epidemiologic stages: stage 1 (emergence), characterized by low incidence and prevalence; stage 2 (acceleration in incidence), marked by rapidly rising incidence and low prevalence; and stage 3 (compounding prevalence), where the incidence decelerates, plateaus or declines while the prevalence steadily increases. A fourth stage (prevalence equilibrium) has been proposed in which the prevalence slope plateaus due to demographic shifts in an ageing IBD population, but it has not yet been evidenced. To date, these stages have remained theoretical, lacking specific numerical indicators to define transition points. Here, using real-world data from 522 population-based studies encompassing 82 global regions and spanning more than a century (1920–2024), we show spatiotemporal transitions across stages 1–3 and model stage 4 progression. Understanding the evolution of IBD across epidemiologic stages enables healthcare systems to better anticipate the future worldwide burden of IBD.",

          "abstract": "Despite accumulating evidence that bat-derived coronaviruses often require intermediate hosts to facilitate transmission to humans1, the potential role of fur animals in zoonotic coronavirus spillovers has largely been overlooked2. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mink respiratory coronavirus (MRCoV) from farmed minks with pneumonia. Notably, MRCoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor and can infect mink, bat, monkey, and human cells. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed that the MRCoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds to the same interface on ACE2 receptors as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RBD, despite exhibiting notable structural differences. We identify the key determinants on ACE2 and MRCoV RBD that confer efficient binding. HKU5-33S, a bat coronavirus closely related to MRCoV, utilizes ACE2 of bat Pipistrellus abramus and requires only two amino acid substitutions to adapt to mink ACE2. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 protease and polymerase inhibitors potently block MRCoV infection, indicating a potential therapeutic strategy. Collectively, these findings enhance the understanding of coronavirus receptor dynamics and highlight their zoonotic potential. Given the risks posed by fur farms as reservoirs for emerging pathogens, our study underscores the urgent need for enhanced surveillance to mitigate future coronavirus outbreaks.",

          "abstract": "Marine plastic pollution is a global issue, with microplastics (1 µm–5 mm) dominating the measured plastic count1,2. Although microplastics can be found throughout the oceanic water column3,4, most studies collect microplastics from surface waters (less than about 50-cm depth) using net tows5. Consequently, our understanding of the microplastics distribution across ocean depths is more limited. Here we synthesize depth-profile data from 1,885 stations collected between 2014 and 2024 to provide insights into the distribution and potential transport mechanisms of subsurface (below about 50-cm depth, which is not usually sampled by traditional practices3,6) microplastics throughout the oceanic water column. We find that the abundances of microplastics range from 10−4 to 104 particles per cubic metre. Microplastic size affects their distribution; the abundance of small microplastics (1 µm to 100 µm) decreases gradually with depth, indicating a more even distribution and longer lifespan in the water column compared with larger microplastics (100 µm to 5,000 µm) that tend to concentrate at the stratified layers. Mid-gyre accumulation zones extend into the subsurface ocean but are concentrated in the top 100 m and predominantly consist of larger microplastics. Our analysis suggests that microplastics constitute a measurable fraction of the total particulate organic carbon, increasing from 0.1% at 30 m to 5% at 2,000 m. Although our study establishes a global benchmark, our findings underscore that the lack of standardization creates substantial uncertainties, making it challenging to advance our comprehension of the distribution of microplastics and its impact on the oceanic environment.",

          "abstract": "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average 1 and plant communities are responding through shifts in species abundance, composition and distribution 2–4 . However, the direction and magnitude of local changes in plant diversity in the Arctic have not been quantified. Using a compilation of 42,234 records of 490 vascular plant species from 2,174 plots across the Arctic, here we quantified temporal changes in species richness and composition through repeat surveys between 1981 and 2022. We also identified the geographical, climatic and biotic drivers behind these changes. We found greater species richness at lower latitudes and warmer sites, but no indication that, on average, species richness had changed directionally over time. However, species turnover was widespread, with 59% of plots gaining and/or losing species. Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness. Despite changes in plant composition, Arctic plant communities did not become more similar to each other, suggesting no biotic homogenization so far. Overall, Arctic plant communities changed in richness and composition in different directions, with temperature and plant–plant interactions emerging as the main drivers of change. Our findings demonstrate how climate and biotic drivers can act in concert to alter plant composition, which could precede future biodiversity changes that are likely to affect ecosystem function, wildlife habitats and the livelihoods of Arctic peoples 5,6 .",

Although hippocampal circuits have been implicated in distinguishing novel and familiar conspecifics2,3,4,5,6,7, it remains unclear how social valence is constructed on the basis of social history and what mechanisms underlie the heightened valence versatility in dynamic relationships. Here we demonstrate that the ventral (v)CA1 integrates serotonin (5-HT) inputs from the dorsal raphe and neurotensin inputs from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) to determine positive or negative valence of conspecific representations. Specifically, during an appetitive social interaction 5-HT is released into the vCA1 and disinhibits pyramidal neurons through 5-HT1B receptors, whereas neurotensin is released during an aversive social interaction and potentiates vCA1 neurons directly through NTR1s. Optogenetic silencing of dorsal raphe 5-HT and PVT neurotensin inputs into the vCA1 impairs positive and negative social valence, respectively, and excitation flexibly switches valence assignment. These results show how aversive and rewarding social experiences are linked to conspecific identity through converging dorsal raphe 5-HT and PVT neurotensin signals in the vCA1 that instruct opposing valence, and represent a synaptic switch for flexible social valence computation.",

Recent work has established that WD can impair microbiome resilience to acute perturbations such as antibiotic treatment7,8, although little is known about the mechanism of impairment and the specific consequences for the host of prolonged post-antibiotic dysbiosis. Here we characterize the trajectory by which the gut microbiome recovers its taxonomic and functional profile after antibiotic treatment in mice on regular chow (RC) or WD, and find that only mice on RC undergo a rapid successional process of recovery. Metabolic modelling indicates that a RC diet promotes the development of syntrophic cross-feeding interactions, whereas in mice on WD, a dominant taxon monopolizes readily available resources without releasing syntrophic byproducts. Intervention experiments reveal that an appropriate dietary resource environment is both necessary and sufficient for rapid and robust microbiome recovery, whereas microbial transplant is neither. Furthermore, prolonged post-antibiotic dysbiosis in mice on WD renders them susceptible to infection by the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Our data challenge widespread enthusiasm for faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) as a strategy to address dysbiosis, and demonstrate that specific dietary interventions are, at a minimum, an essential prerequisite for effective FMT, and may afford a safer, more natural and less invasive alternative.",

In insects, the neck connective is both a physical and an information bottleneck connecting the brain and the ventral nerve cord (an analogue of the spinal cord) and comprises diverse populations of descending neurons (DNs), ascending neurons (ANs) and sensory ascending neurons, which are crucial for sensorimotor signalling and control. Here, by integrating three separate electron microscopy (EM) datasets 1–4 , we provide a complete connectomic description of the ANs and DNs of the Drosophila female nervous system and compare them with neurons of the male nerve cord. Proofread neuronal reconstructions are matched across hemispheres, datasets and sexes. Crucially, we also match 51% of DN cell types to light-level data 5 defining specific driver lines, as well as classifying all ascending populations. We use these results to reveal the anatomical and circuit logic of neck connective neurons. We observe connected chains of DNs and ANs spanning the neck, which may subserve motor sequences. We provide a complete description of sexually dimorphic DN and AN populations, with detailed analyses of selected circuits for reproductive behaviours, including male courtship 6 (DNa12; also known as aSP22) and song production 7 (AN neurons from hemilineage 08B) and female ovipositor extrusion 8 (DNp13).

Hailong protein B (HalB) is an NTase that converts deoxy-ATP into single-stranded DNA oligomers. A series of X-ray crystal structures define a stepwise mechanism of HalB DNA synthesis initiated by a C-terminal tyrosine residue that enables de novo enzymatic priming. We show that HalB DNA signals bind to and repress activation of a partnering Hailong protein A (HalA) effector complex. A 2.0 Å cryo-EM structure of the HalA–DNA complex reveals a membrane protein with a conserved ion channel domain and a unique crown domain that binds the DNA signal and gates activation. Analyzing Hailong defence in vivo, we demonstrate that viral DNA exonucleases required for phage replication trigger release of the primed HalA complex and induce protective host cell growth arrest.

Credit: David Kawai/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nEconomist Mark Carney — leader of Canada’s centre-left Liberal party — will remain Canadian prime minister following Monday’s election. At the time of publication, it was unclear by how much the Liberals had won, but the victory is being seen as a vote of confidence that Carney can fend off economic and other threats to Canada posed by US President Donald Trump.\n\nScientists are cautiously hopeful that Carney will be good news for research in Canada — particularly because of a fund proposed by the Liberal party to attract talent to Canadian universities and to help replace US science funding that has been cut by Trump.\n\n“We’ve seen a strong commitment from the Liberal party in the past to science, and I hope that continues,” says Sarah Laframboise, executive director of the non-profit Evidence for Democracy advocacy group in Ottawa. But, she adds, the future of Canadian science and research is murky because they weren’t discussed much during the election campaign.\n\nStunning turnaround\n\nCarney assumed the role of prime minister in March, after Justin Trudeau, former leader of the ruling Liberal party, resigned. Canada’s political landscape has swung wildly over the past year, with the Conservative party, led by Pierre Poilievre, dominating polls throughout 2024. After Trump put tariffs on Canada and spoke about his desire to make the country the 51st US state, however, public opinion shifted dramatically.\n\nThe meteoric rise of the Liberals is at least partly attributable to Carney’s economic credentials: the prime minister spent 13 years at investment-banking company Goldman Sachs, was the former governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England and is widely credited with saving Canada from the worst impacts of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nCarney celebrates his win at campaign headquarters in Ottawa early on Tuesday.Credit: Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP/Alamy\n\nIn the wake of Trudeau’s resignation, Carney called for a snap election to be held this month, well ahead of the usual October date.\n\nPoilievre worried Canadian scientists earlier this month with his campaign promise to “put an end to the imposition of woke ideology … in the allocation of federal funds for university research” — mirroring language that Trump has used to justify slashing and freezing billions of dollars in US research grants — and to cancel “radical and wasteful” diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. The official 2025 Conservative platform mentioned science only briefly, in the context of managing marine protected areas and investing in fisheries research.\n\nChampioning science\n\nThe official Liberal platform, by contrast, contains an entire section on “championing science and research”, including a promise to create a Canadian Sovereignty and Resilience Research Fund. “Where the U.S. is squeezing out researchers, we will look to welcome research here in Canada,” it reads. “If the U.S. cuts a researcher’s project funding, we will work with the Canadian research ecosystem if projects can directly help Canadians or be commercialized here.”\n\nCanadian science gets biggest boost to PhD and postdoc pay in 20 years\n\nCanadian researchers welcome the sentiment but are waiting for more details — including who exactly would get funding and how much they would receive. “This is very aspirational,” says Sean O’Reilly, president of the Ottawa-based Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, the labour union that represents federal scientists. No numbers or specifics have been mentioned by the Liberals, amid news of the mounting US brain drain. “They make explicit mention of attracting researchers to Canada. I’m excited about that,” says Rees Kassen, director of the Trottier Institute of Science and Public Policy at McGill University in Montreal. But, he asks, “how do we finance an increase in researchers in a system that’s already stressed?”",

The antivenom is reported today in a paper in Cell.\n\nScientists say that the research could lead to direly needed treatments, but that its reliance on material from a person who performed dangerous experiments on himself makes it ethically murky. The paper’s authors say they played no part in Friede’s self-exposure to venom. “We did not advise Friede to do this and no one else needs to do this again — we have all the molecules we need,” says co-author Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biomedical firm Centivax in South San Francisco, California. “Snake venom is dangerous,” he adds, and he cautions people not to follow Friede’s example.\n\nImperfect remedies\n\nCurrent antivenoms are made by injecting horses and other animals with snake venom and then gathering the resulting antibodies. Each antivenom protects against the venom of at most a few species.\n\n“Considering the advanced technologies available in immunology today, it is unacceptable to continue relying on these outdated methods for treating snake bites,” says Kartik Sunagar, a biologist who develops antivenoms at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru.\n\nThe paper’s authors sought to make an antivenom that would protect against a wide range of the world’s 600-plus venomous snake species. As a start, the team focused on the Elapidae family, which includes nearly half of those species. Elapid venom contains peptides called short-chain neurotoxins (SNX) and long-chain neurotoxins (LNX). Both types of peptide bind to the same receptors on nerve cells, impairing communication between neurons and potentially causing muscle paralysis and respiratory failure.\n\nDon’t try this at home\n\nGlanville and his co-author Peter Kwong, a biochemist at Columbia University in New York City, had read news coverage about Friede, who took careful notes about his venom exposure. After receiving approval from an ethics review board, getting informed consent from Friede, and supplying him with documents about the dangers of snake venom, the team collected two vials of Friede’s blood. They isolated antibodies from it and tested them against a panel of toxins from elapid snakes. Antibodies that bound to the toxins were then tested in mice that had been dosed with snake venom. Seeking to add protection against even more species, the researchers tested a third element: varespladib, which inhibits a snake-venom enzyme that breaks down muscle and nerve tissue.\n\nAntibodies from snake collector Tim Friede, here with a water cobra (Hydrodynastes gigas), have been used to make a broad-spectrum antivenom.Credit: Centivax\n\nThey found that a cocktail made up of varespladib and two antibodies from Friede allowed mice to survive otherwise lethal doses of venom from any one of 19 species of dangerous elapid snakes. One of the antibodies binds to a molecular feature shared by toxins in the LNX family. The other binds to a feature shared by toxins in the SNX family.\n\nGlanville says that exact copies of human antibodies could pose less risk of adverse reactions than those based on animal antibodies and broad-spectrum synthetic antibodies designed with computational approaches.",

          "title": "Will US science survive Trump 2.0?",
          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson, Dan Garisto, Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "In just the first three months of his second term, US President Donald Trump has destabilized eight decades of government support for science. His administration has fired thousands of government scientists, bringing large swathes of the country’s research to a standstill and halting many clinical trials. It has threatened to slash billions in funding from US research universities and has terminated more than 1,000 grants in areas such as climate change, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and HIV prevention.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nThis looks likely to be just the beginning. Congress approved a budget bill on 10 April that could lay the groundwork for massive spending cuts over the coming decade. The White House is expected to propose a budget for 2026 that would slash investments in science across the federal government; for example, the Trump administration is considering cutting the science budget for NASA nearly in half and spending at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by 40%. The administration has also begun implementing strict immigration measures that have left some students and researchers in detention centres, and many academics fear that these and future measures could spur researchers to look for opportunities outside the United States.\n\nThe dismantling of scientific institutions and of much of the research ecosystem has led increasing numbers of people inside and outside research to wonder how science will survive Trump. In March, some 1,900 members of the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which represent the country’s leading scientists, published an open letter, declaring: “We are sending this SOS to sound a clear warning: the nation’s scientific enterprise is being decimated.”\n\nIn a survey of Nature readers in April, 94% of nearly 1,600 respondents said they are worried about the future of science in the country. And the same proportion said the Trump administration’s science policies will have negative effects on the world. Although the poll did not include a statistically representative sample, it presents a window onto the concerns of a broad array of researchers (see ‘Trump effects’).\n\nSource: Nature analysis of survey data, April 2025\n\nDamage caused by the Trump administration, science-policy experts warn, could set the United States back for decades. “So many of the damaging impacts are going to be extremely difficult to reverse and are going to take a very long time to recover from,” says John Holdren, a science adviser to former US president Barack Obama who is now a science-policy specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nPresidential plans\n\nThe United States became the pre-eminent science superpower in the wake of the Second World War through sustained federal investments in research and development. This led to innovations and technology that are integral to modern life, such as the Internet, Google’s search engine, GPS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In 2024, the federal government spent about US$200 billion on research and development, with roughly half of that going to defence-related work.\n\nWhat Trump 2.0 means for science: the likely winners and losers\n\nThe largest piece of the pie in non-defence science funding — nearly $48 billion — goes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), sometimes called the crown jewel of US science, which typically awards more than 60,000 research grants per year. As one measure of its impact, the NIH supplied funding that contributed to more than 99% of drugs approved in the United States from 2010 to 2019 (E. Galkina Cleary et al. JAMA Health Forum 4, e230511; 2023).\n\nIn the lead-up to his inauguration, Trump said that his administration would “unleash scientific breakthroughs, ensure America’s technological dominance, and usher in a Golden Age of American Innovation!” His Department of Government Efficiency, headed by billionaire Elon Musk, has justified its sweeping terminations of funds and mass firings at agencies such as the NIH as efforts to root out waste, fraud and abuse, although it has not presented evidence of such.\n\nMany of the administration’s actions mirror suggestions made in Project 2025, a blueprint for a second Trump presidency developed by the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington DC. One of its four central objectives is to “dismantle the administrative state”, which includes thousands of workers at agencies such as the NIH, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Environmental Protection Agency. Project 2025’s authors accuse these federal workers of waste, corruption and “woke propaganda” — language that the Trump administration has used to explain its actions.\n\nEmployees lined up outside the US health department as it began cutting thousands of jobs.Credit: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nSome conservatives have long questioned the value of federal investments in fundamental research, and these views have gained traction with some modern technology industrialists, says William Press, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. The idea that the private sector can pick up the slack has gained ground as the Trump administration works to scale back public investments in science. Press calls it a risky experiment. “There’s going to be a lot of roadkill.”\n\nA spokesperson for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy told Nature that the president has “outlined the administration’s science and technology priorities to ensure American dominance continues into the next generation”.\n\nBut dozens of scientists interviewed by Nature since Trump’s inauguration say the administration’s actions are dismantling US science rather than improving it. “It’s not that there aren’t things that you can do to improve how science is funded,” says Pamela Herd, a sociologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who studies health policy and bureaucracy. What the Trump administration is doing risks killing “the golden goose” that is US science, Herd says.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is slashing NIH-backed research — in charts\n\n“The irony,” she says, “is that mostly what that will do is just increase the risk for fraud, waste and abuse.”\n\nIn some agencies, the intent seems to be to “cut until they can no longer deliver on their mission”, says Rachel Cleetus, a climate-policy researcher at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She points to lay-offs at the National Weather Service (NWS), which have hindered its operations and forecasting capabilities. If the NWS could not function, it would then be easier to dissolve the agency altogether, which would open the door for private weather services to take its place, says Cleetus. “They want to privatize a lot of these essential public goods.”\n\nBut massive, cost-intensive fundamental research is unlikely to be replaced, policy experts warn. “No one has the capacity of the federal government,” Herd says. “You’re producing research, but you’re also training the next generation of scientists. Private industry can’t do that.”\n\nIn particular, the government provides crucial funds for fundamental research that aims to build knowledge but is not necessarily conducted with a practical application in mind (see ‘Innovation spending’). Such research can be years or even decades away from seeding a new technology, and many fundamental-science studies will never reach that point, says Ufuk Akcigit, an economist at the University of Chicago in Illinois. This makes it risky for companies to invest at such an early stage. Instead, they often wait until a discovery’s application becomes clear and then fund the final stages of development, he says.\n\nSource: Natl Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (https://go.nature.com/4JTAN8F)\nGutting federal science\n\nOne of the clearest and most immediate actions the Trump administration has taken to reshape science has been to slash the vast network of scientists and experts who work for the federal government. As of 2020, around 280,000 scientists and engineers were part of the 2-million-strong federal workforce that is now being downsized. In its first three months, the Trump administration has cut many thousands of jobs from science agencies such as the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, although exact figures are difficult to tally because the departments have not released the numbers.\n\nOn its own, the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the NIH, CDC and FDA, announced that it would terminate about 10,000 employees. Many of those who have been fired from science agencies are researchers or staff who support research. In discussions of the 2026 budget, the president and Congress have vowed to make even larger cuts to the federal workforce.\n\nGovernment scientists are accustomed to budget swings and downsizing efforts, but scholars say the degree of hostility and the sheer scale of the potential workforce cuts make this time different.\n\nResearchers interviewed by Nature say that it takes time to train a new generation of recruits, in part because of the unique institutional realities that come with being a government scientist: researchers need to understand government procedures as well as the administrative and statutory context for their work. “The destruction is so pervasive and severe that it’s just not going to be possible to go back to the way things were,” says Blake Emerson, an administrative-law researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n“The thing people need to understand about the long term is that when you fire people and when you dismantle projects, you can’t recreate that the moment you have a new administration,” Holdren says. “You’ve lost the momentum. You’ve lost the knowledge, and rebuilding it can take years to decades.”\n\nAttacks on universities\n\nUniversities across the country are reeling as they grapple with a barrage of aggressive moves by the government, including federal investigations, threats of massive funding cuts, cancellation of research grants, orders to eliminate diversity initiatives and arrests of some foreign-born students and scholars. Although the government has not released full information about grant terminations, researchers have tallied more than 1,000 so far at just the NIH, the NSF and NASA.\n\nAt risk from all of these changes, say researchers, is not just a generation of scientists but the future of the decades-long partnership between government and higher education, which was designed to promote science and foster innovation for the public good. In 2023, US universities spent about $109 billion on research and development, with almost $60 billion coming from the federal government.\n\nA brain drain would impoverish the United States and diminish world science\n\n“There is a very real question about whether the current system of US research universities will remain intact at the end of this year,” says David Goldston, who retired in April as head of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s government-relations team in Washington DC, and previously worked on science issues as a staff member for the US Congress. He says US science is built on the long-standing belief that the country is a stable and welcoming place to do research. “Once you break that spell, it’s gone,” Goldston says — and it won’t magically reappear after another election.\n\nOne of the biggest tests will come in the next few months, as Congress takes up the Trump administration’s proposal for the 2026 budget, which is all but certain to call for unprecedented cuts in investments in federal science and innovation. During the first Trump administration, Republicans joined Democrats in defending against large-scale cuts to science, but the current Republican majority has so far fallen in line with Trump’s policies and priorities.\n\n“The notion that the private sector will magically step in to replace government funding for science has been shown to be completely and empirically wrong,” says Robert Atkinson, an economist and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a science-policy think tank in Washington DC. Atkinson says the Trump administration’s end game seems to be a federal science establishment that is 30–40% smaller than that of today, “and it just doesn’t matter to them what the effects of that might be on science, innovation, competitiveness and economic growth.”\n\nIt is not yet clear what the size of the 2026 federal science budget will be, but research universities could also suffer greatly on other fronts, says Tobin Smith, vice-president for science policy and global affairs at the Association of American Universities (AAU), which represents dozens of the nation’s leading higher-education institutions and is headquartered in Washington DC. Smith points to a number of proposed changes to funding that would substantially reduce the ability of universities to do research, such as reductions in the indirect costs that the government covers so that universities can implement federal grants awarded to academic researchers.\n\nAt the same time, Smith says, the Trump administration has taken the view that federal funding for universities is a privilege that should be extended only if institutions adhere to certain political demands. It has cancelled or suspended billions of dollars in grants and contracts to universities including Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, the University of Pennsylvania and others over political issues such as student protests and transgender athletes. At least one institution has now pushed back: Harvard University leaders announced on 14 April that they would not comply with demands from the Trump administration, which hours later said that it would freeze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard. The university is currently suing the Trump administration.\n\nThe US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long?\n\nAll of this represents an unprecedented threat to universities and their bottom lines, say many research leaders. “The withdrawal of research funding for reasons unrelated to research sets a dangerous and counterproductive precedent,” the AAU board said in a statement in late March.",

          "title": "Trump blew up the global fight against AIDS. Can it recover?",
          "authors": "Simar S. Bajaj",
          "abstract": "In 2024, the United States helped to provide HIV treatment to more than 20 million people around the world. It tested 84 million people for the virus and provided preventive care for several million more. All of that changed in late January, when 270,000 health-care workers, who were supported by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), were told to stop all patient care. Although the administration had characterized it as a pause and says that it has resumed some of PEPFAR’s funding, the future of the programme is in serious doubt. If global health funding is not restored, researchers estimate that by 2030, there could be as many as 11 million extra HIV infections and 3 million extra deaths due to AIDS1 (see ‘Imminent disaster’). Some estimate as many as 15 million deaths by 2040.\n\nPEPFAR has been one of the most successful global health projects in history, financing about 70% of the overall HIV/AIDS response and saving 26 million lives. In the first three months of his second term, US President Donald Trump has thrown the programme into chaos and dismantled the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which ran the majority of PEPFAR’s programming. In late March, Congress failed to reauthorize PEPFAR, plunging it into purgatory.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\n“It’s an abandonment of care,” says Eric Goosby, former US global AIDS coordinator and an infectious-disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nBeyond reversing decades of global health progress, these actions have also upended a historic push to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, a goal defined by the United Nations as a reduction in new infections and AIDS-related deaths to 10% of their 2010 levels.\n\nThe end of AIDS is in sight: don’t abandon PEPFAR now\n\nReaching the ‘AIDS endgame’ was always ambitious, but the world had amassed an arsenal of treatment, prevention and management strategies to fight the disease. And although progress faced considerable headwinds before Trump took office this year, many thought that such a goal was achievable.\n\nNow, as the United States demolishes its foreign-aid infrastructure and global health groups attempt to salvage the pieces, some advocates are hoping that countries will take ownership of their AIDS response and create programmes that are more accountable and more innovative than before.\n\nLow- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will have their work cut out, says Pallabi Deb, senior programme manager for the HIV Vaccine Trials Network at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. “This is a wake-up call.”\n\nWhy the endgame seemed possible\n\nIt was in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2014 that the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) raised the prospect of ending the epidemic. Deaths had fallen substantially from their peak a decade earlier (the decline even beat targets set by the UN’s Millennium Development Goals in 2000). So, to drive progress towards the finish line, UNAIDS outlined a bold plan. “This is an epidemic that no one thought we could end, but now with the progress we see, we know it can be done,” said Ghana’s President John Mahama in 2014.\n\nTrump team guts AIDS-eradication programme and slashes HIV research grants\n\nBeyond the strong political and financial commitment at the time, what made the endgame attainable was an unprecedented understanding of AIDS. “We understand how this virus moves through an individual, attacks their immune system, what parts are attacked more preferentially, how they decline in function,” Goosby says.\n\nResearch enabled the development of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — medication that prevents HIV infection — and antiretroviral therapies that suppress viral replication and stop transmission. They transformed HIV from a fatal diagnosis into a manageable, preventable chronic condition, according to Deb.\n\nAs recently as the early 2000s, a positive HIV test was a death sentence in most LMICs, says Ntombi Ginindza, a former nurse in Mbabane, Eswatini, a small country sandwiched between Mozambique and South Africa. The AIDS epidemic cut nearly two decades from life expectancy there, bringing it down to just 39 years in 1998.\n\nToday, however, Eswatini boasts one of the world’s most successful responses. With antiretrovirals freely available, mainly funded by PEPFAR, the country has reached UNAIDS’s coveted 95-95-95 target: 95% of people living with HIV know their status, 95% of those who know their status take antiretrovirals, and 95% of individuals on these drugs have undetectable levels of HIV in their blood. With the right tools and support, even the hardest-hit countries can reverse course and get within striking distance of the AIDS endgame, Ginindza says.\n\nAdvances in prevention have made the landscape even more promising. Lenacapavir, a therapy that the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve in June, showed remarkable results in a clinical trial in South Africa and Uganda last year. More than 2,000 girls and young women received a shot of lenacapavir every six months, and it completely prevented HIV infections — an extraordinary 100% efficacy2. These results were quickly replicated in a larger study involving six countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas3.\n\nIn 2024, PEPFAR provided services to 6.6 million orphans, children and carers.Credit: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters\n\nLenacapavir could revolutionize HIV prevention because it is more effective and practical than oral PrEP, and is thus a better fit for those worried about the visibility — and potential stigma — of taking a daily pill. “I love lenacapavir because it’s twice a year, very discreet,” says Doreen Moracha, an HIV activist in Nairobi, Kenya, who has been living with the virus for 32 years. The drug’s developer, Gilead Sciences, based in Foster City, California, has even started to see promising results with a once-yearly formulation4.\n\nBut because of cost concerns and regulatory delays, getting lenacapavir to where it’s needed most will be challenging, says Nittaya Phanuphak, executive director of the Institute of HIV Research and Innovation in Bangkok. Still, she is hopeful about a promised partnership between Gilead Sciences and generic manufacturers to make low-cost doses of lenacapavir for 120 LMICs.\n\nThis agreement speaks to a broader pattern, in which grass-roots activism and market interventions have put life-saving tools within reach of millions. Since 2000, pharmaceutical companies have adopted differential pricing, lowering the cost of branded antiretrovirals on the basis of a country’s income, region and HIV burden. In parallel, some governments, including Thailand’s, have invoked public-health exemptions to bypass patents and produce affordable generic drugs domestically.\n\nAs of 2023, HIV infections globally were down by 39% from 2010 levels, and AIDS-related deaths dropped by 51% to 630,000. For many working in this field, decades of scientific advances and public-health progress had put the AIDS endgame within reach.\n\nComplacency and chaos\n\nThere were concerns, however, that pre-dated the Trump administration’s withdrawal of funding. As AIDS deaths declined and living with an HIV infection became more manageable, it was increasingly difficult to evoke the same urgency and political will, says Brendan Bell, a microbiologist at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada. In 2023, countries’ domestic funding to tackle HIV declined for the fourth year in a row, whereas international financing has been falling from its peaks in the early 2010s (see ‘Funding behemoth’). “We’ve become victims of our own success,” Bell says. “With the success of antiretrovirals, why go further?”\n\nSource: A. Wexler et al. KFF/UNAIDS (2024); https://go.nature.com/3GSBELW\n\nFading memories have also stalled social-policy reforms, such as the decriminalization of sex work, drug use and same-sex relationships. Much research shows that fear of discrimination and criminal penalties discourages high-risk populations from accessing PrEP and testing, increasing people’s likelihood of getting HIV and being diagnosed late5. As a result, sex workers, people who use drugs and people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBT+) have sometimes been left out of global progress against AIDS. “You can’t have an impact on these populations without working openly with them,” says infectious-disease physician Sharon Lewin, who heads the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nComplacency is especially common among younger generations, who never witnessed the full horror of the AIDS epidemic, Moracha says. More than one-quarter of new HIV infections are in people aged 15–24 years old, in part because of declining condom use and low testing rates. “There is now a whole new generation that doesn’t see HIV as a big deal,” she says.\n\nHIV: how close are we to a vaccine — or a cure?\n\nThe world will soon get a reminder. The virus starts replicating 6–8 hours after a person with HIV stops taking antiretrovirals. Within a week, their viral load becomes measurable. With waves of HIV leaking into the bloodstream, after four to six weeks, white blood cells start to get chewed up, leaving the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections. “The average number of infections you’d get through is three or four, before it kills you,” Goosby says. Give it three to six months, and hospitals will be overrun with HIV patients who will die in hallways, car parks and overflow tents, he predicts.\n\nDeaths can also happen much sooner than that, for example in infants who have underdeveloped immune systems, or in people with advanced disease succumbing to malaria and other infections. Since Trump’s foreign-aid freeze in late January, an estimated 41,000 adults and 4,500 children living with HIV have died. That is one person roughly every three minutes, according to the PEPFAR Impact Counter, a data dashboard funded by the Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases at Boston University in Massachusetts. “The extraordinary infrastructure that’s delivered antivirals to 70% of people living with HIV can be unravelled in days,” Lewin says.\n\nA statement from a White House official says that mechanisms to serve 85% of PEPFAR beneficiaries are “up and running”, and that it is working with USAID to “rebalance” awards that don’t fit with the administration’s priorities. The statement said that the administration has a “glide path to self-reliance for PEPFAR countries” and that it has seen positive movement to that end over the past two months. The 85% figure seems to apply to treatment efforts and not to prevention programmes. And even supposedly resumed programming has hit roadblocks thanks to the hollowing out of USAID. Requests from Nature for further clarification from White House officials were not answered.\n\nCondoms being distributed in Bangkok.Credit: Peerapon Boonyakiat/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty\n\nTerminated research grants from USAID and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) have also derailed promising advancements and innovations, says Glenda Gray, chief scientific officer at the South African Medical Research Council in Cape Town. For example, Gray’s experimental HIV vaccine trial was shut down, and Phanuphak recently had to close about half of the Institute of HIV Research and Innovation, despite its strong history of testing life-saving interventions. As of early April, nearly 30% of terminated NIH grants were related to HIV/AIDS.\n\nPhanuphak also worries that Trump’s executive orders, such as ones declaring that there are only two genders and placing restrictions on funding for organizations that “promote gender ideology”, will further undermine HIV policy reforms. Thailand, for example, continues to criminalize sex work, ban the distribution of clean needles and syringes and disallow legal gender recognition for transgender individuals. She thinks that, because of US actions, Thai policymakers could be more emboldened to block ongoing reform efforts. “It’s not an enabling environment to tackle HIV,” Phanuphak says.",

          "abstract": "Colleagues routinely describe Michael Running Wolf as someone who walks seamlessly between two worlds.\n\nAs an artificial intelligence (AI) researcher at the software-development company SynthBee in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and as co-founder of the First Languages AI Reality (FLAIR) programme at the Mila–Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute in Montreal, Canada, Running Wolf holds a deep understanding of both the technology underlying AI and the societal benefits it could unlock. And as the son of Lakota and Cheyenne parents, he also knows how technology and data have been weaponized to harm Indigenous communities. Running Wolf therefore approaches his work — in which he revitalizes disappearing languages using AI and virtual-reality tools — with patience, empathy and a healthy dose of scepticism.\n\n“The work that Michael does is so sophisticated and complex because it’s bridging the sacred with the science,” says Estakio Beltran, a partnership adviser at the non-profit organization Native Americans in Philanthropy in Washington DC, who collaborates with Running Wolf and is of Tolteca-Mexica and Tlatoani origin. “We’re fortunate to have him overseeing efforts to reclaim Indigenous languages because his foremost thoughts are to protect and honour Indigenous sovereignty.”\n\nHow researchers can work fairly with Indigenous and local knowledge\n\nRunning Wolf grew up just outside the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana, in a remote town called Birney (2020 population: 97). The settlement often lacked running water and electricity, but it was nevertheless a comforting place where he was surrounded by family, literally — everyone in the town was an extended relative through his mother, and Running Wolf didn’t meet a stranger until he left for university age 18. He spent his childhood learning traditional Cheyenne and Lakota artistry and hearing Indigenous languages spoken around him, an experience that is now increasingly rare.\n\n“For decades, the US government oversaw policies of forced assimilation, and as part of that, it was illegal to speak traditional languages or to practise our cultures openly,” he says. “Those policies were often enforced violently, and so we lost generations of fluent speakers that make it really difficult to come back from now.”\n\nRunning Wolf was a strong student from a young age, he says, and quickly developed an interest in technology, spurred by his mother’s career as a laser lithographer designing microchips for the computing firm Hewlett-Packard in Colorado. He learnt the basics of computer programming in primary school — including working out how to reprogram his graphing calculator to play games such as Snake. However, when it came to choosing a degree course at Montana State University in Bozeman in 1999, Running Wolf says he picked the then-nascent field of computer science on instinct. “No one in my family, or even my guidance counsellor, actually knew what it was.”\n\nEven as he gravitated towards software development, Running Wolf retained an interest in Indigenous histories, noting that if he hadn’t become an AI researcher, he probably would have become an artist or a poet like his father, who holds a degree in fine arts. When he returned to Bozeman in 2007 after a three-year stint in industry to complete a master’s degree in computer science, Running Wolf’s future bridging the two fields began to take shape.\n\nFrom exploitation to empowerment: how researchers can protect Indigenous peoples’ rights to own and control their data\n\nFor his master’s thesis, Running Wolf drew inspiration from the work of researchers who had used oral histories to trace the origins of tales such as Little Red Riding Hood and to identify items eligible for repatriation under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. He spent the summer of 2014 in Siberia, Russia, collecting stories from local Indigenous peoples and using a type of AI called natural language processing to look for similarities between their cultures and those closer to his home. “Ecologically, the area is very similar to the Yellowstone biome in Montana, and so I was interested in how those types of force shape language and culture,” he says. “It stopped being pure computer science and brought in aspects of anthropology.”\n\nAround this time, Running Wolf also met his wife Caroline, a member of the Apsáalooke Nation who speaks 11 languages and was then earning her master’s degree in Native American studies. Together, the two became consumed by thoughts of how computational tools and big data could be used to improve understanding of Indigenous cultures and to reclaim lost languages. The United Nations estimates that roughly half of the world’s 6,700 languages — the majority of which are spoken by Indigenous peoples — are on track to disappear by 2100, yet Running Wolf says there are rarely rigorous plans in place to save them.\n\n“We were both frustrated with the lack of good progress in what was being done at the time,” Running Wolf says. He adds that Caroline has since joined him in co-founding an Indigenous non-profit technology firm called Buffalo Tongue and in managing ongoing projects focused on the applications of AI and immersive technologies for reclaiming Indigenous languages and cultures. “What began as these late-night conversations eventually kicked off this whole new chapter of using technology for language reclamation, and we’ve just become enmeshed in that space.”\n\nThe challenges of AI\n\nIndigenous languages differ from those with Latin roots in ways that make them a challenge to reconcile with existing machine-learning frameworks, Running Wolf says. Many Western languages follow a subject–verb–object sentence structure, for example, whereas Indigenous languages tend to be verb-based and polysynthetic, meaning that a single word can include multiple elements that, in English, would be written out as entire sentences. ‘Bird’, for instance, might translate to something like ‘the winged, flying animal that caws’.\n\nBecause generative AI models predict the next word in a sentence on the basis of the preceding words, these differences mean that algorithms often do a poor job of recognizing and translating Indigenous languages. However, models perform better when they include Indigenous languages, Running Wolf says, because training on a greater diversity of data ultimately makes the underlying algorithms more adaptive and flexible, just as people who know two languages typically have an easier time learning a third. “But that does create a risk for communities when our language data are suddenly valuable,” he adds.\n\nStaff members at the New Zealand firm Te Hiku Media sought the input of local communities to co-create an automatic speech-recognition system for the Māori language te reo.Credit: Te Hiku Media\n\nAlready, there has been a rush by companies such as OpenAI, Amazon and Google to gain access to Indigenous data on language and more; the firms use that information to develop services and products that are then offered back to users, often at a cost. Long-standing mistrust over how their information is likely to be misused has caused some Indigenous communities to disavow themselves of ever turning to AI-based technologies, a stance that Running Wolf respects.\n\n“A lot of this kind of research is without consent, unfortunately, and it has soured people on even trying to engage,” he says. “There’s a lot of risk with AI, and so I think that’s a very healthy response.”\n\nCreating tools for societal good\n\nRunning Wolf is working to overcome these hesitations through creating resources by and for Indigenous communities that help to educate them both about their cultures and the technology and, in turn, give them more control over how their data are used.\n\nHis early efforts began as employee network groups, including one for Indigenous researchers at Amazon when Running Wolf was there working on the company’s AI-powered assistant, Alexa. Later, he and Caroline were involved in launching two wider initiatives, Indigenous in AI and IndigiGenius. These partner with peer groups such as the information-technology consultancy firm Natives in Tech in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Working Group and the Abundant Intelligences research project to shape the future of Indigenous-led AI efforts. In 2019, the Running Wolfs participated in two workshops alongside dozens of other researchers to produce a paper outlining how best to ethically design and create AI tools (J. E. Lewis et al. Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Position Paper; CIFAR, 2020).\n\nHow are researchers using AI? Survey reveals pros and cons for science\n\nIn many instances, one challenge these groups face is a lack of fluent speakers of Indigenous languages to both teach the next generation and to help train AI language models. Although children once learnt their ancestral languages at home, they now mostly engage with languages in the classroom. There’s an urgent need, Running Wolf says, for curricula and other resources — not to replace Indigenous speakers, but to train new teachers and standardize how Indigenous languages are taught. “Now, we have a lot of Native Americans trying to learn in classes using methodologies that don’t have good pedagogy or even good metrics for success,” he says.",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "The main campus for the US National Institutes of Health is located in Bethesda, Maryland.Credit: Philip Scalia/Alamy\n\nUpdate: This story was first published before the release of the NIH policy; it has been updated with details from the policy.\n\nA new policy from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) will end billions of dollars of funding to laboratories and hospitals outside the United States, imperiling thousands of global-health projects and clinical trials on topics such as emerging infectious diseases and cancer.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nOn 1 May, the NIH, the world’s largest funder of biomedical research, announced that by October, it will not renew or issue 'foreign subawards’, which are funds that a US researcher can give to an international collaborator to help complete a project. The agency typically spends about US$500 million on these awards each year.\n\nThe announcement states that the agency is establishing a new award structure for foreign researchers, which has not yet been released. Under the new system, foreign researchers will probably have to submit a grant application and undergo a similar review process as US applicants. The document cites national security and a lack of transparency as the rationale for the change.\n\n“These decisions will have tragic consequences,” says Francis Collins, a geneticist who led the NIH, based in Bethesda, Maryland, for 12 years under three US presidents. As part of its effort to reduce federal spending, the administration of US President Donald Trump has already effectively shuttered the US Agency for International Development, which funded research, prevention and care for diseases worldwide. Combined with that action, Collins says, halting foreign subawards means that “more children and adults in low-income countries will now lose their lives because of research that didn’t get done about diseases like malaria and tuberculosis”.\n\nTrump blew up the global fight against AIDS. Can it recover?\n\nNIH staff members have been instructed to withhold funds for foreign institutions that are part of new research grants and grants coming up for renewal, according to several employees who spoke to Nature under the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nSpokespeople for the agency and its parent organization, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), confirmed the policy change to Nature on 30 April but could not be reached for comment on 1 May.\n\nBroad implications\n\nThe policy targets all subawards to institutions outside the United States, regardless of whether they are located in US-designated ‘countries of concern’ such as China or North Korea, or in an ally such as the United Kingdom. It states that research projects will be terminated if they are no longer viable without the foreign subaward.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is slashing NIH-backed research — in charts\n\nUnless foreign researchers secure funding directly from the agency by October — a tall order — funding for ongoing clinical trials with sites abroad and other international research is likely to lapse, says a former senior NIH employee, who requested anonymity out of fear of retribution. If the administration’s goal is to end funding for research abroad, “but they don’t have the law to do that, this is a way they can do it”, they say, “by making the bureaucracy much more difficult”.\n\nThe policy’s implications will be wide-reaching: last year, the agency issued about 3,700 subawards to institutions abroad, compared with fewer than 900 direct awards to foreign institutions, according to the US government website USASpending.gov.\n\nMuch US-backed international research is on global-health topics such as cancer, maternal and child health and infectious diseases such as AIDS, Ebola and tuberculosis. “Disease outbreaks that start anywhere in the world can reach our shores in hours,” Collins says. “To just pull the plug is short-sighted and self-defeating.” If the United States pulled back all of its global health funding — which was US$12 billion in 2024 — roughly 25 million people could die in the next 15 years, according to models.\n\nAmy Bei, a malaria specialist at the Yale School of Public Health in New Haven, Connecticut, who collaborates with researchers in Senegal, says, “we can’t do cutting-edge malaria research from the United States”, where the disease is not prevalent. “If you want to move the needle on the most pressing global-health problems, this requires pulling from the best minds in the field” across the world, she says.\n\nCancer research could be heavily affected too, says Yu Chen, a chronic-disease epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health in New York City, who helps to lead a massive consortium of cancer researchers in 20 countries. For rare cancers, it’s crucial to pool data from cohorts all over the world, Chen says. “Together, we can have larger sample sizes and do meaningful research.”",

The project was initiated by Picuris Pueblo leaders, who determined how the research was conducted and presented; researchers wishing to use the data generated in the study must get the tribe’s permission.\n\n“I think that’s a big step in the right direction,” says Katrina Claw, a genomicist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, who is Diné, or Navajo, and was not involved with the study.\n\nCraig Quanchello, the Picuris Pueblo lieutenant governor and one of the lead authors of the paper, hopes the study’s conclusions will convince people — including the US government — that his tribe deserves a say in Chaco Canyon’s future. “We’ve always said we have this deep connection to Chaco Canyon,” he said at a press briefing.\n\nA 2023 US government restriction on new oil and gas drilling in the area surrounding Chaco Canyon is facing a legal challenge from the Navajo Nation. A review by the administration of US President Donald Trump is also threatening to repeal the restriction. This month, a federal judge gave two other New Mexico tribes permission to oppose the Navajo lawsuit.\n\n“We steered this ship,” Quanchello said at the briefing, in the hope that by “using technology in the Western way, they would now listen”. He added: “We’ve been telling our stories since time immemorial, but this is something on their terms that they can understand.”\n\nThe ancient Native American ruins in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, date back more than 1,000 years.Credit: Wil Meinderts/Buiten-beeld/Minden Pictures via Alamy\nAncient remains\n\nThe Picuris Pueblo tribe, who number around 300 people, has been working with professional archaeologists since the 1960s. The research focuses on human occupation of the region near Taos since around ad 900. Human remains uncovered during excavations were returned to the tribe in the 1990s, after the passage of a US repatriation law.\n\nIn 2018, archaeologists at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas — which has a campus in Taos — identified a set of Picuris Pueblo remains that had been omitted from the repatriation efforts, and informed the tribe.\n\nHoping to use the remains as evidence of the connection between Picuris and Chaco Canyon, the tribe’s leadership pursued a collaboration with Eske Willerslev, a palaeogenomicist at the University of Copenhagen. His team had previously worked with Native American groups to study ancient human remains, but this was the first time a tribe had sought out his help.\n\n“It wasn’t an easy decision,” Picuris governor Wayne Yazza said at the press briefing. Establishing a genetic connection to Chaco Canyon “was something that we thought would benefit our community”.\n\nAfter brokering an agreement that gave the Picuris considerable say in the study and control over resulting data, Willerslev and his colleagues sequenced the genomes from the remains of 16 ancient Picuris Pueblo, dating to between 500 and 700 years ago, as well as the genomes of 13 modern tribe members.\n\nThe study was the result of an unprecedented collaboration between members of Picuris Pueblo and one of the world’s leading ancient genomics labs.Credit: Thomaz Pinotti\n\nComparisons showed a clear genetic connection between ancient and modern Picuris Pueblo people — as well as to ancient inhabitants of Chaco Canyon, whose remains had been sequenced for a controversial 2017 study2. The remains had been stored in a New York City museum and classified as unaffiliated with any tribes. Neither the museum nor the research team behind the 2017 study meaningfully consulted with Native American groups before publication, upsetting many tribes that claim links with Chaco Canyon3.",

          "authors": "Sara Reardon",
          "abstract": "A decade ago, Helena Jambor found herself struggling to understand the figures in the scientific papers she was reading during her postdoc. Jambor was studying how fluorescently labelled messenger RNA arranges itself inside embryos of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and wanted to choose the images that would most clearly convey her findings. But she couldn’t find many helpful guidelines — or even good examples in the literature. “When you start out, you think you’re the one who’s stupid,” she says. “But after ten years in science, you realize, okay, now I’m an expert and I still don’t understand some of these figures.”\n\nJambor, now a biologist and visualization specialist at the Dresden University of Technology in Germany, realized that image presentation wasn’t just a problem in her own field. In 2021, when she and her colleagues analysed the figures of 580 biology papers in 15 top journals, they found that most contained poorly presented images (H. Jambor et al. PLoS Biol. 19, e3001161; 2021). Many panels lacked labels or scale bars, and annotation features, such as descriptive text and arrows, were often missing from the imaged objects. “I just think it’s sad if someone spends four years researching an amazing issue and publishes a paper and then has a figure that is not fully understandable,” she says. “It will inevitably reduce the readership.”\n\nWill AI jeopardize science photography? There’s still time to create an ethical code of conduct\n\nWhereas scientists receive extensive training on how to collect data, less work goes into teaching them how to showcase the information in publications, presentations and grant applications. For many types of figure panel, including photomicrographs and images of gel-based protein assays known as western blots, some photo editing is required to present them clearly. But there’s a fine line between clarifying and manipulating — as highlighted by increasing attention given to scientific misconduct in published papers.\n\nSome journals and scientific societies are now developing guidelines to help researchers to present their hard-won data well while maintaining image integrity. The increased attention is a good thing, says Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist and full-time image sleuth in San Francisco, California. “If you put the effort into those fronts, you can find [both errors and deliberate manipulations] before they get published.”\n\nSlippery slope\n\nMany aspects of editing are common sense, says Jana Christopher, an image-integrity analyst at the Federation of European Biochemical Societies, who is based in Heidelberg, Germany. For instance, it’s OK to increase the image’s contrast so that a cell or feature pops out against the background, but the background still has to be visible. Altering brightness or saturation is also acceptable as long as the modification is applied equally across the whole image. Cropping is fine if the process doesn’t remove elements that would change the interpretation of the image — after all, Christopher notes, selecting a particular field of view under the microscope is in itself a form of cropping and selective reporting. “The bottom line is that the images need to represent accurately what was observed experimentally,” she says.\n\nImage annotation is essential. Jambor is shocked by how many photographs lack scale bars, for instance. “People seem to just think that it’s nice for decoration or something, but it’s actually essential,” she says, because biological scales vary widely. “If we blow the smallest cell up to the size of a ping-pong ball, the largest cell, in comparison, is the height of Mount Everest.”\n\nHow journals are fighting back against a wave of questionable images\n\nAccessibility is also often overlooked. Jambor’s study found that some 20–50% of biological papers contain at least one figure that isn’t understandable for people who have red–green colour blindness, for instance. Showing coloured fluorescent images side by side instead of overlaid on one another — and annotating everything — helps to alleviate this problem. So does selecting a different colour palette or showing the images in greyscale. Popular image-processing software, such as ImageJ, includes tools that check whether images are suitable for people who are colour-blind.\n\nBut as helpful as such programs can be, the temptation to beautify images can be a slippery slope. Some researchers, for instance, will use editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, to ‘clone’ parts of an image and paste them onto other sections to cover a crack or piece of dust in the sample. This calls the entire paper’s integrity into question, Bik says: “We’ll ask questions.”\n\nAs experimental technology changes, so do standards around the images they capture. “With any new technique, you have to come to an agreement on what is possible or ethical,” Bik says. For instance, 20 years ago it was considered acceptable to put pieces of different western blots next to one another and photograph them as one image. Nowadays, Bik says, this is frowned on and authors are expected to make it clear when this has been done. The cardinal rule is to show your work.\n\nColour me better: fixing figures for colour blindness\n\nSome standards, however, remain constant, Bik notes. A 2004 paper in the Journal of Cell Biology — published just as tools such as Photoshop were becoming widely available to scientists — outlined guidelines that she says are still the gold standard for image analysis today (M. Rossner and K. M. Yamada J. Cell Biol. 166, 11–15; 2004). For instance, the study’s authors wrote that researchers shouldn’t selectively enhance specific features, for example by adding a black dot in Photoshop to make a particle more visible, or increase the number of pixels beyond those contained in the original image, effectively creating new data.\n\n“Data must be reported directly, not through a filter based on what you think they ‘should’ illustrate to your audience,” the authors wrote, warning against the “tempting dangers of digital manipulation”. They added, “Just because the tools exist to clean up sloppy work digitally, that is no excuse to do sloppy work.”",

          "abstract": "Scientists want to use AI agents to study rock samples retrieved from Mars.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) researchers have created a system that can perform autonomous research in astrobiology, the study of the origins of life in the Universe.\n\nAstroAgents comprises eight ‘AI agents’ that analyse data and generate scientific hypotheses. It joins a suite of other AI tools that aim to automate the process of science, from reading the literature to coming up with hypotheses and even writing papers.\n\nResearchers built an ‘AI Scientist’ — what can it do?\n\nThe tool’s creators say they will use it to study samples that NASA plans to retrieve from Mars. The agents will help to determine whether the samples harbour organic molecules that indicate the presence of past or present life. The researchers presented AstroAgents on 27 April at the International Conference on Learning Representations in Singapore.\n\n“It’s helping us build a better understanding of how molecules form in space, how molecules form from life on Earth and how they’re preserved — and then which specific signs should we be searching for,” says astrobiologist Denise Buckner at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who co-authored a preprint describing AstroAgents1.\n\nAI agents\n\nThe tool is an example of ‘agentic AI’ systems. These are typically based on large language models (LLMs) and are designed to be more-active participants than conventional AI tools, deciding what needs to be done and how to do it, evaluating outcomes and adapting in response. Their emergence has prompted lively debate about whether agentic AI can come up with truly original scientific ideas, and how novelty should even be defined.\n\nOne of the most prominent examples is Google’s AI ‘co-scientist’, which was released in February and has searched for potential treatments for liver disease and suggested how antimicrobial resistance arises. Applying agentic AI to astrobiology is new, says astrobiologist Michael Wong at Carnegie Science’s Earth and Planets Laboratory in Washington DC.\n\nMars rover makes epic climb to explore some of the oldest rocks in the Solar System\n\nTo specify the behaviours of the agents, the researchers feed different prompts to an LLM. For example, a ‘data analyst’ is told to identify important patterns in data, a ‘planner’ to decide what to delegate to other ‘scientist’ agents for further research and hypothesis generation, and a ‘critic’ to evaluate the hypotheses and suggest improvements to the data analyst, which then kicks off another round of the process.\n\nThe way AstroAgents splits the hypothesis generation up between multiple specialist agents is innovative, says co-author Amirali Aghazadeh, a computer scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.\n\n“We realized that because of the complexity of the data, it’s better for the agent to assign multiple tasks to multiple ‘scientists’,” he says. It’s up to the planner to decide what each scientist agent will study, and it does this on its own. “It’s kind of the magic of the system,” he says.\n\nHeaps of hypotheses\n\nThe research team experimented with using two LLMs to power AstroAgents — Claude Sonnet 3.5 and Gemini 2.0 Flash. They fed each system mass-spectrometry data for eight meteorites and ten soil samples taken from locations around Earth, including Antarctica and the Atacama Desert in Chile, and carried out ten rounds of refinement.\n\nAstrobiology: Hunting aliens",

That raises the total number of terminated grants to approximately 1,425.\n\nStaff members at the US National Science Foundation (NSF) were told on 30 April to “stop awarding all funding actions until further notice,” according to an email seen by Nature.\n\nThe policy prevents the NSF, one of the world’s biggest supporters of basic research, from awarding new research grants and from supplying additional increments of money or subawards to existing grants. But researchers should be able to draw down money from grant funds that they have already received, NSF staff members say. The email does not provide a reason for the freeze and says that it will last “until further notice”.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nEarlier this week, NSF leadership also introduced a new policy directing staff members to screen grant proposals for “topics or activities that may not be in alignment with agency priorities”. Proposals judged not “in alignment” must be returned to the applicants by NSF employees. The policy has not been made public but was described in documents seen by Nature.\n\nAn NSF staff member says that although good science can still be funded, the policy has the potential to be “Orwellian overreach”. Another staff member says, “They are butchering the gold standard merit review process that was established at NSF over decades”. One program officer says they are resigning because of the policy. Nature spoke with five NSF staffers for this story, all on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nAn NSF spokesperson declined Nature’s request for comment.\n\nContinuing turmoil\n\nThe changes are hitting an agency already in crisis. In the past two weeks, the NSF has terminated roughly 1,040 grants that would have awarded US$739 million to researchers and their institutions. The agency’s director, Sethuraman Panchanathan, resigned last month.\n\nNSF slashes prestigious PhD fellowship awards by half\n\nUncertainty is also being felt by scientists outside the agency. Colin Carlson, an expert in disease emergence at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, leads an initiative to predict viruses that pose pandemic threats. The project, which involves roughly 50 researchers across multiple universities, is funded by a $US12.5 million NSF grant. The project’s latest round of funding was approved, but Carlson worries about subsequent rounds, and the fate of other researchers. Unless it is lifted, the freeze “is going to destroy people's labs,” Carlson says.\n\nFunding for the NSF, as for all other federal agencies, is set by the US Congress. To date, the agency has received only about one-quarter of the funding that Congress appropriated to it for the current fiscal year, which ends on 30 September.",

          "authors": "Elodie Pourret, Olivier Pourret",
          "abstract": "Science textbooks must strike a balance between scientific detail and pedagogical complexity.Credit: SDI Productions/Getty\n\nAs married Earth scientists and parents to three inquisitive children, ten-year-old twin boys and a seven-year-old girl, we care deeply about the accuracy of scientific education and its ability to inspire young minds.\n\nBut when we help our children with science homework, we often find ourselves correcting misconceptions and identifying errors in their textbooks. We give our children simple explanations to correct these misconceptions and have tried to contact a handful of publishers, asking them to edit their textbooks. So far we’ve yet to receive a reply.\n\nAs parents, we appreciate simplicity and engagement in teaching, particularly for younger learners, and many of the ‘issues’ we’ve spotted in books are not outright mistakes, but deliberate simplifications to make foundational concepts more accessible. That said, we feel that it’s important to indicate that these explanations are simplifications to help children and teenagers to understand that there are layers of complexity to explore as they progress.\n\nSome mistakes, however, are simply mistakes. And these have, at times, infuriated us as scientists and as parents invested in the education of our children. Here are some examples of both.\n\nAcceptable simplifications\n\nAtomic models. Textbooks often use the Bohr model to depict atoms, portraying electrons as neatly orbiting a nucleus in fixed paths. Although this model is visually intuitive and an excellent stepping stone for understanding atomic structure, it does not capture the probabilistic nature of electron behaviour described by quantum mechanics. Teaching simplified models first makes sense pedagogically, but in our view, textbooks should clarify that these models are approximations. This would help students to understand the evolution of scientific thought and prepare them for more advanced models.\n\nGeneralized scientific laws. Similarly, textbooks often present scientific laws as universally applicable, without acknowledging their limitations. For instance, the ideal gas law assumes that gas particles have no volume and experience no intermolecular forces, which does not hold true under extreme conditions. Newton’s laws of motion are foundational principles and work well at standard scales and speeds but break down at relativistic speeds or in quantum contexts. These exceptions don’t invalidate Newton’s laws but show that they are part of broader theories. For young learners, it’s important to present these laws as powerful tools for understanding the world while noting that exceptions exist in specialized contexts.\n\nGeological models. Many textbooks depict Earth’s internal structure as a rigidly stratified series of layers: crust, mantle, outer core and inner core. Although this simplification helps with initial comprehension, it overlooks the nuanced transitions and dynamic processes that occur in and between these layers. Perhaps textbooks for older children could introduce more detailed explanations. Indeed, the mantle is not uniform but exhibits gradual changes in composition and behaviour: for example, the upper mantle contains partially molten regions, such as the asthenosphere. In professional work, geoscientists emphasize the importance of gradual transitions and dynamic interactions, such as convection currents in the mantle that drive plate tectonics. These processes illustrate that Earth’s structure is much more complex than the simplified model often taught at schools.\n\nMistakes that are unacceptable\n\nTerminological confusion. Physics textbooks sometimes use the terms ‘mass’ and ‘weight’ interchangeably, leading to confusion. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, typically expressed in kilograms, and remains constant regardless of location. By contrast, weight is the force exerted on an object owing to gravity, measured in newton (the unit of force in the International System of Units), and varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field.\n\nMisusing these terms undermines a fundamental understanding of physics. For example, an astronaut’s mass on Earth and the Moon is identical, but their weight differs because the gravitational pull on the Moon is about one-sixth that of Earth. Without distinguishing these terms, students might erroneously think that mass changes depending on location, which could confuse their understanding of concepts such as inertia, density and gravitational force.\n\nConfusion between sea and ocean. One recurring misconception we’ve observed is the interchangeable use of ‘sea’ and ‘ocean’ in textbooks. Although size is one differentiating factor, the more crucial distinction lies in their underlying geology: oceans are underlain by oceanic crust, whereas seas are often atop continental crust. This confusion underscores a broader issue in science education: the oversimplification of terms to the point at which their precise meanings are lost. Whether discussing seas and oceans, mass and weight or climate and weather, it’s essential for textbooks to clarify distinctions that might seem subtle but are scientifically important. Clear definitions, supported by visual aids such as cross-sectional diagrams or historical examples, can help students to grasp these nuances and develop a more-accurate understanding of complex concepts.",

The pattern is related to extrinsic, rather than intrinsic, geometry.Credit: bibi57/Getty\n\nThe growth of rose petals exploits a geometric trick previously unobserved in nature, physicists have found. Using theoretical analysis, computer simulations and experiments with rubbery plastic sheets, they established that as the petals curl outwards, mechanical feedback regulates their growth, leading to the formation of rolled edges and pointed corners at their tips.\n\nThe findings, described in Science on 1 May1, could one day have applications in engineering and architecture. “You might learn new principles and then implement them in manmade structures,” says Eran Sharon, an experimental physicist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nNature’s patterns\n\nGeometric patterns are known to affect developing organisms. But in all previously observed cases, the principles had to do with the ‘intrinsic’ geometry of surfaces. Intrinsic features are those related to the distances between points on the surface, as would be measured by an ant walking on it. But a surface of a given intrinsic geometry can have multiple ways of existing in 3D — or ‘extrinsic’ geometries. For example, a sheet of paper can be laid flat or curled up into a cylinder; and an ant walking on it would not notice any changes in the distances it covers, even though points on the sheet could be closer to or farther from each other in 3D space.\n\nThe secret forces that squeeze and pull life into shape\n\nDeforming an intrinsically curved surface to lie flat requires stretching it, which creates stresses within the surface. In living, growing tissues, these sorts of stresses can compete with other factors. For example, a growth pattern that would tend to make a tissue curve — meaning that the curved intrinsic geometry would minimize its energy — might be ‘frustrated’ if a leaf is too thick to curve or has different layers that want to curve in opposite ways. Many examples of these tensions, called ‘incompatibilities’, can be seen in nature, where they result in stiffer tissues or create complex architectures.",

Credit: Hariandi Hafid/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock\n\nResearchers have developed a process for refining nickel that they say could dramatically cut its carbon footprint, which is currently equivalent to the total emissions of a small country.\n\nImplementing the process on an industrial scale would present some engineering challenges, but the experiment, described in Nature on 30 April1, is a proof of principle. “What we did here is to prove that the science works,” says co-author Ubaid Manzoor, a metallurgical engineer at the Max Planck Institute for Sustainable Materials in Düsseldorf, Germany.\n\nNickel is a key ingredient in stainless steel, and its use in lithium-ion batteries is predicted to double global nickel demand by 2040. But it has one of the dirtiest production processes of any metal. “Primary production of nickel is highly carbon-intensive,” says Manzoor. On average, refining one tonne of nickel ore produces around 20 tonnes of carbon dioxide (see ‘Emissions from extraction’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThat carbon intensity could further increase as more nickel is extracted from laterites, a type of ore that is currently underutilized. That process can release more than 40 tonnes of carbon dioxide per tonne of nickel, in part because it relies on carbon-rich coke — a material usually derived from coal — to remove oxygen from the rock through chemical reduction.\n\nToxic red mud could be turned into green steel",

          "title": "Why the green-technology race might not save the planet",
          "authors": "Edward Barbier",
          "abstract": "The world has entered an era of increasing ecological scarcity and rising environmental risks. Since 1970, 75% of terrestrial and 66% of marine environments have been altered by human use, climate change, pollution, species loss and invasion1. Some 14 out of 18 global ‘ecosystem services’ have declined, including the stability of the climate, the numbers of pollinators and quantity and the quality of fresh water1. The average size of wildlife populations has plummeted2 by 73%.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nHow economies respond to these issues will be crucial to their prosperity and sustainability3. If nature is valued, and a high price is placed on its exploitation and use, scarcity can create incentives to innovate and substitute. For example, as the cost of converting forests, wetlands and grasslands to farmland rises and fresh water becomes scarce, it becomes increasingly attractive to use agricultural methods that consume less land and water. But if economies choose to continue exploiting or polluting nature, for instance by converting forests to agricultural land, extracting minerals from the sea bed, dumping plastics in the ocean and expanding fossil-fuel reserves, then the costs for humanity and the environment will soar.\n\nSo far, countries are choosing distinct approaches. And two trends are emerging: some nations are ignoring the damage to nature to keep the costs of resources and pollution artificially low, whereas others are embarking on a competitive race to dominate green innovation and markets.\n\nHere, I describe those trends and make the case that, in the long run, the green-technology race is likely to prevail. But the result of this competition might be more prosperity at the expense of less sustainability, unless it is accompanied by global cooperation to solve shared environmental risks.\n\nBarriers to the green transition\n\nNature’s most valuable services — a stable climate, support for food and agricultural systems and protection of people’s lives, health and property — are provided for free. They do not appear in markets and are mostly ignored in policy and business decisions.\n\nWorse, governments provide economic incentives for activities that can harm the environment4,5. Examples include subsidies to lower the cost of coal for electricity, water, pesticides and fertilizers for crops, cutting down forests for timber and trawling sea beds. Such environmentally harmful incentives for fossil fuels, agriculture, water, forestry, construction, transport and fisheries amount to roughly US$1.8 trillion each year globally6. This is about 2% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nA company in Canada uses renewable hydroelectric energy sources for its greenhouse crops.Credit: Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press/Alamy\n\nBecause nature is being underpriced, most economies disregard the increasing costs of ecological scarcity. They don’t view natural systems as assets worth conserving, restoring and protecting through investment4. For example, global spending on biodiversity and habitat conservation, protection and restoration ranges from $124 billion to $143 billion a year7. Yet this is only up to one-fifth of what’s needed — translating into a biodiversity-financing gap of more than half a trillion dollars.\n\nBusinesses, too, are investing insufficiently in nature. More than half of the world’s GDP, or around $44 trillion of global value added by 163 industry sectors and their supply chains, depends on nature and its services8. Yet, companies worldwide are investing only a fraction of that ($5.5 billion to $8.2 billion annually) in making their supply chains environmentally sustainable7.\n\nThe green race\n\nDespite this shortfall, some economies and businesses have recognized that they can gain from becoming greener by exploiting their competitive and technological advantages. The result is an emerging green race over key global markets, innovations and investments, including clean energy, renewable industrial products and processes and markets for carbon, biodiversity and water credits.\n\nHow scientists can drive climate action: celebrate nature and promote hope\n\nSeveral countries, including China, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, have the potential to become market leaders by competing over the greening of key manufacturing sectors, such as vehicle innovation, electricity generation and other industrial processes and durable consumer goods9. Nations with high green-production capabilities are likely to have more patents for environmental technologies, lower carbon dioxide emissions and more stringent environmental policies than those without such capacities10.\n\nGlobally, the proportion of companies with green products and services has been growing11. But this expansion is spread unevenly. Although the United States accounts for 60% of global green stocks, their share in terms of the total US market is only 8%, implying that the US economy is less green than the global average of 9%11. Taiwan, Germany, Canada, Japan, China and France exceed this average, suggesting that their economies are well positioned for success in the green race11.\n\nThe competition is driven by the slowing growth in productivity of the global economy since the 1980s12,13, as well as by increasing opportunities for returns and productivity gains in emerging green sectors. Improving nations’ capacity to avoid natural disasters, which can cause a drop in labour productivity — 70% of which are climate-related12 — might also motivate governments to invest in reducing environmental risks.\n\nA facility for recycling carbon fibre in Taiwan, an emerging leader in the global green economy.Credit: Lam Yik Fei/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nPublic policy is responding, as interested governments vie to win the competitive and fast-changing green race. For example, in the 1990s, Japan, the United States and Germany dominated global green innovation (see ‘Green inventions’). But now, China and South Korea have joined Japan and the United States as leaders, after investing heavily in solar and wind energy, batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nSource: OECD Green Growth Dataset (2024); go.nature.com/42uyajf\n\nSimilarly, countries that are currently competitive in green products and production processes, including Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, might be overtaken by India and France (see ‘Green competition’). Other nations, such as Spain, Turkey and Poland, are also increasing their investment in these areas (see go.nature.com/4jlrsad).\n\nSource: P. Andres and P. Mealy, Green Transition Navigator (London School of Economics & Political Science, 2023); see go.nature.com/4jlrsad\nCounterproductive measures\n\nAll of this green competition might speed up the development of sustainable technologies and reduce the pressure on the planet. But it could also result in the rise of ‘green mercantilism’, if countries adopt protective strategies to enhance their competitive advantage in the global green market.\n\nThere are signs that the latter is happening. After the United States implemented the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, many large economies, including the European Union, China and India, followed its example and shifted their green industrial policies to openly adopt protectionist provisions, such as tax breaks, procurement requirements and loans and subsidies that favour domestic sectors and industries at the expense of international competitors14.",

          "abstract": "US President Donald Trump has proposed stiff cuts to the budgets of US science agencies for 2026.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 calls for unprecedented cuts to scientific agencies that, if enacted, would deal a devastating blow to US science, policy specialists say.\n\nThe budget document released by the White House on Friday for the upcoming fiscal year, which starts on 1 October, is light on details, but it calls for disproportionately large cuts for federal science funding. According to the White House document, the proposal would cut all non-defence spending by 23% but targets the US National Science Foundation for a 56% funding reduction, and would slash the budget of the US National Institutes of Health by roughly 40%. The Environmental Protection Agency, which on Friday also announced plans to dismantle its primary research division, would be hit by a 55% cut as the administration seeks to eliminate what it calls “radical” and “woke” climate programmes.\n\nExclusive: NSF stops awarding new grants and funding existing ones\n\nLater this month, the administration is expected to release a more-detailed budget than the “skinny budget” released today, and science-policy experts say that Trump might still seek cuts to the budget for fiscal year 2025.\n\nUltimately, it is the US Congress that decides how the federal budget will be spent — not the president. But Trump’s proposal is a starting point for congressional negotiations, and there are signs that many members of Congress will go along with Trump’s recommendations. Both Trump and the majority of members of Congress are Republicans.\n\nIn a statement, US representative Tom Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that the budget “lays the foundation for restoring a government that serves the people – not itself.”\n\nScience-policy experts say the budget could be disastrous for the next generation of scientists. “The message that this sends to young scientists is that this country is not a place for you,” says Michael Lubell, a physicist who tracks science policy at the City University of New York in New York City. “If I were starting my career, I would be out of here in a heartbeat.”\n\nIf Congress enacts this budget, “the consequences for the future of our nation will be catastrophic,” Sudip Parikh, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC, a non-profit group that represents scientists, said in a statement.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to questions from Nature about the budget request or scientists’ concerns about it.\n\nNature’s news team breaks down the budget proposal and implications for science.\n\nNational Science Foundation\n\nUnder Trump’s proposal, the 2026 budget of the National Science Foundation (NSF), one of the world’s leading funders of basic research, would drop roughly US$5 billion, a cut of about half compared to its 2024 budget. The budget targets climate science, clean energy, and “woke” social, behavioural, and economic sciences. It would also cut “broadening participation” programmes, which aim to attract members of underrepresented groups to science, by $1.1 billion, a roughly 80% reduction from the last few years.\n\nAlthough the funding for artificial intelligence (AI) research and quantum sciences would be kept at current levels, it is unclear how well the agency itself will function: the budget calls for a $93 million cut to operations, a 20% decrease. Media reports say that half of the NSF staff could be terminated. If the cuts go through, “I don't know how the agency functions as Congress intended it,” says Kenneth Evans, a science policy researcher at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nThe administration has proposed slashing the budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from about $48 billion in 2025 to roughly $27 billion in 2026 — a cut of some 40%. If enacted, this would be the most drastic cut ever for the NIH, which is the world’s largest funder of biomedical research.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is slashing NIH-backed research — in charts\n\nThe request also proposes collapsing many of the agency’s 27 institutes and centres into five new ‘focus areas’. Funding for institutes that perform minority-health and international research would be eliminated entirely.\n\nThese cuts would “absolutely devastate the biomedical research enterprise” and the US economy, which is dependent on that enterprise, says Carole LaBonne, a stem-cell biologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. “It’s incredibly short-sighted.”\n\nThe Trump team justifies these massive cuts by repeating its previous criticisms of the agency: “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health,” the budget document says.\n\nFormer NIH director Monica Bertagnolli, who was appointed by former president Joe Biden, a Democrat, says she was appalled to see the administration’s rhetoric: “Each one of these statements has been litigated in the past and found to be grossly inaccurate or false,” she says. “This is a very unfortunate and distorted view of an organization I know to be dedicated to improving the health of all people.”\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nThe administration seeks to cut the $9.6 billion budget for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by one-third and to eliminate programmes such as one aimed at preventing chronic diseases. That’s despite the stated commitment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who as secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services oversees the CDC, to support such activities.\n\nNASA\n\nNASA’s budget would drop 24.3% from its 2025 level, to $18.8 billion in 2026. That’s the largest single-year cut relative to the previous year’s funding ever proposed. The agency’s science division, including astrophysics, planetary, and earth science research, would be slashed by nearly half. Among the projects targeted for cancellation are climate-monitoring satellites and plans to bring back rock samples from Mars using robotic spacecraft. A coalition of space advocates has spoken out in recent weeks against the proposed cuts, saying they would usher in a “dark age of space science at NASA”.\n\nHuman spaceflight programmes would see dramatic changes: the proposed budget cuts funding for the International Space Station, but pours more money into lunar and Mars exploration — including $1 billion for unspecified “Mars-focused” programmes. That’s in keeping with the administration’s priority of landing astronauts on the Moon and Mars before China does. The budget proposes retiring the government’s heavy-lift Space Launch System rocket after two more flights, including one scheduled to take astronauts to the Moon in 2026.",

But the sixth edition of the National Climate Assessment — already in the works for months — was gutted earlier this week, when US President Donald Trump’s administration dismissed hundreds of scientists helping with it.\n\n‘Totally broken’: how Trump 2.0 has paralysed work at US science agencies\n\nSome researchers aren’t giving up, however. They are wondering whether they could publish it anyway, through independent channels. One of their inspirations is the National Nature Assessment, a report that Trump cancelled on his first day back in office. Last month, researchers involved with that report announced a campaign to publish it outside the governmental framework, using private funding. The report is meant to detail the importance of nature — ecosystems, biodiversity and more — on the US economy and on US health.\n\nBoth reports address “the condition of the planet writ large”, says Gillian Bowser, an ecologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and a lead author of the nature assessment. Efforts to revive them reflect the ways in which US researchers are trying to cope with Trump’s assault on federal science.\n\n“I volunteered for this effort, and I’m ready to continue it,” says Costa Samaras, a systems engineer at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and lead author of a chapter of the climate assessment. “This is important work for the country,” adds Samaras, who worked on US energy policy under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nUp-to-date knowledge\n\nBoth projects were coordinated by the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), a network of 15 federal agencies that deal with environmental issues across the US government. The reports were meant to be comprehensive syntheses of the most up-to-date scientific knowledge in the fields of climate science and ecology.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nThe first National Climate Assessment was published in 2000; since then, this report, mandated by the US Congress, has come out fairly regularly. It is “the de facto understanding of what climate change means for the country”, says Nícola Ulibarrí, an environmental policy specialist at the University of California, Irvine, who contributed to the fifth edition and was slated to contribute to the sixth.\n\nTrump has called climate change a “hoax”, but during his first term as president, he approved the 2018 release of the fourth climate assessment. His team also began the process of setting up the fifth assessment, although the president’s controversial pick to lead the USGCRP — a climate-change denier — was later replaced. By contrast, Trump’s current administration moved swiftly to gut the sixth report, dubbed the NCA6.\n\nIn early April, the president’s team terminated contracts with the company that provided internal staff members to coordinate the report’s production. This week, administration officials dismissed nearly 400 university and other external scientists who were working on it. Nature asked the White House the reason for the terminations, and received the same line that appeared in the scientists’ dismissal e-mail: “At this time, the scope of the NCA6 is currently being reevaluated in accordance with the Global Change Research Act of 1990.”",

          "abstract": "Romeo’s eyes flickered open as his systems rebooted — which he wasn’t expecting. On swallowing the poison, he had initiated a system-wide shutdown in despair. Juliet was dead. She lay there in seemingly calm repose, not breathing, the bottle of poison still clasped in her hand. Unable to face marriage to the Count Paris, distraught at the banishment of Romeo, she had ended her life. This seemed entirely illogical to Romeo. To Romeo’s android. Why would the heir to the Capulet Cloning Corporation kill herself over such matters?\n\nHe sat up. Apparently, despair was also not a legitimate reason for an android created by Montagu Mechanical Men Incorporated to end its existence. Error messages scrolled across his vision, reset codes and system warnings. His system-wide shutdown had been aborted. He was too valuable to be scrapped.\n\nDermal sensors informed him that the crypt was cold and damp. The light level was low, so he turned up the sensitivity of his visual systems and looked over at Juliet.\n\nOddly, she was no longer reclined in tragic repose. She now had a dagger plunged into her heart. His dagger. Her white dress was stained with blood and her face bore an expression of such tragedy that his emotional translation routines had to buffer for a second to process the sight.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nHe almost initiated another system-wide shutdown. Apparently, she had not been dead. Analytical subroutines assessed the scene and determined that she had been faking death, awoken to see her erstwhile lover dead, and then genuinely killed herself.\n\nRomeo would not react well to this. No more than he would have reacted well to the initial news that Juliet had poisoned herself. His violent temper would probably lead to severe damage to the android. No worrying about value for the real Romeo, heir to Montagu Mechanical Men — the very reason the android had attempted to shut himself down rather than face his angry original.\n\nNow it seemed he had no choice. If no news was forthcoming, Romeo would track him down. Wherever he went, his inbuilt locator beacon would allow him to be found. He rose to his feet, checked his balancing systems were up to speed, and trudged from the crypt.\n\n*****\n\nJuliet fretted, alone in her room. Why was there no news from her clone? The mission had been simple: switch places, take the poison, wait in the crypt for Romeo, tell him where to meet her, sneak back into the house and switch places again.\n\nHer father thought he was so clever, making a deal with Paris, getting out of it without losing face, waiting for disloyal elements to make a move, before revealing his daughter and heir to be alive after all. He didn’t know that Juliet — sweet, innocent child that she was — had added her own twist to the plan.\n\nShe peered out of the window into the gloom. There was nothing for it. She would have to go and find out what had happened.\n\nEasier said than done, with her father’s paranoia, but not something that she hadn’t done before. Dressed in plain trousers and short jacket, she opened the French doors onto her balcony, straddled the balustrade and clambered nimbly down the trellis. With a lot of pausing, ducking and running, she made it off the Capulet estate and headed at a run to the crypt.\n\nInside was dim and cold. A dark shadow lay across the chest of her clone. Not a shadow. A stain. A dagger; and blood. Real blood. Clones were as human as real humans. Not like those Montagu creations.\n\n“Poor clone,” she said, touching the dead girl’s cheek. She had done a sterling job of standing in for Juliet on numerous occasions deemed too dangerous by her father. She glanced around. There was the poison bottle on the floor, empty. “But who stabbed you?”\n\nThe only other person who should have been there was Romeo, assuming he had responded to her secret message. Unless he didn’t show up?\n\n“Really?” she said, stamping a foot. “He didn’t show up? I bet he was off seeing that Rosaline. He swore he’d never look at her again!”\n\nUnless it was Romeo who had plunged in the dagger. Had it been a Montagu plot all along? Had he seduced her with the intention of killing her? Either way, she would have nothing more to do with him. She left the crypt and retraced her steps.\n\n*****",

          "authors": "Esme Hedley",
          "abstract": "Credit: Peter Dazeley/Getty\n\nAmid fears of research data disappearing for political and technical reasons, scientists, librarians and archivists are calling out weaknesses in how the scholarly record is being preserved.\n\nTeams that run data repositories are being urged to have contingency plans that would protect their data in the event of emergencies. These might include forming networks with other repositories, which could then step in if a failure occurs. Publishers, too, are being asked to use archiving services to ensure the safety of their content.\n\nResearch data go missing more often than people might expect. For example, a 2023 study1 of more than 3,000 research-data repositories showed that 191 of them had shut down. Of those, 90 did not maintain access to their data or name a repository that had taken over custody of the data, which could indicate that the data have been lost. “Repository shutdown poses a real threat to the perpetual availability of research data,” write lead author Dorothea Strecker, who researches open science and research-data management at the Humboldt University of Berlin, and her colleagues.\n\nData repositories such as PubMed, the Web of Science and Scopus are an essential resource for researchers, because they help to improve the accessibility, reliability and reusability of data. But as a March outage of PubMed made clear, these resources are not infallible. A 2015 analysis2 of 326 databases found that more than 60% had disappeared, were non-functional or had limited functionality, and 14% were archived over an 18-year period.\n\nJonas Recker, an archivist at the Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Mannheim, Germany, says that the possibility of closure can be overlooked by teams that run repositories. “We often don’t think enough about worst-case scenarios, such as loss of funding or the change of the hosting organization’s mission,” he says.\n\nRecker says that the removal of some data sets related to gender and diversity from US government websites in February has reminded the scientific community of the need to build “strong networks” with diverse “geolocation, technology and technical providers, host organizations and funding sources” to ensure that scientific knowledge is preserved.\n\nDistributing data\n\nMany repositories are shut down owing to a lack of funding, technical difficulties or organizational changes, Strecker and her colleagues found. Because preservation “often rests solely on individual repositories”, Strecker says she would like to see a more “distributed” approach to preservation, such as the development of networks that preserve data if a repository is shut down.\n\nRecker agrees, adding that this approach can alleviate the pressure on individual repositories. He recommends that repositories connect with others that are “similar” to them in some way, such as sharing a research discipline, data type or audience. “A group of repositories from the German Network of Educational Research Data is currently working on a ‘cessation checklist’ template, which highlights practical things a repository can do to prepare for a situation where transfer of data to another repository might become necessary,” he says. Having this prepared can help staff to work towards a more formal agreement, such as a memorandum of understanding, says Recker, or help to clarify “which parts of the collection can be transferred, and under which conditions, in case quick action is necessary”.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nPreservation networks are in place for text publications. LOCKSS (Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe), for example, is an open-source program developed by Stanford University in California that makes multiple copies of content and then stores them on the servers of libraries around the world that pay an annual fee to have their collections preserved. ‘Dark’ archives — in which research papers and other content remain mostly inaccessible to the public and are used mainly for restoration or recovery purposes in the event of data corruption or other significant disruptions — are another option. The CLOCKSS (Controlled Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe) dark archive, which is also run out of Stanford, provides access to its archive only in response to specific trigger events, such as the publisher ceasing operations or content being unavailable for an agreed period.\n\nMartin Eve, a researcher in literature, technology and publishing at Birkbeck, University of London, urges publishers to engage with such services. A study he published last year of almost 7.5 million research papers found that more than one-quarter of them had not been properly archived and preserved3. “Publishers need to be brought up to speed on what they need to do to make it work,” he says. “Otherwise, what we’re going to have in 50 years’ time is a bunch of links that we thought were persistent, that have just vanished from use, and a system that’s not great for transmitting knowledge.”\n\nEve’s research found that wealthier publishers were more likely to have good digital preservation measures than were those that are smaller and less well-resourced — a fact that is not surprising to scholarly-communications researcher Juan Pablo Alperin at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. The cost of services such as CLOCKSS (publishers are charged an annual participation fee that is based on publishing revenue) “can be prohibitive for some journals, especially those operating in places such as the global south”, says Alperin. He adds that it’s important that options are available to publishers and repositories in poorer locations.",

But by doing so, we hope to identify sustainable farming methods that will enable the region to remain productive in the face of climate change, far into the future.\n\nAgriculture is a big emitter of greenhouse gases — it accounts for around 15% of Thailand’s carbon emissions — but the sector’s emissions tell only half the story.

Only one medication for the condition has approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, and it has limited effectiveness.\n\nBefore this study, the role of the fungus, called Fusarium foetens, in the human microbiome and its interactions with metabolism were poorly understood. “We had little understanding of how this fungus evolved to colonize the intestines of healthy individuals,” says co-author Jiang Changtao, a microbiologist at Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing. Previous studies have shown that gut yeast — a type of fungus — can aggravate alcoholic fatty liver disease2, but whether filamentous fungi such as F. foetens could affect liver conditions was unclear.\n\nChangtao and his colleagues cultured F. foetens from human faeces using an isolation and culturing system that they designed. They gave the fungus to mice with a type of fatty liver disease called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and found that it markedly improved MASH symptoms, such as reducing already existent liver swelling and liver scarring from the disease.\n\nUltimate cause\n\nThe researchers then investigated how the metabolisms of treated mice changed. They found that the effect was caused by slowed synthesis of fatty molecules called ceramides. Ceramides are important for interactions between the intestine and the liver but are found at elevated levels in humans and mice with MASH.\n\nThe researchers harvested molecules secreted by F. foetens from the fungal culture’s growth medium and found that the secretions alone inhibited ceramide synthesis. The team analysed the growth medium closely and found one molecule that inhibits an intestinal ceramide-synthesizing protein called CerS6.\n\nThe molecule had already been found in multiple fungal species, but its effect on MASH was unknown. Now, Changtao and his team plan to further analyse molecules produced by F. foetens to “provide a new and effective approach for the clinical treatment of MASH”.",

          "authors": "Tyler J. VanderWeele, Byron R. Johnson",
          "abstract": "Flourishing — a state in which all aspects of a person’s life are good — should be the goal of people and nations everywhere1,2. As well as encompassing personal experiences of happiness, health, meaning, pro-sociality, relationships and financial security, flourishing extends to strong communities and good environments.\n\nYet, for something so central to all our lives, research efforts on flourishing have, so far, been woefully inadequate. It’s not entirely for lack of trying. It’s hard to build infrastructure to collect data nationally, let alone globally, on so many aspects of people’s lives. And there are many challenges in how to analyse such data meaningfully so that they can be used to inform policies.\n\nGlobal Flourishing Study – Wave I\n\nThere’s no single question that can be asked to evaluate well-being3. For example, economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) don’t tell us how people in a given country are faring — loneliness, societal division and meaninglessness can be rife even in the richest countries2,4. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)5 can support general drivers of well-being, such as public health and access to water and energy. But they don’t include subjective personal assessments of how purposeful or hopeful people are.\n\nTo get policies on the right track to help people flourish, governments should set up systems for collecting robust data on their citizens’ well-being. Rigorous research needs to be undertaken to track populations and guide our understanding of the determinants of flourishing. Neither will be easy.\n\nAs a first step, here we highlight early results from a large multinational survey — the Global Flourishing Study2 (GFS) — that has collected data from more than 200,000 individuals in 22 countries, representing about half of the world’s population. We call on governments around the globe to step up and do more.\n\nFive challenges\n\nCollection of global data on flourishing is hindered by five factors.\n\nMultiple dimensions. First, if flourishing consists of all aspects of life, the list of what potentially to measure is endless. Moreover, happiness, meaning, relationship quality, income and health are not all perfectly correlated. For example, people in high-income countries tend to evaluate their quality of life as higher but their meaning of life lower than do those in lower-income nations2,4,6. Extensive assessments are needed to understand these nuances, yet no single survey can cover everything.\n\nDo smartphones and social media really harm teens’ mental health?\n\nTo take a general look, the World Happiness Report’s7 global ranking is based on one question from a data-collection survey called the Gallup World Poll, which uses the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale (Cantril Ladder). The question asks: “Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you, and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” But a study published last year has indicated that this question often prompts people to think more about status and money than other aspects of well-being, such as relationships8.\n\nFurthermore, a single question cannot unveil the subtleties and different dynamics across various aspects of well-being. For example, in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, people’s perceptions of happiness, health and financial security decreased more than did those of meaning and social connectedness9. Yet few surveys look beyond questions of life evaluation and satisfaction.\n\nObjective and subjective elements. Assessments of flourishing must cover both the objective state of affairs around a person’s life (their income, environment, job and so on) and the person’s subjective sense of well-being (how happy, secure and connected they feel, for example).\n\nThe former is more routinely measured, with national data often available on income, literacy, employment, life expectancy and a host of other objective measures. The latter is less frequently explored, but crucially important. Two people can spend the same amount of time with others in a work setting or school, and one might feel connected and the other lonely. More research is needed around these subjective aspects to more fully understand human experience.\n\nAnother difficult question is how to prioritize objective versus subjective elements when designing policy. There is plenty of evidence that objective elements affect subjective elements, and vice versa10. For example, happy individuals are more successful in relationships, income and work performance. But there is no definitive way to judge these trade-offs between the objective and the subjective. Researchers still need to examine whether targeting policies towards objective well-being ultimately has a larger effect on subjective well-being, or the reverse.\n\nOlder people reported greater well-being than younger ones in Mexico, a nation with strong community traditions.Credit: Gerardo Vieyra/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nTranslation and interpretation. In any global survey, people who live in different countries and who speak different languages will have varying understandings of the questions. Words are translated and interpreted differently in different contexts.\n\nEven perceptions on numbered response scales can vary by country. For example, people in some East Asian countries might prefer to report towards the middle of the scale6, because extremes can seem boastful or undesirable.\n\nResearchers need to know: are we really measuring the same thing? Are results comparable across countries? If they are not, well-being rankings7 must be interpreted cautiously. A better understanding of differences in interpretation through cognitive interviews11 can provide greater context, help to situate results and further increase awareness of limitations.\n\nDiffering priorities. Different societies might value autonomy, relationships and financial prosperity to varying degrees. Any set of questions necessarily entails settling on a set of values that might not be equally applicable to all. Autonomy might be given more emphasis in Western societies. Balance, peace and harmony, although arguably universally valued, might be given more emphasis in Eastern cultures12. We should respect the priorities and values of each nation and culture. This, however, does make standardized data collection more challenging and requires a broader set of measures.\n\nTo build a better world, stop chasing economic growth\n\nMethodological challenges. As well as the obstacles we’ve already mentioned, researchers struggle to obtain longitudinal data over time in order to discern causation, to achieve adequate sample sizes and to obtain data that can act as controls in discerning true drivers of flourishing. Association is not causation, and longitudinal data from the same group of linked individuals over time is needed to try to separate cause from effect. Controlling for confounding factors requires yet more data. Therefore, large sample sizes are essential to help to tease out associations.\n\nResearchers must also pay attention to issues around measurement. With self-reported survey answers, social-desirability biases (respondents wanting to give more attractive answers) and self-deception biases (with respondents thinking of themselves more highly than they ought to) come into play and can vary by country. Collecting data on more-objective assessments of well-being can partially counter these problems.\n\nA world-wide perspective\n\nThe GFS2 is an ambitious project that is trying to address some of these challenges, through including large sample sizes, a wide range of questions, nationally representative samples to understand dynamics at the country level and longitudinal data collection. It is collecting data annually for five years, from 2022 to 2027. The survey was shaped by input from scholars around the world and includes 109 questions, including ones on community, economics, politics, childhood experiences and spirituality or religion2,13. The data are freely available through the Center for Open Science (see www.cos.io/gfs). The first wave (mostly 2023 data) was released in February 2024, and the second wave (2024 data) was released in April this year.",

          "authors": "Laura Dattaro",
          "abstract": "To receive tenure, US professors usually have to teach a certain number of courses and demonstrate accomplishments, such as obtaining research grants.Credit: Sky Nesher/Getty\n\nEpidemiologist Candice Johnson was just getting started as a faculty member at Michigan State University (MSU) in East Lansing when US President Donald Trump took office. Since then, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has cancelled a research contract it had awarded her that covered 5% of her salary. And the Trump administration has effectively eliminated the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, one of the main sources of funding in Johnson’s field.\n\nHow Trump’s attack on universities is putting research in peril\n\nJohnson studies health disparities in the workforce, particularly in under-represented groups — a challenge, given that Trump’s team is targeting what it has called “radical and wasteful” government spending on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. She’s worried about her future in research — and in particular about her prospects of receiving tenure, a status in the US academic system that, once attained, guarantees researchers a faculty position that can be terminated only under extreme circumstances. Johnson’s ‘tenure clock’ has started, and she would normally be expected in the next five years to apply for tenure by demonstrating her accomplishments, including articles published and research grants secured.\n\nBut with the chaos brought by the Trump administration, “it seems to be an impossible thing to try to plan out the next five years not knowing what’s going to happen”, she says.\n\nJohnson’s not alone. For other early-career researchers who spoke to Nature, the path to meeting standard tenure expectations now seems blocked, and they are looking to their universities for guidance on how to proceed. Since Trump began his presidency, US agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that fund science have been slashing research awards that don’t align with the administration’s political ideology. They’ve also been freezing grants to universities with DEI programmes, or that the administration says have failed to protect their students from antisemitism. (Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, yesterday released reports initiated in 2024 by internal task forces that found evidence of this type of discrimination — as well as discrimination against Muslim and Arab students — and has pledged reform.)\n\nThese and other actions by the Trump team have left many researchers in limbo, waiting for funding that might never arrive, or scrambling to find other sources of financial support, to keep their teams intact.\n\nAnnika Barber, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, says that for many laboratories, including hers, even a three- to six-month gap in funding means that people have to be fired.\n\nTicking tenure clocks\n\nBarber’s own funding, for studying the neural basis of decision-making in fruit flies, is secure at the moment: this month, the NIH approved a renewal of her existing grant, after initially asking her to stop any DEI-related work. She is part of a group in her faculty union exploring options to help researchers with ticking tenure clocks. Possibilities under consideration include bridge funding — whereby a university provides temporary financing until a long-term solution is found — and modifying the requirements of tenure. The group hasn’t yet made any specific requests of Rutgers, but Barber says its members think that tenure extensions — giving researchers more time to meet requirements — won’t work in this situation, because there’s no guarantee that funding will ever be restored.\n\nPostdocs and PhD students hit hard by Trump’s crackdown on science\n\nJohnson agrees that a tenure-clock extension probably won’t solve the problem. “I don’t know how we could still meet the tenure requirements” if US science budgets continue to be targeted, she says. Media outlets have reported that Trump will be requesting a reduction of about 40% in the NIH’s spending for fiscal year 2026, for example.\n\nNature contacted the universities of each researcher interviewed for this story to ask what steps they are taking to help scientists who are worried about attaining tenure. Only MSU, where Johnson works, answered.\n\nAron Sousa, dean of the College of Human Medicine at MSU, anticipates that disruptions to federal funding would justify extensions. The institution is discussing the possibility of shifting tenure requirements, he says, although no formal proposals are yet under consideration.\n\n“We will have to change our standards if funding, and the kinds of research that funding allows, are no longer possible for faculty in this country,” he says.",

The results are described in Cell today1.\n\n“The outcome is important if we did find ourselves in a pandemic setting again, with some other virus that we may then have a new vaccine for,” says co-author Mee Ling Munier, a vaccine researcher at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe question of which arm produces a more effective immune response from vaccination has persisted for a long time, says Munier. “Most people get their vaccine in their non-dominant arm because that doesn’t affect their day-to-day life.” But experiments in mice suggest that where a vaccine is given can affect the body’s immune response, she adds.\n\n154 million lives and counting: 5 charts reveal the power of vaccines\n\nMunier and her colleagues found that specialized immune cells, called subcapsular sinus macrophages, in mouse lymph nodes play an important part in mounting an immune response to vaccination.\n\nWhen a booster vaccine was administered in the same location as the initial dose, the mice’s subcapsular sinus macrophages were already primed. They reactivated immune cells called memory B cells more quickly than did the cells of mice whose second vaccination was administered in a different limb.\n\nFaster peak",

          "abstract": "Thomas Crowther made a name for himself after publishing a paper that suggested Earth had eight times more trees than expected.Credit: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Bloomberg Philanthropies\n\nA university investigation into Thomas Crowther, a prominent tree researcher who ran a large laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), reveals that he blurred personal and professional relationships in his lab and breached internal rules on financial and hiring compliance. But it clears him of misusing grant funds.\n\nHowever, some members of Crowther’s laboratory have accused ETH Zurich of a flawed and biased investigation, in a letter sent to the university on 28 April and seen by Nature, and they call for an independent review into the university’s handling of the case. The investigation led ETH Zurich to decide that it would not renew Crowther’s contract — a tenure-track professorship — and his lab, which previously employed 40–60 people, is being dismantled.\n\nETH Zurich published a retracted version of the report on 25 April. It finds that Crowther “repeatedly failed to follow internal rules and adequately address conflicts of interest”, but it does not provide evidence of any misuse of funds, according to Stefan Spiegel, the university’s vice-president of finance and controlling at the institution.\n\nCrowther, who is on administrative leave until his contract expires in September, denies many of the allegations investigated in the report, but admits he made mistakes. “I am deeply sorry if this caused any discomfort for anyone,” Crowther said in a statement to Nature. He never engaged “any form of inappropriate advances”, he adds.\n\nThe university confirmed to Nature that it had received the lab members’ letter. “From ETH Zurich’s perspective, the case is considered closed” with the publication of the report, it said in a statement. “The President of ETH Zurich had already concluded in December 2024 that the basis of trust required for a permanent position was not given in this case.”\n\nRising star\n\nCrowther rose to prominence after publishing a Nature paper1 in 2015 that suggested that Earth had eight times more trees than expected. His work garnered interest from influential people, including US President Donald Trump, and inspired a high-profile tree-conservation initiative by the World Economic Forum.\n\nCrowther has been at ETH Zurich since 2017, but in late 2024, Swiss media reported that several people had made allegations against him to the university.\n\nThe report into these allegations, investigated in 2024 and 2025 by a law firm appointed by ETH Zurich, reveals that among the documents examined were five individuals’ written statements and a whistle-blowing report on possible compliance issues.\n\nThe investigation says that Crowther treated “his employees in the same way as friends”. Although most employees appreciated his behaviour, the report says, others thought it was inappropriate and said he crossed personal boundaries. Examples of this reported behaviour included late-night WhatsApp messages inviting employees to parties. Some described a “toxic management culture”.\n\nIn a statement to Nature, Crowther admits that he blurred the lines between personal and professional life, and treated employees as close friends. “I am devastated that it did not work for some. I will always strive to improve,” he says.\n\nFinancial matters\n\nFor some of the more serious allegations, such as that Crowther kissed a former lab intern and invited a student to his apartment after dinner, the institution said it received information during the investigation that contradicts the accusers’ versions of events.\n\nCrowther added: “I would never ever initiate any form of intimate interaction with a student. I am grateful that the ETH investigation uncovered clear evidence to contradict these accusations.”\n\nOn financial and legal matters, the probe investigated several allegations, including that lab members worked for other organizations during their contracted hours and that the lab misused consultancy contracts.\n\nThe report finds that in certain cases, such as spending on crisis communications, legal advice and marketing, and the use of consultancy contacts, the rules were not always followed. In the report, Crowther acknowledged a “few minor oversights” relating to spending on crisis communication and legal advice, but denies that consultancy contracts were misused.\n\nCrowther says that his lab was huge, with “countless contracts and collaborations”. “I know that I will have made some accidental errors. But I can guarantee that no lab members worked for other organizations during their employment at ETH,” he adds.\n\nOverall, the report concludes that Crowther conducted his research to a high level, but “failed to live up to the responsibility expected of him”.",

          "abstract": "Protein molecules (artist’s illustration) fold into their final shapes. Newly developed editors can swap bits of a protein for other molecules and amino acids.Credit: Ruslanas Baranauskas/Science Photo Library\n\nA powerful technique that directly edits proteins in living cells promises to help researchers to study proteins in improved ways.\n\nThe technique relies on strings of amino acids called inteins, which can autonomously cut themselves out of proteins. Scientists have now harnessed inteins to splice chemical groups, unusual amino acids and even polymers into target proteins, and can observe how such additions affect a protein’s function and cellular location.\n\nThe method was described in a pair of papers in Science, one published today1 and one in April2.\n\nThe technique is “a very nice addition to the toolbox”, says Mikko Taipale, a molecular geneticist at the University of Toronto in Canada, who was not involved in either study. Just as DNA-editing CRISPR systems have transformed the ability to manipulate genes, intein editors will provide a better way to investigate the form, function and localization of proteins, says Taipale.\n\nBut whereas CRISPR is ready for use in living cells, laboratory animals and humans, current protein editors require finicky customization and can be used only in cells. The tools are “good for very specific questions”, says Taipale.\n\nIntein intel\n\nInteins were discovered in 1990 in baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and thousands of these elements have since been identified in other single-celled organisms. “We call them Houdini proteins, because they escape from the bondage of the proteins they’re embedded in,” says Tom Muir, a chemist at Princeton University in New Jersey and a co-author of the Science paper published in April. Although inteins’ biological role remains unclear, for the most part, researchers have long been trying to repurpose inteins as protein editors.\n\nAI tools are designing entirely new proteins that could transform medicine\n\nProgress has been slow: inteins can be hard to work with and are inefficient editors. But Muir’s group designed new inteins that perform better than previously available ones. The paper published today, by George Burslem at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and his colleagues, describes intein systems that are easier to produce and use in live cells.\n\nThe editors, called protein transposons by Muir’s team, require some groundwork. Researchers first have to reprogram the DNA code for the protein of interest. This step adds instructions to encode an ‘acceptor site’ where the edit will be made. The site includes two intein elements at either end.\n\nThe researchers then prepare a ‘donor’ protein carrying the desired cargo to be spliced into the target protein. The cargo is bracketed by two more intein elements. When the target protein and the donor align, the split inteins pair up and self-eject from the target protein, taking the rest of the acceptor site with them. The cargo slots itself into the gap.\n\nThe process is “cut and paste”, says Burslem.\n\nQuick work\n\nBurslem’s team used the editors to make changes in five different proteins in live cells. The protein editors needed less than ten minutes to do their work, Burslem says. Muir’s team used a different set of editors to tweak three proteins.\n\n“Between the two papers, there’s quite a breadth of different types of proteins that this has been applied to,” says Muir.\n\nThese editors provide a powerful new tool for cell-biology experiments, he adds. The tools can be used to add markers to proteins, giving scientists a fresh way to track proteins’ actions and movements. And the editors can paste in stretches of amino acids that will redefine where a protein goes in the cell, give it a new function or force it to interact with another protein of interest.",

We investigate how demographic factors—including age, gender, marital status, employment status, education, religious service attendance and immigration status—are correlated with financial well-being (as assessed through four dimensions). Additionally, we analyse associations between recalled early-life conditions, such as parental marital status and childhood health, with financial well-being in adulthood. Our findings reveal cross-national differences in levels of financial well-being and its demographic correlates. Early-life conditions were also consistently associated with adult financial well-being, although these associations varied substantially across countries. These results suggest that understanding financial well-being should encompass both current sociodemographic factors and early-life experiences within the unique cultural and socioeconomic contexts of different populations.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary approaches examining the determinants of happiness have posited that happiness is determined bidirectionally by both top-down, global life satisfaction and bottom-up, domain satisfaction processes. We propose a personalized happiness perspective, suggesting that the determinants and consequences of happiness are idiographic (that is, specific) to each individual rather than assumed to be the same for all. We showed the utility of a personalized happiness approach by testing associations between life and domain satisfaction at both the population and personalized levels using nationally representative data of 40,074 German, British, Swiss, Dutch and Australian participants tracked for up to 33 years. The majority of participants (41.4–50.8%) showed primarily unidirectional associations between domain satisfactions and life satisfaction, and only 19.3–25.9% of participants showed primarily bidirectional associations. Moreover, the population models differed from personalized models, suggesting that aggregated, population-level research fails to capture individual differences in personalized happiness, showing the importance of a personalized happiness approach. Patterns of individual differences are robust, yet distinguishing between individual-level patterns and random error is challenging, highlighting the need for future work and innovative approaches to study personalized happiness.",

Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials on peer-reviewed, Internet-based, self-administered psychological interventions for stress reduction in healthy or subhealthy adults. A total of 63 studies with 20,454 participants were included (68.18% female; mean age 39.14 years). Integrated expert insights with large language models to develop a three-dimensional framework encompassing theoretical foundation, human support and mobile technology. Intervention labels were independently coded by the authors and ChatGPT. The included studies’ quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Bayesian network meta-analysis and Bayesian meta-regression were used to explore comparative efficacy and potential moderators. The framework classified and compared 19 mobile stress interventions, identifying key moderating factors for optimization. Stress management programmes, problem-solving therapy and mindfulness meditation ranked the top. There was no conclusive evidence that human support or mobile technology significantly enhanced intervention outcomes. The evidence is subject to sex imbalance and quality risk, while the limited statistical power of meta-regression warrants caution in interpreting moderator effects. Our findings provide insights for designing more effective and scalable stress interventions and offer promising strategies to reduce health service disparities and advance the Sustainable Development Goals.",

We offer a three-pronged approach of child-specific, family-level and systemic educational and information renumeration via a child-centric reparations framework. Mechanisms for such government transfers have precedent in the USA but face limitations in that their broader implementation would also require political will.

We consider conceptual, empirical, pragmatic and policy arguments that have been put forward for each of these understandings and measurement approaches.

Ten studies reported positive screening rates for possible depression antenatally, and lockdown was associated with increases in positive screening rates (1.37, 1.06–1.78).

We identified eligible articles by searching for keywords related to physical punishment in six languages across 11 databases, with search periods from April to August 2021 and June to July 2024. This process yielded 5,072 unique records, of which 189 studies, comprising 1,490 unique effect sizes and representing 92 LMICs, met our inclusion criteria. Findings from random-effects multilevel meta-analyses indicated that physical punishment was associated with detrimental outcomes, including mental health problems, worse parent–child relationships, substance use, impaired social–emotional development, negative academic outcomes and heightened externalizing behaviour problems, among others. Despite some variation by contextual and study-level characteristics, all subgroup estimates were consistent in direction. Sensitivity checks indicated that these findings were not typical of other non-violent methods of discipline but were specific to physical punishment and psychological aggression. The analysis confirmed that physical punishment is associated with detrimental outcomes for individuals in LMICs. Additional research is needed to inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies and interventions to prevent the physical punishment of children and adolescents worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Increasing educational attainment is one of the most important and effective strategies for health and economic improvements. The extent to which extreme climate events disrupt education, resulting in reduced educational attainment, remains understudied. Children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may be uniquely vulnerable to losing schooling after disasters due to the poor physical condition of schools and the lack of resources to mitigate unexpected household shocks. Our analysis assesses this overlooked social cost of tropical cyclones on schooling attainment. We study the education records of nearly 5.4 million individuals living in 13 LMICs that experienced tropical cyclones between 1954 and 2010. By comparing individuals living in the same locations but with different exposure levels, we estimate the change in the likelihood that a preschool-age child exposed to tropical cyclone received no schooling. We find that exposure during preschool age is associated with a 0.5 percentage point increase in the likelihood of never attending schooling (2.5% above baseline), with larger effects (up to 8.8% increase) from stronger storms. These effects are more pronounced among girls and are greater in areas less adapted to tropical cyclones. Between 2000 and 2020, we estimate that 79,000 children in the 13 study countries did not start school due to tropical cyclones, and, across all affected students, tropical cyclones resulted in a total loss of 1.1 My of school. These impacts, identified among some of the world’s poorest populations, may grow in importance as exposure to severe tropical cyclones is projected to increase with climate change.",

However, in two preregistered studies of Grades 1 to 12 students in the United States ( N = 2,765), we find a significant divergence in students’ gender stereotypes about different STEM fields. Gender stereotypes about computer science and engineering more strongly favored boys than did gender stereotypes about math and science. These patterns hold across genders, intersections of gender and race/ethnicity, and two geographical regions. This divergence between different STEM fields was evident, although smaller, for children in elementary school compared to adolescents (students in middle school and high school). The divergence in stereotypes predicted students’ divergence in motivation for entering these fields. Gender stereotypes on average slightly favored girls in math and were egalitarian or slightly favored girls in science, while boys remained strongly favored for computer science and engineering, with implications for educational equity and targeted interventions.",

          "authors": "Armin Granulo, Christoph Fuchs, Robert Böhm",
          "abstract": "Governments need to develop and implement effective policies to address pressing societal problems of our time, such as climate change and global pandemics. While some policies focus on changing individual thoughts and behaviors (e.g., informational interventions, behavioral nudges), others involve systemic changes (e.g., car bans, vaccination mandates). Policymakers may use system-level policies to achieve socially desirable outcomes, yet often refrain from doing so because they anticipate public opposition. In this article, we propose that people’s psychological reactance driving this opposition is a transient phenomenon that dissipates once system-level policies are in place. Using secondary survey data ( N = 49,674) and experimental data (six studies; N = 4,629; all preregistered), we document that psychological reactance to system-level policies is greater when they are planned (ex ante implementation) than when they are already implemented (ex post implementation). We further demonstrate that this effect can be observed across various intervention contexts and provide insights into its underlying psychological mechanisms. Specifically, ex ante vs. ex post the system-level policy’s implementation, individuals focus more on the transition-induced personal losses than on the prospective societal outcome gains. In line with this perspective, we show that the decline in reactance to system-level policies after their implementation is mediated and moderated by the salience of personal losses, and that the initial reactance to such policies is mitigated by the salience of societal gains. These findings suggest that the public’s negative reactions to system-level policies are more transient than previously thought and can help policymakers design effective interventions.",

Our empirical evidence shows that in the past 10 y, the advancement of AI/ICT has hindered the development of democracy in many countries around the world. Given that both the state rulers and civil society groups can use AI/ICT, the key that determines which side would benefit more from the advancement of these technologies hinges upon “technology complementarity.” In general, AI/ICT would be more complementary to the government rulers because they are more likely than civil society groups to access various administrative big data. Empirically, we propose three hypotheses and use statistical tests to verify our argument. Theoretically, we prove a proposition, showing that when the above-mentioned complementarity assumption is true, the AI/ICT advancements would enable rulers in authoritarian and fragile democratic countries to achieve better control over civil society forces, which leads to the erosion of democracy. Our analysis explains the recent ominous development in some fragile-democracy countries.",

          "abstract": "Despite its importance to society and many decades of research, key questions about the social and psychological processes of political persuasion remain unanswered, often due to data limitations. We propose that AI tools, specifically generative large language models (LLMs), can be used to address these limitations, offering important advantages in the study of political persuasion. In two preregistered online survey experiments, we demonstrate the potential of generative AI as a tool to study persuasion and provide important insights about the psychological and communicative processes that lead to increased persuasion. Specifically, we test the effects of four AI-generated counterattitudinal persuasive strategies, designed to test the effectiveness of messages that include customization (writing messages based on a receiver’s personal traits and beliefs), and elaboration (increased psychological engagement with the argument through interaction). We find that all four types of persuasive AI produce significant attitude change relative to the control and shift vote support for candidates espousing views consistent with the treatments. However, we do not find evidence that message customization via microtargeting or cognitive elaboration through interaction with the AI have much more persuasive effect than a single generic message. These findings have implications for different theories of persuasion, which we discuss. Finally, we find that although persuasive messages are able to moderate some people’s attitudes, they have inconsistent and weaker effects on the democratic reciprocity people grant to their political opponents. This suggests that attitude moderation (ideological depolarization) does not necessarily lead to increased democratic tolerance or decreased affective polarization.",

          "abstract": "In a world where teams serve as the backbone of collaboration and innovation, women must feel safe when contributing to teamwork. Unfortunately, an increasing number of women report experiencing sexual harassment in workplaces and other collective settings. This research included an examination of how exposure to sexist insults affects collaborative efforts. We argue that in addition to its well-documented effects on individuals, sexism within teams undermines team performance. Hence, emotional synchrony—temporally coordinated emotional facial expressions between individuals—loses its ability to enhance collaboration when team members are exposed to sexism. Under the threat of sexist comments, emotional synchrony signals social bonding rather than focusing team members on performance goals. To test this theory, 177 woman dyads interacting on a video-conferencing platform received instructions for a cooperative task with/without sexist comments from an actor-experimenter in sexism/control conditions. Emotional synchrony was assessed through temporal alignment in facial expressions between dyad members and was correlated with team performance. Our findings revealed a significant increase in facial expressive synchrony among teams in the sexism condition. Whereas facial expressive synchrony predicted better performance in the control condition, its classic positive effects on team performance vanished under sexism. These results suggest that exposure to sexism, while enhancing social cohesion, eliminates the benefits of emotional synchrony, which is considered the social glue of collective action. These findings suggest that zero-tolerance policies for sexual harassment are not only more ethical but can also promote effective teamwork.",

          "abstract": "Autocatalysis is seen as a potential key player in the origin of life, and perhaps more generally in the emergence of Darwinian dynamics. Building on recent formalizations of this phenomenon, we tackle the computational challenge of exhaustively detecting minimal autocatalytic cycles (autocatalytic cores) in reaction networks and further evaluate the impact of thermodynamic constraints on their realization under mass action kinetics. We first characterize the complexity of the detection problem by proving its NP-completeness. This justifies the use of constraint solvers to list all cores in a given reaction network, and also to group them into compatible sets, composed of cores whose stoichiometric requirements are not contradictory. Crucially, we show that the introduction of thermodynamic realism does constrain the composition of these sets. Compatibility relationships among autocatalytic cores can indeed be disrupted when the reaction kinetics obey thermodynamic consistency throughout the network. On the contrary, these constraints have no impact on the realizability of isolated cores, unless upper or lower bounds are imposed on the concentrations of the reactants. Overall, by better characterizing the conditions of autocatalysis in complex reaction systems, this work brings us a step closer to assessing the contribution of this collective chemical behavior to the emergence of natural selection in the primordial soup.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the effects of missense mutations or single amino acid variants (SAVs) on protein function is crucial for elucidating the molecular basis of diseases/disorders and designing rational therapies. We introduce here Rhapsody-2 , a machine learning tool for discriminating pathogenic and neutral SAVs, significantly expanding on a precursor limited by the availability of structural data. With the advent of AlphaFold2 as a powerful tool for structure prediction, Rhapsody-2 is trained on a significantly expanded dataset of 117,525 SAVs corresponding to 12,094 human proteins reported in the ClinVar database. Adopting a broad set of descriptors composed of sequence evolutionary, structural, dynamic, and energetics features in the training algorithm, Rhapsody-2 achieved an AUROC of 0.94 in 10-fold cross-validation when all SAVs of a particular test protein (mutant) were excluded from the training set. Benchmarking against a variety of testing datasets demonstrated the high performance of Rhapsody-2 . While sequence evolutionary descriptors play a dominant role in pathogenicity prediction, those based on structural dynamics provide a mechanistic interpretation. Notably, residues involved in allosteric communication and those distinguished by pronounced fluctuations in the high-frequency modes of motion or subject to spatial constraints in soft modes usually give rise to pathogenicity when mutated. Overall, Rhapsody-2 provides an efficient and transparent tool for accurately predicting the pathogenicity of SAVs and unraveling the mechanistic basis of the observed behavior, thus advancing our understanding of genotype-to-phenotype relations.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) represents a progressive form of steatotic liver disease which increases the risk for fibrosis and advanced liver disease. The accumulation of discrete species of bioactive lipids has been postulated to activate signaling pathways that promote inflammation and fibrosis. However, the key pathogenic lipid species is a matter of debate. We explored candidates using various dietary, molecular, and genetic models. Mice fed a choline-deficient L-amino acid–defined high-fat diet (CDAHFD) developed steatohepatitis and manifested early markers of liver fibrosis associated with increased cholesterol content in liver lipid droplets within 5 d without any changes in total liver cholesterol content. Treating mice with antisense oligonucleotides against Coenzyme A synthase ( Coasy ) or treatment with bempedoic acid or atorvastatin decreased liver lipid droplet cholesterol content and prevented CDAHFD-induced MASH and the fibrotic response. All these salutary effects were abrogated with dietary cholesterol supplementation. Analysis of human liver samples demonstrated that cholesterol in liver lipid droplets was increased in humans with MASH and liver fibrosis and was higher in PNPLA3 I148M (variants rs738409) than in HSD17B13 variants (rs72613567). Together, these data identify cholesterol in liver lipid droplets as a critical mediator of MASH and demonstrate that Coenzyme A synthase knockdown and bempedoic acid are therapeutic approaches to reduce liver lipid droplet cholesterol content and thereby prevent the development of MASH and liver fibrosis.",

          "abstract": "Homeostatic regulation ensures stable neural circuit output under changing conditions. We find that in Drosophila larvae, either presynaptic weakening due to perturbation of transmitter release or postsynaptic weakening due to perturbation of glutamate receptors at synapses between motor neuron (MN) and muscle has little impact on locomotion, suggesting a nonsynaptic compensatory mechanism. In vivo imaging shows that five different forms of synaptic weakening increase the duration of activity bouts in type I MNs. Strikingly, this compensation is input selective: occurring only in the tonic type Ib MN, not the phasic type Is MN that innervates the same muscle. Moreover, an inhibitory class of central pre-MNs that innervates the tonic—but not phasic—input decreases in activity. The adjustment in activity occurs remarkably quickly: within minutes of synapse perturbation. We propose that MN firing is dynamically regulated by two coordinated mechanisms: a cell-autonomous adjustment of MN excitability and a circuit adjustment of inhibitory central drive. The input selectivity of this process suggests homeostatic adjustment to maintain tonic drive but hold constant the phasic drive that organizes locomotory wave patterns.",

Resonance-stabilized radicals (RSRs) are commonly identified in fuel combustion and pyrolysis processes and play an essential role in carbonaceous particle formation. Despite their importance, comprehensive experimental and mechanistic understanding of particle inception through RSR reactions is lacking. This work investigated particle size distribution, chemical composition, and thermal behavior of soot particles generated by the flow reactor pyrolysis reactions of typical RSRs, in particular, 1-indenyl, 1-methylnaphthyl, and 2-methylnaphthyl radicals, and by the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons with a variety of structures. Particle size distributions show soot particles with mobility diameters in an incipient-particle range of 1.3 to 1.6 nm. Laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry results suggest that soot products consist of much larger covalently bound clusters (CBCs) than those observed in the gas phase. Under our experimental conditions, the CBCs exhibit a phase transition for particles with calculated molecular diameters of around 1.5 nm. Evaporation experiments and thermogravimetric analysis of the soot products reveal distinct thermal characteristics for small and large CBCs. These results implicate CBCs as bridges between gas-phase species and soot particles. The present work provides a soot-inception mechanism called RSR clustering (RSRC) that is characterized by the reactive clustering of RSRs. The RSRC mechanism contrasts with conventional soot formation models that attribute soot inception primarily to the aggregation of large-size polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

The predominant view holds that high rates of phenotypic evolution result from lineage transitions across peaks in an adaptive landscape, with subsequent slow-downs, but evidence remains debated. I developed a phylogenetic “diffused Brownian motion” model that characterizes nuanced variations in evolutionary rates and use it to comprehensively assess body size evolution and its underlying rates for 2,950 extinct and 792 extant species that span over 450 Mys of evolution. I find that evolutionary rates do not conform to expectations from adaptive landscape theory, but rather have been stable, unaffected by the accumulation of phenotypic disparity. Long-term evolutionary trends, such as several net increases in clade-average body size, result both from sustained evolution at the lineage level and the sorting of species phenotypes and their underlying evolutionary rates at the clade level, sometimes acting in opposite directions. These findings substantiate an active role of species in shaping their environment that generate continuous novelty of life forms.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic elastography uses an imaging system to visualize the propagation of elastic waves, the speed of which is directly related to the elasticity felt by palpation. Very few studies have focused on X-ray elastography because of the technical challenges it poses: a planar image of an integration volume at a very slow sampling rate. We demonstrate that tracking a slow elastic wave guided along a one-dimensional structure could provide a possible solution. The recently discovered flexural pulse wave, which is naturally generated by heartbeats and propagates along arteries, is the perfect candidate for X-ray elastography. As it reflects the cardiovascular health of patients, arterial elasticity is a biomarker of high clinical interest. We first validate the method by measuring the elasticity in artery phantoms using X-ray. We then move on to data obtained in vivo on coronary arteries during a routine angiography examination. During coronary angiography, a catheter is used to inject an X-ray contrast dye into the patient’s aorta. X-rays are then taken as the dye spreads through the coronary arteries. It shows the movement of the coronary arteries for a few seconds and provides an opportunity to follow the natural flexural pulse waves. The obtained Young’s moduli for two patients are E = 38 ± 30 kPa and E = 38 ± 28 kPa, respectively. These preliminary results are expected to pave the way for X-ray elastography.",

Recent advances in genomic sequencing technology have enabled the measurements of TFs’ footprints and binding affinities on DNA at the single-molecule level, facilitating the probing of binding cooperativity among adjacent TFs. This necessitates quantitative descriptions of TFs’ binding cooperativity and understanding of its potential functional relevance. In this study, we show that the binding cooperativities between two adjacent TFs can be quantified by the γ coefficient, which can be experimentally determined. Under thermodynamic equilibrium, the binding affinities of two TFs can either increase together (positive cooperativity) or decrease together (negative cooperativity), but not in opposing directions (one increases while the other decreases). Within the framework of thermodynamics, we investigate the functional relevance of cooperativity. The functional relevance of positive cooperativity, which has been extensively discussed in the literature, is the sigmoidal binding curve around a TF concentration threshold (analogous to oxygen binding to hemoglobin), whereas the functional relevance of negative cooperativity is twofold. First, mutual exclusion of the two TFs enables bidirectional gene switching, akin to the CI-Cro system in phage λ . Second, while TFs often exhibit intranuclear concentration fluctuations, negative binding cooperativity assures fast TF dissociation from DNA and hence rapid response for gene expression regulation. Furthermore, the nonequilibrium steady states of living cells can lead to either positive or negative cooperativity, which can also be quantified by the γ coefficient.",

          "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 1 (HEV-1) infection in pregnant women is associated with adverse outcomes of pregnancy including fulminant hepatic failure, fetal loss, premature birth, and neonatal mortality, although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this study, we first demonstrated that HEV-1 robustly infects pregnant gerbils and causes pregnancy-associated adverse outcomes, which were recorded in 4/6 HEV-1-infected but only 1/5 in PBS-inoculated pregnant gerbils. However, vertical transmission of HEV-1 from mothers to newborns is not evident, as HEV-1 RNA was not detected in uterus tissues or in newborn pups. To further determine whether HEV-1 can cross the placental barrier, we established an in vitro blood–placental barrier by coculturing human placental trophoblast cells (BeWo) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in Transwell inserts. By using the placental barrier under the conditions in this study, we showed that quasi-enveloped or nonenveloped HEV-1, HEV-3, or HEV-4 virions do not readily cross the barrier prior to 4 d postinoculation when it has high barrier integrity. Importantly, we demonstrated that the placental barrier induces local antiviral resistance at the maternal-fetal interface, that interactions between maternal- and fetal-derived cocultured cells are important for induction of antiviral resistance, and that anti-HEV resistance can be transferred to nonplacental HepG2 liver cells. We also revealed that the main effectors of antiviral resistance at the placental barrier are type III interferons (IFN-λ1, λ2/3) and the chemokine CXCL10. The findings have important implications in understanding the mechanisms leading to HEV-1-associated maternal and fetal adverse outcomes in pregnant women.",

          "abstract": "Recent increases in woody plant density in dryland ecosystems—or “woody encroachment”—around the world are often attributed to land-use changes such as increased livestock grazing and wildfire suppression or to global environmental trends (e.g., increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide). While such changes have undoubtedly impacted ecosystem structure and function, the evidence linking them to woody encroachment is mixed, and the underlying processes are not fully understood. To clarify the role of demographic processes in changing woody plant abundance, we conducted a meta-analysis of tree age structures from 29 woodland populations across the interior western United States, estimating per-capita tree establishment rates over the last several hundred years using demographic models. We found only limited evidence of increases in per-capita tree establishment rates following 19th-century Euro-American settlement. On the contrary, our results showed that observed age structures dominated by young trees, often cited as evidence of woody encroachment driven by anthropogenic processes, can be largely predicted by a null model based only on steady, multiplicative tree population growth. Moreover, we demonstrated that tree establishment rates in the last century have mostly declined rather than increased, and they are currently at their lowest rates since at least 1600 CE. Our results suggest that a large part of modern increases in woodland tree establishment and density may in fact be a result of long-term population increases, and failing to consider the demographic processes underlying population growth can lead to an overestimation of settlement effects on stand structure.",

Here, we present an intelligent self-correcting method for the high-resolution growth of uniform few-layer graphene. We demonstrate the layer-resolved growth of wafer-scale bilayer and trilayer graphene (BLG and TLG) with selective Bernal stacking through spontaneous correction of the single-layer graphene film with disordered multilayer graphene islands. Theoretical calculations reveal that the self-correcting growth is driven by the stepwise energy minimization of the closed system and kinetically activated by forming a low-barrier pathway for the carbon detachment-diffusion-attachment. Such uniform Bernal-stacked BLG and TLG films show high quality with distinct quantum Hall effect being observed. Our work opens an avenue for developing an intelligent methodology to realize the precise synthesis of diverse 2D materials.",

          "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal diseases characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors. Neuroinflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of RP and its progression. Previous studies have suggested that the transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays a pivotal role in regulating acute and chronic neuroinflammation. However, the functional role of TAK1 in neuroinflammation remains unclear in RP. Here, we observed TAK1 upregulation in activated microglia of the rd10 mouse model of RP. To create the conditional deletion of TAK1 in microglia, we backcrossed Cx3cr1 CreER/CreER mice and Tak1 fl/fl mice onto rd10 background. We found that both heterozygous (rd10;Cx3cr1 CreER/+ ;Tak1 fl/+ ) and homozygous (rd10;Cx3cr1 CreER/+ ;Tak1 fl/fl ) deletion of microglial TAK1 slowed down photoreceptor degeneration but with distinct mechanisms. The heterozygous TAK1 deficiency resulted in a reduction in the activation and proliferation of microglia and the release of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting STAT3 signaling. In contrast, the homozygous TAK1 deficiency induced apoptosis in microglia via the TNF/RIPK1/CASP3 signaling pathway, contributing to the reduction of microglia-mediated neurotoxicity and subsequent preservation of photoreceptors in RP. Overall, our findings highlight the crucial role of TAK1 in the survival and activation of microglia. We propose that targeting microglial TAK1, considering its expression levels and subsequent signal transduction, could offer a promising personalized therapeutic strategy for individuals with RP regardless of underlying genetic causes.",

          "abstract": "Site-one protease (S1P) carries out the first proteolytic step to activate membrane-bound effector proteins in the Golgi. S1P matures through an autocatalytic process that begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and culminates with the displacement of its inhibitory pro-domain by its cofactor, sterol regulatory element binding protein-regulating gene (SPRING). Spatial control of S1P activity and substrate localization underpins signaling pathways governing, among others, lipogenesis, ER stress, and lysosome biogenesis. The factors governing these pathways are activated by S1P-mediated proteolysis upon their regulated transport from the ER to the Golgi. S1P cleaves substrates with the recognition sequence RX(L/I/V)Z, where X is any residue other than Cys or Pro and Z is preferably Leu or Lys. However, the structural basis for substrate recognition by S1P has remained unknown. Here, we used the small molecule PF-429242, a competitive inhibitor of S1P, to investigate substrate recognition by the S1P/SPRING complex. We determined the structure of S1P/SPRING bound to PF-429242 and found that PF-429242 binds S1P in the same pocket that recognizes the substrate’s conserved P 4 Arg. Further structural analysis suggests that S1P requires a conformation change to accommodate the substrate’s P 2 (L/I/V) residue. We designed an S1P mutation (I308A) to reduce the steric clash at the P 2 position and generated an S1P that was resistant to PF-429242 in biochemical and cell culture assays. Our findings reveal selectivity in the recognition of substrates by S1P and provide a roadmap for the rational design of improved S1P inhibitors.",

          "abstract": "Genomic imbalance refers to the more severe phenotypic consequences of changing a single chromosome compared to changing the whole genomic set. Previous genomic imbalance studies in maize have identified gene expression modulation in aneuploids of single chromosome arms. Here, the modulation of gene expression in more complex aneuploids, e.g., monosomy of one chromosome arm and trisomy of another was examined to determine the extent that combination aneuploids were additive, multiplicative, or rebalanced in terms of their effect on gene expression. A series of genetic crosses was performed to produce one, two, and three copies of one arm with independent one, two, and three copies of the other arm in each of the three genotypes for the opposite arm. In total, 31 combinations were analyzed. By examining RNA modulation, we found that cis genes on varied chromosome arms are generally more dosage-compensated in aneuploid combinations than in single aneuploidy even though some showed a clear dosage effect. For genes on the unvaried chromosomes ( trans ), there is greater modulation in most of the aneuploidy combinations. Finally, 22 of the 31 combinations were found to have an altered transcriptome size, suggesting that extensive stoichiometric changes of genomic regions upset global messenger RNA (mRNA) transcription. Overall, these results have important implications for understanding the role of genomic stoichiometry for mechanisms of gene expression, the evolution of dosage-sensitive duplicated genes, the evolution of sex chromosomes, the rapid growth adaptation of aneuploid cancer cells, and the control of quantitative traits.",

This is especially manifest for lineages with extended geological histories, which, therefore, evokes questions as to the associated processes producing such patterns. Insects, as the earliest flying animals, have exceptional abilities for expanding their range and habitats and to avoid detrimental conditions. They are ideal for exploring historical biogeography augmented via adaptation. Here, we employ beaded lacewings as a model to explore such patterns and likely processes, particularly given that they differ notably from the commonly observed pattern of a latitudinal diversity gradient. Furthermore, owing to their good fossil record it can be observed that their distributions varied remarkably through time. Ecological niche modeling and evaluation demonstrate their niche variation and niche breadth expansion intermittently accompanying global climate change. However, different niche relevant variables changed under patterns of either phylogenetic conservatism or evolutionary lability. By assessing wing morphological disparity and modeling flight aerodynamics, we uncovered a continuous improvement of flight efficiency through beaded-lacewing history as well as a Paleogene divergence in strategy, which reveals a long-term associated path with the niche variation. Our results unveil the adaptive evolution and dispersal history of beaded lacewings through 170 My, achieved by dynamic strategies in niche shift and flight adaptation as responses to a changing planet.",

We observe that on average, NC and CC iron meteorites are characterized by distinct Δ 33 S (Δ 33 S NC = 0.013 ± 0.003‰; Δ 33 S CC = −0.021 ± 0.009‰; 2 SE).

In this study, we profile a cohort of patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma undergoing aPD-1 therapy using single-cell RNA sequencing, high-definition spatial transcriptomics in tumors and draining lymph nodes, and spatial immunoreceptor profiling, with long-term clinical follow-up. We find that successful responses to PD-1 inhibition are characterized by an induction of B cell receptor (BCR) clonal diversity after treatment initiation. These induced BCR clones spatially colocalize with T cell clones, facilitate their activation, and traffic alongside them between tumor and draining lymph nodes to enhance tumor clearance. Furthermore, we validated aPD-1-induced BCR diversity as a predictor of clinical response in a larger cohort of glioblastoma, melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, suggesting that this is a generalizable predictor of treatment response across many types of cancers. We find that pretreatment tumors harbor a characteristic gene expression signature that portends a higher probability of inducing BCR clonal diversity after aPD-1 therapy, and we develop a machine learning model that predicts PD-1-induced BCR clonal diversity from baseline tumor RNA sequencing. These findings underscore a dynamic role of B cell diversity during immunotherapy, highlighting its importance as a prognostic marker and a potential target for intervention in non-responders.",

However, the role of EVs in interspecies interactions and their physiological and ecological significance are not well understood. In this study, we found that Escherichia coli EVs inhibit the growth of group A Streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes ) by inducing defective cell division via the following processes. E. coli EVs first attach to the cell surface of GAS. In EV-attached GAS cells, multiple septa and Z-rings form in close proximity, which clearly differs from the typical cell division process. This is due to inhibition of peptidoglycan (PG) remodeling in the process after septum formation, in which the next cell division is initiated without completion of peripheral PG synthesis. Therefore, cell division proceeds while inducing cell elongation and cell separation failure, leading to growth inhibition. Furthermore, EV alters the expression of approximately 10% of all genes encoded on the GAS genome, and the diverse functions of these gene sets, which include replication, division, and metabolism, suggest that EVs have a variety of biological effects on the targeted bacterial cells. Notably, E. coli EVs significantly decreased the expression of genes involved in representative GAS virulence, such as slo , nga , and hasA , and also markedly attenuated the pathogenicity of GAS in mice. Our findings provide insight into the competitive functions of EVs between different bacterial species, expanding current knowledge on EV-mediated interspecies interactions.",

We have demonstrated the efficacy of a unique combination of transcription factors, including NEUROD1, and four Yamanaka reprogramming factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC), in generating glutamatergic neurons within 3 wk. This approach, which requires only five pivotal factors (NEUROD1, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC), has the potential to create functional neurons and circumvents the need for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) intermediates, as evidenced by single-cell RNA sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, along with lineage-tracing experiments using Cre-LoxP system. While fibroblasts have been widely used for neuronal reprogramming, our findings suggest that peripheral blood cells offer a potential alternative, particularly in contexts where minimally invasive sampling and procedures convenient for patients are emphasized. This method provides a rapid strategy for modeling neuronal diseases and contributes to advancements in drug discovery and personalized medicine.",

          "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is a key developmental process underlying the origination of newly evolved genes. However, rapid cell type–specific transcriptomic divergence of the Drosophila germline has posed a significant technical barrier for comparative single-cell RNA-sequencing studies. By quantifying a surprisingly strong correlation between species- and cell type–specific divergence in three closely related Drosophila species, we apply a statistical procedure to identify a core set of 198 genes that are highly predictive of cell type identity while remaining robust to species-specific differences that span over 25 to 30 My of evolution. We then utilize cell type classifications based on the 198-gene set to show how transcriptional divergence in cell type increases throughout spermatogenic developmental time. After validating these cross-species cell type classifications using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and imaging, we then investigate the influence of genome organization on the molecular evolution of spermatogenesis vis-a-vis transcriptional bursting. We first show altering transcriptional burst size contributes to premeiotic transcription and altering bursting frequency contributes to postmeiotic expression. We then report global differences in autosomal vs. X chromosomal transcription may arise in a developmental stage preceding full testis organogenesis by showing evolutionarily conserved decreases in X-linked transcription bursting kinetics in all examined somatic and germline cell types. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the cultivator model of de novo gene origination by demonstrating how the appearance of newly evolved testis-specific transcripts potentially provides short-range regulation of neighboring genes’ transcriptional bursting properties during key stages of spermatogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Many organisms employ reversible dormancy, or seedbank, in response to environmental fluctuations. This life-history strategy alters fundamental ecoevolutionary forces, leading to distinct patterns of genetic diversity. Two models of dormancy have been proposed based on the average duration of dormancy relative to coalescent timescales: weak seedbank, induced by scheduled seasonality (e.g., plants, invertebrates), and strong seedbank, where individuals stochastically switch between active and dormant states (e.g., bacteria, fungi). The weak seedbank coalescent is statistically equivalent to the Kingman coalescent with a scaled mutation rate, allowing the use of existing inference methods. In contrast, the strong seedbank coalescent differs fundamentally, as only active lineages can coalesce, while dormant lineages cannot. Additionally, dormant individuals typically mutate at a slower rate than active ones. Consequently, despite the significant role of dormancy in the ecoevolutionary dynamics of many organisms, no methods currently exist for inferring population dynamics involving dormancy and associated parameters. We present a Bayesian framework for jointly inferring a latent genealogy, seedbank parameters, and evolutionary parameters from molecular sequence data under the strong seedbank coalescent. We derive the exact probability density of genealogies sampled under the strong seedbank coalescent, characterize the corresponding likelihood function, and present efficient computational algorithms for its evaluation based on our theoretical framework. We develop a tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and implement our inference framework as a package SeedbankTree within BEAST2. Our work provides both a theoretical foundation and practical inference framework for studying the population genetic and genealogical impacts of dormancy.",

Despite the cardioprotective effects of endogenous ligand, apelin, achieving G-protein-biased agonism for therapeutic benefit poses a significant challenge. In this study, we unravel the biased signal transduction pathway mediated by a reported partial G i -protein-biased APLNR agonist CMF-019 and developed a biased chemical space remodeling approach to identify exclusive G-protein-biased agonists targeting APLNR. These agonists exhibited enhanced Gi-protein-biased function and protective effects in both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings not only enhance comprehension of APLNR-biased agonism but also establish drug design strategies for modifying and reshaping biased chemical landscapes in other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).",

          "abstract": "Tight regulation of gene expression is achieved through the coordinated action of transcription factors and cofactors that often can act as both repressors and activators in response to regulatory signals, with their activity modulated by context-specific signal transduction pathways that also impinge on their transient and cyclical recruitment to chromatin. However, the mechanisms underlying the intricate interplay between the regulatory strategies controlling cofactors’ activity and localization across subcellar domains remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of G-Protein Pathway Suppressor 2 (GPS2), a transcriptional cofactor critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis via regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, stress response, lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, and inflammation, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. By integration of biochemical assays with genome-wide RNA sequencing and Chromatin immunoprecipitation-Seq analyses, we show that nuclear GPS2 is required for licensing histone deacetylase 3 recruitment to chromatin via restricted ubiquitination by tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an E3 ubiquitin ligase previously shown to regulate the switch from repressive to activating functions of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR)/silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) complex and here unexpectedly found to translocate to the nucleus in response to IL-1β stimulation. Nuclear TRAF6 is recruited to chromatin via direct interaction with the corepressors NCoR/SMRT, and TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 2 (TAB2), a facultative component of the NCoR/SMRT complex, contributes to corepressor clearance from target regulatory regions. Together, these results reveal an exquisite mechanism for coordinating the local regulation of cofactor activity with proinflammatory signaling pathways.",

Their activation cleaves a series of inactive protease zymogens, which then activate downstream effector enzymes, ensuring a rapid response. In mosquitoes, these cascades involve clip-domain serine proteases and their noncatalytic homologs (CLIPs), whose make-up and structural organization are not fully understood. Here, we systematically assessed the contribution of individual CLIPs to humoral immunity in Anopheles gambiae , by performing gene knockdown of 85 of the 110 CLIPs in adult females and assessing their individual contribution to humoral immunity regulation. By coupling RNAi with assays measuring antimicrobial activity and melanization, we identified 27 immunoregulatory CLIPs. Only one CLIP contributed to both immune responses, thus providing evidence for largely distinct protease subnetworks controlling melanization and antimicrobial activity. CLIPs regulating antimicrobial activity were found to contribute to antimicrobial peptide expression and to control infection resistance, as knockdowns reduced bacterial load and improved survival. Furthermore, our analysis of CLIP gene expression unveiled a immunoregulatory mechanism reliant on protease baseline coexpression rather than infection-induced upregulation. Together, results from this study improve our understanding of immune system regulation by proteolysis and identify a layer of regulation that could be manipulated for mosquito control purposes.",

Additionally, rifamycins induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), a major human drug-metabolizing enzyme, further limiting their use in patients with comorbidities that require treatment with CYP3A4 substrates such as CF and HIV coinfection. We chemically reengineered rifabutin to enhance its potency against M. abscessus by blocking intrabacterial inactivation and eliminate drug–drug interactions by removing induction of CYP3A4 gene expression. We have designed and profiled a series of C25-substituted derivatives resistant to intracellular inactivation and lacking CYP3A4 induction, while retaining excellent pharmacological properties. Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis , devoid of ADP-ribosyltransferase, the frontrunners are equipotent to rifabutin, suggesting superior clinical utility since they no longer come with the drug interaction liability typical of rifamycins. Prioritized compounds demonstrated superior antibacterial activity against a panel of M. abscessus clinical isolates, were highly bactericidal against replicating and drug-tolerant nonreplicating bacteria in caseum surrogate and were active against intracellular bacteria. As single agents, these rifamycins were as effective as a standard-of-care four-drug combination in a murine model of M. abscessus lung infection.",

However, the exploration of stereoselective construction of chiral cationic complexes, particularly those induced by point chirality, has been notably limited due to the constraints posed by the type of chiral chromatographic columns and separation efficiency. To address this, we have developed a construction strategy for generating coconformational mechanically helical and topologically chiral [2]catenanes through the induction of point chirality. In this study, by adjusting the symmetry of the ligand, we have easily realized the efficient construction of high-yield crystalline coconformational mechanically helical and topologically chiral [2]catenanes. Moreover, within the enantiomerically pure chiral environment of molecular self-assembly driven by L -alanine and L -valine residues in bidentate ligands, the coconformational mechanically helical and topologically chiral [2]catenanes exist exclusively as a single enantiomer, thus eliminating the need for laborious CSP-HPLC separation from racemic mixtures. The generation of the opposite enantiomer can be realized by employing unsymmetrical ligands containing corresponding D -alanine and D -valine residues, as confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, electrospray-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, solution-state NMR spectroscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy.",

          "abstract": "Stop-loss mutations cause over twenty different diseases. The effects of stop-loss mutations can have multiple consequences that are, however, hard to predict. Stop-loss in ITM2B/BRI2 results in C-terminal extension of the encoded protein and, upon furin cleavage, in the production of two 34 amino acid long peptides, ADan and ABri, that accumulate as amyloids in the brains of patients affected by familial Danish and British Dementia. To systematically explore the consequences of Bri2 C-terminal extension, here, we use a yeast-based massively parallel assay to measure amyloid formation for 676 ADan substitutions and identify the region that forms the putative amyloid core of ADan fibrils, located between positions 20 and 26, where stop-loss occurs. Moreover, we measure amyloid formation for ~18,000 random C-terminal extensions of Bri2 and find that ~32% of these sequences can nucleate amyloids. We find that the amino acid composition of these nucleating sequences varies with peptide length and that short extensions of two specific amino acids (Aliphatics, Aromatics, and Cysteines) are sufficient to generate de novo amyloid cores. Overall, our results show that the C-terminus of Bri2 contains an incomplete amyloid motif that can turn amyloidogenic upon extension. C-terminal extension with de novo formation of amyloid motifs may thus be a widespread pathogenic mechanism resulting from stop-loss, highlighting the importance of determining the impact of these mutations for other sequences across the genome.",

Herein, to address these, we propose a synthesized dispersion engineering that compensates for higher-order wave dispersion, and considers both diffraction and refraction. This approach allows for the design of an elastic metasurface with achromatic focusing capability across an ultrabroadband range, from audible to ultrasound frequencies. By exploiting Kirchhoff–Love plate theory, we demonstrate achromatic focusing with a quasi-continuous phase profile. Additionally, we harness the amplified electrical energy generated by piezoelectric elements attached at the confocal point.

          "abstract": "Aneuploidy is observed as gains or losses of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms and is a common hallmark of cancer. Whereas models for the generation of aneuploidy in cancer invoke mitotic chromosome segregation errors, whole-arm losses might occur simply as a result of centromere breakage. We recently showed that elevated RNA Polymerase II level over the S-phase-dependent histone genes predicts rapid recurrence of human meningioma and is correlated with total whole-arm losses relative to gains. To explain this imbalance in arm losses over gains, we have proposed that histone overexpression at S-phase competes with the histone H3 variant CENP-A, resulting in centromere breaks and whole-arm losses. To test whether centromere breaks alone can drive aneuploidy, we ask whether total whole-arm aneuploids can predict outcomes across different cancer types in large RNA and whole-genome sequencing databanks. We find that total whole-arm losses generally predict outcome, suggesting that centromere breakage is a major initiating factor leading to aneuploidy and the resulting changes in the selective landscape that drive most cancers. We also present evidence that centromere breakage alone is sufficient to account for whole-arm losses and gains, contrary to mitotic spindle error models for the generation of aneuploidy. Our results suggest that therapeutic intervention targeting histone overexpression has the potential to reduce aneuploidy and slow cancer progression.",

Mechanistically, ZIP4 modulates microglial plasticity through tumor-derived extracellular vesicles carrying triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1), a process regulated by the zinc-dependent transcription factor Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 1 in GBM cells. TREM1 enhances microglial plasticity through the spleen associated tyrosine kinase-Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (SYK-PDK-STAT3) signaling axis, ultimately promoting an immune environment favorable to tumor progression. ZIP4 depletion or TREM1 inhibition attenuates tumor growth and behavioral effects in vivo by disrupting the tumor–microglia interaction.

          "abstract": "Bacteria are known to allocate their proteomes according to how fast they grow, and the allocation strategies employed strongly affect bacterial adaptation to different environments. Much of what is currently known about proteome allocation is based on extensive studies of the model organism Escherichia coli . It is not clear how much of E. coli ’s proteome allocation strategy is applicable to other species, particularly since different species can grow at vastly different rates even in the same growth condition. In this study, we investigate differences in nutrient-dependent proteome allocation programs adopted by several distantly related bacterial species, including Vibrio natriegens , one of the fastest-growing bacteria known. Extensive quantitative proteome characterization across conditions reveals an invariant allocation program in response to changing nutrients despite systemic, species-specific differences in enzyme kinetics. This invariant program is not organized according to the growth rate but is based on a common internal metric of nutrient quality after scaling away species-specific differences in enzyme kinetics, with the faster species behaving as if it is growing under a higher temperature. The flexibility of enzyme kinetics and the rigidity of proteome allocation programs across species defy common notions of evolvability and resource optimization. Our results suggest the existence of a blueprint of proteome allocation shared by diverse bacterial species, with implications on common underlying regulatory strategies. Further knowledge on the existence and organization of such phylogeny-transcending relations also promises to simplify the bottom–up description and understanding of bacterial behaviors in ecological communities.",

          "abstract": "Current genome sequencing initiatives across a wide range of life forms offer significant potential to enhance our understanding of evolutionary relationships and support transformative biological and medical applications. Species trees play a central role in many of these applications; however, despite the widespread availability of genome assemblies, accurate inference of species trees remains challenging due to the limited automation, substantial domain expertise, and computational resources required by conventional methods. To address this limitation, we present ROADIES, a fully automated pipeline to infer species trees starting from raw genome assemblies. In contrast to the prominent approach, ROADIES incorporates a unique strategy of randomly sampling segments of the input genomes to generate gene trees. This eliminates the need for predefining a set of loci, limiting the analyses to a fixed number of genes, and performing the cumbersome gene annotation and/or whole genome alignment steps. ROADIES also eliminates the need to infer orthology by leveraging existing discordance-aware methods that allow multicopy genes. Using the genomic datasets from large-scale sequencing efforts across four diverse life forms (placental mammals, pomace flies, birds, and budding yeasts), we show that ROADIES infers species trees that are comparable in quality to the state-of-the-art studies but in a fraction of the time and effort, including on challenging datasets with rampant gene tree discordance and complex polyploidy. With its speed, accuracy, and automation, ROADIES has the potential to vastly simplify species tree inference, making it accessible to a broader range of scientists and applications.",

Stiffness gradient, as a special feature evolved in reptilian adhesion systems, offers significant advantages in enhancing adhesion adaptation and stability. However, it remains a challenge to accurately replicate the geometrical morphology and soft-rigid composite properties of stiffness gradient structures, which limits the engineering applications of bioinspired adhesives. Here, a stiffness gradient adhesive structure with mushroom-shaped morphology via electrically activated one-step growth is proposed. Under the action of electric field, the liquid-phase polymer grows rheologically to realize the mushroom-shaped structural morphology, and the nanoparticles inside the polymer are aggregated toward the top by dielectrophoresis to realize the stiffness gradient distribution of rigid top and soft bottom. Due to the adaptation of the soft part to the interfacial contact and the effective inhibition of peeling by the rigid part, the proposed stiffness gradient structure improves the adhesion strength by 3 times in the parallel state and by 5 times in the nonparallel state compared to the conventional homogeneous structure. In addition, the application of adhesive structures in wall-climbing robots was demonstrated, opening an avenue for the development of dry adhesive-based devices and systems.",

          "authors": "Nicolas Lenner, Logan Chariker, Stanislas Leibler",
          "abstract": "In the common cellular space, hundreds of binding reactions occur reliably and simultaneously without disruptive mutual interference. The design principles that enable this remarkable compatibility have not yet been adequately elucidated. In order to delineate these principles, we consider the intracellular sensing of transition metals in bacteria—an integral part of cellular metal homeostasis. Protein cytosolic sensors typically interact with metals through three types of lateral chain residues, containing oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. The very existence of complete sets of mutually compatible sensors is a nontrivial problem solved by evolution, since each metal sensor has to bind to its cognate metal without being “mismetallated” by noncognate competitors. Here, based solely on theoretical considerations and limited information about binding constants for metal-amino acid interactions, we are able to predict possible “sensor compositions,” i.e., the residues forming the binding sites. We find that complete transition-metal sensor sets are severely limited in their number by compatibility requirements, leaving only a handful of possible sensor compositions for each transition metal. Our theoretical results turn out to be broadly consistent with experimental data on known bacterial sensors. If applicable to other cytosolic binding interactions, the results generated by our approach imply that compatibility requirements may play a crucial role in the organization and functioning of intracellular processes.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents pore unit assembly-discrete element model (PUA-DEM), a pore-scale hydromechanical framework that resolves interactions between mobile granular particles and multiphase fluids in unsaturated granular media. The framework uniquely integrates DEM with pore-scale hydrodynamic models to capture unsaturated flow dynamics, while leveraging a two-way coupling mechanism to ensure bidirectional fluid–grain feedback through stabilized domain partitioning. Further innovations include a dynamic pore-merging and retriangulation algorithm that enhances computational efficiency for large-scale systems. Validated against experimental data for glass beads and Ottawa sand, PUA-DEM accurately reproduces critical hydromechanical phenomena-including capillary/viscous fingering, wetting-induced granular swelling/collapse, and quasi-static deformation-under diverse saturation and loading regimes. Numerical case studies reveal how capillary forces and wetting fluid saturation collectively govern granular response, from pore-scale meniscus evolution to macroscale flow instabilities. By bridging pore- and particle-scale physics, PUA-DEM advances predictive modeling of partially saturated granular systems, offering transformative insights for geohazard mitigation, sustainable agriculture, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and energy-related engineering applications.",

          "abstract": "The term “post-truth” has been used to characterize the contemporary era . Designated as the word of the year in 2016 by the Oxford English Dictionary , “post-truth” refers to “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping political debate or public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” Authors advocate that more needs to be done to address the adverse effects of post-truth, such as misinformation , and to help people cope with it. But what exactly needs to be done? Take the science education ecosystem, for example: What are the implications for science curricula in schools and universities? How should school science teachers and university lecturers teach? One way of dealing with post-truth is to focus on the nature and importance of scientific evidence to counter proliferation of misinformation. My own research group has been investigating strategies to support evidence-based reasoning in secondary school science lessons for more than 25 years. Our work has highlighted how students’ skills in evidence-based reasoning can be supported through resources and pedagogical strategies .",

          "abstract": "Prokaryotic defense-associated reverse transcriptases (DRTs) were recently identified with antiviral functions; however, their functional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here we show that DRT9 forms a hexameric complex with its upstream non-coding RNA (ncRNA) to mediate antiphage defense by inducing cell growth arrest via abortive infection. Upon phage infection, the phage-encoded ribonucleotide reductase NrdAB complex elevates intracellular dATP levels, activating DRT9 to synthesize long, poly-A-rich single-stranded cDNA, which likely sequesters the essential phage SSB protein and disrupts phage propagation. We further determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the DRT9-ncRNA hexamer complex, providing mechanistic insights into its cDNA synthesis. These findings highlight the diversity of RT-based antiviral defense mechanisms, expand our understanding of RT biological functions, and provide a structural basis for developing DRT9-based biotechnological tools.",

Using a carcinogen-induced model of LUSC with no added genetic hits or cell type bias, we find that carcinogen exposure leads to non-neutral competition among basal cells, aberrant clonal expansions, and basal cell mobilization along the airways. Ultimately, preinvasive lesions develop from a few highly mutated clones that dominate most of the bronchial tree. Multi-site sequencing in human patients confirms the presence of clonally related preinvasive lesions across distinct airway regions. Our work identifies a transition in basal cell clonal dynamics, and an associated shift in basal cell fate, as drivers of field cancerization in the lung.",

We engineer a scalable circuit architecture based on ASE that can execute AND and OR logic and scale to an eight-input expression. We demonstrate ASE-based circuits can detect messenger RNAs with high specificity in mammalian cells via AND logic computation. The capacity of ASE-based circuits to accept messenger RNAs as inputs enables integration of endogenous cellular information for efficient multi-input information processing, demonstrated by a multi-input molecular classifier monitoring key cell reprogramming events.

          "abstract": "Since the late 20th century, an emerging atmospheric teleconnection pattern, the trans-Eurasian heatwave-drought train, has intensified remarkably during summer, correlating with a surge in concurrent heatwave-drought events from Eastern Europe to East Asia. Tree-ring proxies, spanning three centuries, reveal that the recent intensity of this pattern is unprecedented in the historical records. In contrast, the circumglobal teleconnection, which historically dominated the continental-scale Eurasian heatwave occurrences, has shown no discernible trend amid global warming. Consequently, this emerging pattern signifies a radical shift in Eurasian heatwave-drought climatologies. The mechanism involves Rossby wave propagation linked to warming sea surface temperatures in the Northwestern Atlantic and enhanced Sahel precipitation, both amplified recently by overlapping effects of anthropogenic warming and natural variability. Land-atmosphere interactions driven by soil moisture deficits further intensified the pattern regionally. Climate models predict that anthropogenic forcings will continue to strengthen the pattern throughout this century.",

In this work, we establish a unified framework for second harmonic generation in microresonators, identifying a decisive factor M that predicts the ACE limit under the nonlinear critical coupling (NCC) condition. Using this framework, we fabricate periodically poled lithium niobate microresonators and address the dispersive-dissipative suppression to approach the NCC condition. We achieve a record-high ACE of 61.3% with milliwatt-level pump powers toward the ultimate efficiency, with the potential for higher efficiency as the M factor increases.

          "abstract": "The Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc), Italy, exhibits distinct unrest patterns, including shallow seismicity following substantial strain accumulation, all within a densely populated area. Previous geophysical studies typically analyzed individual episodes, but by comparing two distinct unrest periods we identified recurring manifestations and V P / V S anomalies linked to a confined reservoir at 2- to 4-kilometer depth. Integrating rock physics experiments under hydrothermal conditions, 24 years of rainfall data, and subsurface hydrodynamics, we found increasing rainfall rates, which indicate reservoir recharge and pressurization. We show that hydrothermal water promotes caprock sealing through the formation of a fibrous microstructure. Our experiments further demonstrate that fluid accumulation rates directly influence deformation rates. Together, these processes drive gradual deformation, natural seismicity, and deepening earthquake foci. Recognizing these recurring patterns is crucial for understanding the caldera’s unrest-driving mechanism, enabling us to offer actionable insights for hazard assessment and engineering solutions, such as intercepting water upstream to prevent drainage toward Pozzuoli.",

Tumor-infiltrating CAR-IL-15 iNK cells exhibited high levels of CAR, IL-15, and NK-activating receptors, negligible checkpoint exhaustion markers, and extremely low levels of NK suppressive factors CISH , TGFBR2 , and BATF , enabling them to sustain activation, metabolic fitness, and effective tumor killing within TGF-β–rich hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

LINE-1 encodes two proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, both essential for successful retrotransposition. ORF2p has endonuclease and reverse transcription activity, while ORF1p binds RNA. Many copies of ORF1p assemble onto the LINE-1 RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensate. However, the function of these condensates in the LINE-1 life cycle remains unclear. Using reconstitution assays on DNA curtains, we show that L1 RNP condensates gain DNA binding activity only when RNA is super-saturated with ORF1p. In cells, L1 RNP condensates bind to chromosomes during mitosis. Mutational analysis reveals that DNA binding is crucial for nuclear entry and LINE-1 retrotransposition activity. Thus, a key function of ORF1p is to form an RNP condensate that gains access to the genome through DNA binding upon nuclear envelope breakdown.",

Clock interferometry, where particles with an internal clock are coherently split and recombined along two spatial paths, has sparked interest due to its fundamental implications, especially at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Here, we demonstrate that a clock interferometer provides metrological improvement compared to its technical noise–limited counterpart using a single internal quantum state. This enhancement around a critical working point can be interpreted as a geometric phase–induced signal-to-noise ratio gain. In our experimental setup, we infer a sensitivity enhancement of 8.8 decibels when measuring a small difference between external fields. We estimate that tens of decibels of sensitivity enhancement could be attained for measurements with a higher atom flux.

Here, we introduce an in-sensor multilevel image adjustment method using adjustable synaptic phototransistors, enabling the capture of well-defined images with optimal brightness and contrast suitable for achieving high-clarity contour extraction. This is enabled by emulating dopamine-mediated neuronal excitability regulation mechanisms. Electrostatic gating effect either facilitates or inhibits time-dependent photocurrent accumulation, adjusting photo-responses to varying lighting conditions. Through excitatory and inhibitory modes, the adjustable synaptic phototransistor enhances visibility of dim and bright regions, respectively, facilitating distinct contour extraction and high-accuracy semantic segmentation.

We find that scarcely investigated cellular determinants—namely, storage duration, membrane stiffness, and membrane-bound sialic acid quantity—substantially affect PACE nanoparticle adsorption efficiency. Following development of an optimized adsorption protocol, RBC hitchhiking was shown to enhance PACE nanoparticle cargo delivery to pulmonary tissue while also increasing exposure to other assayed organs.

The characterization of protactinium sulfate complexes has been limited to those in solution, which have left key details unaddressed since the 1960s. This report describes a synthetic strategy to crystallize a protactinium complex using boric acid and sulfuric acid. Herein, the authors detail the results of hydrothermal synthesis and the single-crystal analysis of a novel protactinium sulfate complex, (PaO) 2 (SO 4 ) 3 (H 2 O) 2 . This work has elucidated structural features, providing groundwork for accurate computational analysis and clarifying previously unknown details on the coordination, denticity, and binding properties of protactinium sulfate complexes.",

Proxy data from the middle to late Miocene reveal that large-scale cooling and drying occurred; however, the reasons for this climate transition remain unclear. Through a compilation of proxy data and climate simulations, our results indicate that atmospheric CO 2 decline markedly decreased the temperature and reduced the precipitation in most of the land area, while the paleogeographic changes enhanced cooling at northern high latitudes and increased precipitation in East Asia, East Africa, and South America. In comparison, vegetation changes accelerated cooling at northern high latitudes (the maximum cooling exceeded 10°C) and modulated precipitation at low- and mid-latitude continents (the maximum decrease was close to 30%). This deepens the understanding of the mechanism of the late Miocene climate transition and highlights the importance of vegetation feedbacks during global climate change.",

Here, performing scanning gate microscopy on a live superconducting NbN resonator at millikelvin temperatures, we locate individual TLS, directly revealing their microscopic nature. Mapping and visualizing the most detrimental TLS in the bath pinpoints the dominant sources of ubiquitous 1/ f dielectric noise and energy relaxation. We also deduce the three-dimensional orientation of individual TLS electric dipole moments. Combining these insights with structural information of the underlying materials can help unravel the detailed microscopic nature and chemical origin of TLS, directing targeted strategies for their eventual mitigation.",

This study focuses on the development of the pericellular matrix (PCM), a domain that directly contacts the chondrocyte and is a key regulator of biomechanical and biochemical signaling. Using three-dimensional cell culture, microfluidic cell compression platforms, and genetic mouse models, we demonstrated that collagen VI is initially assembled at the cell surface and then displaced to form a shell at the PCM-territorial matrix boundary. Cell surface–bound hyaluronan is crucial for the assembly process, and hyaluronan-aggrecan complexes drive displacement. Integrin adhesion is not required early but is crucial to determine the final placement of the collagen VI shell. Dynamic compression accelerated PCM maturation except in aggrecan mutants. Together, these findings provide key insights into the development of the mechanosensitive PCM and establish an in vitro platform to support studies of matrix biology in normal and disease models.",

Here, we found HMGB2 + CD8 + T cells as being associated with immune exhaustion and resistance to anti–PD-1 treatment through single-cell RNA sequencing. Mechanistically, HMGB2 impaired the oxidative phosphorylation in CD8 + T cells and inactivated the interferon-γ response in tumor cells, reducing the antitumor effector function. Tannic acid, a specific inhibitor of HMGB2, synergized with PD-1 antibody to attenuate tumor growth and reverse T cell exhaustion.

Structural analysis of ER-RQC intermediates revealed concomitant binding and direct interaction of the UFMylation and RQC machineries on the 60 S . In the presence of an arrested peptidyl–transfer RNA, the RQC factor NEMF and the UFM1 E3 ligase (E3 UFM1 ) form a direct interaction via the UFL1 subunit of E3 UFM1 , and UFL1 adopts a conformation distinct from that previously observed for posttermination 60 S . While this concomitant binding occurs on translocon-bound 60 S , LTN1 recruitment and arrest peptide degradation require UFMylation-dependent 60 S dissociation from the translocon.

Eleven previously reported coelacanth “muscles” are nonexistent, while three previously unknown muscle subdivisions and connections are found. These findings markedly affect our understanding of the deep-time cranial evolution of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). Only 13% of the previously identified myological evolutionary novelties for the major gnathostome lineages proved to be accurate, but several new ones are proposed. We show that low, moderate, and high levels of cranial muscle innovation characterized the emergence of lobe-finned (sarcopterygian), cartilaginous (chondrichthyan), and ray-finned (actinopterygian) fishes, respectively. The novelties in the latter group resulted in the evolution of a second active mechanism for the expansion of the oropharyngeal cavity, which was probably crucial for the predominance of suction feeding versus bite feeding in extant actinopterygians.",

Exploiting the strong SAW SBS gain, we demonstrate a narrowband internal net gain amplifier overcoming propagation losses. In addition, we achieve a stimulated Brillouin laser in TFLN, featuring a tuning range exceeding 20 nanometers and enabling high-purity radio frequency signal generation with an intrinsic linewidth of 9 hertz. Furthermore, we develop a programmable, multifunctional integrated Brillouin microwave photonic processor capable of notch filtering, bandpass filtering, or true time delay.

The presence of an opening makes it less constrained, more deformable, and easier to morph, as demonstrated by several studies on open-surface morphing across patterns, materials, and scales. Here, we present a platform to morph closed surfaces with bistability that harnesses a balanced integration of origami and kirigami principles. By harmonizing panel rotation around creases nearly tangent to the closed surface and panel rotation around hinges nearly perpendicular to the closed surface, we show that origami-kirigami assemblages can shape-morph between a cube and a sphere, scale between spheres of dissimilar size, and change topology between a sphere and a torus, with programmed bistability. The framework offers a promising strategy for designing bistable reconfigurable structures and metamaterials with enclosed configurations.",

We developed a methodological pipeline that integrates supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to rigorously quantify astrocyte morphological features and spatial organization across the brain, leveraging expression of cytoskeletal markers. Application of this pipeline reveals that morphological characteristics of individual astrocytes predict their location within the NAc. Our analysis also indicates that after heroin use, astrocyte structural plasticity is impaired in portions of the NAc associated with the extinction of conditioned responses and is uniquely engaged in the dorsomedial portion of the NAc shell, an undercharacterized subdivision of the structure.",

High-throughput sequencing and biochemical analysis showed that most of the selected 1331 RNA sequences required at least one DNA for activity. Representatives for four of six RNA clusters that depended on DNA cofactors were active even when the 256 DNAs were replaced by completely random DNA 20-nucleotide oligomers.

The collapse of this species in the rocky intertidal revealed an unexpected relationship between two keystone predators. In this study, we show how the loss of Pisaster along the Monterey Peninsula, CA, USA led to an increase in mussel ( Mytilus californianus ) size and expansion into lower tidal zones. Before the sea star wasting event, the local sea otter population fluctuated around a near equilibrium. However, in the absence of Pisaster , sea otters increased their dietary intake on mussels, which contributed in part to a local population-level rise.

Viral escape drives restriction factors to evolve rapidly at virus-binding interfaces to regain defense. Here, we explore how antiviral proteins balance restricting many viruses with evolving specificity against individual viruses. Human MxA uses its rapidly evolving loop L4 as the specificity determinant for orthomyxoviruses such as thogotovirus (THOV) and influenza (IAV). Previous combinatorial mutagenesis of rapidly evolving residues in human MxA loop L4 identified THOV “super-restrictors” and suggested an antiviral breadth-specificity trade-off. Using a modified combinatorial mutagenesis strategy, we find super-restrictor MxA variants specific to H5N1 IAV. A single L4 residue underlies the MxA breadth-specificity trade-off. However, rare “generalist” super-restrictors or a heterozygous combination of more common “specialist” super-restrictors can overcome the breadth-specificity trade-off. Our findings suggest that at least two strategies enable restriction factors such as MxA to increase their restriction of diverse viruses to overcome breadth-specificity trade-offs, which might be pervasive in host-virus conflicts.",

Readily available aryl iodides, alkyl/aryl bromides, and propargyl esters are used as the distinct electrophilic coupling partners, leading to the synthesis of a diverse array of tetrasubstituted allenes. In particular, the challenging asymmetric formal triple XEC has also been realized through palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis, which uses the sterically hindered 2,6-disubstituted aryl bromides as the arylating reagents to prepare tetrasubstituted allenes bearing an axially chiral biaryl unit.

          "abstract": "Arterial thrombosis is commonly accompanied by poor recanalization and high recurrence, typically caused by a fibrinolysis-resistant microenvironment. We identify elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor–1 (PAI-1) and, notably, its strong correlation with inflammation in arterial thrombosis. To address this, small molecular inhibitors of PAI-1 and inflammation are used as bioregulators to restore vascular homeostasis. We design a carrier-free supramolecular system based on the bioregulators-tuned self-assembly of a near-infrared thrombus probe, which preferentially forms protein corona in situ to enhance plasma stability. Under acidic conditions and increased shear stress, the supramolecular assemblies disintegrate, enabling site-specific cargo release. In vivo, the probe accumulates 22.8-fold more in the thrombotic than contralateral artery. Functionally, this nanomedicine improves outcomes in mice with carotid artery thrombosis and chronic cerebral ischemia. Mechanistically, it down-regulates NF-κB signaling, inhibits NETosis and glycolysis, and up-regulates cGMP-mediated signaling, thereby alleviating inflammation and promoting fibrinolysis. This study offers an innovative codelivery strategy using supramolecular assemblies to advance therapies for arterial thrombosis.",

However, the precise structure of their polyamide selective layer under hydrated conditions and its relationship to membrane transport remain poorly understood. Using cryo–electron tomography, we successfully reconstructed the three-dimensional structure of six commercial polyamide membranes under hydrated conditions, revealing a fully swollen nodular network. The highly heterogeneous nodules, measuring 17.2 ± 2.8 nanometer in thickness, were directly connected to the pores of the underlying polysulfone substrate. The nodules occupied most of the surface area compared to the 75.9 ± 26.8-nanometer-thick dense layer of the polyamide film. Key structural parameters of the nodules, including surface area index and wall thickness, were correlated with the water permeance of an additional 16 polyamide membranes, validating the major role of these nodules in water transport. This study enhances our understanding of the heterogeneous structure of desalination membranes and its role in membrane transport.",

We explored how DOM generated from a bloom-forming, centric diatom, infected with taxonomically distinct viruses—a single-stranded (ss) DNA and a ssRNA virus—impacted microbial processing of organic matter. DOM derived from uninfected and ssDNA virus–infected cultures supported growth in bacterial isolates and a mixed assemblage. In contrast, DOM from ssRNA virus infection did not stimulate growth, but rather induced ectoproteolytic activity, suggesting this DOM was less bioavailable. Exoprotease activity was also substantially higher in ssRNA virus–infected cellular exudates compared to ssDNA virus–infected and uninfected cultures. This suggests that DOM produced through virus-mediated host lysis does not a priori support secondary production and implicate ssRNA virus infection as a source of proteolytic activity in the water column, highlighting a multifaceted role for viruses in altering microbial utilization and remineralization length scales of organic matter in the ocean.",

A new high-resolution body size dataset covering 2435 species from 1091 genera of Cambrian and Ordovician trilobites reveals that body size evolution changes episodically, with three marked reductions in size. Such a pattern rules out a persistent Cope’s rule dynamic. Rather, we find a strong temporal link between body size changes and major fluctuations in marine redox, supporting the hypothesis that marine oxygen levels exerted a primary control on the tempo and mode of trilobite body size evolution.

There is extensive evidence of pathogen modulation of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, endosomes, lysosomes, and nucleus.

Here, we demonstrate that Legionella actively recruits peroxisomes to its replication vacuole using a secreted bacterial effector protein. Defects in peroxisome metabolic function restrict expansion of the Legionella vacuole membrane and cause rupture of this compartment, inhibiting bacterial replication and leading to bacterial degradation. Similarly, peroxisome dysfunction causes Salmonella replication vacuole destabilization and reduced bacterial burden within host cells. Thus, these two intracellular bacterial pathogens exploit host cell peroxisomes to maintain their replication compartments, establishing a critical role for this organelle in disease.",

We identified several significantly differentially expressed genes, with CCL2 displaying the strongest association with 3-repeat tau pathology and increased burden in PiD compared to those in 4-repeat tau progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cases. Investigation of co-expressed genes and pathways suggested the involvement of mRNA processing, mitochondrial function, and immune processes in disease pathobiology.

In early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, impaired metabolism and functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex strongly predict future cognitive impairments. Therefore, understanding Alzheimer’s disease–related deficits in the retrosplenial cortex is critical for understanding the origins of cognitive impairment and identifying early treatment targets. Using the 5xFAD mouse model, we discovered early, sex-dependent alterations in parvalbumin-interneuron transcriptomic profiles. This corresponded with impaired parvalbumin-interneuron activity, which was sufficient to induce cognitive impairments and dysregulate retrosplenial functional connectivity. In fMRI scans from patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, we observed a similar sex-dependent dysregulation of retrosplenial cortex functional connectivity and, in postmortem tissue from subjects with Alzheimer’s disease, a loss of parvalbumin interneurons. Reversal of cognitive deficits by stimulation of parvalbumin interneurons in the retrosplenial cortex suggests that this may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy.",

PFR is particularly useful for inspecting centimeter-scale pipeline systems with varying diameters and shapes, which pose substantial challenges. Although recent soft robots using smart materials offer advantages, difficulties remain in handling different pipe sizes, navigating transitions, and managing fluid flow. PFR’s inflatable soft skin is equipped with flexible spikes that create asymmetrical friction under vibrations, propelling the robot forward without feedback control. Its hollow structure allows fluid flow, while a front-mounted camera enhances inspection capabilities. PFR adapts to various pipeline conditions, navigating cavities 1 to 1.5 times its diameter and critical areas such as 90° elbows, T-connectors, and high-curvature sections. In specific scenarios, PFR can generate a propulsive force 20 to 35 times its weight.",

The RITH phenotypes highly correlated with prognosis and pathological ITH. In addition, through an integrated multi-omics analysis, we uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying RITH, notably enhancing its biological interpretability. Specifically, high-RITH tumors demonstrated an enrichment of cancer-associated fibroblasts and activation of extracellular matrix remodeling. Our approach facilitates the noninvasive refined classification of ITH using radiomics and multi-omics, paving the way for tailored treatment strategies in HCC.

Volcanic plume gas measurements are often interpreted assuming that magmatic gases are chemically inert on emission and near-source dilution in air. Conversely, many volcanic plumes contain high levels of bromine monoxide (BrO), which is produced by atmospheric oxidation of magmatic hydrogen bromide (HBr) emissions. We investigate the chemical kinetics of hot magmatic gases mixing with air. Our model reproduces and explains observations of volcanic plume BrO at Mt. Etna, evidencing that reduced gases [HBr, as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2 )] can oxidize at the hot magma–air interface. The extent of oxidation is controlled by the magmatic gas temperature. Observations of BrO and H 2 in Mt.

The amplitude of the observed distribution is smaller than predicted for maximally quantum entangled two-photon states but larger than expected for separable photons.

Our study investigates neurotransmitter modulation of ACOD1 expression, a regulator of immunometabolism activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Screening neurotransmitters identifies dopamine as a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced ACOD1 expression in innate immune cells. Mechanistically, DRD2 forms a complex with TLR4, initiating MAPK3-dependent CREB1 phosphorylation and subsequent ACOD1 transcription. Conversely, dopamine disrupts TLR4-MYD88 interaction via DRD2 without affecting the formation of the LPS-induced TLR4-MD2-CD14 complex. Enhanced ACOD1 expression induces CD274/PD-L1 production independently of itaconate, precipitating inflammation-associated immunosuppression in sepsis. Delayed administration of pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, mitigates lethality in bacterial sepsis mouse models. Conversely, the dopamine antagonist aripiprazole exacerbates sepsis mortality. Dysregulation of the dopamine-ACOD1 axis correlates with sepsis severity in patients, indicating a potential therapeutic target for modulating this neuroimmune pathway.",

CHIP was associated with prevalent RA in 10,089 FINRISK study participants with whole-exome sequencing (OR, 2.06; P  = 0.029) and in the FinnGen cohort ( n  = 520,210; OR, 1.49; P  &lt; 0.001) using single-nucleotide polymorphism array–based CHIP annotation. In FinnGen, CHIP was also associated with inferior overall survival in participants with RA ( P  = 0.013). In newly diagnosed RA ( n  = 573), DNMT3A -mutated seropositive patients had increased inflammatory markers and disease activity compared with patients without CHIP. In contrast, TET2 mutations were enriched in seronegative RA ( P  = 0.009). Our findings provide further evidence for the context-dependent association between CHIP and inflammation, with potential therapeutic implications.",

Usually, high sensitivity depends on expensive instruments and sophisticated procedures, making sensitivity contradict affordability and simplicity. Here, we proposed an ultra-sensitive single-tube biosensor (USTB) where users can visually detect targets by observing the liquid motion state in a glass tube. The developed instrument-free USTB performed low-cost ($0.1), fast (1 min), and ultra-sensitive detection for both the DNA/RNA fragments (≤1 aM) and the clinical positive samples, which commercial reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR kits could not effectively recognize. Furthermore, USTB is promising to be easily applied to detect other-type biomarkers by the designed smart sensing unit.",

          "abstract": "Marine calcifying organisms precipitate their shells either in equilibrium with seawater or under strict biological control. Here, we show that these two options represent two ends of a spectrum. In species with a more “closed” system, rates of H + removal and Ca 2+ uptake are high and exceed the amount of ions required for calcification. This explains the relatively low Mg/Ca of the calcite of this species by dilution of the [Mg 2+ ] in the calcifying fluid. Conversely, in species with a more open system, the H + and Ca 2+ fluxes are lower, with more seawater exchanged between the environment and calcifying fluid, explaining the relatively high Mg/Ca in these foraminifera. In either of these species, mitochondria were found to be located at the site where the Ca 2+ /H + exchange takes place and the mitochondrial density aligned with the rate of pumping. These findings highlight the crucial role of transmembrane transporters and mitochondria in foraminifera calcification and explain the species-specific elemental signatures.",

Despite extensive research, Early Cretaceous cryosphere responses to temperature and atmospheric P CO 2 fluctuations over short, human, timescales remain uncertain. Here, we show rapid late Valanginian (~133 million years ago) seasonal fluctuations in sea surface temperature (SST) and δ 18 O mainly driven by atmospheric P CO 2 . Two distinctive features emerge: large seasonal variability of up to 15.9° ± 4.9°C in Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, comparable to that found today, a positive sea surface δ 18 O value related to evaporation (expressed as salinity increases), and the existence of polar ice. Model-predicted patterns of SST change match with high statistical confidence those derived from clumped isotopes in well-preserved oyster fossils from Madagascar and display consistent warm/cold seasonality. Given its relative coolness in a Cretaceous context, the late Valanginian is a valuable analog for Earth’s future climate.",

Diffusion tensor images from five perfusion-fixed (in skull) specimens were acquired at 15 micrometers, the highest resolution ever reported. Diffusion tensor imaging yields multiple 3D volumes, each of which highlights unique cytoarchitecture. The averages were mapped into micro–computed tomography of the mouse skull to create external landmarks (bregma and lambda). Light sheet images of the same brains were coregistered, providing cell maps in the same stereotaxic space. The Allen Reference Atlas was registered to the volume to correct the geometric distortion in that atlas and bring it into the stereotaxic space.

Herein, we develop a scalable polymer-involved biomimetic assembly that responds to intracerebral reactive oxygen species (ROS) for elastic spreading and concentration-dependent drug therapy. Structurally, a polymer of thermally sensitive deformation is selected for hydrophobic loading of curcumin (Cur) and coordinative grafting onto ultrasmall ceria (CeO 2 ) by elastic compression at transition temperature, which is further sealed by self-polymerized dopamine with apolipoprotein decoration to improve intracerebral shuttling. When triggered by ROS in the lesions, burst exposure of Cur and polymer-linked CeO 2 (PCeO 2 ) is achieved. The concentrated Cur switches amyloid-β (Aβ)–activated microglia into normal for mobilizing phagocytosis, and CeO 2 has sustainable antioxidant capacity to prevent microglial mitochondrial damage after phagocytosis of PCeO 2 -captured Aβ. After administration, our findings reveal microglia-mediated Aβ clearance, neuroprotection, and ROS elimination in AD mice. Collectively, this biomimetic assembly provides a promising approach in AD treatments.",

However, the nonuniformity issue of the memristors renders the practical deployment of in-memory computing hardware complex, requiring peripheral circuits to ensure the accuracy of scientific computing, thereby resulting in increased power consumption. Here, we present a mortise-tenon–shaped (MTS) memristor with ultrahigh uniformity by introducing a mortise-shaped h-BN flake on the HfO 2 switching layer. The MTS memristor exhibits ultrasmall cycle-to-cycle (~2.5%) and device-to-device (~6.9%) variations compared to the HfO 2 memristor without the MTS structure. Furthermore, we use the MTS memristors to build a partial differential equation solver and demonstrate a convergence speed of solving the Poisson equation five times faster than the solver based on the traditional HfO 2 memristors. This work provides a promising approach for notably reducing the hardware resources required for fast and high-accuracy scientific computing.",

The prevailing mechanical approach is locally induced flexoelectricity with large strain gradients. However, this approach usually requires huge mechanical forces, which greatly impede device applications. Here, we report an approach of using triboelectric effect to mechanically, reversibly switch ferroelectric polarization across α-In 2 Se 3 ferroelectric memristors. Through contact electrification and electrostatic induction effects, triboelectric units are used to sensitively detect mechanical forces and generate electrical voltage pulses to trigger α-In 2 Se 3 resistance switching. We realize multilevel resistance states under different mechanical forces, by which a neuromorphic stress system is demonstrated. Notably, we achieve the reversal of α-In 2 Se 3 ferroelectric polarization with a record-low mechanical force of ~10 kilopascals and even with tactile touches. Our work provides a fundamental but pragmatic strategy for creating mechanical tactile ferroelectric memory devices.",

Activation of such modes and interactions might influence conformational rearrangements and energy transport within the phycobilisome system.

A de Bruijn tiling like theoretical framework was built elucidating the formation mechanism of spin quasicrystals for diverse symmetries. Moreover, the configurations of these spin textures can be manipulated through the adjustments of the wavefronts, among which phason-like discontinuous dynamics is observed and quantitatively measured. Unlike optical quasicrystals shaped by electromagnetic fields, these spin-governed quasicrystals exhibit quasi-periodic properties of kinematic parameters, extending their potential applications to other physical systems.

Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of herding and nonherding breeds reveals signatures of positive selection associated with pathways underlying social interaction and cognitive functions. Of the strong selective sweep signals, haplotypes within ephrin type-B receptor 1 ( EPHB1 ), which is linked to locomotor hyperactivity and spatial memory, show evidence of segregation within breed lineages for the conformation versus working lines of border collies and introgression with a genetically and geographically distant herding breed of Entlebucher mountain dogs. We show that a working line–specific haplotype of EPHB1 is associated with elevated levels of chase-bite motor patterns based on a well-validated behavior survey. These findings indicate that functional selection has shaped the genetic architecture of herding breeds, which may relate to their proficiency in addressing diverse tasks and challenges in maintaining control over the herd.",

We establish a model system to investigate telomere phage biology by isolating the virions of telomere phages and infecting naïve strains to create isogenic lines with and without a phage. We find that only a small set of telomere phage proteins is expressed in phage-host cells, including a toxin—the telocin—that kills other Klebsiella strains. We identify and validate a set of telocins in the genomes of other prevalent Klebsiella telomere phages. Thus, telomere phages are widespread elements encoding diverse antibacterial weapons and we discuss the prospect of using telocins for precision editing of microbial populations.",

For some experimental conditions, Hamming codes are efficient in encoding the highest possible number of genes for spatial analysis. However, for most experimental parameters, the optimal generation of error-robust codebooks is an unsolved mathematical problem. Here, we present a method to generate highly optimized extended Hamming codebooks compatible with established error-correctable methodologies such as MERFISH. Our method uses an iterative set-exchange approach and generally reaches over 90% of the theoretical maximum limit of gene set complexity.
