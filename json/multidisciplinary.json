          "abstract": "The ocean is essential for humanity1,2,3. Yet, inequity in ocean-based activities is widespread and accelerating4,5,6,7,8. Addressing this requires governance approaches that can systematically measure equity and track progress9. Here we present the Ocean Equity Index (OEI)—a framework for assessing and improving equity in ocean initiatives, projects and policies. We apply the index, which scores twelve criteria, to case studies at local, national and global scales. We show that the OEI can generate structured data to support evidence-based decision-making across ocean sectors and scales. As a theoretically robust and widely applicable tool, the OEI can guide the design of more equitable ocean initiatives, projects or policies, ensuring better outcomes for coastal people and marine ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "The implications of climate change for malaria eradication this century remain poorly resolved1,2. Many studies focus on parasite and vector ecology in isolation, neglecting the interactions between climate, malaria control and the socioeconomic environment, including disruption from extreme weather3,4. Here we integrate 25 years of African data on climate, malaria burden and control, socioeconomic factors, and extreme weather. Using a geotemporal model linked to an ensemble of climate projections under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 (SSP 2-4.5) scenario5, we estimate the future impact of climate change on malaria burden in Africa, including both ecological and disruptive effects. Our findings indicate that climate change could lead to 123 million (projection range 49.5 million to 203 million) additional malaria cases and 532,000 (195,000–912,000) additional deaths in Africa between 2024 and 2050 under current control levels. Contrary to the prevailing focus on ecological mechanisms, extreme weather events emerge as the primary driver of increased risk, accounting for 79% (50–94%) of additional cases and 93% (70–100%) of additional deaths. Most increases stem from intensification in existing endemic areas rather than range expansion, with significant regional variation in impact. These results highlight the urgent need for climate-resilient malaria control strategies and robust emergency response systems to safeguard progress towards malaria eradication.",

          "abstract": "Two decades of genetic studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have identified more than 100 genes harbouring rare risk mutations 1–13 . Despite this substantial heterogeneity, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses have identified convergent patterns of dysregulation across the ASD postmortem brain 14,15–17 . To identify shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD-linked mutations, we assembled a large patient collection of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells, consisting of 70 hiPS cell lines after stringent quality control representing 8 ASD-associated mutations, idiopathic ASD, and 20 lines from non-affected control individuals. Here we used these hiPS cell lines to generate human cortical organoids, profiling by RNA sequencing at four distinct time points up to 100 days after in vitro differentiation. Early time points harboured the largest mutation-specific changes, but different mutations converged on shared transcriptional changes as development progressed. We identified a shared RNA and protein interaction network, which was enriched in ASD risk genes and predicted to drive the observed downstream changes in gene expression. CRISPR–Cas9 screening of these candidate transcriptional regulators in induced human neural progenitors validated their downstream convergent molecular effects. These data illustrate how risk associated with genetically defined forms of ASD can propagate by means of transcriptional regulation to affect convergently dysregulated pathways, providing new insight into the convergent impact of ASD genetic risk on human neurodevelopment.",

          "abstract": "Optical amplifiers are fundamental to modern photonics, enabling long-distance communications1, precision sensing2,3 and quantum information processing4,5. Erbium-doped amplifiers dominate telecommunications but are restricted to specific wavelength bands1,6, whereas semiconductor amplifiers offer broader coverage but suffer from high noise and nonlinear distortions7. Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) promise broadband, quantum-limited amplification across arbitrary wavelengths8. However, their miniaturization and deployment have been hampered by watt-level power requirements. Here we demonstrate an integrated OPA on thin-film lithium niobate that achieves >17 dB gain with <200 mW input power—an order of magnitude improvement over previous demonstrations. Our second-harmonic-resonant design enhances both pump generation efficiency (95% conversion) and pump power utilization through recirculation, without sacrificing bandwidth. The resonant architecture increases the effective pump power by nearly an order of magnitude compared with conventional single-pass designs, while also multiplexing the signal and pump. We demonstrate flat near-quantum-limited noise performance over 110 nm. Our low-power architecture enables practical on-chip OPAs for next-generation quantum and classical photonics.",

          "abstract": "Ultralight axion particles are candidates for dark matter1, conjectured to form stable, macroscopic field configurations in three-dimensional space, resulting in the possible formation of topological defect dark matter2,3,4 (TDM). Exploring their possible existence through a realistic parameter space requires considering interactions that extend beyond the constraints imposed by astrophysical observations of stellar cooling processes5. Here we report the outcome of an experiment that monitors possible transient rotations of polarized spins, which could be induced by the interaction with topological defects, carried out by correlating five noble-gas laboratory set-ups located in two cities. Amplification and optimal noise filtering in hyperpolarized noble-gas spins greatly enhance the sensitivity to TDM-induced spin rotations, reaching approximately 10−6 rad. Through this, we set constraints on the axion–nucleon coupling across an axion mass range from 10 peV to 0.2 μeV, achieving 4.1 × 1010 GeV at 84 peV. These values exceed known constraints imposed by astrophysical observations, although these are obtained under different model assumptions. Our approach could further stimulate broad beyond-Standard Model physics searches, such as transient axion waves, axion stars, axion strings and Q-balls.",

However, owing to the severe irradiation effects of space energetic particles, the implementation of radiation-tolerant electronic circuits remains a challenge4,5,6. Here we report the observation of the space radiation effect on a satellite-based device and find that atomically thin materials are expected to accumulate minimal radiation-induced damage in principle. Accordingly, on the basis of a 4-inch wafer-scale monolayer 2D MoS2 process, we implement an atomic-layer transistor-based radiation-tolerant radio frequency (RF, 12–18 GHz) system with both transmitters and receivers for spaceborne communication. For on-orbit experiments, the 2D communication system was successfully launched to the approximately 517 km low Earth orbit. Notably, the system maintains a bit error rate (BER) of less than 10−8 in the transmitted data after 9 months of on-orbit operation, indicating substantial radiation tolerance and long stability. The lifespan of the 2D communication system is predicted to be about 271 years even on the geosynchronous orbit with a much harsher radiation environment. This work showcases the unique prospects of 2D electronics for spaceborne applications.",

          "abstract": "Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, 100–200 nm) light sources are crucial for advanced spectroscopy, quantum research and semiconductor lithography1,2,3. Compared with conventional large-scale VUV generation technologies4,5,6,7, second-harmonic generation (SHG) through nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals8,9,10 is the simplest and most efficient method. However, the scarcity of suitable NLO crystals has constrained the production of VUV light through SHG: existing materials fail to meet phase-matching requirements, suffer from low conversion efficiency or have severe growth limitations11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. In this study, we report the development of the fluorooxoborate crystal NH4B4O6F (abbreviated as ABF) as a promising material for VUV light generation. VUV devices with specific phase-matching angles were constructed, achieving a record 158.9-nm light through phase-matching SHG and a maximum nanosecond pulse energy of 4.8 mJ at 177.3 nm with a conversion efficiency of 5.9%. The enhanced NLO performance is attributed to optimized arrangements of fluorine-based units creating asymmetric sublattices. This work provides further material in the NLO field, with potential for applications in compact, high-power VUV lasers using ABF.",

          "abstract": "Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron correlations, is an interesting topic with broad scientific and technological impact1,2,3,4. Twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2) is a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI)5,6,7,8,9,10, exhibiting the fractionally quantized anomalous Hall effect11,12,13,14. As the chirality of the edge states and sign of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic polarization15,16, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the Chern insulator (CI)/FCI states. Here we demonstrate control of ferromagnetic polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states, by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe2. At low excitation power, we achieve on-demand preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, that is, electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable ferromagnetic states under helicity-selective optical pumping. With increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature17,18. Both optical training and direct switching are most effective near CI and FCI states, which we attribute to a gap-enhanced valley polarization of optically pumped holes. The magnetization can be dynamically switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved measurements further demonstrate optical writing of ferromagnetic, and thus CI (or FCI) domains. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological spintronics, quantum memories and creation of exotic edge states by programmable patterning of integer and fractionally quantized anomalous Hall domains4,19.",

          "abstract": "Time-dependent drives hold promise for realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems1,2,3. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems4,5, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives6,7. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Here, using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by n-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is ‘doubly tunable’: one way by driving frequency, the other way by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent 2n + 1. Using quantum-state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a two-dimensional configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.",

Decades before the onset of motor symptoms, patients with PD suffer from constipation and present with circulating T cells responsive to αS, suggesting that peripheral immune responses initiated in the ENS may be involved in the early stages of PD1,5,6,7. However, cellular mechanisms that trigger αS pathology in the ENS and its spread along the gut–brain axis remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that muscularis macrophages (ME-Macs), housekeepers of ENS integrity and intestinal homeostasis, modulate αS pathology and neurodegeneration in models of PD8,9. ME-Macs contain misfolded αS, adopt a signature reflecting endolysosomal dysfunction and modulate the expansion of T cells that travel from the ENS to the brain through the dura mater as αS pathology progresses. Directed ME-Mac depletion leads to reduced αS pathology in the ENS and central nervous system, prevents T cell expansion and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction, suggesting a role for ME-Macs as early cellular initiators of αS pathology along the gut–brain axis. Understanding these mechanisms could pave the way for early-stage biomarkers in PD.",

          "abstract": "Most bacterial pathogens are polylysogens, harbouring multiple vertically transmitted prophages1,2,3. These prophages enhance bacterial pathogenicity and survival by encoding virulence factors and anti-phage defence systems while retaining the capacity for horizontal transfer. Thus, prophage-encoded anti-phage defences must block propagation of external phages without inhibiting the spread of the prophages that encode them. Here we identify HepS—an abortive infection system encoded on the Gifsy-1 prophage constituted of a single HEPN domain protein—which restricts phages of the Siphoviridae family. We demonstrate that in its native host context of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, HepS both senses phage infection and enacts abortive infection. Structures of HepS reveal a tetrameric nuclease complex that undergoes allosteric activation upon recognition of Siphoviridae tail tip proteins during production of new phage particles. Once activated, HepS cleaves specific transfer RNA anticodon loops and arrests phage replication. Gifsy-1, a Siphoviridae itself, evades self-targeting by expressing a tail tip variant that does not trigger HepS, as do co-resident Siphoviridae prophages Gifsy-2 and Gifsy-3. This evasion permits Gifsy-1 to spread despite encoding HepS. These findings reveal a mechanism by which a prophage defends the host while maintaining its propagation abilities.",

          "abstract": "The Stoner–Wohlfarth antiferromagnet (AFM), an extension of the classical Stoner–Wohlfarth model originally describing the magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic nanoparticles1,2, refers to a single-domain AFM whose Néel vector can be coherently switched by the magnetic field. These AFMs not only retain the inherent advantages of antiferromagnetism but also feature controllable Néel vector and a perfect switching ratio, thus emerging as promising building blocks for ultradense magnetic memories and high-throughput computing systems3,4. However, bulk AFMs are not the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs owing to the hard-to-switch Néel vector and inevitable multidomain structure3,5,6,7. Here we report that CrPS4, a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) A-type AFM, exhibits ideal characteristics of the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs, because of the dominance of antiferromagnetic exchange over the magnetic anisotropy and high quality of vdW interfaces. The antiferromagnetic order undergoes a ferromagnet (FM)-like binary switching with the magnetic field rather than the layer-by-layer flipping observed in other 2D A-type AFMs. Moreover, we deduce the characteristic exchange length of several vdW A-type AFMs and propose a criterion for judging the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs. Our work therefore establishes a universal framework for understanding the magnetization reversal in layered AFMs and promotes the effective use of 2D AFMs in advanced spintronic devices.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotic genome replication is surveyed by the S-phase checkpoint, which coordinates sequential origin activation to prevent the exhaustion of poorly defined, rate-limiting replisome components 1–3 . Here we show that excessive origin firing saturates chromatin-bound proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)—a sliding clamp for DNA polymerase processivity and Okazaki fragment processing 4 —thereby restricting further PCNA loading and lagging-strand synthesis when checkpoint control is lost. PCNA-associated factor 15 (PAF15) emerges as a dosage-sensitive regulator of this process 5–9 . During unperturbed S phase, the entire soluble PAF15 pool binds to chromatin, leaving no reserve to stabilize PCNA under conditions of excessive origin activation. PAF15 binds to PCNA specifically on the lagging strand through a high-affinity PIP motif and occupies the DNA-encircling channel, protecting the clamp and associated enzymes from premature unloading by the ATAD5–RFC complex. Conversely, overexpression of PAF15 or forced redistribution to the leading strand disrupts replisome progression and induces cell death. These detrimental effects are mitigated by Timeless–Claspin, which blocks PAF15–PCNA binding on the leading strand. E2F4-mediated repression fine-tunes PAF15 expression to ensure optimal dosage and strand specificity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized replisome constraint: when PAF15–PCNA assemblies are exhausted, the S-phase checkpoint globally restricts origin activation, linking a strand-specific rate-limiting mechanism to global replication dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Cambrian Burgess Shale-type (BST) fossil biotas document nearly complete snapshots of the oldest Phanerozoic marine ecosystems1,2,3,4. However, the rarity of deposits bearing high-diversity BST biotas5 has restricted our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of the Cambrian explosion. Here we report the Huayuan biota—a lower Cambrian (Stage 4, approximately 512 million years ago) BST Lagerstätte from an outer shelf, deep-water setting of the Yangtze Block in Hunan, South China. The Huayuan biota yields remarkable taxonomic richness, comprising 153 animal species of 16 phylum-level clades dominated by arthropods, poriferans and cnidarians, among which 59% of species are new. The biota is comprised overwhelmingly of soft-bodied forms that include preserved cellular tissues. The complex ecosystem contained diverse radiodonts and pelagic tunicates, filling a gap of high-diversity BST biotas from the Cambrian Stage 4. Critically, multivariate ordination based on a global dataset of Cambrian BST biotas places the Huayuan biota within a main transition of marine animal ecosystems between Cambrian Age 3 and Age 4. Network analysis reveals close faunal connections between the Huayuan and Burgess Shale biotas, indicating transoceanic dispersal. Dated shortly after the Sinsk event6,7,8, the Huayuan biota illuminates differences in the impacts of this extinction in shallow- versus deep-water settings during the first Phanerozoic mass extinction and offers critical insights into the transformation of global ecosystems in the early Cambrian.",

          "abstract": "Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve more than 90% accuracy on popular benchmarks such as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding1, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. Here, in response, we introduce Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be an expert-level closed-ended academic benchmark with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 2,500 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable but cannot be quickly answered by internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a marked gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.",

The imprints of these processes on gas kinematics remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of energy conversion within clusters4. High-resolution spectral mapping with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observatory5 offers a way forward6,7. Here we present XRISM kinematic measurements of the Perseus cluster, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner approximately 60 kpc, probably associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, SMBH feedback drives gas motions, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could have a substantial role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources to robustly characterize the velocity fields and their role in the evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for SMBH feedback models.",

          "abstract": "The invention of the laser transformed optics by providing intense, coherent light in the visible region, but extending this concept to X-rays has been hindered by a lack of suitable gain media and mirrors. Current hard X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facilities 1–5 overcome this by amplifying shot noise from a high-peak-current electron bunch via self-amplified spontaneous emission 6 in a single pass through long undulators, delivering very high brightness but with a noisy, multi-spiked temporal and spectral profile. Cavity-based XFELs (CBXFELs) 7–9 were proposed to close this gap by recirculating spectrally filtered X-ray pulses in a Bragg-reflecting cavity synchronized to a high-repetition-rate electron beam. Here we show lasing with multi-pass gain at 6.952 keV in a 132.8-m round-trip diamond-based Bragg cavity 10 at the European XFEL, matched to the 2.23-MHz bunch spacing of the superconducting accelerator 5 . Under stringent length and angular stability requirements, a ring-up in the cavity across successive bunches was observed, producing spectrally pure, microjoule-level pulses. This establishes the feasibility of CBXFELs in an accelerator environment and validates diamond Bragg optics for X-ray resonators. The demonstrated spectral purity opens a path to next-generation X-ray science, which demands highly coherent, stable sources.",

          "abstract": "During infection, many RNA viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), form specialized biomolecular condensates, viral factories (VFs), where viral transcription and replication occur1,2. Paradoxically, high protein concentrations are typically required for condensate nucleation3, yet attaining sufficient protein levels in infection is thought to require VFs for viral transcription and replication. Here, to uncover how viruses solve this paradox to establish VFs, we visualized early infection of RSV in real time with single genomic viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) resolution. Our results reveal that VFs are nucleated from infecting vRNPs rather than de novo in the cytoplasm. VF nucleation further requires in-virion pre-assembly of viral protein–protein interaction networks on vRNPs to form ‘pre-replication centres’ (PRCs). PRCs are potent condensate nucleation seeds due to their efficient recruitment and retention of viral proteins. The high affinity of PRCs also results in increased association of the viral polymerase and its co-factors, allowing efficient viral transcription even in the absence of VFs. Together, these activities create a feed-forward loop that drives rapid VF formation. PRC assembly depends on in-virion viral protein levels and is highly heterogeneous among virions, explaining cell-to-cell heterogeneity in infection progression, and identifying heterogeneous virions as an important origin of infection heterogeneity. Together, our results show that in-virion pre-assembly of PRCs kick-starts viral condensate nucleation upon host-cell entry and explains cell-to-cell heterogeneity in RSV infection.",

Here we introduce a universal 3D microfabrication/nanofabrication strategy compatible with a broad range of materials by precisely manipulating optofluidic interactions within a confined 3D space, enabling the creation of volumetric, free-form 3D microstructures/nanostructures. A femtosecond-laser-induced heating spot generates a localized thermal gradient, providing precise spatiotemporal control over optofluidic interactions of the nanoparticle-laden dispersions. This enables the rapid and highly localized assembly of nanoparticles with diverse shapes and compositions—including metals, metal oxides, carbon nanomaterials and quantum dots—into complex 3D microstructures. To demonstrate its versatility, we fabricate multifunctional microdevices, such as 3D microfluidic valves with size-selective sieving functionality, achieving fast separation of microparticles/nanoparticles with distinct dimensions, as well as microrobots integrated with four distinct functional materials, achieving multimodal locomotion powered by different external stimuli.

          "abstract": "Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure1. Studying their progenitors, protoclusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. However, detecting protoclusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization2,3,4. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations located several protocluster candidates by identifying overdensities of z ≳ 5 galaxies5,6,7,8,9. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a protocluster, JADES-ID1, at z ≈ 5.68, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of \\({L}_{{\\rm{bol}}}=(1.{5}_{-0.6}^{+0.5})\\times 1{0}^{44}\\,{\\rm{erg}}\\,{{\\rm{s}}}^{-1}\\) and infer a total gravitating mass of \\({M}_{500}=(1.{8}_{-0.7}^{+0.6})\\times 1{0}^{13}\\,{M}_{\\odot }\\), making this system a progenitor of today’s most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as z ≈ 5.7. Also, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely10, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict.",

Although primary infection is often subclinical, persistent EBV infection can drive immune dysregulation and long-term complications. Despite the ubiquity of infection, the determinants of EBV persistence following primary exposure remain poorly understood, although human genetic variation partially contributes to this phenotypic spectrum 1–3 . Here we demonstrate that existing whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of human populations can be used to quantify persistent EBV DNA. Using WGS and health record data from the UK Biobank ( n = 490,560) and All of Us ( n = 245,394), we uncover reproducible associations between blood-derived EBV DNA quantifications and respiratory, autoimmune, neurological and cardiovascular diseases. We evaluate genetic determinants of persistent EBV DNA via genome association studies, revealing heritability enrichment in immune-associated regulatory regions and protein-altering variants in 148 genes. Single-cell and pathway level analyses of these loci implicate variable antigen processing as a primary determinant of EBV DNA persistence. Further, relevant gene programs were enriched in B cells and antigen-presenting cells, consistent with their roles in viral reservoir and clearance. Human leukocyte antigen genotyping and predicted viral epitope presentation affinities implicate major histocompatibility complex class II variation as a key modulator of EBV persistence. Together, our analyses demonstrate how re-analysis of human population-scale WGS data can elucidate the genetic architecture of viral DNA persistence, a framework generalizable to the broader human virome 4 .",

Here we functionally examined how the cortical song premotor region HVC, which is necessary for zebra finch song1, controls the sequential production of learned song syllables. We found that HVC could generate the complete sequence of learned song syllables independently of its main synaptic input pathways. Thalamic input to HVC was needed for song initiation, but it was not required for transitions between syllables or for song completion. We showed that excitation of HVC neurons during song reliably caused vocalizations to skip back to the beginning of the song, in a manner reminiscent of a skipping record. This restarting of syllable sequences could be induced at any moment of the song and relied on local circuits within HVC. We identified and computationally modelled a synaptic network, including intratelencephalic premotor and corticostriatal neurons within HVC that are essential for completing song syllable sequences. Together, our results show that the learned zebra finch song is controlled by a cortical sequence-generating network in HVC that, once started, can sustain production of all song syllables independent of major extrinsic input pathways. Thus, sequential neuronal activity can be organized to fuse well-learned vocal motor sequences, ultimately achieving holistic control of this naturally learned behaviour.",

However, how HSPGs mechanistically mediate signalling at the cell surface—particularly in the context of cell surface RNA—remain poorly understood. During developmental and disease processes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), a heparan sulfate-binding factor, regulates endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis3. The regulatory paradigm for endothelial cell-mediated selectively of VEGF-A binding and activity has largely been focused on understanding the selective sulfation of the anionic heparan sulfate chains4,5,6,7,8. Here we examine the organizational rules of a new class of anionic cell surface conjugates, glycoRNAs9,10, and cell surface RNA-binding proteins (csRBPs11,12). Leveraging genome-scale knockout screens, we discovered that heparan sulfate biosynthesis and specifically the 6-O-sulfated forms of heparan sulfate chains are critical for the assembly of clusters of glycoRNAs and csRBPs (cell surface ribonucleoproteins (csRNPs)). Mechanistically, we show that these clusters antagonize heparan sulfate-mediated activation of ERK signalling downstream of VEGF-A. We demonstrate that the heparan sulfate-binding domain of VEGF-A165 is responsible for binding RNA, and that disrupting this interaction enhances ERK signalling and impairs vascular development both in vitro and in vivo and is conserved across species. Our study thus uncovers a previously unrecognized regulatory axis by which csRNPs negatively modulate heparan sulfate-mediated signalling in the context of angiogenesis driven by VEGF-A.",

The superfluid phase has been observed in wide-ranging bosonic systems spanning naturally occurring quantum fluids, such as liquid helium, to engineered platforms such as bilayer excitons and cold atom systems1,2,3,4. Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid—termed a supersolid5,6,7,8. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained unknown9,10,11. Here we report observation of a superfluid-to-insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magnetoexcitons. Mapping the transport behaviour of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid on increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low-temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase.",

The roles of arterial baroreceptors in systemic physiology are well appreciated2, but the functions of vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors have been more difficult to parse, in part due to the closed-loop structure of the cardiovascular system. Here we use genetic tools in mice to identify a small group of neurons that are acutely sensitive to circulating blood volume and initiate a reflex that compensates for decreased filling of the heart in an upright posture and haemorrhage. Vagal PIEZO2 neurons form characteristic end-net endings in the heart, lower blood pressure in response to optogenetic stimulation and display blood-volume-dependent responses with every heartbeat that are time-locked to atrial and ventricular systole. Knockout of Piezo2 and/or ablation of PIEZO2 neurons in vagal ganglia eliminates this heartbeat-coupled nerve activity, causes orthostatic hypotension and compromises cardiovascular stability during trauma-induced blood loss. Together, these findings demonstrate that vagal mechanoreceptors monitor the cardiac cycle and initiate a blood-volume-dependent reflex that defends the constancy of circulation.",

Despite major theoretical, experimental, and computational advances in characterizing short- and medium-range order9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24, quantitative determination of complete 3D atomic arrangements in amorphous materials remains experimentally demanding. Atomic electron tomography (AET) now provides a pathway to direct 3D atomic mapping in these materials25,26,27. Here we present a quantitative analysis of AET, showing how robust image preprocessing, denoising, projection alignment and normalization, advanced tomographic reconstruction, atom tracing, elemental classification and atomic position refinement collectively enable reliable determination of 3D atomic coordinates and elemental identities in amorphous materials. Using multislice-simulated datasets of amorphous Si, SiGeSn and CoPdPt nanoparticles under varying noise levels, our workflow outperforms an alternative approach28 in both positional precision and classification accuracy. For CoPdPt, we identify 95.1% of Co, 99.0% of Pd and 100% of Pt atoms, with corresponding 3D positional precisions of 29 pm, 12 pm and 6 pm, respectively, under realistic dose conditions. These results establish practical guidelines and quantitative benchmarks for achieving accurate AET of non-crystalline materials, and the underlying framework can be broadly applied to other tomographic imaging modalities for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction.",

The human organic solute transporter αβ (OSTα–OSTβ; hereafter referred to as OSTα/β) is a BA transporter that has a key role in the secretion and distribution of BAs3,4,5,6. Pathogenic mutations in OSTα/β have been associated with cholestasis7,8. Despite the functional importance of OSTα/β in BA homeostasis, the stoichiometry and assembly of the complex and the molecular mechanism that underlies BA transport by OSTα/β remain unknown. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human OSTα/β in complex with cholesterols and an endogenous substrate, elucidating the structural basis for the function of OSTα/β. OSTα/β is assembled in a novel dimer-of-heterodimers manner: two OSTα units form the homodimeric core, with two OSTβ units bound to the periphery. OSTα adopts the G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) fold and contains a unique cysteine-rich loop with seven palmitoylation sites; these cooperate with transmembrane helices 5 and 6, constituting a BA recognition site. A positive cavity in OSTα connects the BA site and facilitates the transmembrane translocation of BAs through OSTα/β. Together, this study reveals the architecture and transport mechanism of OSTα/β and provides insights into the structure–function relationships of this crucial transporter in BA homeostasis.",

Taking advantage of inherent low sensitivity of a nuclear transition to its environment9, orders of magnitude more emitters can be hosted in a solid-state crystal compared with current optical lattice atomic clocks10. Furthermore, solid-state systems needing only simple thermal control11 are key to the development of field-deployable compact clocks. Here we explore and characterize the frequency reproducibility of the 229Th:CaF2 nuclear clock transition, a key performance metric for all clocks. We measure the transition linewidth and centre frequency as a function of the doping concentration, temperature and time. We report the concentration-dependent inhomogeneous linewidth of the nuclear transition, limited by the intrinsic host crystal12 properties. We determine an optimal working temperature for the 229Th:CaF2 nuclear clock at 196(5) K, at which the first-order thermal sensitivity vanishes. This would enable in situ temperature co-sensing using different quadrupole-split lines, reducing the temperature-induced systematic shift below the 10−18 fractional frequency uncertainty level. At 195 K, the reproducibility of the nuclear transition frequency is 220 Hz (fractionally 1.1 × 10−13) for two differently doped 229Th:CaF2 crystals over 7 months. These results form the foundation for understanding, controlling and harnessing the coherent nuclear excitation of 229Th in solid-state hosts and for their applications in constraining temporal variations of fundamental constants.",

High- T c materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model—a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice—is believed to capture the essential physics of high- T c materials 1–5 , obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging 6 . The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moiré WSe 2 (refs. 7,8 ), in which low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable 9–11 , presents a new platform for studying the high- T c problem. Here we tune moiré WSe 2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moiré unit cell ( ν = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high- T c phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at ν = 1, superconducting domes on electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states such as strange metals 12–14 . Twist-angle dependence studies further show that the highest T c always occurs adjacent to the Mott transition 3,15 . Our results indicate strong correlation as the key to superconductivity in moiré WSe 2 and establish a new material system for studying high- T c superconductivity in a controllable manner.",

          "abstract": "Early development across vertebrates and insects critically relies on robustly reorganizing the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs into individualized cells 1,2 . This intricate process is orchestrated by large microtubule structures that traverse the embryo, partitioning the cytoplasm into physically distinct and stable compartments 3,4 . Here, despite the robustness of embryonic development, we uncover an intrinsic instability in cytoplasmic partitioning driven by the microtubule cytoskeleton. By combining experiments in cytoplasmic extract and in vivo, we reveal that embryos circumvent this instability through two distinct mechanisms: either by matching the cell-cycle duration to the time needed for the instability to unfold or by limiting microtubule nucleation. These regulatory mechanisms give rise to two possible strategies to fill the cytoplasm, which we experimentally demonstrate in zebrafish and Drosophila embryos, respectively. In zebrafish embryos, unstable microtubule waves fill the geometry of the entire embryo from the first division. Conversely, in Drosophila embryos, stable microtubule asters resulting from reduced microtubule nucleation gradually fill the cytoplasm throughout multiple divisions. Our results indicate that the temporal control of microtubule dynamics could have driven the evolutionary emergence of species-specific mechanisms for effective cytoplasmic organization. Furthermore, our study unveils a fundamental synergy between physical instabilities and biological clocks, uncovering universal strategies for rapid, robust and efficient spatial ordering in biological systems.",

Here we introduce the cavity-array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements26,27, and instead uses a free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses28,29 to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micrometre-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom-array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom–cavity coupling and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including through a fibre array as a proof of principle for networking applications30. As an outlook, we realize a next-generation iteration of the platform with over 500 cavities and a nearly 10-fold improvement in finesse.

In this context, a recent report describing the three-dimensional structure determination of an amorphous solid using atomic-resolution electron tomography (AET) is truly remarkable3. If validated, such an analysis would be groundbreaking. Here we address this issue and investigate whether and when AET can identify all or most atoms in an amorphous nanoparticle. By simulating AET, we reveal limitations on the structural and chemical information AET can determine from noisy electron images. For monoatomic nanoparticles, the structure can be determined with an atomic-position accuracy of tens of picometres under stringent fluence, sampling and projection requirements. For multi-element amorphous nanoparticles, chemical identification resolution is determined by noise and experimental sampling. Heavier atoms are more easily resolved than lighter ones, and large chemical analysis uncertainties emerge when atomic peak and background intensities overlap. Using these insights, we delineate nanoparticle size, composition, electron fluence and image sampling requirements for AET. The results serve as a benchmark for future experiment design and demonstrate a viable approach for amorphous structure determination validation using AET.",

The allergic state is typified by the presence of allergen-reactive immunoglobulin E (IgE), which triggers mast cell degranulation upon allergen encounter, manifesting in pruritis, oedema and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis. Over the past century, the prevalence of allergic diseases has increased markedly, suggesting that environmental rather than genetic factors are mediating this change 2 . Although many hypotheses connecting environment to allergy exist 3–6 , the biological mechanisms that underpin environmentally mediated protection from allergy are unknown. Here we show, using a mouse model of allergic disease, that exposure to immunostimulatory environments generated cross-reactive adaptive immune memory, which tracked with obstructed type II immune responses upon allergen exposure. We found that engagement of cross-reactive adaptive immunity protected against future allergic sensitization and suppressed established allergic responses. Cross-reactivity in a tolerogenic context also prevented allergy, with the effect extending across antigenically complex exposures even at low protein sequence similarity. Our findings demonstrate a mechanistic relationship between environment and allergy, with general implications for adaptive immune function in natural settings.",

The organic solute transporter Ostα/β, essential for bile acid efflux in enterohepatic circulation3, has long defied mechanistic elucidation. Here we present cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human Ostα/β in apo and substrate-bound states at 2.6–3.1 Å resolution, revealing a distinctive membrane protein architecture that defines a new transporter class. Ostα/β forms a symmetric tetramer of heterodimers, with each Ostα subunit showing a new seven-transmembrane fold, augmented by a single transmembrane helix of Ostβ. This architecture is stabilized by extensive lipid modifications, including a palmitoylated cysteine-rich motif that forms a lateral substrate-binding groove. The structures uncover a unique transport pathway featuring two substrate-binding sites connected by an amphipathic helix-gated conduit. This design, conserved in the evolutionarily related TMEM184 family, suggests an ancient mechanism for substrate translocation. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate voltage-sensitive, bidirectional transport driven by electrochemical gradients, elucidating the efflux role of Ostα/β in vivo. Lipid interactions, notably palmitoylation-dependent trafficking, emerge as critical for stability and function. These findings clarify the molecular mechanism of Ostα/β, provide a structural basis for disease-associated mutations4,5 and establish a paradigm for lipid-modified membrane transport.",

          "abstract": "Deep learning models that predict functional genomic measurements from DNA sequences are powerful tools for deciphering the genetic regulatory code. Existing methods involve a trade-off between input sequence length and prediction resolution, thereby limiting their modality scope and performance 1–5 . We present AlphaGenome, a unified DNA sequence model, which takes as input 1 Mb of DNA sequence and predicts thousands of functional genomic tracks up to single-base-pair resolution across diverse modalities. The modalities include gene expression, transcription initiation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, chromatin contact maps, splice site usage and splice junction coordinates and strength. Trained on human and mouse genomes, AlphaGenome matches or exceeds the strongest available external models in 25 of 26 evaluations of variant effect prediction. The ability of AlphaGenome to simultaneously score variant effects across all modalities accurately recapitulates the mechanisms of clinically relevant variants near the TAL1 oncogene 6 . To facilitate broader use, we provide tools for making genome track and variant effect predictions from sequence.",

          "abstract": "Effort is costly: given a choice, we tend to avoid it1. However, in many cases, effort adds value to the ensuing rewards2. From ants3 to humans4, individuals prefer rewards that had been harder to achieve. This counterintuitive process may promote reward seeking even in resource-poor environments, thus enhancing evolutionary fitness5. Despite its ubiquity, the neural mechanisms supporting this behavioural effect are poorly understood. Here we show that effort amplifies the dopamine response to an otherwise identical reward, and this amplification depends on local modulation of dopamine axons by acetylcholine. High-effort rewards evoke rapid acetylcholine release from local interneurons in the nucleus accumbens. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic receptors on dopamine axon terminals to augment dopamine release when reward is delivered. Blocking the cholinergic modulation blunts dopamine release selectively in high-effort contexts, impairing effortful behaviour while leaving low-effort reward consumption intact. These results reconcile in vitro studies, which have long demonstrated that acetylcholine can trigger dopamine release directly through dopamine axons6,7,8,9,10,11, with in vivo studies that failed to observe such modulation12,13,14, but did not examine high-effort contexts. Our findings uncover a mechanism that drives effortful behaviour through context-dependent local interactions between acetylcholine and dopamine axons.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary personality assessment relies heavily on psychometric scales, which offer efficiency but risk oversimplifying the rich and contextual nature of personality. Recognizing these limitations, this study explores the use of commercially available generative large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Claude and so on, to assess personality traits from open-ended qualitative narratives. Across two distinct samples and methodologies (spontaneous streams of thought and daily video diaries), we used seven commercial, generative LLMs to score Big-Five personality traits, achieving convergence with self-report measures comparable to or exceeding established benchmarks (for example, self–other agreement, ecological momentary assessment, and bespoke machine learning models). Although results differed across different LLMs, we found that using the average LLM score across models provided the strongest agreement with self-report. Further, LLM-generated trait scores also demonstrated predictive validity regarding daily behaviours and mental health outcomes. This LLM-based approach achieved quantitative rigour based on qualitative data and is easily accessible without specialized training. Importantly, our findings also reaffirm that personality is expressed ubiquitously, in that it is carried in the stream of our thoughts and is woven into the fabric of our daily lives. These results encourage broader adoption of generative LLMs for psychological assessment and—given the new generation of tools—stress the value of idiographic narratives as reliable sources of psychological insight.",

          "abstract": "Although the distinction between episodic and semantic memory is supported by numerous neuropsychological studies, neuroimaging data have shown considerable overlap between regions that are activated during semantic and episodic remembering. This might indicate similar or shared mechanisms but might also result from inadequate task designs or poor functional magnetic resonance imaging signal coverage. Here we compared neural activations and representations associated with successful retrieval of episodic and semantic memories, using tasks that are more closely matched. A total of n = 40 participants recalled pairings between logos and brand names, where the pairings corresponded to real-world knowledge (semantic task) or were learned in an initial study phase (episodic task). Neither a priori-defined networks nor clusters generally activated by our task provided evidence for any difference between successful semantic and episodic retrieval, with the Bayes factor for the a priori networks supporting the null hypothesis of no difference.

Here, to characterize mammalian information-processing architecture, we combine functional neuroimaging and anaesthesia in humans, macaques, marmosets and mice. We show that breakdown of information integration is a convergent effect of diverse anaesthetics across mammalian species. As the system disintegrates, brain dynamics become more difficult to control. Both effects are reversed upon re-awakening induced by thalamic deep-brain stimulation in the macaque. Regional breakdown of integrated information coincides with the species-specific spatial topography of PVALB/Pvalb gene expression. To provide mechanistic insight beyond correlation, we develop computational models for humans, macaques and mice that integrate species-specific connectivity and transcriptomic gradients, demonstrating their respective roles for controlling brain dynamics and information integration. We reveal evolutionarily conserved controllers of information integration in the mammalian brain.",

          "abstract": "In light of continued foreign interference in the US presidential elections, where undisclosed digital voter suppression advertising has been deployed, this study addresses the questions of who is exposed to these ads and whether and how such exposure influences voter turnout. Using a sample that resembles the US voting-age population, the study directly measures each individual’s ad exposure through a user-level real-time ad tracking tool, which is merged with the same individual’s survey responses to identify voter suppression content and its targeting patterns. By further matching individual-level exposure to voter suppression ads with the same individual’s verified voter turnout records, the study estimates the effects of voter suppression on actual turnout. The study findings from the 2016 US Presidential Election reveal clear geo-racial targeting patterns in voter suppression: non-Whites residing in the racial minority counties of battleground states were exposed to substantially more voter suppression ads than their counterparts. Moreover, exposure to voter suppression ads was associated with decreases in voter turnout at the population level, albeit small. The sharpest declines were observed among non-Whites residing in minority counties of battleground states, suggesting that the intensified turnout suppression among the targeted segments of the electorate may have played a role in shaping turnout.",

          "authors": "Xiaomin Wang, Christian Hilbe, Boyu Zhang",
          "abstract": "When people collaborate in groups, they routinely face collective action problems: for the group effort to succeed, individuals need to cooperate despite any incentives to defect. These problems can be modeled with public goods games. To facilitate such an analysis, many studies assume the game is symmetric. Group members have the same means to cooperate (equal endowments), and contributions of different group members are equally effective (equal productivities). Studies that allow for some inequality tend to focus on one kind of inequality only. In practice, however, people can be unequal in many ways. The effect of these inequalities may in turn depend on the specific public goods game considered. To explore these issues, we combine a large-sample experiment with extensive theoretical work. We systematically vary four aspects: the group members’ endowments, their productivities, group size, and whether the public goods game exhibits linear returns or returns given by a threshold function. By exploring all four aspects, we obtain a unique dataset to explore the effect of asymmetry on cooperation. Based on this dataset, we study whether there is an advantage of “aligned inequality”: whether groups achieve a better surplus if more productive individuals have a larger endowment. For public goods games with linear returns, we find such an advantage, thereby corroborating previous research. If returns follow a threshold function, however, aligned inequality results in inferior payoffs. These results show that the effect of inequality on cooperation depends on the kind of public goods game considered.",

          "authors": "Wesley Binder, Joel S. Ruprecht, Jack Rabe, Matthew C. Metz, Rebecca Hutchinson, Daniel R. Stahler, Taal Levi",
          "abstract": "After widespread extirpation, conservation efforts have restored large carnivores to portions of their former range. Substantial research has since focused on their ability to alter ecological communities through effects on herbivores and mesocarnivores, but the principles governing competition among multiple apex carnivores remain unclear. While mesocarnivore scavenging of apex carnivore kills drive “enemies with benefits” dynamics, subordinate apex carnivores seldom rely on scavenging. Instead, they proficiently hunt prey themselves that dominant apex carnivores can steal, fundamentally altering the dynamics of their interactions. We used 9 y of contemporaneous GPS telemetry and 3,929 potential kill site investigations from a reconstituted community of sympatric wolves and cougars in Yellowstone National Park to test whether such apex–apex dynamics instead follow an “enemies without benefits” framework. Wolf movement and resource selection were strongly linked to cougar kills, resulting in carcass theft (i.e., kleptoparasitism) that drove their interactions and led to cougar mortalities. In contrast, cougars avoided wolf kills, were tied to escape terrain, and did not kill wolves, producing an asymmetric dynamic that persisted across distinct seasonal contexts. However, as elk (the shared primary prey) declined longitudinally, cougars shifted their diets to smaller-bodied deer that were kleptoparasitized by wolves at one-sixth the rate of elk kills. Our findings demonstrate that prey diversity and landscape structure are critical for subordinate apex carnivores who experience severe interference competition from their dominant counterparts. This dynamic extends trophic theory and provides a framework for predicting the coexistence outcomes of carnivore restoration and the ongoing recolonization of wolves.",

          "abstract": "Our adaptive immune system relies on the persistence over long times of a diverse set of antigen-experienced B cells to encode our memories of past infections and to protect us against future ones. While longitudinal repertoire sequencing promises to track the long-term dynamics of many B cell clones simultaneously, sampling and experimental noise make it hard to draw reliable quantitative conclusions. Leveraging statistical inference, we infer the dynamics of memory B cell clonal dynamics and conversion to plasmablasts, which includes clone creation, degradation, abundance fluctuations, and differentiation. We find that memory B cell clones degrade slowly, with a half-life of 10 y. Based on the inferred parameters, we predict that it takes about 50 y to renew 50% of the repertoire, with most observed clones surviving for a lifetime. We infer that, on average, 1 out of 100 memory B cells differentiates into a plasmablast each year, more than expected from purely antigen-stimulated differentiation, and that plasmablast clones degrade with a half-life of about one year in the absence of memory imports. Our method is general and could be applied to other longitudinal repertoire sequencing B cell subsets.",

While electrochemical lithium extraction using LiMn 2 O 4 (LMO) holds great promise, its practical application is hindered by mechanical degradation caused by anisotropic volume changes and stress accumulation during cycling. Herein, we present an entropy-driven amphiphilic self-assembly strategy that engineers stress-homogenized multilayer core–shell architectures, which innovatively mitigates stress accumulation by tuning the internal geometric structure to optimize stress–strain behavior, thereby synergistically enhancing ion distribution, transport kinetics, and electrochemical stability. This hierarchical interlayer architecture ensures uniform Li + distribution and redistributes internal stresses, mitigating localized stress concentrations and lattice expansion to preserve structural integrity throughout cycling. The optimized LMO establishes a dual benchmark for both capacity and cycling stability in hybrid capacitive deionization, achieving a remarkable lithium extraction capacity of 4.78 mmol g −1 with 96% retention over 100 cycles, outperforming both its unoptimized counterpart and other reported materials of the same type. Finite element simulations further elucidate a 48% reduction in maximum stress compared to disordered counterparts, underscoring the critical coupling between ion diffusion and stress evolution. This paradigm provides a pathway for developing advanced materials with intrinsically stable architectures for sustainable lithium extraction.",

          "abstract": "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is characterized by a variety of specific genetic alterations that impact signaling pathway dependencies and therapeutic outcomes. Among the recurrently mutated genes, we identified RHOA , a member of the small GTPase family, as a selective dependency in DLBCL. Here, we show that RHOA function is essential for the survival of ABC DLBCL cells because it sustains oncogenic B cell receptor (BCR) signaling through maintaining a signaling-permissive conformation of the cortical actin network. This enables the formation of active BCR microclusters at the cell surface, ultimately resulting in constitutive, BCR-driven NF-κB survival signaling. Moreover, we found that RHOA controlled endocytosis of the BCR and thereby the assembly of the endolysosomal My–T–BCR multiprotein complex, a central activator of NF-κB consisting of MYD88, Toll-like receptor 9, and the internalized BCR. The recurrent DLBCL-associated RHOA R5W mutation rendered RHOA constitutively active in its GTP-bound state and changed the conformation of the actin network from primarily filamentous actin to globular actin. This altered actin state led to an increase in BCR microcluster formation, amplification of NF-κB signaling, and resistance to inhibitors targeting chronic active BCR signaling. Hence, our study establishes RHOA and its mutant isoforms as critical regulators of oncogenic BCR signaling in DLBCL.",

In human sAC, two charged residues coordinate HCO 3 − and are essential for HCO 3 − -mediated activation. In contrast, pH-regulated sACs and orthologs from 13 phyla have these residues replaced by neutral ones. These substitutions abolish the enzyme’s responsiveness to HCO 3 − and suggest that pH regulation of sAC is widespread in nonmammalian metazoans. Furthermore, we show that in sea urchin sperm, a rise of pH during spawning stimulates cAMP synthesis, a key step in the activation of motility. An evolutionarily significant pattern is emerging: Across phyla, sAC regulation by pH or HCO 3 − represents an adaptation to environments with low or high HCO 3 − , respectively.",

While previous work has shown that membrane-bound organelles regulate metabolic activities and that membrane-less condensates conduct metabolic reactions, the coordination between these two organizations remains unaddressed. By using a combination of proximity labeling, superresolution fluorescence microscopy, and metabolite analyses using isotopic tracing, we investigated the relationships between these metabolic hotspots. Here, we show that nutrient deficiency elongates mitochondria and transforms the ER from a tubular to sheet-like morphology, coinciding with increased mitochondrial respiration and inosine 5′-monophosphate levels. These structural changes promote the colocalization of purinosomes with these organelles, enhancing metabolic channeling. Disruption of ER sheet formation via MTM1 knockout destabilizes purinosomes, impairs substrate channeling, and reduces intracellular purine nucleotide pools without altering enzyme expression. Our findings reveal that organelle morphology and interorganelle contacts dynamically regulate the assembly and function of metabolic condensates, providing a structural basis for coordinated metabolic control in response to nutrient availability.",

However, how the high diversity of bumblebees in the QTP evolved and contributed to their diversification in adjacent and far-reaching regions remains unclear. Here, we explored this question using a widespread bumblebee species, Bombus pyrosoma . Phylogenomic analysis revealed a history of dispersal out of the QTP and distinct lineage divergence along elevations within the species. Four major chromosomal inversion variants were identified, and shifts in their frequency with altitude were consistent with patterns of lineage divergence. The highland bumblebees showed stronger metabolic robustness and better flight performance under cold environments, whereas lowland ones excelled under warm conditions. Forty-one percent of the positively selected genes were located in the inversion regions and were mostly associated with fatty acid metabolism and information processing. Mutation with a strong candidate gene, elovl6 , possibly modulated long-chain fatty acid elongation, which facilitated bumblebee flight under thermal stress. Finally, genomic inversion analyses across 22 bumblebee species–17 native to the QTP–corroborate the widespread involvement of inversions in the elevational diversification of bumblebees. Overall, our findings revealed that chromosomal inversions play a pivotal role in facilitating local adaptation and dispersal out of the QTP in a bumblebee, providing insights into the genomic underpinnings of bumblebees’ diversification.",

Here, we develop a microscopic theory of LMC in layered quantum materials and identify how it is controlled by a “layer-space” quantum geometry. Focusing on rhombohedral multilayer graphene systems, we find that the interplay between LMC and valley-polarized order produces a butterfly shaped magnetic hysteresis controlled by out-of-plane electric field: a signature of LMC and a multiferroic valley order. Furthermore, we identify a nonlinear LMC in rhombohedral multilayer graphene under time-reversal symmetry, while the absence of centrosymmetry enables the generation of a second-order nonlinear electric dipole moment in response to an out-of-plane magnetic field. Our theoretical framework provides a quantitative understanding of LMC, as well as the emergent magnetoelectric properties of rhombohedral multilayer graphene.",

Here, we identify specific sensory adaptations associated with the emergence of predatory feeding behaviors in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus. While Caenorhabditis elegans uses contact-dependent sensing primarily to avoid threats, P. pacificus has co-opted this modality to support both avoidance and prey detection, enabling context-dependent predatory behavior. To uncover a potential mechanism underlying the evolution of P. pacificus prey perception, we mutated 27 canonical mechanosensory genes and assessed their function using behavioral assays, automated behavioral tracking, and a machine learning analysis of behavioral states. While several mutants showed mechanosensory defects, Ppa-mec-6 mutants specifically also impaired prey detection, indicating the emergence of a mechanosensory module linked to predatory behavior. Furthermore, disrupting both mechanosensation alongside chemosensation revealed a synergistic influence for these modalities. Crucially, Ppa-mec-6 is expressed in the environmentally exposed IL2 neurons that represent the first point of predator–prey contact. Moreover, silencing Ppa-mec-6 expressing cells induced severe predation defects validating their importance for prey sensing. Thus, predation evolved through the co-option of mechanosensory and chemosensory systems that act together to shape the evolution of complex behavioral traits.",

          "abstract": "Granular materials densify under repeated mechanical perturbations, nonequilibrium dynamics that underlies many natural and industrial processes. Because granular relaxation is governed by frictional contacts and energy dissipation, this aging behavior fundamentally differs from that of thermal glasses despite their apparent similarities. Here, we uncover how friction controls the compaction dynamics of granular packings subjected to quasistatic cyclic shear. Using discrete element simulations, we construct a dynamic state diagram as a function of strain amplitude and friction, revealing a rich interplay among jamming marginality, stabilization, and fluidization. We identify a friction-dependent crossover strain that separates aging and fluidized regimes, showing reentrant, nonmonotonic behavior: Increasing friction first suppresses fluidization but then promotes it through smooth, creep-like rearrangements. This transition is marked by a shift from intermittent, avalanche-like rearrangements to continuous, diffusive motion. Our findings demonstrate that friction exerts a dual role in granular aging—both stabilizing and fluidizing—thereby uncovering the fundamental nonequilibrium mechanisms that govern compaction, rheology, and aging in athermal disordered systems. More broadly, our results reveal a general principle for how friction governs metastability and flow in athermal matter—from granular and frictional colloids to soils and seismic faults—linking microscopic contact mechanics to macroscopic dynamics.",

However, their long-term fates and collective impacts on ecosystem nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and carbon (C) sequestration remain unresolved. Here, using a decade-long paired labeling ( 15 NH 4 + and 15 NO 3 − ) experiment in a temperate forest, we demonstrate that initially distinct fates of different N forms converged within 2 y due to low initial loss rates prior to organic incorporation. After 10 y, overall ecosystem retention was remarkably similar (55.3 to 65.6%) for both N forms. A process -based N-cycling model was built and parameterized by our 15 N recovery data and the model predicted declining ecosystem NUE with increasing N deposition level. We further identified a deposition-induced C sequestration potential of 41.41 kg C kg −1 N under an incremental deposition of 10 kg N ha −1 y −1 , exceeding prior estimates at comparable loads. This study provides mechanistic, high-resolution temporal data critical for refining N-cycle models and reveals an optimal N deposition range (20 to 30 kg N ha −1 y −1 ) that maximizes C sequestration while minimizing environmental risks (e.g., nutrient imbalance, eutrophication) in temperate forests.",

The evolutionary transition from homo- to hetero-oligomers by gene duplication and chain specialization is widespread, yet it entails challenging requirements for maintaining oligomerization and functionality. Chain specialization in ferritins, which occurs in bacteria, vertebrates, and plants, is a salient example of this phenomenon. In heteroferritins, the two essential functions, ferroxidase activity and electron transfer, are split between two specialized chain types. Many heteroferritins assemble into complexes with variable subunit ratios, implying the existence of assembly rules that balance compositional flexibility with structural constraints. Here, we identify the assembly rules governing the organization of the heterobacterioferritin from Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense (MSR-1 Bfr) by analyzing its cryo-EM reconstructions. These rules consist of structural constraints that limit the number of possible arrangements and promote juxtaposition of the two, now separated functions. These constraints support compositional flexibility while preserving function, thereby providing resilience to stochastic variation in oligomer stoichiometry. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the assembly rules identified in MSR-1 Bfr are widespread across the Bfr family and coevolved with chain specialization. Together, these findings support leading models of hetero-oligomer evolution and reveal the emergence of order-exerting mutations that shape the organization of multimeric protein complexes while conserving function.",

We found that overexpression of MuC was lethal in Escherichia coli and observed that host replication was overinitiating under these conditions. Suppressors of MuC lethality mapped to dnaA , diaA , and dnaX . DnaA initiates replication at oriC , assisted by DiaA. Reinitiation is prevented by hydrolysis of ATP-DnaA to ADP-DnaA by Hda and DnaN (β-sliding clamp or Clamp). DnaX, the tau/gamma subunit of Pol III, is part of the Clamp loader complex. Coexpression of hda and dnaN rescued MuC lethality. This result suggested that MuC was interfering with either Hda or DnaN. We noticed that MuC contains two near-consensus Clamp-binding motifs (CBM), one at the N terminus and one at the C-terminus. Changing the consensus residues of either CBM abolished MuC lethality, abrogated MuC-dependent transcription, and reduced plaque-forming units. Inactivation of a ts Clamp through temperature shift specifically inhibited MuC-dependent transcription but not σ 70 -dependent transcription. We show that MuC interacts with the Clamp to activate late gene transcription both in vivo and in vitro. This study demonstrates the involvement of the E. coli Clamp, a processivity factor essential for DNA replication, for transcription by E. coli RNAP. We observed that members of the Mor/MuC family of transcription factors all possess at least one CBM, suggesting that engaging the Clamp for transcription is likely to be more prevalent than hitherto recognized.",

Here, we show that the genomes of several brown algae encode only a single AGO protein, containing the conserved functional domains characteristic of the family. Using the model brown alga Ectocarpus and a combination of cell biology, genetic, and transcriptomic approaches, we demonstrate that AGO is essential for the transition from vegetative growth to sexual reproductive development and for germline establishment. Our results further suggest that AGO functions in concert with microRNAs to regulate target genes primarily at the posttranscriptional level, likely through translational repression. Ectocarpus thus represents a rare example of a complex multicellular organism that relies on a single AGO protein to regulate key developmental processes, pointing to a minimalistic model of RNA-based regulation in brown algae.",

From ~200 pg of HeLa digest—approximately 80% of a cell—the technology identified 1,035 proteins with high reproducibility in quantification (coefficient of variation &lt;15% across technical triplicates). With microprobe sampling in vivo, we quantified 808–1,022 proteins from opposite poles of the dorsal–animal (D1) blastomere before division, and we traced how these spatial distributions are retained or remodeled in the descendant D1.1 (neural-fated) and D1.2 (epidermal-destined) cells. To decouple subcellular distributions from dorsal–ventral axis cues, we perturbed patterning by ultraviolet ventralization. These results establish microprobe CE–MS for deep subcellular proteomics in intact embryos and reveal spatially distinct protein distributions during early fate specification.

Despite some promising preclinical evidence, this combination therapy has shown limited efficacy in patients with homologous recombination (HR)–proficient tumors. To investigate this discrepancy between preclinical and clinical results, we profiled the effects of PARP inhibition in prostate cancer models in the presence or absence of AR inhibition. Surprisingly, AR inhibition impaired response to PARP inhibitors in castration-sensitive cells and had no effect on response in castration-resistant cells. AR inhibition also did not regulate DNA repair in either the castration-resistant or castration-sensitive setting.

          "abstract": "The Middle Pleistocene (MP; ca. 774 to 129 ka) marks a critical period of human evolution, characterized by increasing behavioral complexity and the first unambiguous evidence of plant-based technologies. Despite this, direct evidence for early wooden tool use remains exceptionally rare. Here, we present the earliest handheld wooden tools, identified from secure contexts at the site of Marathousa 1, Greece, dated to ca. 430 ka (MIS12). Through a systematic morphological, microscopic, taphonomic, and taxonomic analysis of the sampled wood macroremains, two specimens were securely identified as modified by hominins: one small alder ( Alnus sp.) trunk fragment bears clear working and use-wear traces consistent with a multifunctional stick likely used in digging at the paleolakeshore; and one very small willow/poplar ( Salix sp./ Populus sp.) artifact exhibits signs of shaping and potential use-wear. A third specimen, a large alder trunk segment, shows deep, nonanthropogenic striations interpreted here as claw marks from a large carnivoran. The wooden tools were excavated together with butchered elephant remains, small lithic artifacts and debitage, and worked bone, underscoring the diversity of engagement with a variety of different raw materials for technological purposes at Marathousa 1. These finds extend the temporal range of early wooden tools. They represent both the use of expedient larger handheld tools as well as a much smaller, likely finger-held wooden tool, which is uniquely small for the Pleistocene, expanding known functional purposes of early wood technologies. Moreover, they highlight the Megalopolis Basin’s exceptional preservation conditions and its role in understanding the evolution of hominin behavior.",

          "abstract": "Lions and tigers, as dominant apex predators, likely became competitors when lions expanded from Africa into Eurasia approximately one million years ago (Ma), forming a lion–tiger transition belt from the Middle East through Central Asia to the Russian Far East. At the easternmost edge of this zone, the Japanese Archipelago has long been considered a Late Pleistocene tiger refugium, supported by large felid subfossils traditionally attributed to tigers ( Panthera tigris ), though their taxonomic identity remained unresolved. To clarify the origin, evolutionary history, and biogeography of Japan’s Pleistocene felids, we analyzed 26 ancient specimens previously assumed to be tigers. Using mitochondrial and nuclear genome hybridization capture and sequencing, paleoproteomics, Bayesian molecular dating, and radiocarbon dating, we found that all ancient Japanese “tiger” remains yielding molecular data were, unexpectedly, cave lions ( Panthera spelaea ). One specimen from Yamaguchi Prefecture, western Japan, was radiocarbon dated to 36,000-34,891 cal. BP. These cave lions likely dispersed to the Japanese Archipelago between ~72.7 and 37.5 thousand years ago (ka), when a land bridge connected northern Japan to the mainland during the Last Glacial Period. Our findings challenge the long-held view that tigers once took refuge in Japan, showing instead that cave lions were widespread in northeast Asia during this period and were the Panthera lineage that colonized Japan, reaching even its southwestern regions despite habitats previously thought to favor tigers.",

          "abstract": "For proper segregation of chromosomes and successful cytokinesis, chromosomes must first “congress”—gather in a tight plate near the spindle equator. Molecular mechanism(s) of congression are not fully understood. Here we combine live-cell microscopy, perturbations of microtubule motor activities, correlative light/electron microscopy, and computational modeling, to quantitatively characterize the early-prometaphase movements that bring the scattered chromosomes to the equator in human RPE1 cells. We find that the early-prometaphase movements are directed toward the center of the spindle axis and not the spindle poles. Centromere velocity of the centripetal movements is not constant, with centromeres moving faster at larger distances from the spindle center. We also detect that numerous short microtubules appear at kinetochores at the earliest stages of spindle assembly and prior to chromosome congression. Computational modeling reveals that a mechanism based on brief, stochastic, minus-end directed interactions between the short microtubules protruding from the kinetochores and long appropriately curved microtubules within the spindle accurately predicts the observed distance-velocity function. Further, the model predicts that insufficient numbers of microtubules protruding from the kinetochores decreases the velocity and randomizes directionality of congression movements. These predictions match changes in the chromosome behavior observed in cells with suppressed nucleation of microtubules at the kinetochore corona (RPE1 Rod Δ/Δ ). In contrast, predictions of computational models based on continuous pulling forces at kinetochores differ significantly from the experimental observations. Together, live-cell observations and modeling reveal a mechanism that enables the efficient and synchronized arrival of chromosomes to the spindle equator.",

          "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (αS) plays a central role in several neurodegenerative diseases. Although predominantly neuronal, αS is also present in peripheral fluids such as serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it may contribute to disease propagation. However, its extracellular interactions remain poorly understood. By combining in situ NMR spectroscopy and bottom–up MS proteomics, we reveal that monomeric αS exhibits distinct interactomes in serum versus CSF. Both N- and C-terminal αS regions bind to serum components, while in CSF, αS remains largely unbound. The N- and C-terminal interactions are mechanistically diverse: C-terminal binding is electrostatic, whereas N-terminal interactions persist under high ionic strength, implicating hydrophobic interactions. Deletion of the first ten N-terminal residues, which include several hydrophobic side chains, abolishes these interactions, highlighting their functional importance. Proteomic profiling and NMR validation identify key αS serum partners, including albumin, γ-globulins, and lipoproteins, which, together, are sufficient to recapitulate the serum αS interactome and elicit redundant interactions with the αS N-terminal region. Despite such redundancy, αS methionine oxidation selectively disrupts N-terminal binding, suggesting a redox-sensitive mechanism regulating the αS extracellular interactome. Notably, C-terminal interactions are preserved when the N-terminal binding is detuned, indicating that the N- and C-termini elicit independent interactions with the extracellular matrix, a marked difference from the intracellular milieu. These findings uncover dynamic and fluid-specific αS interaction signatures, offering new molecular insights into its peripheral roles and identifying potential new epitopes as synucleinopathy biomarkers. These results are also relevant for other amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), for which αS serves as a prototype.",

Mammalian Reelin increases the complexity of Drosophila Mushroom Body (MB) neurites, an effect mediated by LpR1 and LpR2, the orthologs of mammalian Reelin receptors. Paradoxically, to date, no Reelin ortholog has been described in Drosophila . Here, we report that the protein product of the uncharacterized Drosophila CG17739 gene, which we named Drospondin, shares sequence homology with vertebrate F-spondin and Reelin. We show that Drospondin is expressed in glial cells and is crucial for MB development. Our results also show that Drospondin genetically interacts with LpRs and that human Reelin rescues neuronal and brain structural defects in Drospondin-deficient flies. Furthermore, Drospondin-deficient flies exhibit altered sleep, locomotion, and social behaviors. Our results reveal that Drospondin is a Drosophila protein with similar functions to mammalian Reelin/F-spondin, that has an essential role in brain development and function, the impairment of which has profound functional consequences for the animal.",

In the current conceptual framework, the initial stone nidus is thought to include the aggregation of inorganic crystallites, the formation of which is favored by elevated concentrations of dissolved constituents. Here, we show that this highly prevalent stone type comprises a form of organic–inorganic polycrystalline biocomposite with integrated bacterial biofilms. Evidence from electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy reveal the unanticipated internal structure of kidney stones from human patients, where bacterial biofilms are intercalated between polycrystalline mineral layers, even in stones identified as “noninfectious” clinically, including those in patients without underlying urinary tract infections. We observe similar bacterial biofilm architectures on the surfaces of stone fragments obtained due to lithotripsy, suggesting that bacteria are intrinsic to the process of nephrolithiasis. Crystallites proximal to biofilm layers exhibit significantly smaller grain sizes, which indicate a larger local concentration of nucleation sites. Staining reveals that biofilm areas of these stones are enriched with bacterial DNA. That bacteria are now observed so broadly in kidney stones (including even in less prevalent struvite stones) may be conceptually salient: Based on the evidence adduced here, we propose a model in which the urine-rich environment of the kidney can impinge on bacterial calcium homeostasis and amplify bacterial production of nucleation templates such as extracellular DNA. The resultant counterion condensation intrinsic to polyelectrolytes charged beyond the Manning criterion (such as DNA) drastically enhances the probability of heterogeneous nucleation, thereby amplifying calcium oxalate stone formation.",

Despite the therapeutic potential of BK channel agonists, the molecular mechanisms by which they stabilize the pore’s open conformation remain unclear. Using cryoelectron microscopy and molecular dynamic simulations, we identified that NS1619, a synthetic benzimidazolone agonist, first described as a BK opener, binds within a pocket formed by the S6/RCK1 linker and the S4 transmembrane segment. Our simulations suggest that agonist binding promotes a twisting motion in the S6 segment, enabling critical interactions with residues K330, K331, and F223.

          "abstract": "Machine learning holds great promise for classifying and identifying fossils, and has recently been marshaled to identify trackmakers of dinosaur footprints and address long-standing debates over whether some dinosaur tracks are the oldest birds or ornithopods (duck-billed herbivores and kin) in the fossil record, or alternatively were made by nonavian theropods. Existing methods in paleontology, however, require supervision and a priori labeling of training data by researchers, which can lead to bias. We employ an unsupervised machine learning technique for recognizing inherent patterns in shape data, using a disentangled variational autoencoder network, to a database of 1,974 footprints, spanning a diversity of dinosaurs across their evolutionary history, including modern birds. Our neural network identified eight features of shape variation that most differentiate these tracks: overall load and shape (amount of ground contact area), digit spread, digit attachment, heel load, digit and heel emphasis, loading position, heel position, and left–right load. With the unsupervised process finished, we a posteriori labeled each track based on published expert judgments, plotted them into morphospace, and applied distance metrics to group means and nearest neighbors, which showed 80 to 93% agreement with expert identifications. Controversial Late Triassic-Early Jurassic bird-like tracks group with fossil and modern birds and some Middle Jurassic three-toed tracks with ornithopods, supporting an older origin for these groups than recorded by body fossils. We provide an app, DinoTracker, to make this process accessible, and source code that can be adapted to other cases where paleontologists or biologists are studying patterns of shape variation.",

          "abstract": "Repeated games and stochastic games are important frameworks to study direct reciprocity. Individuals react strategically to their coplayers’ previous behavior. While strategies in such games can be arbitrarily complex, explorations of evolutionary dynamics are often done in specific strategy spaces. Individuals may consider a fixed number of past rounds, or only some of the partner’s previous actions. Such restrictions can make the interpretation of the results difficult. Strategies found to be superior within a restricted set may lose stability when more complex strategies are permitted. We discuss two notions of completeness that rule out this possibility. If a strategy space, S, is best-reply-complete, then any strategy in S is guaranteed to have a best reply in S. If a space, S, is payoff-complete, then any strategy playing against an opponent in S can be replaced by an equivalent strategy within S without affecting either player’s payoff. Sufficient conditions for best-reply-completeness have been given in a seminal paper by Levínský et al. Here, we show that for strategies of bounded memory, the same conditions are sufficient for payoff-completeness. Furthermore, using those conditions, we illustrate how to construct many complete spaces for simple games. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of complete strategy spaces, which are particularly useful when interpreting evolutionary simulations and determining best responses.",

While numerous studies have explored the mechanisms and functions of body coloration as a sexual signal, the role of another essential property of light—polarization—remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the question of whether and how polarization signals achieve high conspicuousness under sexual selection, including their visibility and associated behavioral and morphological adaptations, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we identified a strikingly conspicuous polarization signal used specifically during courtship in the cuttlefish Doratosepion andreanum and investigated the underlying optical mechanism. The signal consists of a pattern of adjacent horizontally and vertically polarized areas, optimizing signal detectability for cephalopod polarization vision. This pattern is generated by reflective cells called iridophores and transparent muscle: light becomes horizontally polarized when reflected by iridophores, and its angle of polarization is then rotated to vertical when transmitted through a birefringent muscle layer. Our findings show the significant contribution of polarization of light to animal communication and reveal that polarization signals—like colorful sexual ornaments—can achieve high conspicuousness through fundamentally different optical mechanisms.",

Using polysynaptic viral tracing, we show that AgRP and POMC neurons receive indirect input from partially overlapping but distinct areas of the olfactory cortex, indicating that they process different sets of olfactory information. We also identify different complements of neurons more directly upstream of AgRP and POMC neurons that could relay olfactory cortical signals to the appetite neurons. Single-cell transcriptomics shows heterogeneous expression of neuromodulator receptors among AgRP neurons, suggesting variations in the signals they receive. Integrated viral tracing and RNA localization further reveals selected brain areas where upstream neurons express cognate receptor ligands.

The field oscillations induce a shaking of the orientation of the skyrmion lines, leading to a phase where the critical depinning current for translational motion vanishes. We measure the transverse susceptibility of MnSi to track various depinning phase transitions induced by currents, oscillating fields, or combinations thereof.

We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated subanatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs.

          "abstract": "Whiteflies pose a major threat to crops worldwide, primarily because they transmit begomoviruses with which they have evolved intricate mutualistic relationships. The mutualisms are known to exacerbate whitefly invasions and drive widespread plant virus pandemics. Yet, certain plant genotypes are able to resist both the whiteflies and the viruses and a good understanding of the underlying mechanisms could help to develop more resistant varieties. Here, we show that the viruliferous whitefly Bemisia tabaci induces an early and strong release of the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene in cultivated tomato plants. This volatile functions as an airborne signal that primes neighboring conspecifics for enhanced resistance to begomoviruses, including Tomato yellow leaf curl virus and Papaya leaf curl China virus. These results challenge the view that whitefly-induced volatile emissions primarily benefit the insect vector, suggesting instead that the plant prioritizes antiviral defense over antiherbivore resistance. β-Caryophyllene exposure was also found to enhance the emission of β-Caryophyllene, methyl salicylate and β-myrcene upon whitefly attack, increasing plant attractiveness to the parasitoid Encarsia formosa . Using a β-caryophyllene overproducing transgenic tomato line and synthetic β-caryophyllene dispensers, we confirmed that β-caryophyllene exposure primes antipathogen defenses in tomato plants and confers improved plant fitness under sustained infestation by viruliferous whiteflies. Importantly, this defense priming is genotype-specific and limited to certain tomato cultivars, suggesting that β-caryophyllene-mediated resistance can be harnessed through selective breeding.

          "abstract": "Emerging and reemerging viruses pose a significant threat to global health. Although direct-acting antivirals have shown success, their efficacy is limited by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral variants. Hence, there is an urgent need for additional broad spectrum antiviral therapeutic strategies. Here, we identify by phenotypic screening a set of stereochemically defined photoreactive small molecules (photo-stereoprobes) that stereoselectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung epithelial cells. Structure–activity relationship–guided chemical proteomics identified the eukaryotic translation termination factor 1 (ETF1) as a target of the photo-stereoprobes, and this interaction was recapitulated with recombinant purified ETF1. We found that the photo-stereoprobes modulate programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanisms essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection without causing ETF1 degradation, thus distinguishing the photo-stereoprobes from other known ETF1-directed small molecules. We finally show that the photo-stereoprobes also inhibit the replication of additional viruses with noncanonical ribosomal frameshifting mechanisms. Our findings identify a mechanistically distinct class of ETF1 ligands that implicate host translation termination processes as a potential drug target for antiviral development.",

          "abstract": "Baculoviruses are large DNA viruses that mainly infect insects. During infection, viral egress from midgut cells and subsequent behavior changes lead to terminally infected insects migrating to higher elevations on plant branches or tree limbs. However, the neural mechanisms driving this hyperactivity remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the climbing behavior of Helicoverpa armigera larvae enhances the dispersal of Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV). Our findings reveal that HearNPV triggers a calcium response in enteroendocrine cells, leading to the release of midgut-derived tachykinin (TK). Released TK activates its receptor (TKR) in the brain, thereby promoting phototaxis and climbing behavior. Additionally, HaTTD14 functions as a downstream regulator of the TK–TKR signaling pathway. These results provide insights into the neural and molecular mechanisms driving baculovirus-induced hyperactivity, which aids in viral transmission.",

          "abstract": "Biological polymers often face a trade-off between stiffness, strength, and extensibility: Materials that are strong and stiff tend to be brittle, while those that are elastic and extensible usually lack strength. Here, we show that netcasting spiders (Deinopidae) overcome this trade-off by forming mixed-silk metastructures, which enable both high elastic deformation and load resistance. These spiders have evolved a unique predatory strategy, casting a sticky silk web over prey, which subjects the web radii to extreme strains far exceeding those sustained by typical spider silk fibers. The radii consist of a compound filament with an elastomeric core surrounded by looped bundles of thin fibers. This architecture results in an unusual mechanical profile: The threads are initially compliant and highly extensible, but they stiffen as the fiber loops straighten, enhancing load-bearing capacity. Notably, spiders control this compound architecture through a reel-spinning technique, controlling loop formation and fiber mixture to establish an elasticity gradient across the web—stiff and strong in the main frame lines, yet soft and hyperelastic in the lower radii that undergo the greatest deformation during prey capture. These findings represent a unique case of behavioral modulation of silk processing to circumvent biomaterial trade-offs, enabling extraordinary dynamics and specialization of web architecture. The herein described principle of looped fiber-reinforced elastomers may also be transferred to the design of artificial materials for applications that require both high elasticity and strength.",

          "abstract": "The ocean is thought to be the terminal sink for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), persistent organofluorine chemicals used widely in modern commerce for decades. Industry and stewardship programs phased out the most abundantly produced legacy PFAS in the early 2000s due to toxicity concerns. However, they have since been replaced by shorter carbon chain and “novel” chemistries, and past work hypothesized likely increases in these replacement PFAS that were not previously quantifiable. To address this gap, we measured bulk extractable organofluorine (EOF) in archived liver and muscle tissues from pelagic Subarctic pilot whales over the last several decades. Results show EOF concentrations peaked in 2011 and declined by over 60% by 2023. Among a broad suite of targeted and suspect PFAS measured using high-resolution mass spectrometry, only one was consistently increasing through 2023. Tissue concentrations of four main legacy PFAS that accounted for over 75% of EOF were all decreasing by 2023. The timing of peak concentrations depended primarily on whether they were transported to the subarctic by ocean circulation or atmospheric deposition, with the latter declining much faster. Oceanic transport and bioaccumulation modeling suggests that decadal-scale lags between production and food web bioaccumulation are primarily driven by marine transport processes. Large declines in tissue concentrations in this study reinforce the effectiveness of phase-outs in chemical production. However, other work showing stable or increasing EOF in human serum suggests many emerging PFAS with more neutral physicochemical properties may be preferentially accumulating in terrestrial and nearshore environments compared to legacy PFAS.",

One can then ask if some properties of the entire network are already explained by a small part of the network, a network motif. A famous example of an ecological motif is exploitative competition in food webs, where the presence of two species competing for a shared resource precludes the existence of a stable equilibrium for the whole system. However, other examples of motifs with such direct impacts on stability are not known. Here, we show why small motifs that allow conclusions on systemic stability are rare. More importantly, we show that another dynamical property, reactivity, is typically rooted in motifs. Computing the reactivity of motifs can reveal which parts of a network are prone to respond violently to perturbations. This highlights motif reactivity as a useful property to measure in real-world systems to understand likely modes of systemic failure in food webs or other networks in epidemics, supply chains, or power grids.",

By alloying 20 atomic percent (at.%) hafnium into Ta thin films, we achieve a superconducting transition temperature (T c ) of 6.09 K as observed in direct current (DC) transport measurements, reflecting an increase in the superconducting gap. We systematically vary deposition conditions to control film orientation and transport properties of Ta-Hf alloy thin films. We then confirm the enhancement in T c via microwave measurements at millikelvin temperatures. We verify the ∼ 40 % increase in T c relative to bare Ta devices, while the loss contributions from two-level systems and quasi-particles remain unchanged in the low temperature regime. These findings emphasize the promise of material engineering in superconducting circuits and point to many potential material candidates for further exploration.",

However, combinatorial trial-and-error exploration is prohibitively costly, while machine learning (ML) approaches are hindered by data scarcity. Here, we develop an ML-guided framework integrating active learning with physics-informed Bayesian optimization to rapidly converge on optimal compositions. The resulting Ti 36 V 14 Nb 22 Hf 22 Zr 1 Al 5 alloy achieves a yield strength of 953 MPa and a large tensile ductility of 42%. The high strength arises from the substantial lattice distortion, as well as the ~1-nm-sized local chemical fluctuations (LCFs) inherent to the highly concentrated bcc solid solution. The ubiquitous LCFs also substantially promote dislocation multiplication and strain hardening, enabling a large tensile ductility.

          "abstract": "In mammals, passive acquisition of maternal immunoglobulins is essential for neonatal immune development and defense against infections. IgG, a central mediator of humoral immunity, is maternally transferred via distinct mechanisms depending on placental structure in placental mammals. In humans (hemochorial placenta), IgG is prenatally transported across the placenta, whereas in large domestic animals such as pigs and cows (epitheliochorial/connective chorionic placenta), IgG is exclusively transferred postnatally via colostrum and absorbed in the neonatal intestine. Rodents (allantoic chorionic placenta) employ both pathways. Critically, IgG must traverse multiple tissue barriers-including the placenta, mammary gland, and neonatal intestine-to reach the circulation of newborns. While FcRn is known to facilitate IgG transport in the placenta and neonatal intestine, the mechanisms underlying IgG secretion into milk remain unclear. Here, we identify FcγRIIB as the key transporter mediating maternal IgG transfer across the mammary gland in mammals. Using constitutive and conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate that FcγRIIB deficiency impairs mammary IgG transfer, whereas its overexpression enhances milk IgG levels. Strikingly, in pigs, FcγRIIB is highly upregulated in mammary tissue prepartum, and its disruption abolishes IgG accumulation in colostrum. Our work opens avenues for improving neonatal immunity through targeted modulation of FcγRIIB-mediated IgG transport.",

In this study, we systematically analyzed the entire human surfaceome, identifying approximately 4,500 targetable sites and introducing potential binding seeds for initiating protein design applications.

However, the processes underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Examining the dynamics of signal and noise correlations among neuron pairs in chronic calcium imaging experiments in the mouse auditory cortex, we investigate how activity-dependent, Hebbian-like plasticity and activity-independent, stochastic synaptic processes contribute to representational drift. We found that signal correlations predict future noise correlations, suggesting that stimulus-induced coactivation leads to increased effective connectivity between neuron pairs. Moreover, simple linear network models were able to account for the observed temporal dependencies between signal and noise correlations, but only if both Hebbian-like plasticity and stochastic changes of either inputs or recurrent synapses contribute to representational drift. In conclusion, our findings suggest that continuous sensory input–driven Hebbian-like plasticity can balance ongoing stochastic synaptic changes, thereby preventing the network’s functional degradation.",

          "abstract": "The myosin superfamily encompasses over 70 classes, each with multiple subclasses, and exhibits substantial diversity in properties such as velocity, ATPase activity, duty ratio, and directionality. This functional diversity enables the specialized roles of each myosin in various organisms, organs, and cell types. Beyond these well-characterized parameters, a newly recognized property has recently come into focus: Certain myosins drive actin filaments along chiral curved trajectories. However, this newly identified property remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated this chiral motion in vitro using Chara corallina myosin XI ( Cc XI), which drives fast clockwise (CW) movement of actin filaments. This chiral motion arises from asymmetric displacement at the filament’s leading tip, and its curvature depends on the myosin density. Surprisingly, at elevated actin concentrations, filaments exhibiting chiral curved motion undergo collective dynamics, spontaneously forming a ring-shaped structure—termed the actin chiral ring (ACR)—that exhibits persistent CW rotation. ACRs display remarkable stability, continuing to rotate at their formation site until ATP is depleted, while maintaining their structure even after rotation ceases. This stability has not been reported among reported collective motions of cytoskeletal proteins driven by various motors. Our findings demonstrate that myosins with chiral activity can autonomously organize actin filaments into stable, chiral structures through collective motion, providing insights into actin self-organization by unconventional myosins. This paradigm offers a mechanistic basis for how motor-driven molecular asymmetry can give rise to coherent structural chirality at the cellular scale—an essential step in the emergence of cell chirality and asymmetry during development.",

          "abstract": "Agile and efficient modern flyers like birds and insects rely on complex aerodynamics to increase performance such as leading edge vortices, tip vortices, rapid pitch rotations as well as wing–wake and wing–wing interactions. However, their evolutionary origins are poorly understood. Early birds and their closest relatives like Microraptor had a multiwinged configuration featuring long pennaceous feathers on their arms, legs, and tail, a configuration not seen today. The skill of these early flyers has been debated, centering around what was driving the evolution of this multiwing configuration and its loss in favor of the modern two-winged configuration. In this context, the aerodynamics and wing–wing interactions of Microraptor during gliding flight are investigated. The gliding flight mechanics of Microraptor exhibit flow patterns consistent with those observed and quantitatively assessed in volant living animal species. We analyze leading edge vortices on the forewing and hindwing including beneficial wake interactions between them as well as tip vortices on the distinct distally flared hindwing. The latter is unique in Microraptor as the hindwing’s characteristic outer span flare provides the necessary surface for the tip vortex to be bound to and thus contribute additional lift. These findings suggest that Microraptor evolved toward utilizing leading edge and tip vortices and their aerodynamic interactions. This implies that such utilization was also being exploited by other early multiwinged theropods to differing extents as part of a crucial milestone in early flight evolution.",

However, recent rodent studies suggest that medullary regions and local spinal circuits also contribute to forelimb execution, leaving it uncertain if these findings apply to humans. Critically, the dynamic interactions among medullary motor regions, intersegmental spinal networks, and cortical sensorimotor areas during hand movement control remain poorly understood. Here, through functional MRI (fMRI) studies in humans and mice during forelimb movement tasks, we reveal topographically organized corticomedullary networks, comprising the lateral rostral medulla (Lat-RM) and caudal medulla (CauM), that regulate forelimb movement. In mice, the corticomedullary coupling in both CauM and Lat-RM increased systematically along a ventro-medio-dorsal gradient, with the strongest links to primary motor and premotor cortices. In humans, higher‐order sensorimotor regions drove the strongest connectivity with CauM and Lat-RM, while the more medially located medial rostral medulla remained weakly engaged. Furthermore, simultaneous brain-spinal fMRI revealed distinct functional territories within the human C3–C4 cervical spinal cord, with ventral regions exhibiting strong connectivity to the medulla and dorsal regions to lower cervical segments. Together, our findings identify a conserved corticomedullary network underlying forelimb movement control across species, while also uncovering variation in cortical involvement. They indicate the presence of an indirect pathway involving both the reticulospinal pathway and the C3–C4 propriospinal system, which contributes to fine hand motor control in the mammalian brain.",

Studies on Shaker channels in Arabidopsis have provided a paradigmatic framework, but the rice genome encodes an additional member, OsKAT1, whose function remians poorly defined. OsKAT1-type channels are characterized by an innately short cytosolic C terminus, forming a unique clade of monocot-specific short Shakers that is prevalent in Poaceae species. In rice, OsKAT1 is predominantly expressed in the root stele. Disruption of OsKAT1 (KO mutation) leads to a significant reduction in K + secretion into the xylem sap delivered to the shoot. Patch-clamp experiments on root stele protoplasts of WT and KO plants indicate that OsKAT1 functions as an inward channel. Functional analyses in Xenopus oocytes reveal that despite activating at weakly negative voltages, OsKAT1 is intrinsically incapable of mediating substantial outward currents—a property attributed to its truncated C terminus. Together with outward K + channel activity, this feature enables stelar cells to remain significantly permeable to K + around the K + equilibrium potential. When expressed in Arabidopsis , OsKAT1 contributes to K + transport in the xylem sap, but only in wild-type plants that express SKOR, a Shaker channel specialized for this role. These results demonstrate that OsKAT1 constitutes a component of K + translocation to shoots and shed light on the energization and regulation underlying this function. Moreover, OsKAT1 is shown to improve rice adaptation to environmental conditions and enhance grain yield under field conditions through its facilitating root-to-shoot ion translocation.",

          "abstract": "Type III secretion systems (T3SS) are critical virulence machines in many Gram-negative bacteria, enabling hierarchical secretion of translocases followed by effectors. In the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS, the regulatory protein InvE (SctW) enforces this order. Here, we show that InvE assembles into tetramers and higher-order oligomers and that oligomerization is essential for function. A 2.4 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals a tetramer built as a dimer of antiparallel dimers. Photocrosslinking maps one set of residues to the interdimer seams in this tetramer, while crosslinks from additional sites suggest lateral docking between dimers in alternative registries in vivo. Blue-native electrophoresis and SEC–MALS detect native high-molecular-weight species consistent with such assemblies. DNA-PAINT superresolution microscopy confirms the presence of higher-order InvE oligomers in vivo. Charge-reversal mutations that disrupt oligomerization collapse InvE to monomers and abolish secretion, effector translocation, invasion, and virulence. Together, these data define an oligomerization-based switch in which InvE reuses the dimeric face to form higher-order contacts that govern the transition from translocase to effector secretion.",

          "abstract": "Canopy shade environments can negatively impact plant growth and survival. Phytochrome A (phyA) is essential for seedling adaptation to deep shade, yet its role under moderate natural canopy conditions remains unclear. By expressing a phyA-nanoLUC reporter in Arabidopsis thaliana , we quantify diurnal fluctuations in phyA and its induction by low red to far-red (R:FR) ratio, simulating canopy shade. We uncover a key regulatory function for phyB, which increases phyA stability postdawn in unshaded conditions and modulates expression of PHYA in low R:FR. Further, we demonstrate that beyond its role as a deep shade sensor, phyA is an adept sensor of canopy shade, capable of detecting a range of R:FR ratios across light intensities. Mathematical modeling demonstrates that this property arises from the dynamic features of the phyA High Irradiance Response (HIR) mode of action. Interestingly, phyA synthesis is strongly induced by subtle reductions in R:FR ratio, and is robust to light perturbation, suggesting the phyA-sensory module is configured to detect modest shade. Spectral data from natural shade habitats provide ecological context for our laboratory findings. Physiological analysis indicates that under canopy shade phyA promotes seedling de-etiolation, organizes resource management, and accelerates reproductive development. We propose that this suite of responses, termed the “canopy adaptation strategy,” enhances survival chances under conditions where shade avoidance strategies are maladaptive.",

          "abstract": "Some mammals develop amyloid plaques and type 2 diabetes, much like humans, depending on the sequence of their islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). In humans, IAPP forms a toxic oligomer with a parallel β-sheet across residues 23 FGAIL 28 S. Using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, we monitor the structure of IAPP from seven different mammals, five of which are from species that can develop type 2 diabetes (ferret, raccoon, cat, baboon, and human) and three from those that do not (hamster, rat, and pig). G24 is isotope labeled to monitor for the presence of the oligomeric β-sheet previously found in human IAPP. For the species that develop type 2 diabetes, their IAPP is cytotoxic, and a β-sheet at G24 is observed during the lag phase prior to fibril formation. In contrast, the species that do not develop type 2 diabetes have nontoxic IAPP, and their IAPP does not form this β-sheet structure. Pig IAPP forms oligomers, but with a different structure that is nontoxic. Thus, an oligomer with a parallel β-sheet at G24 that resembles that of the known human IAPP oligomer correlates with cytotoxicity and propensity for type 2 diabetes. These results indicate that the sequence within the 20 to 29 region of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), long known to correlate with type 2 diabetes in mammals, determines the structure and toxicity of an oligomer, supporting the oligomer hypothesis for type 2 diabetes and providing an explanation other than plaque formation for why some mammals develop insulin deficiency in late-stage type 2 diabetes, and others do not.",

We performed integrated whole-genome, whole-exome, and transcriptome sequencing on 80 ESS tumors, comprising 32 low-grade (LG) and 48 high-grade (HG) tumors, to characterize their genetic landscape. The overall mutation burden was modest, with no significant difference between grades; however, we identified six hypermutated cases (7.5%) harboring POLE or mismatch repair mutations, genomic features predictive of immunotherapy response. We identified focal RAD54B amplifications in 15 tumors (18.8%), leading to elevated RAD54B expression and significantly shorter survival. This establishes RAD54B as an oncogenic driver in ESS. Known tumor suppressors (PTEN, TP53) were frequently mutated in HG-ESS but rare in LG-ESS, highlighting distinct grade-specific drivers of malignancy. HG-ESS exhibited widespread chromosomal gains, frequent loss of cell-cycle regulators (RB1, CDKN2A), and numerous private gene fusions arising from complex DNA rearrangements. In contrast, LG-ESS were defined by canonical fusions (e.g., JAZF1–SUZ12 ) and co-occurring deletions in metabolic regulator genes (TSC2, STK11). Finally, in an activating NRAS-mutant (p.Q61R) HG-ESS xenograft, the combination of MEK and FAK inhibition dramatically suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival, highlighting a promising targeted treatment strategy. Overall, our comprehensive analysis defines the molecular basis of ESS and provides a strong preclinical rationale for precision therapies in this aggressive cancer.",

Integrating high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking and video footage from large-scale foraging competitions with cognitive-computational modeling and agent-based simulations, we show how foragers integrate personal, social, and ecological information to guide spatial search and patch-leaving decisions. We show how the social context emerges as a key driver of foraging dynamics. Foragers adaptively rely on social information to locate resources when unsuccessful and extend giving-up times in the presence of others, which results in increased area-restricted search at high social densities. These findings demonstrate the importance of sociality for human foraging decisions and provide a template for harnessing high-resolution tracking data to study real-world cognition.",

Metal-organic (MO) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers promise for scalable growth, but the reactions are kinetically limited, leading to nanometer-scale domain size and carbon contaminations. Here, we unveil the fundamental kinetic limitations and overcome them by introducing oxygen-assisted MOCVD (oxy-MOCVD) technology. By tuning reactions with oxygen, MO precursors are converted into high-purity transition-metal oxides and chalcogens, producing aligned molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) domains with a size and growth rate that are orders of magnitude larger than conventional MOCVD. The MoS 2 is free of carbon impurities and exhibits average mobility exceeding 100 square centimeters per volt per second. The scalability of oxy-MOCVD is demonstrated by 150-millimeter single-crystal MoS 2 wafers, proving the feasibility of industrial-scale production.",

          "abstract": "Terrestrial vascular plants operate under negative water potential, which results in hydraulic tension in the vascular system. Vascular tension varies with transpiration and soil drying and is regulated by stomata, pressure-activated valves on the leaf surface. We hypothesize that soil physical constraints drive convergence in the operational range of leaf vascular tension. Based on a meta analysis of 19 diverse species, we find that stomatal regulation of transpiration is activated when leaf vascular tension reaches a narrow target of 1.3 ± 0.6 megapascals. This value matches the range (1.4 ± 0.6 megapascals) predicted from an optimal soil water extraction model. Optimality in plant vascular tension appears to have evolved by selection for a narrow range of osmotic pressure in the leaves of diverse species growing across variable environments.",

This QP ceramic exhibited a d 33 of ~6850 pC/N, which surpasses commercial PZT ceramics by 10 to 30 times and commercial lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate single crystal by ~4 times. This exceptional property arises from the tricritical nature of the QP, a thermodynamic singularity that produces an ultrasoft lattice and enables complete polarization alignment in polycrystals.

          "abstract": "Aging is characterized by a decline in the ability of tissue repair and regeneration after injury. In skeletal muscle, this decline is largely driven by impaired function of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to efficiently contribute to muscle regeneration. We uncovered a cause of this aging-associated dysfunction: a cellular survivorship bias that prioritizes stem cell persistence at the expense of functionality. With age, MuSCs increased expression of a tumor suppressor, N-myc down-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), which, by suppressing the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, increased their long-term survival potential but at the cost of their ability to promptly activate and contribute to muscle regeneration. This delayed muscle regeneration with age may result from a trade-off that favors long-term stem cell survival over immediate regenerative capacity.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the key mechanisms that control the tectonic deformation of the continents remains a fundamental challenge in geodynamics. We present a high-resolution geodetic velocity field of the Tibetan Plateau, which shows that a few major strike-slip fault systems separate regions of more uniformly distributed deformation. We suggest that focused strain on major fault systems is enabled by relatively low-viscosity ductile shear zones extending through the lithosphere beneath the seismically active fault planes. Simple model calculations show that high slip rates on the Kunlun Fault enable east-west extension to be distributed broadly across the relatively weak southern and central Tibetan Plateau. Activation of the Kunlun fault in the Miocene at the same time as the onset of rifting in the north-south grabens suggests a causal relationship.",

          "abstract": "Plants display a wide range of life spans and aging rates. Although dynamic changes to DNA methylation are a hallmark of aging in mammals, it is unclear whether similar molecular signatures reflect rates of aging and organism life span in plants. In this work, we show that the short-lived model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits a loss of epigenetic integrity during aging, which causes DNA methylation decay and the expression of transposable elements. We show that the rate of epigenetic aging can be manipulated by extending or curtailing life span and that shoot apical meristems are protected from these epigenetic changes. We demonstrate that a program of transcriptional repression suppresses DNA methylation maintenance pathways during aging and that mutants of this program display a complete absence of epigenetic decay while physical aging remains unaffected.",

Beyond encoding genetic information, nucleic acids also display complex physicochemical parameters that shape structure, dynamics, and interactions. Understanding how sequence variation sculpts the energetic landscapes underlying these properties requires methods that capture both molecular diversity and dynamic behavior. Single-molecule techniques are ideally suited to this task, but conventional formats remain time and cost intensive. Recent breakthroughs have enabled highly multiplexed approaches for observing molecular dynamics across millions of individual molecules representing thousands of sequences or barcoded entities. Though still in development, these methods have begun to bridge sequence, structure, dynamics, and function at scale, opening new opportunities in drug discovery, molecular diagnostics, and functional genomics.",

However, current estimates of heritability are low—twin studies show heritability of only 20 to 25%, and recent large pedigree studies suggest it is as low as 6%. Here we show that these estimates are confounded by extrinsic mortality—deaths caused by extrinsic factors such as accidents or infections. We use mathematical modeling and analyses of twin cohorts raised together and apart to correct for this factor, revealing that heritability of human life span due to intrinsic mortality is above 50%. Such high heritability is similar to that of most other complex human traits and to life-span heritability in other species.",

We identified core regulators of cell identity and developed sequence-based models that revealed conserved regulatory codes. By predicting chromatin accessibility across 240 mammalian species, we reconstructed the evolutionary histories of human cis-regulatory elements, identifying sets associated with positive selection and gene expression changes, including the recent gain of THRB expression in cerebellar progenitor cells.

We sequenced eight new Blattodea species showing stepwise contracted genomes. Woodroach brood-rearing remained constrained by deactivated oxidative phosphorylation and peroxisome genes, consistent with slow immature growth. Termites lost key genes mediating sperm motility, corroborating that reproductive division of labor required monogamous colony-founding. They also co-opted many genes from fundamental nutrition-sensitive juvenile hormone, insulin, EGFR and Dpp signaling pathways. Thus, most larvae develop as workers via high energy metabolism early on, while reproductive nymphs highly express energy metabolism genes late in development. These pathways are consistent with obligate dependence on provisioning by specialized workers and feedback loops allowing large homeostatic colonies to evolve.",

Loss of SPRTN activity during replication and mitosis lead to unresolved DNA damage, chromosome segregation errors, micronuclei formation, and cytosolic DNA release that activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. In a Sprtn knock-in mouse model of Ruijs-Aalfs progeria syndrome, chronic cGas-Sting signaling caused embryonic lethality through inflammation and innate immune responses.

Drill cores and geophysical logs from International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 405 demonstrate that the megathrust preferentially develops at the top or base of the pelagic clay in the sedimentary layers present on the incoming Pacific Plate, where pronounced contrasts in physical properties occur. This preference results in a narrow, weak fault located at a major mechanical contact between frontal prism mud and subducted sediments, which enhances the tendency for shallow seismic slip, suggesting that the Japan Trench may be more susceptible to ruptures with large shallow slip than are margins without weak clays.",

Zone-specific, mosaic introduction of Ctnnb1 (catenin beta 1) and Arid2 (AT-rich interaction domain 2) mutations, commonly co-mutated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in mouse models showed that position and metabolic context determine clone fates. Ctnnb1 / Arid2 -driven cancers were much more likely to arise in zone 3. The zone 3 genes Gstm2 and Gstm3 were required for efficient HCC initiation, in part through inhibition of ferroptosis.

Synergistically combined with heralded quantum imaging, they have notable potential for identifying light-sensitive samples under minimal illumination. However, present schemes usually lack the capability to control the quantum imaging function dynamically. Here, we introduce versatile liquid crystals to realize heralded single-photon imaging and electrically tunable multimode switching. On the basis of the bichiral cholesteric liquid crystal modulator, different morphology information of the target can be extracted with a high signal-to-noise ratio, including the entire shape and its fine outline. The nematic liquid crystal, leveraging its electrically tunable properties, is explored to select specific polarizations of heralded single photons, enabling dynamic remote switching in trimode quantum imaging. To further improve the time efficiency, an ultrafast remote switching is presented on the basis of the appealing ferroelectric liquid crystals. This work supplies a unique imaging platform for photon-limited scenarios and reveals the unprecedented possibilities of soft matters in quantum information processing.",

Current diagnostic methods assess circulating autoantibodies, C-peptide levels, or dysglycemia, yet these approaches fail to identify β cell destruction preceding glucose dysregulation. Here, a subcutaneous microporous scaffold is used as an immunological niche (IN), which provides a nonvital accessible tissue reflecting many immune changes occurring in the pancreas. Sequencing analysis of the IN successfully delineates at-risk from nonrisk groups, as well as disease progressors from nonprogressors at 6 weeks of age in the nonobese diabetic mouse model. Within progressors, we identify disease 5 to 7 weeks before disease onset. Collectively, disease occurring in a poorly accessible site can be identified early by sampling a distant nonvital tissue, indicating the systemic nature of the disease and informing the timing of disease modifying therapies to halt or delay the progression of T1D.",

          "abstract": "Anode-less 5 V–class lithium metal batteries (LMBs) promise high energy density and safety yet, in practice, face critical challenges including dendrite growth, interfacial instability, pulverization associated with “dead” lithium accumulation, and energy density compromise from the use of heavy copper collector. Here, we demonstrate an elaborate design of two-dimensional hexagonal zinc-containing metal-organic framework anchored on conductive titanium carbide (Ti 3 C 2 T x ) MXene sheets (MX/2D-Zn-MOF) as a three-dimensional lightweight host for anode-less 5 V–class LMBs. The abundant nitrogen/fluorine/zinc-rich lithiophilic sites effectively decrease lithium nucleation energy barriers, ensure uniform lithium deposition, and stabilize solid electrolyte interphase. The interconnected three-dimensional framework further guides uniform lithium deposition by spatially homogenizing lithium ion flux and reducing local current density as well as offers sufficient space to alleviate structural change, thus affording structural integrity against pulverization. As a result, the MX/2D-Zn-MOF host demonstrates uniform lithium deposition, reversible lithium plating and stripping behavior, and stable cycling performance (~1800 hours at 1.0 milliamperes per square centimeter and 5.0 milliampere hours per square centimeter). Impressively, the assembled anode-less 5 V–class lithium metal pouch cell delivers stable cycling performance and high energy density.",

Here we propose a principle of hyperelastic and omniadhesive gels composed of polymer networks with long dangling chains and sufficient good solvents. The molecules of good solvents screen off interchain interactions for hyperelasticity. The long dangling chains disentangle and adsorb to substrate for strong adhesion. We synthesized such gels by controlling the polymerization kinetics. When a monomer solution is partially cured, some monomers form a network and others form the solvent. The resulting gel, termed homogel, consists of a polymer network with enormous dangling chains and solvent of identical chemistries. An interval exists where the dangling chains are long and disentangled substantially, and the homogel exhibits both hyperelasticity and omniadhesion. We demonstrated such a gel with a hysteresis of 4.1% (stretch = 10) and adhesion energy of ~510 joules per square meter. The principle is generic and applicable to gels of different types.",

          "abstract": "Controlling wave propagation in complex environments is a central challenge across wireless communications, imaging, and acoustics, where multiple scattering and interference obscure direct transmission paths. Coherent wavefront shaping enables precise energy delivery but typically requires full knowledge of the medium. Here, we introduce a universal statistical framework for targeted mode transport (TMT) that circumvents this limitation and validate it on various platforms including microwave networks, two-dimensional chaotic cavities, and three-dimensional reverberation chambers. TMT quantifies the efficiency of transferring energy between specified input and output channels in multimode wave-chaotic systems. We develop a diagrammatic theory that predicts the eigenvalue distribution of the TMT operator and identifies the macroscopic parameters—coupling strength, absorption, and channel control—that govern performance. The theory provides explicit bounds for optimal TMT wavefronts and captures phenomena like statistical transmission gaps and reflectionless states. These findings establish design principles for energy delivery and information transfer in complex environments, with broad implications for adaptive signal processing and wave-based technologies.",

          "abstract": "Microfluidics enable high-precision and cost-effective processing of biological and chemical substances. However, designing and fabricating microfluidic chips typically requires substantial expertise and numerous design iterations, posing considerable barriers to entry for nonexperts. We introduce μFluidicGenius (μFG), an open-access, machine learning (ML)–augmented design tool that enables nonexpert users to rapidly create functional microfluidic circuits. Users simply define the spatial placement of reservoirs, specify the channel connections between them, and assign desired flow rates through this layout. Leveraging a hybrid algorithmic framework that integrates ML models with mathematical modeling, μFG automatically generates spatially coded maze structures that implement the precise fluidic resistances needed to meet the target flow distribution. These resistive elements are optimized to fit within the available geometry and can reproduce complex flow profiles, such as physiologically relevant flow rates in multi-organ-on-chip platforms. The resulting microfluidic designs are directly exportable for three-dimensional printing. Experimental validation demonstrates that μFG-generated circuits reproduce target flow distributions with 90% accuracy. By streamlining and automating microfluidic circuit creation, μFG not only lowers the barrier to entry for nonexperts but also showcases a principled and efficient application of ML to fluidic system design, enabling rapid and customizable development of complex microfluidic architectures.",

Unlike SERS, the nonlinear CARS process requires the coherent interaction of three distinct fields. The interactions between the electric fields and nanoparticle (NP) morphology for single-particle SECARS remain unexplored, and the underlying mechanisms generating the SECARS signal are not fully understood. Here, 27 distinct NPs were synthesized and screened using a CARS microscope. Among them, only star-core core-satellite NPs show single-particle SECARS signals, which were affected by laser polarization, two-photon luminescence background, photoinduced heating effects, particle size, and particle morphology. The influence of NP properties on SECARS enhancement offers guidance for the design and synthesis of NPs for single-particle SECARS and opportunities in biological imaging and chemical sensing.",

          "abstract": "Strabismus, affecting ~4% of children, impairs vision and psychosocial health. However, clinical diagnosis requires multiple instruments and stepwise examinations of ocular alignment, extraocular muscle function, and deviation angle. It is limited by low diagnostic objectivity, poor pediatric compliance, and high cost. Here, we propose a strategy for one-stop strabismus digital diagnosis via artificial intelligence (AI)–integrated, skin-like, and wearable “Eyelectronics.” The ultralightweight, imperceptible eye-wearable system features an ultrathin (~60 micrometers in thickness), breathable, and multidirectional (0°/45°/90°) strain-sensing array conformally adapted to the sensitive eyelid. It enables wireless, mild-restricted measurement of eyelid deformation during eye movements. Through biomechanical modeling validated by ocular magnetic resonance imaging simulations, we establish a prior correlation between eyelid deformation and eye movements. The Eyelectronics, powered by our physiology knowledge-driven end-to-end AI algorithm, achieves simultaneous measurement of strabismus angle and identification of paretic muscle. It delivers a 96.6% four-direction classification accuracy and a 1.2° measurement accuracy in ocular motility examinations. Clinical benchmarking against the clinical standard (Hess screen test) confirmed diagnostic agreement (intraclass correlation = 0.978). This system bridges quantitative biomechanical sensing with digital diagnosis, promoting a paradigm for future strabismus treatment.",

Here, we report that extracellular domains (ECDs) of CATSPERε are essential for canopy and holo-complex assembly and modulate channel activity during sperm capacitation. CATSPERε-deficient males are sterile due to the absence of the entire channel and defective sperm hyperactivation. Expressing ECD-truncated CATSPERε during spermatogenesis does not rescue the knockout because it fails to incorporate into the native complex. In contrast, addition of a CATSPERε ECD fragment during sperm capacitation significantly reduces sperm hyperactivation. These findings provide insight into the underlying molecular and developmental mechanisms of CatSper assembly and how the channel can be modulated in physiological settings and by therapeutic intervention.",

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play diverse and critical roles in intercellular communication, and we have demonstrated interaction between EVs and vascular endothelial cells. Through serum proteomic analysis, we identified LIM and calponin homology domain–containing protein 1 (LIMCH1) as a PE-associated EV protein that is highly expressed in PE placentas, particularly in syncytiotrophoblasts, which release EVs into the maternal circulation. LIMCH1-enriched EVs (LIMCH1-EVs) increased endothelial permeability in vitro. Transcriptome analysis revealed that LIMCH1-EVs disrupted endothelial cell-cell junction assembly by suppressing the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1. Furthermore, administration of LIMCH1-EVs promoted pulmonary vascular permeability in vivo. These findings suggest a role of LIMCH1-EVs in EV-associated vascular endothelial dysfunction, a central pathology of PE. In addition, this study provides insights into mechanisms that may contribute to PE-associated pulmonary edema, which have not yet been clarified.",

In mice performing skilled locomotion, we recorded from dMSNs, iMSNs, and their cortical and thalamic inputs identified by monosynaptic rabies tracing. A recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier and clustering analysis revealed functionally heterogeneous subpopulations in each population, with dMSNs preferentially activated at movement onset and offset, and iMSNs during execution. Cortical and thalamic inputs were preferentially activated during onset/offset and execution, respectively, though dMSN- and iMSN-projecting neurons in each region showed similar patterns. Locomotion phase-specific rhythmic activity was found in a subset of thalamic dMSN-projecting neurons and dMSNs. Cortex or thalamus inactivation reduced MSN activity.

          "abstract": "Bacterial efflux pumps are major contributors to multidrug resistance, classically described as “gatekeepers” that reduce drug entry. Here, we uncover a post–entry mechanism of efflux pumps, revealing their function deep into intracellular drug-target interactions. Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we monitored the activity of major efflux systems in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with Hoechst 33342 (HCT), a DNA binding inhibitor. We found that inactivation of efflux (Δ tolC in E. coli and Δ6 in P. aeruginosa ) increased the apparent HCT-DNA affinity, mediated by a decreased apparent unbinding rate, whereas the intrinsic rate remained unchanged. Statistical physics modeling and experimental testing show that, unlike under dilute in vitro conditions, drug molecules that unbind from their targets in intracellular environments undergo successive rebinding, prolonging the total lifetime of the drug bound to the target. However, efflux pumps counteract this effect by suppressing rebinding, thereby kinetically destabilizing drug-target interactions. This biophysical mechanism acts multiplicatively with the canonical gatekeeping effect to broaden and amplify drug resistance.",

Among these, BIN1 and RIN3 have emerged as susceptibility genes, yet their functional relationship in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated how BIN1 and RIN3 interaction regulates RAB5 activity and endosomal pathology. RIN3 has been shown to bind BIN1, and we previously reported that this interaction modulates amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) trafficking and Aβ generation in vitro. To extend these findings, we used Rin3 constitutive knockout ( Rin3-CKO ) mice and CRISPR-Cas9–edited human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons carrying either BIN1 knockout or rare familial AD RIN3 missense mutations within the BIN1-binding domain. We found that disruption of BIN1-RIN3 binding, through either genetic deletion or pathogenic RIN3 variants, resulted in RIN3-mediated RAB5 hyperactivation and enlargement of neuronal endosomes, a hallmark of early AD pathology. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed dysregulated expression of AD-related genes. Together, these findings establish BIN1 as a critical regulator of RIN3-driven RAB5 activation and neuronal endosomal homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "Trimethylation of the histone H3K36 residue (H3K36me3) plays an indispensable role in ensuring transcription fidelity by suppressing undesired cryptic transcription in chromatin. H3K36me3 modification is accomplished by Set2/SETD2 during transcription elongation by the RNA polymerase II elongation complex (EC). Here, we found that Set2-mediated H3K36me3 deposition occurs on the nucleosome reassembling behind the EC. The histone chaperone FACT suppresses H3K36me3 deposition on the downstream nucleosome, thereby ensuring that Set2 targets specifically on the reassembling upstream nucleosome. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of the nucleosome-transcribing EC complexed with Set2 revealed that Set2 is anchored by the Spt6 subunit of the EC to capture both of the H3 N-terminal tails in a stepwise manner during the nucleosome reassembly process. Abrogation of the Set2-EC interaction leads to defective transcription-coupled H3K36me3 deposition. These insights elucidate the structure-based mechanism of transcription-coupled H3K36me3 deposition in chromatin.",

          "abstract": "α-Synuclein (αSyn) is a presynaptic protein of unestablished physiological function that plays a central role in Parkinson’s disease neuropathology. To date, the reported effects of αSyn expression on the kinetics of axonal synaptic vesicle exocytosis and membrane cycling have been relatively small. In contrast, we report that αSyn is the major modulator of substantia nigra somatodendritic dopamine release, a little-understood form of neurotransmission that is central to sensorimotor and basal ganglia circuitry. This regulation is due to a previously unknown role for αSyn in controlling the activity of the L-type calcium ion channels (LTCC), which are also implicated in Parkinson’s pathogenesis. αSyn-deficient neurons further display decreased spike frequency adaptation, hippocampal LTCC-dependent long-term potentiation, and immediate early gene induction, functions that are essential for synaptic adaptation and neuronal plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Mantle plumes beneath major oceanic hot spots appear to be rooted in unusually large structures near the core-mantle boundary, which have markedly reduced seismic wave speeds. The origin of these large ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs), referred to as mega-ULVZs, remains uncertain partly because of lack of constraints on the relative reduction in shear versus compressional wave speeds ( R S/P ). This ratio can give clues into the compositional makeup of the mega-ULVZs. Through joint seismic analysis of core-diffracted P and S waves beneath Hawai’i, we constrain the R S/P of its mega-ULVZ to 1 to 1.3. Mineralogical modeling reveals that iron enrichment via solid iron-rich magnesiowüstite [(Mg,Fe)O] matches this seismic constraint, independent of modeled ULVZ thickness. Enrichment of metallic iron-rich magnesiowüstite likely enhances the thermal conductivity of mega-ULVZs and provides a mechanism to drive localized plume upwelling. Higher reported R S/P values for smaller ULVZs near subduction zones may therefore indicate different processes at play controlling ULVZ formation across the diverse core-mantle boundary landscape.",

          "abstract": "The properties and stability of hydrous phases are crucial to unraveling the mysteries of the deep water cycle. Under deep lower mantle conditions, water and hydrous phases transition into a superionic state. However, superionic effect on their stability and dehydration behavior remains unclear. Using ab initio and deep learning potential molecular dynamics simulations, we discovered a doubly superionic transition in δ-AlOOH, characterized by the highly diffusive behavior of both hydrogen and aluminum ions within the oxygen sublattice. These highly diffusive elements contribute external entropy to the system, stabilizing the structure at 140 GPa and 3800 K. Our free-energy calculations reveal that water tends to freeze under deep lower mantle conditions, so dehydration becomes energetically and kinetically unfavorable even under core-mantle boundary (CMB) conditions. This implies that superionic water may accumulate in the deep lower mantle over geologic time, forming a long-term reservoir at the base of the mantle.",

          "abstract": "If the immune system is an interconnected network, then the evolution of an archetype that is ideal for fighting one pathogen should result in trade-offs decreasing its ability to fight others. How many archetypes are there in an immune system? We infected diverse mice with Plasmodium chabaudi and identified five distinct archetypes of responses on the basis of the host’s position in microbial load, immune activity, and host damage space. To better understand the nature of these archetypes, we developed a mathematical model of a generalized host-pathogen system. This model explains the number and distribution of archetypes across a population of diverse hosts. Mice resilient to P. chabaudi exhibited poor outcomes when challenged with influenza, SARS-CoV-1, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis , and vice versa, supporting our trade-off hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Stainless steels are essential materials in sustainable energy conversion systems, particularly in hydrogen-related applications. However, their susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement and corrosion limits their long-term use, creating a need for advanced alloys capable of resisting environmentally assisted damage and mechanical failure. Here, we design a cost-effective austenitic stainless steel. The key innovation involves the atomic-scale passivation of grain boundaries through nitrogen decoration. This enhances resistance to failure, achieving about 3.8-fold increase in corrosion resistance and a 1.35-fold increase in hydrogen embrittlement resistance compared to commercial 316L. The steel exhibits very low hydrogen diffusivity (~7.8 × 10 −17  square meters per second), mitigating hydrogen embrittlement at ambient temperature, an advantage over conventional steels. In addition, formation of a dense passive film improves corrosion resistance in environments such as dilute hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda. The outstanding resistance of the stainless steel against such harsh coupled environmental conditions qualifies it as a promising candidate for sustainable and secure infrastructure in the emerging hydrogen economy.",

          "abstract": "Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, yet the contributions of its components remain unclear, particularly across geographic regions and racial/ethnic groups. We extended the generalized weighted quantile sum regression model by incorporating two-way fixed effects (gWQS-feglm) to quantify PM 2.5 component–attributable CVD deaths across the contiguous United States. PM 2.5 component–attributable CVD deaths declined from 42,200 (28,200,57,600) in 2001 to 23,500 (15,700,32,100) in 2020, driven by ammonium (NH 4 + ) and sulfate (SO 4 2− ) reductions. In 2020, high-attributable-mortality regions remained and regional disparities in PM 2.5 composition pronounced, with NH 4 + dominant in California and the East North Central, SO 4 2− in the South, and black carbon and SO 4 2− in the Middle Atlantic. Racial/ethnic disparities persisted, with non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics experiencing slower attributable-mortality declines compared with non-Hispanic whites. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions based on components to address disparities in PM 2.5 -attributable burden.",

          "abstract": "Predicting floating ice dynamics remains a challenging problem with implications for Earth’s climate. While gigantic icebergs have garnered worldwide attention, small ice bodies have been overlooked, and we still lack their mechanistic models. Aided by a real-time tracking, we unravel the transient processes of freely floating ice in calm waters—including the kinematics, phase transition, and surrounding fluid dynamics—that govern melting. Combining the heat transfer model and our experimental results, we develop and validate a theoretical model for the melt rate, identifying ice geometry and convective regime as key controls. Furthermore, the ice-driven convective volume flux is found to exceed the meltwater flux by orders of magnitude, underscoring the ecological relevance of floating ice; it not only supplies freshwater but also acts as a destabilizing buoyancy source that redistributes mass macroscopically. Our study provides a foundation for developing mechanistic parameterizations of icebergs and ice floes melting in climate models.",
